Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"NOVEL, n. A short story padded. A species of composition bearing the same relation to literature that the panorama bears to art. As it is too long to be read at a sitting the impressions made by its successive parts are successively effaced, as in the panorama. Unity, totality of effect, is impossible; for besides the few pages last read all that is carried in mind is the mere plot of what has gone before. To the romance the novel is what photography is to painting. Its distinguishing principle, probability, corresponds to the literal actuality of the photograph and puts it distinctly into the category of reporting; whereas the free wing of the romancer enables him to mount to such altitudes of imagination as he may be fitted to attain; and the first three essentials of the literary art are imagination, imagination and imagination.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"TREE, n. A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal apparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear only a negligible fruit, or none at all. When naturally fruited, the tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor in public morals. In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit (white and black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the public taste and, though not exported, profitable to the general welfare. That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no discovery of Judge Lynch (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the lamp-post and the bridge-girder) is made plain by the following passage from Morryster, who antedated him by two centuries:While in yt londe I was carried to see ye Ghogo tree, whereof  I had hearde moch talk; but sayynge yt I saw naught remarkabyll in  it, ye hed manne of ye villayge where it grewe made answer as  followeth:Ye tree is not nowe in fruite, but in his seasonne you shall  see dependynge fr. his braunches all soch as have affroynted ye  King his Majesty.

Gelasma, if it paid you to devote Your talent to the service of a goat, Showing by forceful logic that its beard Is more than Aaron's fit to be revered; If to the task of honoring its smell Profit had prompted you, and love as well, The world would benefit at last by you And wealthy malefactors weep anew -- Your favor for a moment's space denied And to the nobler object turned aside. Is't not enough that thrifty millionaires Who loot in freight and spoliate in fares, Or, cursed with consciences that bid them fly To safer villainies of darker dye, Forswearing robbery and fain, instead, To steal (they call it cornering) our bread May see you groveling their boots to lick And begging for the favor of a kick? Still must you follow to the bitter end Your sycophantic disposition's trend, And in your eagerness to please the rich Hunt hungry sinners to their final ditch? In Morgan's praise you smite the sounding wire, And sing hosannas to great Havemeyher! What's Satan done that him you should eschew?

Before he'd time to stop and fly, An earthquake trifled with the eye That saw a ghost. He fell as fall the early good; Unmoved that awful vision stood. The stars that danced before his ken He wildly brushed away, and then He saw a post. --Jared MacphesterAccounting for the uncommon behavior of ghosts, Heine mentions somebody's ingenious theory to the effect that they are as much afraid of us as we of them. Not quite, if I may judge from such tables of comparative speed as I am able to compile from memories of my own experience. There is one insuperable obstacle to a belief in ghosts. A ghost never comes naked: he appears either in a winding-sheet or in his habit as he lived. To believe in him, then, is to believe that not only have the dead the power to make themselves visible after there is nothing left of them, but that the same power inheres in textile fabrics. Supposing the products of the loom to have this ability, what object would they have in exercising it? And why does not the apparition of a suit of clothes sometimes walk abroad without a ghost in it? These be riddles of significance. They reach away down and get a convulsive grip on the very tap-root of this flourishing faith.",GHOST n outward visible sign inward fear saw ghost occupied dismal thing path following time stop fly earthquake trifled eye saw ghost fell fall early good Unmoved awful vision stood stars danced ken wildly brushed away saw post Jared MacphesterAccounting uncommon behavior ghosts Heine mentions somebody ingenious theory effect much afraid us quite may judge tables comparative speed able compile memories experience one insuperable obstacle belief ghosts ghost never comes naked appears either winding sheet habit lived believe believe dead power make visible nothing left power inheres textile fabrics Supposing products loom ability object would exercising apparition suit clothes sometimes walk abroad without ghost riddles significance reach away get convulsive grip tap root flourishing faith,GHOST n outward visible sign inward fear saw ghost occupy dismal thing path follow time stop fly earthquake trifle eye saw ghost fell fall early good Unmoved awful vision stand star dance ken wildly brush away saw post Jared MacphesterAccounting uncommon behavior ghost Heine mention somebody ingenious theory effect much afraid u quite may judge table comparative speed able compile memory experience one insuperable obstacle belief ghost ghost never come naked appear either wind sheet habit live believe believe dead power make visible nothing leave power inhere textile fabric Supposing product loom ability object would exercise apparition suit clothe sometimes walk abroad without ghost riddle significance reach away get convulsive grip tap root flourish faith,ghost n outward visibl sign inward fear saw ghost occupi dismal thing path follow time stop fli earthquak trifl eye saw ghost fell fall earli good unmov aw vision stand star danc ken wild brush away saw post jare macphesteraccount uncommon behavior ghost hein mention somebodi ingeni theori effect much afraid u quit may judg tabl compar speed abl compil memori experi one insuper obstacl belief ghost ghost never come nake appear either wind sheet habit live believ believ dead power make visibl noth leav power inher textil fabric suppos product loom abil object would exercis apparit suit cloth sometim walk abroad without ghost riddl signific reach away get convuls grip tap root flourish faith

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SEAL, n. A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their authenticity and authority. Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, and attached to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself. Sealing, in this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent. In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a sacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now. As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful. Our word sincere is derived from _sine cero_, without wax, but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S., commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean _locum sigillis_, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used --an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish. The words _locum sigillis_ are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union.",SEAL n mark impressed upon certain kinds documents attest authenticity authority Sometimes stamped upon wax attached paper sometimes paper Sealing sense survival ancient custom inscribing important papers cabalistic words signs give magical efficacy independent authority represent British museum preserved many ancient papers mostly sacerdotal character validated necromantic pentagrams devices frequently initial letters words conjure many instances attached way seals appended nearly every reasonless apparently meaningless custom rite observance modern times origin remote utility pleasing note example ancient nonsense evolving process ages something really useful word sincere derived _sine cero_ without wax learned agreement whether refers absence cabalistic signs wax letters formerly closed public scrutiny Either view matter serve one immediate need hypothesis initials L commonly appended signatures legal documents mean _locum sigillis_ place seal although seal longer used admirable example conservatism distinguishing Man beasts perish words _locum sigillis_ humbly suggested suitable motto Pribyloff Islands whenever shall take place sovereign State American Union,SEAL n mark impress upon certain kind document attest authenticity authority Sometimes stamp upon wax attach paper sometimes paper Sealing sense survival ancient custom inscribe important paper cabalistic word sign give magical efficacy independent authority represent British museum preserve many ancient paper mostly sacerdotal character validate necromantic pentagram device frequently initial letter word conjure many instance attach way seal append nearly every reasonless apparently meaningless custom rite observance modern time origin remote utility please note example ancient nonsense evolve process age something really useful word sincere derive _sine cero_ without wax learn agreement whether refer absence cabalistic sign wax letter formerly close public scrutiny Either view matter serve one immediate need hypothesis initial L commonly append signature legal document mean _locum sigillis_ place seal although seal long use admirable example conservatism distinguish Man beast perish word _locum sigillis_ humbly suggest suitable motto Pribyloff Islands whenever shall take place sovereign State American Union,seal n mark impress upon certain kind document attest authent author sometim stamp upon wax attach paper sometim paper seal sens surviv ancient custom inscrib import paper cabalist word sign give magic efficaci independ author repres british museum preserv mani ancient paper most sacerdot charact valid necromant pentagram devic frequent initi letter word conjur mani instanc attach way seal append near everi reasonless appar meaningless custom rite observ modern time origin remot util pleas note exampl ancient nonsens evolv process age someth realli use word sincer deriv _sine cero_ without wax learn agreement whether refer absenc cabalist sign wax letter former close public scrutini either view matter serv one immedi need hypothesi initi l common append signatur legal document mean _locum sigillis_ place seal although seal long use admir exampl conservat distinguish man beast perish word _locum sigillis_ humbl suggest suitabl motto pribyloff island whenev shall take place sovereign state american union
