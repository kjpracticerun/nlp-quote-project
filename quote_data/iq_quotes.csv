Gwen Ifill,"Nobody does commercial TV out of the goodness of their heart. There has to be a market-driven financial incentive, an economic imperative. Katie was wildly successful for so long, she created a market incentive. It made economic sense for CBS."
Gwen Ifill,"You would like me to say that the veil will be ripped from the voters' eyes sometime between now and November, thereby restoring the proper version of Democracy to the House and Senate. I won't say that, of course. The simple reason is, I don't know."
Gwen Ifill,"When the President was asked about global warming at a public appearance yesterday, he responded by talking about America's addiction to oil. You make the connection."
Gwen Ifill,"Whatever their motivations, lawmakers on both side of the aisle have certainly discovered that immigration is one of those issues that resonate strongly with the public."

Gwen Ifill,"If it were the Clinton people, they'd be sitting around figuring out how to pull themselves out. Instead the president is continuing to go around the country and peddling Social Security, which the needle is not moving on."
Gwen Ifill,Folks who are getting their strokes in the South are not as unhappy with Howard Dean. You don't see anybody starting any movement to get him out of office.
Gwen Ifill,"Don't count out other amazing programming like Frontline. You will still find more hours of in-depth news programming, investigative journalism and analysis on PBS than on any other outlet."

Jarome Iginla,"We got ourselves in penalty trouble tonight. I think we had five penalties in the third period. In a tie game, it's hard to get offense."
Jarome Iginla,"I take pride in it and I do think about it. It's hard to put in words, but [watching black hockey players when I was growing up] made me feel it was possible. So knowing what it meant to me and thinking that maybe there are other young black kids who want to play and are in the same situation that I was and wanting to follow that dream... it's a neat feeling to think maybe [I can make a difference]."
Jarome Iginla,"We're a union of 700 players and there are going to be different opinions, ... But I personally appreciate the job Trevor, Ted and the executive committee have done. Ted is a big part of this deal. He's had a huge say in getting us back on the ice."

Jarome Iginla,"Defensively, we've been doing really well, and offensively, we'd like to score more goals. I don't think that's a secret. Personally, I think the first half could have been better and I'm looking forward to the second half and contributing more on the offensive side of it."
Jarome Iginla,"That's one of the funniest things I've ever seen,"

Jarome Iginla,We're around the same age. He's a good power forward. He's got good hands in front of the net. He scores his share of goals. He can get really hot too which is a good thing.
Jarome Iginla,We know we have to get better. We have the talent and the ability to get a goal. Now the main goal is to get better.

Ivan Illich,"It takes more time and effort and delicacy to learn the silence of a people than to learn its sounds. Some people have a special gift for this. Perhaps this explains why some missionaries, notwithstanding their efforts, never come to speak properly, to communicate delicately through silences. Although they ''speak with the accent of natives'' they remain forever thousands of miles away. The learning of the grammar of silence is an art much more difficult to learn than the grammar of sounds."

As chair of the China-U.S. Center for Sustainable Development, he believes China will be forced to become a leading incubator of environmental innovation simply because the in-country collision between people's needs and the ability of natural systems to support them is already so acute. As he notes,] The Chinese have to build new housing for 400 million people in 12 years. ... While Europe has been a driver for innovation in cleaner technologies, China promises to be its market."

David Irving,"In my view, freedom of speech means the freedom to say things to other people that they don't want to hear. And if that causes offense to them, then that's partly their problem and partly mine. Freedom of speech is the right to be wrong, basically. Sometimes I'm wrong."
David Irving,I come from a free country and I'm not going to let anybody silence me.
David Irving,"The way the law is written, I didn't have any other choice but to plead guilty."
David Irving,Smoking is just a prop or wardrobe that helps identify a character as a bad guy. They have to do whatever they can to make the audience feel that this is a despicable person who is fighting or challenging the hero.
David Irving,I have no academic qualifications whatsoever.
David Irving,I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz.
David Irving,History is like a constantly changing tree.
David Irving,because of my ability to stand up to the experts ... to take them all on single-handed.
John Irving,"So, you see, it's a real chore for me to write a book review because it's like a contest. It's like I'm writing that book review for every bad book reviewer I've ever known and it's a way of saying [thrusts a middle finger into the air] this is how you ought to do it. I like to rub their noses in it."
John Irving,"You know, people think you have to be dumb to skip rope for 45 minutes. No, you have to be able to imagine something else. While you're skipping rope, you have to be able to see something else."
John Irving,"You don't want to dwell on your enemies, you know. I basically feel so superior to my critics for the simple reason that they haven't done what I do. Most book reviewers haven't written 11 novels. Many of them haven't written one."
John Irving,"There's no reason you shouldn't, as a writer, not be aware of the necessity to revise yourself constantly."
John Irving,There's no reason you should write any novel quickly.
John Irving,The building of the architecture of a novel - the craft of it - is something I never tire of.
John Irving,"No adult in my family would ever tell me anything about who my father was. I knew from an older cousin - only four years older than I am - everything, or what little I could discover about him."
John Irving,"More than a half, maybe as much as two-thirds of my life as a writer is rewriting. I wouldn't say I have a talent that's special. It strikes me that I have an unusual kind of stamina."
John Irving,"If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you love, you have to find the courage to live it."
John Irving,"I think the sport of wrestling, which I became involved with at the age of 14... I competed until I was 34, kind of old for a contact sport. I coached the sport until I was 47. I think the discipline of wrestling has given me the discipline I have to write."
John Irving,"I have pretty thick skin, and I think if you're going to be in this business, if you're going to be an actor or a writer, you better have a thick skin."
John Irving,"I had been a student in Vienna, and one of the neat little things I had found out was about that zoo. It was a good debut novel for me to have published. I was 26 or 27 when it was published. I already had a kid and would soon have a second."
John Irving,"And I find - I'm 63, and my capacity to be by myself and just spend time by myself hasn't diminished any. That's the necessary part of being a writer, you better like being alone."
John Irving,"And I don't want to begin something, I don't want to write that first sentence until all the important connections in the novel are known to me. As if the story has already taken place, and it's my responsibility to put it in the right order to tell it to you."
John Irving,"When I was still in prep school - 14, 15 - I started keeping notebooks, journals. I started writing, almost like landscape drawing or life drawing. I never kept a diary, I never wrote about my day and what happened to me, but I described things."
John Irving,"Sometimes that's a year, sometimes it's 18 months, where all I'm doing is taking notes. I'm reconstructing the story from the back to the front so that I know where the front is."
John Irving,I don't begin a novel or a screenplay until I know the ending. And I don't mean only that I have to know what happens. I mean that I have to hear the actual sentences. I have to know what atmosphere the words convey.
John Irving,"I've always been a fan of the 19th century novel, of the novel that is plotted, character-driven, and where the passage of time is almost as central to the novel as a major minor character, the passage of time and its effect on the characters in the story."
John Irving,Good habits are worth being fanatical about.
John Irving,You've got to get obsessed and stay obsessed.
John Irving,There are few things as seemingly untouched by the real world as a child asleep.
John Irving,"Your memory is a monster; you forget - it doesn't. It simply files things away. It keeps things for you, or hides things from you - and summons them to your recall with a will of its own. You think you have a memory; but it has you!"
John Irving,I suppose I'm proudest of my novels for what's imagined in them. I think the world of my imagination is a richer and more interesting place than my personal biography.
John Irving,Half my life is an act of revision.
John Irving,Writing a novel is actually searching for victims. As I write I keep looking for casualties. The stories uncover the casualties.
John Irving,"I take people very seriously. People are all I take seriously, in fact. Therefore, I have nothing but sympathy for how people behave - and nothing but laughter to console them with."
John Irving,"To each other, we were as normal and nice as the smell of bread. We were just a family. In a family even exaggerations make perfect sense."
John Irving,You can't learn everything you need to know legally.
Hale Irwin,"I got off to a good start with birdies on three of four holes and kept it going the rest of the way,"
Hale Irwin,"I am really proud that I have continued to do as well as I have, particularly considering I have had some back [problems] the past couple of years, ... And pride I think that is a very important five-letter word."
Hale Irwin,"Let's put that in perspective, ... I finished an hour before the leaders. It wasn't like that putt sent me into the playoffs. Heading into the 11th hole, I wasn't even in the top 15."
Hale Irwin,"That's too bad. I like the golf course. We're seeing it under some difficult conditions because of the greens, (but) I have great memories here."
Hale Irwin,"I think it's great for golf. I don't see any problem with it, if it helps our sponsor."
Hale Irwin,"I hit a lot of very good golf shots this week,"
Hale Irwin,"I hit a lot of very good golf shots this week. I'm not going to beat up my short game, but I had some putting difficulty. But I'm not complaining."
Hale Irwin,"I am still trying to understand this game, ... I am still learning how to play golf. There are a lot of shots I still don't know. I am still trying to learn, and I think that's a good attitude to have."
Hale Irwin,What she has done with her boys and what she is doing to establish a new life in Phoenix is just unbelievable.
Hale Irwin,"I just never subscribed to the theory that at age 55, you fall off the face of the earth on the Tour. I always felt that was too young of an age for that."
Hale Irwin,"If you're not just a little bit nervous before a match, you probably don't have the expectations of yourself that you should have."
Hale Irwin,I relish the challenge of playing and going out at the age 60 to play like I did when I was 50.
Hale Irwin,"I just never subscribed to the theory that at age 55, you fall off the face of the earth on the Tour, ... I always felt that was too young of an age for that."
Steve Irwin,"To me, the story is the power of volunteers,"
Steve Irwin,"I have no problem giving donations, but I like to see my money go to work."
Steve Irwin,"He could still decide to take out his anger on us,"
Chris Isaak,"I think I'm in a really nice position, where I'm sure I could do another show if I wanted to do one, but right now the main thing in my mind is writing songs."
Chris Isaak,"One thing, when you're an actor, you finish something and then you have to worry about what the next gig is. When you're a musician, you can always write your own stuff, and I'm working on new stuff for a new album right now."
Chris Isaak,"The things that got me through grade school are helping me out later in life. It's like, I show up on time. If you buy a ticket to one of my shows, I'll show up. I'll be there. And if it says 10:00, I'll be on stage at 10:00."
Yusuf Islam,"I always stood for the elimination of conflict and wars, and any of those causes that ignite them."

Yusuf Islam,Everything I do is for the pleasure of Allah.
Yusuf Islam,All things can be forgiven if we can progress.
Yusuf Islam,Some extremists take elements of the sacred scriptures out of context.
Yusuf Islam,The greatest legacy is that which benefits the widest number of people for the longest period without limit to value. No one but the Prophet Muhammad was given that role as the seal of God's message.
Yusuf Islam,It's very difficult to ignore humanitarian disasters. The royalties from my albums continue to support my charity work.
Yusuf Islam,"I am confident that, in the end, common sense and justice will prevail. I'm an optimist, brought up on the belief that if you wait to the end of the story, you get to see the good people live happily ever after."
Yusuf Islam,A person who steals bread during a famine is not treated as a thief.
Yusuf Islam,The fact that the Prophet cared for every human being and tried his best to ensure their security in the hereafter must be the most telling of his compassionate and merciful characteristics.
Yusuf Islam,"I've returned to being an amateur without any ties or strings attached, which gives me a freedom I never had before."
Yusuf Islam,Music is a lady that I still love because she gives me the air that I breathe. We need all sorts of nourishment. And music satisfies and nourishes the hunger within ourselves for connection and harmony.
Yusuf Islam,"Because I don't play guitar any more, African harmonies and rhythms have been an inspiration to me. I love the raw origin of the sound. It complements my voice and words naturally."
Yusuf Islam,Man is created to be God's deputy on earth and it is important to realize the obligation to rid ourselves of all illusions and to make our lives a preparation for the next life.
Yusuf Islam,"I became very famous, as a teenager, and my name and photo were splashed in all the media. They made me larger than life, so I wanted to live larger than life, and the only way to do that was to be intoxicated."
Yusuf Islam,"In a World where people are surrounded by darkness, ignorance and fear, it is a sign of hope to be celebrating Islam's message of peace and light, and the last great Messenger, born and chosen to deliver them to all mankind."
Goran Ivanisevic,"When you are winning too much, sometimes you think you should never lose again. I am learning to lose."
Goran Ivanisevic,It's easier when you play. You get your emotion out. You scream. You yell. You do whatever you want. You play. But it's tough to sit.
Goran Ivanisevic,"This is the biggest achievement this team has had in its history, so for sure we want to go even further,"
Ana Ivanovic,"It hurt during the doubles match [Wednesday] night, ... The best thing I can do now is to get treatment and hopefully be ready for the U.S. Open."
Ana Ivanovic,It hurt during the doubles match (Wednesday) night. The best thing I can do now is to get treatment and hopefully be ready for the U.S. Open.
Ana Ivanovic,That's one of my goals for this year: top 10. I really want it and I have to work hard. There are some aspects in my game I have to improve.
Allen Iverson,"I think that with this team, we honestly worry about other things besides team concepts."
Allen Iverson,"I think with this team we honestly worry about things other than the team concept, what makes up a good team. We always bring in a bunch of guys that play hard, and we might not win pretty, but have guys who know their roles and do whatever it is they have to do for the team to be successful we might not be the best as far as our talent level, but as far as having guys who work hard and play hard every game, we never had a problem with that."
Allen Iverson,I think a lot of it has to do with the trade deadline being over. Guys are comfortable now that they?re going to be here.
Allen Iverson,"I think that as far as talent, we have enough to get over the hump. We are just not doing it. You can?t coach it, you can?t preach it. It is just something that players must be willing to do."
Allen Iverson,"Chris and myself, some nights we're going to struggle and we're not going to be able to get it done. We need other guys to step up. When you get 31 from a guy off the bench, you're supposed to win that game."
Allen Iverson,"When I struggle the way I did tonight, as a team we are obviously going to struggle."
Allen Iverson,"As long as you leave everything out on the basketball court, you can go into the locker room and feel good about yourself and that's important.............."
Allen Iverson,I don't have a problem with it. I'll do it for the rest of the season.
Allen Iverson,"I told him before the play that if both men went to me, to go to the basket and get a good shot. Things didn't go the way we wanted tonight."
Allen Iverson,"I guess it's just having time to play with each other and learning each other, just finding out how he wants to play and vice versa. He told me coming into the season that he wasn't doing his job if I didn't average four or five more points than I had been, and he was right because I am. ... We work together. We find out what plays we want to run. When we call plays for him, he tells me things he can do to get me an easy basket. And when a play is called for me, I let him know, if they take certain things away from me, what I can get for him. So it's just having some chemistry, being together and having a coach that understands that both of us need the ball and understands how both of us want to play."
Allen Iverson,"It's an honor. It's tough enough just to make an All-Star team, but when you're able to be a starter, it just says a lot about being pretty much one of the faces of the NBA because the fans pick you."
Allen Iverson,"It's an honor you know to be able to accomplish something like that knowing what he meant to this franchise and to the league. It's a great accomplishment, but without my guys, there's no way to get that accomplished."
Allen Iverson,"Just getting back into the game and making it a game is all heart. It feels bad, though, because we don't give that effort in the beginning and then we start showing the heart when we're about to get blown out. You have to play like that in the beginning and get stronger as the game goes on."
Allen Iverson,"Honestly, we know that we're fighting for a playoff position. I just don't want to settle for the eighth spot. If we play these games out and win most of them, we can get up to the seventh, or maybe even the sixth spot."
Allen Iverson,"We have to get it done, that's no excuse."
Allen Iverson,It probably was a fall and it swelled up on me. I kept playing on it. ... My doctors just said rest it as much as possible.
Allen Iverson,"It was a great feeling (to sit out) because I didn't feel good at all, ... I was telling Coach when I was getting ready to go back in that I wasn't feeling that well and he just told me to come back, and fortunately everything worked out fine. I just didn't feel good. I was dizzy out there the whole game. Once I stopped playing at halftime and came back in, I just never felt right. I think I'm coming down with something."
Allen Iverson,"I feel like if they want us to dress a certain way, they should pay for our clothes. It's just tough, man, knowing that all of a sudden you have to have a dress code out of nowhere. I don't think that's going to help the image of the league at all. ... It kind of makes it fake. The whole thing is fake."
Allen Iverson,The first appearance is always going to be the most memorable. This one is special because I'm 30 years old and you hear all the negative things about your game declining and at this point you should be breaking down. I still go out and play hard every night and give it my all. I guess the fans recognize that because they put me in the All-Star game.
Allen Iverson,"We should because when coaches get fired, the players have a lot to do with it."
Allen Iverson,"This is the thing you dream about when you're a kid, even before getting into the league."
Allen Iverson,"This is like a tribute to them, the people who helped me to get here. The thing that makes me feel good about the whole thing is, the fans voted me here."
Allen Iverson,Personally I just want to win a championship.
Allen Iverson,"If that many people recognize how hard I go every night and what I put into my game, to make myself and my team better, it means a lot to mean. I'm fortunate; I'm blessed to be in the situation that I'm in right now."
Allen Iverson,"If I don't believe it, then they don't need me on the court. I've just got to believe that in my heart."
Allen Iverson,I owe all of this to the guys I've played with and all the coaches that have helped me get to where I'm at right now. I'm honored to be here.
Allen Iverson,"I don't want to just go to the playoffs, I don't want to go to the playoffs and win the first round, second round, and not win the whole thing because it's bittersweet."
Allen Iverson,"I don't care. I feel like if we don't make a trade, we have to get it done with what we've got."
Allen Iverson,"I believe that whatever we have, regardless of a trade being done or not, I feel we have a shot. I've just got to believe that we're going to be all right. I've got to just play basketball."
Allen Iverson,Being an All-Star is everything.
Allen Iverson,"I had a lot of growing up to do. A lot of times, I learned the hard way."
Allen Iverson,He took advantage of his opportunities. He just got himself involved. He played a great game.
Allen Iverson,These guys don't have all the physical ability but they are able to win basketball games because they play the right way.
Allen Iverson,"That's something we expect from Dre every night, ... We know he has the ability to shut people down."
Charles Ives,"The possibilities of percussion sounds, I believe, have never been fully realized."
Charles Ives,The word 'beauty' is as easy to use as the word 'degenerate.' Both come in handy when one does or does not agree with you.
Charles Ives,The fabric of existence weaves itself whole.
Charles Ives,"A rare experience of a moment at daybreak, when something in nature seems to reveal all consciousness, cannot be explained at noon. Yet it is part of the day's unity."
Charles Ives,"If a poet knows more about a horse than he does about heaven, he might better stick to the horse, and some day the horse may carry him into heaven."
Charles Ives,"Expression, to a great extent, is a matter of terms, and terms are anyone's. The meaning of 'God' may have a billion interpretations if there be that many souls in the world."
Molly Ivins,"The thing about democracy, beloveds, is that it is not neat, orderly, or quiet. It requires a certain relish for confusion."
Molly Ivins,Satire is traditionally the weapon of the powerless against the powerful.
Molly Ivins,"Next time I tell you someone from Texas should not be president of the United States, please pay attention."
Molly Ivins,It is possible to read the history of this country as one long struggle to extend the liberties established in our Constitution to everyone in America.
Molly Ivins,"I dearly love the state of Texas, but I consider that a harmless perversion on my part, and discuss it only with consenting adults."
Molly Ivins,I believe in practicing prudence at least once every two or three years.
Molly Ivins,Being slightly paranoid is like being slightly pregnant - it tends to get worse.
Molly Ivins,I believe that ignorance is the root of all evil. And that no one knows the truth.
Satoru Iwata,"There would be no paperbacks, no romance novels, no magazines."
Satoru Iwata,We do not run from risk. We run to it. We are taking the risk to move beyond the boundaries of the game industry to reach new players and current players.
Satoru Iwata,You say you want a revolution?
Satoru Iwata,The key here is not what you are playing but how you will be playing. Revolution will also create entirely new genres to expand the definition of video games.
Satoru Iwata,This is an extremely exciting innovation -- one that will thrill current players and entice new ones.
Satoru Iwata,"No one else can match the environment we're creating for expanding the game experience to everyone. Our path is not linear, but dynamic."
Satoru Iwata,"This new approach is like stepping onto an unexplored continent for the first time, with all the potential for discovery that suggests. No one else can match the environment we're creating for expanding the game experience to everyone. Our path is not linear, but dynamic."
Satoru Iwata,"Small developers can compete on creativity not on scale or staff size.... Nintendo is willing to help bring these ideas to life,"
Satoru Iwata,"The development of this game came from our belief that people wanted something new. In this case, the game took the form of a treadmill for the mind."
Satoru Iwata,I really don't think that there's going to be a lot of acceptance by current customers of the $60 price tag.
Haz Iwendi,He's in the custody of security agencies in Borno.
Haz Iwendi,We are on red alert. All state commissioners of police are under instructions to monitor developments and prevent any violence.
Haz Iwendi,"The police moved in, shot at the (kidnappers') vehicle. They killed the driver of the vehicle but the kidnappers dropped the dead body and went away."
Haz Iwendi,They will be charged with misconduct and dereliction of duty.
Haz Iwendi,The army is assisting the police and a curfew has been imposed.
Eddie Izzard,"We have archeology on television, and I quite like it; itâ€™s a sort of detective thing, but itâ€™s really true, you know itâ€™s thereâ€¦ But itâ€™s kind of slow on telly, it has this problem of, â€œWeâ€™ve been here three weeks on live television, and weâ€™ve taken off about a millimeter of top soil so farâ€¦â€ Thereâ€™s men with brushes and beardsâ€¦ maybe theyâ€™ve just got beards, Iâ€™m not sureâ€¦ â€œWe found this and carbon-dated it to last Tuesday, so weâ€™re very excitedâ€¦â€"
Eddie Izzard,"Father, bless me for I have sinned, I did an original sinâ€¦ I poked a badger with a spoon."
Eddie Izzard,Romance & Cigarettes.
Eddie Izzard,"Picasso, he should have been a taxidermist!â€œIâ€™ve done your dog. Itâ€™s got nine eyes down the side, I made his head all square, 15 legs. What do you think of that?â€â€œFido looks a bit weird.â€"
Eddie Izzard,"I am an evil giraffe, and I shall eat more leaves from this tree then prehaps I should, so that other giraffes may die"
Eddie Izzard,"So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little naive, I feel!"
Eddie Izzard,I'm a one-man idiot.
Eddie Izzard,MAC gave me 55 lipsticks to test. These are the same lipsticks I got caught stealing by the police when I was 15. How ironic.
Eddie Izzard,I like my coffee like I like my women. In a plastic cup.
Eddie Izzard,"I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from."
Eddie Izzard,"I wanna live 'til I die, no more, no less."
Eddie Izzard,They tend to come out a colour called 'Pants left in wash'
Eddie Izzard,Boy bands should be exploded from a great height. They're just pretty people singing music written by others.
Eddie Izzard,Never put a sock in a toaster.
Eddie Izzard,"If you've never seen an elephant ski, you've never been on acid."
Eddie Izzard,I'm an Action Transvestite
Eddie Izzard,"I'm an action transvestite really, so it's running, jumping, climbing trees... putting on make-up when you're up there!"
Tom Izzo,"If anybody that ever played here hears that statistic, they're going to have trouble coming back and seeing us."
Tom Izzo,"In our losses to Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, we've had serious foul trouble at key times. Maybe we've had leads or were playing good, but it changed the complexion of the game."
Tom Izzo,"The really sad part is, I thought this team had enough talent to go a long way. We had three really good players, but we just didn't have enough depth and we were never as consistent or tough as we needed to be."
Tom Izzo,"I'm not a big believer that the NCAA goes totally on strength of schedule and things like that, so I think you still have to have wins."
Tom Izzo,I didn't sleep very well. We got into the flow better and I feel fortunate to win. It wasn't good enough to pat ourselves on the back.
Tom Izzo,I feel all of the responsibility for that. I did not get as much out of these guys as they had to give.
Tom Izzo,"I'm happy that the league is looking better and better. We're making progress as a conference, and making progress as a team, but we're still a work in progress and we've got a lot of work to do."
Tom Izzo,Well I'm a little disappointed right now because we're having some hotel problems because there seems to be some other (events) booked. I don't know if that's the Big Ten's fault or Indianapolis' fault but that's a little concerning.
Tom Izzo,"They deserved to win. I'm not sure they worked any harder (than his team) in practice, but on this given night they brought it. It was their night and they deserved it."
Tom Izzo,It's kind of nice. They don't like to practice?I do. So they finally get their way.
Tom Izzo,It was pretty good after the game ? swelled up a hair. We didn't practice yesterday just for that reason.
Tom Izzo,"I don't think there's any question that was our best performance of the year, against a really good team. That was our best basketball in a couple of years."
Tom Izzo,"Sometimes there's only so much you can do. I think Matt would play if it was just the pain. They're worried that if your jaw is broke and you get hit again, what can happen."
Tom Izzo,This was a strange game. I was as happy as 10 men to only be down only four at halftime.
Tom Izzo,It makes my job look like tiddlywinks.
Tom Izzo,I think he's done a great job in a tough situation.
Tom Izzo,Their guys have made significant improvement. That's a sign that they are being well coached.
Tom Izzo,"I'm not a big believer in that. The one time it really hurt was when Ohio State won the thing (in 2002) and got shipped west. That was awful. In that respect it would be an advantage losing, but for the most part winning is more of an advantage."
Tom Izzo,We played well in spurts and I thought we hurt them with our transition game. We weren't rebounding well enough to get any breaks going in the first half. Rebounding is our Achilles' heel right now.
Tom Izzo,"It's a nice honor to have three players recognized. I think it speaks not only to the talent of those players but also their unselfishness to be willing to share awards with their teammates, much like the Detroit Pistons had four all-stars, but no one who started in the all-star game."
Tom Izzo,"I think he's starting to get it. He's starting to see and understand, ?I didn't go hard enough here, I got to be stronger with the ball there.' I think he's seeing it. Before, I think he was hearing it and not seeing it. Now, I think he's hearing it and seeing it."
Tom Izzo,"Talking about sacrificing in terms of giving up a couple of hours compared to giving up a life, they just don't match."
Tom Izzo,"I thought about bringing out the accordion and giving them the Lawrence Welk special. At times with this group, I didn't know what to do with them."
Tom Izzo,"We have a long way to go but we are still in the race. I'm not giving up on the Big Ten, but we just aren't in control so we just have to let it play out and focus on getting better every day until the Big Ten tournament and the NCAA tournament. We have lots of big games we need to focus on, but it feels good to be home."
Tom Izzo,Those two guys are going to have to learn under fire.
Tom Izzo,"The NCAA wants you to make sure nobody's fighting, and then they don't want you breaking it up. My assistant doesn't deserve any of the blame for that; I do. I didn't appreciate the double-technical because I didn't think that was deserved."
Tom Izzo,I was very disappointed in our execution and some of our guard play. Maybe we were a little fatigued. We were short on a lot of shots.
Tom Izzo,You try to make excuses that are real.
Tom Izzo,"Sometimes, these jobs deal with emotion. I just wanted to make sure he didn't do that."
Tom Izzo,"No doubt our guards struggled. We made some big plays, and then we made some not-so-smart plays. It was a shame, because Paul Davis had two of the best practices of his life, and he just struggled tonight to even catch the ball."
Tom Izzo,It took courage for these kids coming off something like that. If you could have seen how people were tightening up after Saturday's game. It's scary.
Tom Izzo,I think there was a little self-doubt. But I thought we made a commitment that we're going to try to play and leave it on the floor.
Tom Izzo,"He's got the skills to handle the ball, but he needs to get stronger to play at the college level, and he'll do that."
Tom Izzo,"When the players want to win more than the coach, that's a great sign, and I see that."
Tom Izzo,We came here to get our school clothes.
Tom Izzo,"It's the class of the class, and that's what you want to be associated with."
Tom Izzo,I'm expecting big things out of this class. They have paid their dues. I would like to send them off the right way.
Tom Izzo,"This is the greatest time of the year. For nine, 10 years, we've gotten better over Christmas."
Tom Izzo,It was like Santa's elves working on Christmas day.
Tom Izzo,"Before Christmas I thought he was hitting a little bit of a wall, but after Christmas I thought he really started to understand things a little bit better and run things a little bit better. And his shot is getting a little bit better."
Tom Izzo,We're going to get back in the weight room to work on toughness and character. I promise we'll be tougher and I promise we'll get this program back to where we all want it.
Tom Izzo,"We really didn't shoot very well. We just missed. In that first half, we were just throwing balls at the basket."
Tom Izzo,I think he's really improved his three-point shooting and just his awareness of the game. I'd say he is one of the more improved players I've seen in this league.
Tom Izzo,"He might be only the second kid (after Jason Richardson) I would advise to do that, just because, that way, there'd be no questions unanswered."
Tom Izzo,He has that ability to raise a crowd off its feet. He's done a good job for them bringing that alone. ... You always have to be a little more concerned about a lob they might throw into the rafters that he can go get. That makes it more difficult.
Ashraf Qazi,"There is a control on the level of violence which is still at a worrisome level, but there is a definite control over the immediate potential for it to escalate."
Ashraf Qazi,The signs are good. All credit first to the people of Iraq to come out and refuse to show any voter fatigue in the third vote this year and then to the government and the IECI and to all the parties who have campaigned and participated by and large peacefully.
Ashraf Qazi,The urgency to form a broad-based government or a government of national unity in view of these challenges is absolutely essential.
Ashraf Qazi,We would hope for an improved security environment because otherwise many people who may wish to participate would be deterred.
Ashraf Qazi,Everything must now be done to help the negotiating parties reach a sustainable compromise as quickly as possible.

Nido Qubein,"Our kids don't want to live in deplorable rooms, ... They're paying $25,000 a year to come to this school. You tell me what kind of environment they should have."

Nido Qubein,"We are thrilled and honored to have Marsha at the helm of our board as we embark on our journey to transform High Point University, ... Her support for High Point University over the years is immeasurable. We trust in her vision, and are confident in her abilities."

With your help, we can create a nationally recognized university with top-notch facilities, exceptional educational opportunities and superior student experiences."
Nido Qubein,"This is a turning point for High Point University, ... Mr. Wilson's gift will enable us to fulfill many dreams and heighten our standards to new levels of excellence."
Nido Qubein,We are honored to have such a committed community of alumni and friends. We welcome our HPU family back to campus on this special weekend and encourage them to join in our extraordinary vision for High Point University.
Nido Qubein,"I cannot imagine a more deserving person to receive this award, ... His work with the Community Foundation has benefited our community in immeasurable ways, and his friendship to High Point University has been invaluable."
Nido Qubein,have stretched out beyond the comfort zone to make this (upgrading) happen.
Nido Qubein,Your present circumstances don't determine where youcan go; they merely determine where you start
Nido Qubein,I only wish I had more time for fund raising.
Nido Qubein,"What if you could be anything, or anybody, you chose to be? Think about it. What would you choose to be?"
Nido Qubein,One of the greatest resources people cannot mobilize themselves is that they try to accomplish great things. Most worthwhile achievements are the result of many little things done in a single direction.

Nido Qubein,"Winners compare their achievements with their goals, while losers compare their achievements with those of other people"

Nido Qubein,Change brings opportunity.
Carlos Queiroz,You could say I am more satisfied with the result than with our performance but Bayern made it really hard for us and we did fight.
Carlos Queiroz,"It was a terrible defeat but, for us, it never happened."
Carlos Queiroz,"This kind of competition is the right opportunity for these kind of players to start and create opportunities for them to make them grow up and make them ready to perform in the major competitions,"
Carlos Queiroz,"There are no suspicious circumstances, just people who have made a complaint... This could have substance or not. After the evidence (from the player) the authorities will draw the conclusions they believe to be right and fair."
Carlos Queiroz,"He went to make a statement as was planned. Based on those statements, the authorities are going to reach fair and correct conclusions,"
Joel Quenneville,"I think it makes everybody around the group more solid, you get better opportunities to assess your talent and your team, and they get exposed to situations that maybe they wouldn't have been able to get over the course of the season and you're better and you're deeper as you go along. I think that's where we're at right now with our group. I think everybody's handled the situation well."
Joel Quenneville,"With the new rules, the puck carrier is going to have more leverage to do what he wants, ... Having puck possession is obviously a great way to play the game. If you don't have the puck, you want to work hard to get it back as quick as you can, and that involves checking hard."
Joel Quenneville,The opportunity is definitely there. Somebody's got to seize it.
Joel Quenneville,I always viewed it as an honor and privilege to coach Al. He's one of the guys who would do anything to win.
Joel Quenneville,"We're coming off two critical months. November and December, as far as the volume of games and a lot of real busy stretches in those months - this month looks like each and every game we should be well-prepared, ready and rested. This is an opportunity for us to help ourselves and position ourselves where we'd like to move up in the standings."
Joel Quenneville,"I think he had a real good start to the year. Lately, some games he's been strong, some games he hasn't. We'd like to see a little more consistency in his play."
Joel Quenneville,"That was definitely a strange game. We had a couple of games where we had the three-goal lead and let it get away from us earlier in the year. I liked the way we battled back. Even though we were down by three goals, we were still positive."
Joel Quenneville,It was a great environment for a hockey game. The fans were terrific. It felt like a playoff game. The crowd was into it. It was nice to see such great support from the fans. I thought right from the outset the building was electric.
Joel Quenneville,All you need is love.
Joel Quenneville,"He's got a great track record of being an excellent coach. When you look at the whole package, he's a very passionate, strong-minded guy with a great opinion on the game."
Joel Quenneville,"Joe wanted to go. A couple guys wanted to go, and I think you need (prior) approval, and I didn't want to risk (a penalty) at that stage of the game. I still think he'll remember it. It was a huge goal, a timely goal."
Joel Quenneville,"I think (Laperriere) gets noticed with how well he can check, but I think, offensively, he's got some ability to make plays,"
Joel Quenneville,"He's showing me, we'll call it surprise patience with the puck. I didn't know he had that ability, but it's certainly been nice to see."
Richard Quick,"I do have some other opportunities that I hope to pursue, but they will be secondary to spending time with my family, ... I've heard coaches say that when they get close to a point where they're ready to retire, and when I was younger I didn't really understand that. But as you get a little order, you do begin to understand it, and that's where I am."
Richard Quick,"This is my last swimming meet as a coach, and it's kind of a strange feeling because I've wanted to be a swimming coach since I was 12-years-old, ... The biggest thing I'm going to miss is being a partner with the athletes and living their dreams. I just loved that, and I'm going to miss it a lot. But, I'm closing out this phase of my life, and I'm very excited about where I'm headed."
Richard Quick,"Her 10th birthday was last May, but she wanted to wait to have the party until I could be there, ... We're going to have it at the swimming pool at my house."

Robert Quillen,"If we wish to make a new world we have the material ready. The first one, too, was made out of chaos."
Shane Quilling,"Chris, as of right now, is the starting QB. He's just a sophomore, so he's going to make sophomore mistakes, but he's getting better by the day. And the exciting part is, we're going to have him a couple more years after this."
Shane Quilling,"The last three or four years, we've started league with a loss and it's come back to hurt us. Bottom line, we would have gone to the playoffs the last two years if we would have won one more game, so this game here is huge."
Shane Quilling,"These are the games you live for, right here. You have electricity in the air ... The adrenaline is flowing ... I think it's going to be the place to be Friday night."
Shane Quilling,"We're pretty solid, experience-wise, on the D-line and at linebacker. We're just young, not age-wise, but experience-wise, in the secondary. I think a lot of our success is going to depend on how well our secondary catches up."
Brady Quinn,"He just wished me luck against everyone else but Michigan, obviously,"
Brady Quinn,It was more a feeling of hunger than anything else.
Brady Quinn,"He's so brutally honest at times that it can catch you off guard. The best thing about his honesty is that it's fair. He doesn't play favorites. He's even more intense now than he was in the spring, and I'm sure that he will become even more so when we start playing the season."
Brady Quinn,I wasn't thinking anything about revenge coming into this game. What enabled us to win was the execution of our game plan.
Brady Quinn,"It's obviously a lot more comfortable when you're calling the plays down on the field. I can come up toÃŠ[ CharlieÃŠWeis ]ÃŠon the sidelines and talk to him face to face. You can see his emotions, what he's thinking, by the way he's talking to you. That's something that's help me, being able to have that face-to-face with him, being able to talk with him."
Brady Quinn,"Coach Vaas and Coach Weis are on the same page in what they desire from their quarterbacks. The always try to get the most out of you. Coach Vaas is on us a lot of time no matter what. Even if the throw appears perfect, maybe there is something fundamentally we didn't do well. He is extremely hard on us and he is always making sure we strive for perfection in everything we do."
Brady Quinn,"He's in Hollywood, that's where all the big entertainment is, so obviously that's going to be part of his college experience and everything he goes through. Obviously being in South Bend, it's not a hot spot for celebrities, so a lot of the focus when it comes to me is more or less football."
Brady Quinn,I still am. I root for Ohio State in certain circumstances.
Brady Quinn,"When you look at the situation, I'm a big believer in my faith. And I actually believe God helped me make the decision to come to Notre Dame, and I feel the same way about Him giving me a feeling that it's in my best interests to come back for another year and it's in my best interests to finish out school and be prepared for the real world whenever football ends."
Brady Quinn,"I'm a big believer in my faith, and I actually believe God helped me make the decision to come to Notre Dame for a reason.

Brian Quinn,"Turnover was down for the first time in 10 years, with sales of merchandise, in particular, falling fairly sharply following several years of uninterrupted growth."
Brian Quinn,"He has proved himself one of the great Celtic managers, and his place in the history of the club is assured. He goes with our gratitude and best wishes."
Brian Quinn,"I believe there has been somewhat better news in recent times [on his wife's health]. I think he [O'Neill] is certainly a very strong candidate. He's comfortable in dealing with the press. He'll defend himself. He takes a close interest in what the press says and I know if he were a candidate and being considered for the job he would think quite hard about that aspect of it, because I think outside the city of Glasgow the England manager is pretty much top of the pile."
Brian Quinn,A combination of growth in the areas of high market activity and consolidation of our position in the remaining markets present exciting prospects for the group.
Brian Quinn,"There are still pockets of areas that are still having problems getting vaccine. The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) promises it's on the way, so by the end of this month and December people should still be able to get their shots."
Colin Quinn,"You know, the funny thing about Lorne and that show is that, you can go over one million things, but in a business of bean counters, he still likes to laugh at small things and creates a show around it."
Colin Quinn,"Well... you know, I would wake up with a terrible hangover in a jail somewhere and worst part was that I would not know why I was there."
Colin Quinn,My stand-up act? I combine the fact that the world is a violent place with the fact that each person is responsible for the situation they are in.
Colin Quinn,"It was tumultuous, it was crazy, but I would not trade it for anything."
Colin Quinn,"I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write."

Kenneth Quinn,"It will be one of the nicest buildings in the state. Our expectation was that after we are handed the keys to the front door, it would take 36 to 37 months to finish the project."
Kenneth Quinn,"This is really criminalizing well-intentioned, honest mistakes, and singling out -- I think unfairly -- the one company that up front admitted its mistakes early on."
Kenneth Quinn,"This is really criminalizing well-intentioned, honest mistakes, and singling out -- I think unfairly -- the one company that up front admitted its mistakes early on,"
Kenneth Quinn,We don't believe any evidence exists of willful and criminal behavior. We intend to defend ourselves against any criminal charges vigorously.
Pat Quinn,an infusion of youth (possibly with Alex Steen and Clarke Wilm on the wings).
Pat Quinn,"They know they were bad, so I don't want them wondering if they have lost the (trust) of the coach. They should know they will get another chance."
Pat Quinn,"That's where we got into trouble before, playing him before he was ready ... we'll have to make sure we're on the same page with Darcy and the medical staff."
Pat Quinn,Talent? We have talent. Talent is only part of the whole thing. We tried to rely on talent tonight. I hope we learned.
Pat Quinn,"You look at your talent, you watch how we run our practices, you think the intangibles with this team were pretty good."
Pat Quinn,"I'm not necessarily surprised because there was talent there and none of us knew how the new game was going to go. They can skate and that's really what shows up when you play this team. Individually and as a group, their game really has some speed to it. They move the puck really well."
Pat Quinn,Guys with good offensive talent couldn't seem to finish off because we were still relying on our individual skills and couldn't get over that hump that you need to get over.
Pat Quinn,"The Swiss team came to work; they played a better Canadian game than we did. Talent is only part of this whole thing. We tried to win on talent alone and it wasn't good enough. If we don't learn from this, we'll be going home early."
Pat Quinn,Talent is only one part of this whole thing and we tried to rely on talent tonight and it wasn't good enough. If we don't realize that then we will be going home early.
Pat Quinn,"We have talent, but it's only one part of the whole thing. We tried to rely on talent and it wasn't good enough. And if we don't learn from that, we will be going home early."
Pat Quinn,We have a lot of talent and great individual players but we have a long way to go to become a team.
Pat Quinn,"They have a lot of talent,"
Pat Quinn,"They have a lot of talent. Many of the advantages entering this season went to clubs like Atlanta, Calgary, ones that have been lousy for awhile, but were not only able to have good young guys but have the (salary)cap in the right spot too."
Pat Quinn,"It's all about results. You run a great risk if you spend your time chasing fads. What you chase has to be a proven method of teaching, and that has to be incorporated into the design."
Pat Quinn,"To leave him out too long is not fair to him, it's not fair to the rest of the guys, so I'm happy that he's playing."
Pat Quinn,"He's showing a responsibility and an accountability that we were hoping we'd get, but you never know, and he's showing it right now."
Pat Quinn,It's a process and we are making some progress.
Pat Quinn,We like to use Pony because he's consistently the best guy in practice.
Pat Quinn,Would the sellers have been motivated had we not had that power? I can't answer that.
Pat Quinn,We couldn't seem to get anything going with any passion. I guess tonight it just seemed not to be there. We had a lot of guys who just couldn't seem to get anything going.
Pat Quinn,He was given an injection to see if it could quiet down some inflammation and relieve some of the pain there.
Pat Quinn,"He felt a pop in his ribs. He's definitely in pain, but we don't know exactly what that's about. We'll get a picture (today) and find out what the pain means."
Pat Quinn,"He has some pain still on the inside (of his knee). I don't know exactly what ligament that is, but he has some pain in his dry land training that shows up. Until that disappears, he won't be cleared to do anything."
Pat Quinn,I think the idea as a coach is you put out a lineup that can win that night. The present is more important than the future. You try to put the guys out there who will get us one more victory.
Pat Quinn,I guess they're doing what they're taught to do. The nature of those kind of hits are not something you want to see.
Pat Quinn,"You'd think it wouldn't be something like a wrist, but that's the bad luck of it."
Pat Quinn,Not a wrist. That's bad luck.
Pat Quinn,It's about learning to become a team.
Pat Quinn,"He has shown, basically in my mind, the signs of leadership."
Pat Quinn,We are fortunate to have an abundance of leaders on our team. We are confident that these players will bring our team the necessary leadership on the ice and in our dressing room as we prepare for the World Cup.
Pat Quinn,"I wanted to get O'Neill with Allison, which is where I kind of planned on having him all the way along."
Pat Quinn,This journey ended tonight ... the next one starts tomorrow. My plan is to proceed as normal.
Pat Quinn,You've got to get tough and do the job and we're not doing the job.
Pat Quinn,"My intention is to leave them (at centre) for the start of the year,"
Pat Quinn,"We played a lot better, so that has to be looked at as an improvement, especially over Saturday night."
Pat Quinn,"We played a lot better and so that has to be looked at as an improvement, especially over Saturday night. We weren't that bad in the other games but it was not good enough to win, I guess. But the effort was better."
Pat Quinn,"Maybe people are really going to love it. But from an old-timer's standpoint, I hate the game being decided this way."
Pat Quinn,"He's probably the biggest reason they won gold in 1998, and he would have been the dark horse to carry them to gold again."
Pat Quinn,The 26 players we selected today are the ones who we feel will get us (back) to that gold-medal circle.
Pat Quinn,We can't take penalties especially when their special team are so hot of late. They looked like pretty easy goals and that was the difference. I was pretty pleased with how we played in the first.
Pat Quinn,Those two power-play goals certainly changed the game.
Pat Quinn,We've been giving him second chances all year. There have been lots of nights that we've played him that he hasn't necessarily earned it.
Pat Quinn,"I am tired of watching other guys make plays right on our doorstep. We can't be giving gifts away. It is one thing to get beat, but another to beat yourself."
Pat Quinn,It could be (McCabe or one of his ilk prevail). It has helped their game that we're using them a lot more on power play and penalty kills.
Pat Quinn,"A .300 hitter is considered tremendously successful. There's a lot more failure than there is success. In the shootout, at some point, there has to be a winner."
Pat Quinn,"Execution was the problem. If you don't execute, whether it's from a lack of trying, maybe a lack of talent, I don't know ... but if you can't do the job does it mean bringing other people in? I don't know. Those people weren't in the lineup because they didn't do the job."
Pat Quinn,(We like their) youth and enthusiasm.
Pat Quinn,"We've run the gamut of emotions over the last little while, that's for sure. These were a big two points on the board here tonight."
Pat Quinn,Emotion is powerful in sport. We want it. We want the positive emotions and we fight the negative ones. It's pretty hard to look at your job and know exactly what you need to do when emotions get a hold of you.
Pat Quinn,"When you have those hopes and dreams like your fans do, it seems to be devastating."
Pat Quinn,"They (team doctors) did the surgery, they had to re-embed the finger nail."
Pat Quinn,You cross-check a guy twice you're going to get called. You have to play with discipline to be successful.
Pat Quinn,That's a lack of discipline.
Pat Quinn,"I had kind of a feeling that this team had a little bit of destiny to it,"
Pat Quinn,"He's a hockey person, a hockey dad, and secretly, I think he loves the Leafs."
Pat Quinn,"I try not to dwell on that. Criticism goes with all sorts of things in life. I don't think about that at all. My focus is on trying to help these young men be as good as they can be. By feeling bad or being distracted by what is being said, all you are doing is not answering adversity the best way you can. I try to put it where it belongs. I'm not beating myself up."
Pat Quinn,"Right now we're trying to build some team work, we're trying to build some confidence,"
Pat Quinn,"It still remains open going forward. (Decisions) will be based on communication with our goaltenders, in particular Marty."
Pat Quinn,"There is no game without the players, and no victories for a team or its coach without loyal and talented individuals on the management, coaching and support staffs."
Pat Quinn,He hasn't raised himself up to be a first- or second-line player yet and as a coach you want him to challenge himself to move up and not be happy with what he's doing now.
Pat Quinn,"I think it raises it, definitely. People like a white Christmas."
Pat Quinn,He's one of the great goaltenders Canada has ever had. He didn't have a great start to the season but lately he's been on top of his game. He's a winner and the right guy to start.
Pat Quinn,"[KELOWNA, B.C. (CP) - Team Canada wrapped up its five-day camp Friday, a gathering that failed to make it any easier to narrow down the list of Olympic hopefuls. Not a single player looked out of place.] We knew this wouldn't be easy and it's not going to be, ... The next three months will go a long way towards deciding who the final guys are."
Pat Quinn,"I have yet to have a conversation with anyone (with Hockey Canada) about this issue, so all this speculation is premature to talk about."
Pat Quinn,"One of the things Team Canada management wanted to do, because we have so many talented Canadian players, was that availability of selecting the guy who's hot at the time."
Pat Quinn,"I believe that it comes from who you are and what you learn when you're younger, not necessarily just when you look down at what's on your chest."
Pat Quinn,I guess we're just going to have to fight through this. We have some adversity with our special teams. We paid for this game by taking penalties.
Pat Quinn,"I see him as a more mature guy right now and he has that good ability to get around the ice,"

quran,"Have you not considered those (Jews) who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of Allah that it might decide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw."
quran,"Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants; but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss, and of them is he who takes a middle course, and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by Allah's permission; this is the great excellence."
quran,And those who were given the Book did not become divided except after clear evidence had come to them.
quran,"He it is Who caused those who disbelieved of the followers of the Book to go forth from their homes at the first banishment you did not think that they would go forth, while they were certain that their fortresses would defend them against Allah; but Allah came to them whence they did not expect, and cast terror into their hearts; they demolished their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers; therefore take a lesson, O you who have eyes! / And had it not been that Allah had decreed for them the exile, He would certainly have punished them in this world, and m the hereafter they shall have chastisement of the fire."
quran,"And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, your souls have made the matter light for you, but patience is good and Allah is He Whose help is sought for against what you describe."
quran,"He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran,"Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame; / And continue to remind, for surely the reminder profits the believers."
quran,There the believers were tried and they were shaken with severe shaking.
quran,"And warn your nearest relations, / And be kind to him who follows you of the believers."
quran,They do not pay regard to ties of relationship nor those of covenant in the case of a believer; and these are they who go beyond the limits.
quran,Is he then who is a believer like him who is a transgressor? They are not equal.
quran,"And be not infirm, and be not grieving, and you shall have the upper hand if you are believers."
quran,"And whoever comes to Him a believer (and) he has done good deeds indeed, these it is who shall have the high ranks, / The gardens of perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein; and this is the reward of him who has purified himself."
quran,Then We brought forth such as were therein of the believers.
quran,"Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty; / They do not believe in it, and indeed the example of the former people has already passed."
quran,And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they are going to earn (of evil).
quran,"O you who believe! What (excuse) have you that when it is said to you: Go forth in Allah's way, you should incline heavily to earth; are you contented with this world's life instead of the hereafter? But the provision of this world's life compared with the hereafter is but little."
quran,"And when they come to you, they say: We believe; and indeed they come in with unbelief and indeed they go forth with it; and Allah knows best what they concealed."
quran,"(As for) those who believe and do good, a good final state shall be theirs and a goodly return."
quran,"O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best. This is of the communications of Allah that they may be mindful."

quran,"And when Our clear communications are recited to them, their argument is no other than that they say: Bring our fathers (back) if you are truthful."
quran,"And Allah turned back the unbelievers in their rage; they did not obtain any advantage, and Allah sufficed the believers in fighting; and Allah is Strong, Mighty."
quran quran,But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard; they altered the words from their places and they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of; and you shall always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them; so pardon them and turn away; surely Allah loves those who do good (to others).
quran quran,"Alike (to Him) among you is he who conceals (his) words and he who speaks them openly, and he who hides himself by night and (who) goes forth by day."
quran quran,And they are guided to goodly words and they are guided into the path of the Praised One.
quran quran,"And women in the city said: The chiefs wife seeks her slave to yield himself (to her), surely he has affected her deeply with (his) love; most surely we see her in manifest error."
quran quran,"So when he saw his shirt rent from behind, he said: Surely it is a guile of you women; surely your guile is great: / O Yusuf! turn aside from this; and (O my wife)! ask forgiveness for your fault, surely you are one of the wrong-doers."
quran quran,"And there is no blame on you respecting that which you speak indirectly in the asking of (such) women in marriage or keep (the proposal) concealed within your minds; Allah knows that you win mention them, but do not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful manner, and do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled, and know that Allah knows what is in your minds, therefore beware of Him, and know that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing."
quran quran,"And when you have divorced women and they have ended-- their term (of waiting), then do not prevent them from marrying their husbands when they agree among themselves in a lawful manner; with this is admonished he among you who believes in Allah and the last day, this is more profitable and purer for you; and Allah knows while you do not know."
quran quran,"And the divorced women should keep themselves in waiting for three courses; and it is not lawful for them that they should conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the last day; and their husbands have a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for reconciliation; and they have rights similar to those against them in a just manner, and the men are a degree above them, and Allah is Mighty, Wise."
quran quran,"Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully. She said: My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us. So when he came to him and gave to him the account, he said: Fear not, you are secure from the unjust people."
quran quran,"And give women their dowries as a free gift, but if they of themselves be pleased to give up to you a portion of it, then eat it with enjoyment and with wholesome result."
quran quran,"And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is a discomfort; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as Allah has commanded you; surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves."
quran quran,"And if a woman fears ill usage or desertion on the part of her husband, there is no blame on them, if they effect a reconciliation between them, and reconciliation is better, and avarice has been made to be present in the (people's) minds; and if you do good (to others) and guard (against evil), then surely Allah is aware of what you do."
quran quran,"He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is given a great good and none but men of understanding mind."
quran quran,"You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and your souls, and you shall certainly hear from those who have been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists much annoying talk; and if you are patient and guard (against evil), surely this is one of the affairs (which should be) determined upon."
quran quran,And his wealth will not avail him when he perishes.
quran quran,"Woe to every slanderer, defamer, / Who amasses wealth and considers it a provision (against mishap); / He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal."
quran quran,Eat and pasture your cattle; most surely there are signs in this for those endowed with understanding.
quran quran,Truly in that there is an oath for those who possess understanding.
quran quran,"And with truth have We revealed it, and with truth did it come; and We have not sent you but as the giver of good news and as a warner."
quran quran,"And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, verifying what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it, therefore judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their low desires (to turn away) from the truth that has come to you; for every one of you did We appoint a law and a way, and if Allah had pleased He would have made you (all) a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you, therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds; to Allah is your return, of all (of you), so He will let you know that in which you differed; / And that you should judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their low desires, and be cautious of them, lest they seduce you from part of what Allah has revealed to you; but if they turn back, then know that Allah desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults; and most surely many of the people are transgressors."
quran quran,"Certainly they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they meditated plots against you until the truth came, and Allah's commandment prevailed although they were averse (from it)."
quran quran,"So the truth was established, and what they did became null."
quran quran,"And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His words, though the guilty may be averse (to it)."
quran quran,So when the truth came to them from Us they said: This is most surely clear enchantment! / Musa said: Do you say (this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is it magic? And the magicians are not successful.
quran quran,This is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth; and surely those who go against the Book are in a great opposition.
quran quran,Most surely this is a certain truth.
quran quran,"Certainly Allah had shown to His Apostle the vision with truth: you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah pleases, in security, (some) having their heads shaved and (others) having their hair cut, you shall not fear, but He knows what you do not know, so He brought about a near victory before that."
quran quran,"These are the communications of Allah which We recite to you with truth; then in what announcement would they believe after Allah and His communications? / Woe to every sinful liar, / Who hears the communications of Allah recited to him, then persists proudly as though he had not heard them; so announce to him a painful punishment."
quran quran,"We did not create them both but with the truth, but most of them do not know."
quran quran,"How shall they be reminded, and there came to them an Apostle making clear (the truth), / Yet they turned their backs on him and said: One taught (by others), a madman."
quran quran,"Certainly We have brought you the truth, but most of you are averse to the truth."
quran quran,"And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, that is the truth verifying that which is before it; most surely with respect to His servants Allah is Aware, Seeing."
quran quran,"And those before them rejected (the truth), and these have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them, but they gave the lie to My apostles, then how was the manifestation of My disapproval? / Say: I exhort you only to one thing, that rise up for Allah's sake in twos and singly, then ponder: there is no madness in your fellow-citizen; he is only a warner to you before a severe chastisement."
quran quran,Therefore rely on Allah; surely you are on the clear truth.
quran quran,"And they shall not bring to you any argument, but We have brought to you (one) with truth and best in significance."
quran quran,"And if the truth be on their side, they come to him quickly, obedient."
quran quran,And of a truth he saw himself on the clear horizon.
quran quran,But he rejected (the truth) and disobeyed.
quran quran,"And certainly those before them rejected (the truth), then how was My disapproval."
quran quran,And when it is recited to them they say: We believe in it surely it is the truth from our Lord; surely we were submitters before this.
quran quran,"So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray, / But called the truth a lie and turned back, / Then he went to his followers, walking away in haughtiness."
quran quran,"Except those who repent and amend and make manifest (the truth), these it is to whom I turn (mercifully); and I am the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful."
quran quran,"And do not give away your property which Allah has made for you a (means of) support to the weak of understanding, and maintain them out of (the profits of) it, and clothe them and speak to them words of honest advice."
quran quran,"Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and hoary hair after strength; He creates what He pleases, and He is the Knowing, the Powerful."
quran quran,What! that which is made in ornaments and which in contention is unable to make plain speech! / And they make the angels-- them who are the servants of the Beneficent God-- female (divinities). What! did they witness their creation? Their evidence shall be written down and they shall be questioned.
quran quran,Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and what they do openly.
quran quran,"And when you see them, their persons will please you, and If they speak, you will listen to their speech; (they are) as if they were big pieces of wood clad with garments; they think every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, therefore beware of them; may Allah destroy them, whence are they turned back? / And when it is said to them: Come, the Apostle of Allah will ask forgiveness for you, they turn back their heads and you may see them turning away while they are big with pride."
quran quran,"Whoever goes aright, for his own soul does he go aright; and whoever goes astray, to its detriment only does he go astray: nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of another, nor do We chastise until We raise an apostle."
quran quran,"There shall every soul become acquainted with what it sent before, and they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Patron, and what they devised shall escape from them."
quran quran,"And a soul will not die but with the permission of Allah the term is fixed; and whoever desires the reward of this world, I shall give him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter I shall give him of it, and I will reward the grateful."
quran quran,"Why is it not then that when it (soul) comes up to the throat, / And you at that time look on-- / And We are nearer to it than you, but you do not see-- / Then why is it not-- if you are not held under authority-- / That you send it (not) back-- if you are truthful? / Then if he is one of those drawn nigh (to Allah), / Then happiness and bounty and a garden of bliss."
quran quran,"And they denied them unjustly and proudly while their soul had been convinced of them; consider, then how was the end of the mischief-makers."
quran quran,"And every soul shall be paid back fully what it has done, and He knows best what they do."
quran quran,"O you who believe! avoid most of suspicion, for surely suspicion in some cases is a sin, and do not spy nor let some of you backbite others. Does one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? But you abhor it; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, surely Allah is Oft-returning (to mercy), Merciful."
quran quran,And abandon open and secret sin; surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned.
quran quran,"Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up in their place from among those who have a claim against them, the two nearest in kin; so they two should swear by Allah: Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not exceeded the limit, for then most surely we should be of the unjust."
quran quran,"Whoever then alters it after he has heard it, the sin of it then is only upon those who alter it; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing."
quran quran,"See how they forge the lie against Allah, and this is sufficient as a manifest sin."
quran quran,"And whoever commits a fault or a sin, then accuses of it one innocent, he indeed takes upon himself the burden of a calumny and a manifest sin."
quran quran,"And whoever commits a sin, he only commits it against his own soul; and Allah is Knowing, Wise."
quran quran,They shall pass therein from one to another a cup wherein there shall be nothing vain nor any sin.
quran quran,Nay! those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and opposition.
quran quran,"And whoever strives hard, he strives only for his own soul; most surely Allah is Self-sufficient, above (need of) the worlds."
quran quran,"You have advantages in them till a fixed time, then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House."
quran quran,And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice.
quran quran,"A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of springs, / White, delicious to those who drink."
quran quran,"And one of His signs is that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them, and He put between you love and compassion; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect."
quran quran,"And certainly there came to them an Apostle from among them, but they rejected him, so the punishment overtook them while they were unjust."
quran quran,"Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful, / And that My punishment-- that is the painful punishment."
quran quran,"Yet their cry, when Our punishment came to them, was nothing but that they said: Surely we were unjust."
quran quran,"And as for the two who are guilty of indecency from among you, give them both a punishment; then if they repent and amend, turn aside from them; surely Allah is Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful."
quran quran,"How (great) was then My punishment and My warning! / Surely We sent upon them a single cry, so they were like the dry fragments of trees which the maker of an enclosure collects."
quran quran,"And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment besides that (in the world), but most of them do not know."
quran quran,And other (punishment) of the same kind-- of various sorts.

quran quran,"And if We hold back from them the punishment until a stated period of time, they will certainly say: What prevents it? Now surely on the day when it will come to them, it shall not be averted from them and that which they scoffed at shall beset them."
quran quran,And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies and do not stand by his grave; surely they disbelieve in Allah and His Apostle and they shall die in transgression.
quran quran,"O you who believe! do not go near prayer when you are Intoxicated until you know (well) what you say, nor when you are under an obligation to perform a bath-- unless (you are) travelling on the road-- until you have washed yourselves; and if you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth, then wipe your faces and your hands; surely Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving."

quran quran,Those who keep up prayer and spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them. (The Accessions 8.3)
quran quran,"Do you not see that Allah is He Whom do glorify all those who are in the heavens and the earth, and the (very) birds with expanded wings? He knows the prayer of each one and its glorification, and Allah is Cognizant of what they do. (The Light 24.41)"
quran quran,"Have you not seen those to whom it was said: Withhold your hands, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate; but when fighting is prescribed for them, lo! a party of them fear men as they ought to have feared Allah, or (even) with a greater fear, and"

This is for him among you who fears falling into evil; and that you abstain is better for you, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,"And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them."
quran quran,"Is then he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has made himself deserving of displeasure from Allah, and his abode is hell; and it is an evil destination."

quran quran,"Thus it is due to mercy from Allah that you deal with them gently, and had you been rough, hard hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them, and take counsel with them in the affair; so when you have decided, then place your trust in Allah; surely Allah loves those who trust."

quran quran,"And how many a living creature that does not carry its sustenance: Allah sustains it and yourselves; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing."
quran quran,"And rely on the Ever-living Who dies not, and celebrate His praise; and Sufficient is He as being aware of the faults of His servants, / Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods, and He is firmly established on the throne of authority; the Beneficent God, so ask respecting it one aware."
quran quran,"And Allah has created from water every living creature: so of them is that which walks upon its belly, and of them is that which walks upon two feet, and of them is that which walks upon four; Allah creates what He pleases; surely Allah has power over all things."
quran quran,"And We did not send any apostle but with the language of his people, so that he might explain to them clearly; then Allah makes whom He pleases err and He guides whom He pleases and He is the Mighty, the Wise."
quran quran,"And.surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they might expel you from it, and in that case they will not tarry behind you but a little."
quran quran,What! Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a tract of land to engulf you or send on you a tornado? Then you shall not find a protector for yourselves.
quran quran,O my people! enter the holy land which Allah has prescribed for you and turn not on your backs for then you will turn back losers.
quran quran,And most certainly We will settle you in the land after them; this is for him who fears standing in My presence and who fears My threat.
quran quran,"And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that (as for) the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it."
quran quran,"Until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people to whom We had given no shelter from It; / Even so! and We had a full knowledge of what he had."
quran quran,Surely We established him in the land and granted him means of access to every thing.
quran quran,So go about in the land for four months and know that you cannot weaken Allah and that Allah will bring disgrace to the unbelievers.
quran quran,"And remember when He made you successors after Ad and settled you in the land-- you make mansions on its plains and hew out houses in the mountains-- remember therefore Allah's benefits and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief."
quran quran,"And thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land-- he had mastery in it wherever he liked; We send down Our mercy on whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of those who do good."
quran quran,"And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We are but peace-makers."
quran quran,"But if you held command, you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship! / Those it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes."
quran quran,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them while they were stronger than these in power? And Allah is not such that any thing in the heavens or in the earth should escape Him; surely He is Knowing, Powerful."
quran quran,"And he was unjustly proud in the land, he and his hosts, and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us."
quran quran,"And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings and their property, and (to) a land which you have not yet trodden, and Allah has power over all things."
quran quran,"Then as to Ad, they were unjustly proud in the land, and they said: Who is mightier in strength than we? Did they not see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in strength, and they denied Our communications? / So We sent on them a furious wind in unlucky days, that We may make them taste the chastisement of abasement in this world's life; and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is much more abasing, and they shall not be helped."
quran quran,"So it became as black, barren land."
quran quran,That is because you exulted in the land unjustly and because you behaved insolently.
quran quran,"Those who, should We establish them in the land, will keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and enjoin good and forbid evil; and Allah's is the end of affairs. (The Pilgrimage 22.41)"
quran quran,"Nay, they reject that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge, and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them; even thus did those before them reject (the truth); see then what was the end of the unjust."
quran quran,"But Allah bears witness by what He has revealed to you that He has revealed it with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness (also); and Allah is sufficient as a witness."
quran quran,"When you received it with your tongues and spoke with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and you deemed it an easy matter while with Allah it was grievous."
quran quran,"He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge."
quran quran,Certainly He has a comprehensive knowledge of them and He has numbered them a (comprehensive) numbering.
quran quran,"Musa said to him: Shall I follow you on condition that you should teach me right knowledge of what you have been taught? / He said: Surely you cannot have patience with me / And how can you have patience in that of which you have not got a comprehensive knowledge? / He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any matter."
quran quran,"And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said those before them, the like of what they say; their hearts are all alike. Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure."
quran quran,"And they have no knowledge of it; they do not follow anything but conjecture, and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all."
quran quran,"And certainly We chose them, having knowledge, above the nations."
quran quran,"To Him is referred the knowledge of the hour, and there come not forth any of the fruits from their coverings, nor does a female bear, nor does she give birth, but with His knowledge; and on the day when He shall call out to them, Where are (those whom you called) My associates? They shall say: We declare to Thee, none of us is a witness."
quran quran,"Surely Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the hour, and He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the wombs; and no one knows what he shall earn on the morrow; and no one knows in what land he shall die; surely Allah is Knowing, Aware."
quran quran,Nay! those who are unjust follow their low desires without any knowledge; so who can guide him whom Allah makes err? And they shall have no helpers.
quran quran,"And those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good, and none is made to receive this except the patient."
quran quran,"Until when they come, He will say: Did you reject My communications while you had no comprehensive knowledge of them? Or what was it that you did? / And the word shall come to pass against them because they were unjust, so they shall not speak."
quran quran,"And they say: When shall this threat be (executed) if you are truthful? / Say: The knowledge (thereof is only with Allah and I am only a plain warner.= / But when they shall see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry, and it shall be said; This is that which you used to call for."
quran quran,"They ask you about the hour, when will be its taking place? Say: The knowledge of it is only with my Lord; none but He shall manifest it at its time; it will be momentous in the heavens and the earth; it will not come on you but of a sudden. They ask you as if you were solicitous about it. Say: Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know."
quran quran,"But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray"
quran quran,"But the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, and those who keep up prayers and those who give the poor-rate and the believers in Allah and the last day, these it is"
quran quran,"So when they have reached their prescribed time, then retain them with kindness or separate them with kindness, and call to witness two men of justice from among you, and give upright testimony for Allah. With that is admonished he who believes in Allah and the latter day; and whoever is careful of (his duty to) Allah, He will make for him an outlet, / And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not; and whoever trusts in Allah, He is sufficient for him; surely Allah attains His purpose; Allah indeed has appointed a measure for everything."
quran quran,"So the punishment overtook them in justice, and We made them as rubbish; so away with the unjust people."
quran quran,"And every nation had an apostle; so when their apostle came, the matter was decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt with unjustly."
quran quran,"And you have it not in your power to do justice between wives, even though you may wish (it), but be not disinclined (from one) with total disinclination, so that you leave her as it were in suspense; and if you effect a reconciliation and guard (against evil), then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,"And if you are upon a journey and you do not find a scribe, then (there may be) a security taken into possession; but if one of you trusts another, then he who is trusted should deliver his trust, and let him be careful (of his duty to) Allah, his Lord; and do not conceal testimony, and whoever conceals it, his heart is surely sinful; and Allah knows what you do."
quran quran,"Had it been a near advantage and a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the tedious journey was too long for them; and they swear by Allah: If we had been able, we would certainly have gone forth with you; they cause their own souls to perish, and Allah knows that they are most surely / Allah pardon you! Why did you give them leave until those who spoke the truth had become manifest to you and you had known the liars? / They do not ask leave of you who believe in Allah and the latter day (to stay away) from striving hard with their property and their persons, and Allah knows those who guard (against evil)."
quran quran,"Nay, their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which they do."
quran quran,"Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance till / Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth and children, / We are hastening to them of good things? Nay, they do not perceive."
quran quran,"The dwellers of the desert are very hard in unbelief and hypocrisy, and more disposed not to know the limits of what Allah has revealed to His Apostle; and Allah is Knowing, Wise."
quran quran,"And they fall down on their faces weeping, and it adds to their humility."
quran quran,And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might ride upon them and as an ornament; and He creates what you do not know.
quran quran,"Whoever desires honor, then to Allah belongs the honor wholly. To Him do ascend the good words; and the good deeds, lift them up, and (as for) those who plan evil deeds, they shall have a severe chastisement; and (as for) their plan, it shall perish."
quran quran,"Nay! but you do not honor the orphan, / Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor, / And you eat away the heritage, devouring (everything) indiscriminately, / And you love wealth with exceeding love."
quran quran,"Or you should cause the heaven to come down upon us in pieces as you think, or bring Allah and the angels face to face (with us)."
quran quran,And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and We have made it fair seeming to the beholders.
quran quran,"And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven, so that they ascend into it all the while, / They would certainly say: Only our eyes.have been covered over, rather we are an enchanted people."
quran quran,And We have made the heaven a guarded canopy and (yet) they turn aside from its signs.
quran quran,"And when they said: O Allah! if this is the truth from Thee, then rain upon us stones from heaven or inflict on us a painful punishment."
quran quran,"Surely (as for) those who reject Our communications and turn away from them haughtily, the doors of heaven shall not be opened for them, nor shall they enter the garden until the camel pass through the eye of the needle; and thus do We reward the guilty."
quran quran,"The followers of the Book ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven; so indeed they demanded of Musa a greater thing than that, for they said: Show us Allah manifestly; so the lightning overtook them on account of their injustice. Then they took the calf (for a god), after clear signs had come to them, but We pardoned this; and We gave to Musa clear authority."
quran quran,"And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and most surely We are the makers of things ample."
quran quran,"If We please, We should send down upon them a sign from the heaven so that their necks should stoop to it."
quran quran,"So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods, and revealed in every heaven its affair; and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and (made it) to guard; that is the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing."
quran quran,"Then He directed Himself to the heaven and it is a vapor, so He said to it and to the earth: Come both, willingly or unwillingly. They both said: We come willingly."
quran quran,"He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you sustenance from heaven, and none minds but he who turns (to Him) again and again."
quran quran,"Will they not then consider the camels, how they are created? / And the heaven, how it is reared aloft, / And the mountains, how they are firmly fixed, / And the earth, how it is made a vast expanse? / Therefore do remind, for you are only a reminder."
quran quran,"When the heaven becomes cleft asunder, / And when the stars become dispersed, / And when the seas are made to flow forth, / And when the graves are laid open, / Every soul shall know what it has sent before and held back."
quran quran,Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He made it.
quran quran,"Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have made it and adorned it and it has no gaps? / And the earth, We have made it plain and cast in it mountains and We have made to grow therein of all beautiful kinds, / To give sight and as a reminder to every servant who turns frequently (to Allah)."
quran quran,The ink of the scholar and the blood of a martyr are of equal value in heaven.
quran quran,"Surely those who disbelieve shall be cried out to: Certainly Allah's hatred (of you) when you were called upon to the faith and you rejected, is much greater than your hatred of yourselves."
quran quran,And they ascribe to Allah what they (themselves) hate and their tongues relate the lie that they shall have the good; there is no avoiding it that for them is the fire and that they shall be sent before.
quran quran,That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed: We will obey you in some of the affairs; and Allah knows their secrets.
quran quran,"And if their turning away is hard on you, then if you can seek an opening (to go down) into the earth or a ladder (to ascend up) to heaven so that you should bring them a sign and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have gathered them all on guidance, therefore be not of the ignorant."
quran quran,So We responded to him and delivered him from the grief and thus do We deliver the believers.
quran quran,"Then his wife came up in great grief, and she struck her face and said: An old barren woman! / They said: Thus says your Lord: Surely He is the Wise, the Knowing."
quran quran,"And when the caravan had departed, their father said: Most surely I perceive the greatness of Yusuf, unless you pronounce me to be weak in judgment."
quran quran,"And We have enjoined on man goodness to his parents, and if they contend with you that you should associate (others) with Me, of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them, to Me is your return, so I will inform you of what you did."
quran quran,Or have they a god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah from what they set up (with Him).
quran quran,"Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts, so that We may show to him some of Our signs; surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing."
quran quran,"And let not those of you who possess grace and abundance swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and those who have fled in Allah's way, and they should pardon and turn away. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,"Here is protection only Allah's, the True One; He is best in (the giving of) reward and best in requiting."
quran quran,What! do you make (one who undertakes) the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque like him who believes in Allah and the latter day and strives hard in Allah's way? They are not equal with Allah; and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
quran quran,"And let not those deem, who are niggardly in giving away that which Allah has granted them out of His grace, that it is good for them; nay, it is worse for them; they shall have that whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the resurrection day; and Allah's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is aware of what you do."
quran quran,"Surely they feared not the account, / And called Our communications a lie, giving the lie (to the truth)."
quran quran,"And those who accuse free women then do not bring four witnesses, flog them, (giving) eighty stripes, and do not admit any evidence from them ever; and these it is that are the transgressors, / Except those who repent after this and act aright, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,"Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing of good (to others) and the giving to the kindred, and He forbids indecency and evil and rebellion; He admonishes you that you may be mindful."
quran quran,"And Ibrahim asking forgiveness for his sire was only owing to a promise which he had made to him; but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he declared himself to be clear of him; most surely Ibrahim was very tender-hearted forbearing."
quran quran,"It is not (fit) for the Prophet and those who believe that they should ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even though they should be near relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are inmates of the flaming fire."
quran quran,"Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them; this is because they disbelieve in Allah and His Apostle, and Allah does not guide the transgressing people."
quran quran,"Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,Allah has promised to those who believe and do good deeds (that) they shall have forgiveness and a mighty reward.
quran quran,Take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from the ignorant.
quran quran,"Then hasten on from the Place from which the people hasten on and ask the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,"And if you are slain in the way of Allah or you die, certainly forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than what they amass."
quran quran,"And those who when they commit an indecency or do injustice to their souls remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their faults-- and who forgives the faults but Allah, and (who) do not knowingly persist in what they have done."
quran quran,"And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord; and a Garden, the extensiveness of which is (as) the heavens and the earth, it is prepared for those who guard (against evil)."
quran quran,And in the morning they asked forgiveness.
quran quran,"And prepare against them what force you can and horses tied at the frontier, to frighten thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them, whom you do not know (but) Allah knows them; and whatever thing you will spend in Allah's way, it will be paid back to you fully and you shall not be dealt with unjustly."
quran quran,"And remember when you were few, deemed weak in the land, fearing lest people might carry you off by force, but He sheltered you and strengthened you with His aid and gave you of the good things that you may give thanks."
quran quran,"And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and say, forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good (to others)."
quran quran,"And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish and do not approach this tree, for then you will be of the unjust."
quran quran,"They shall have no food but of thorns, / Which will neither fatten nor avail against hunger."
quran quran,"Then let man look to his food, / That We pour down the water, pouring (it) down in abundance, / Then We cleave the earth, cleaving (it) asunder, / Then We cause to grow therein the grain, / And grapes and clover, / And the olive and the palm, / And thick gardens, / And fruits and herbage / A provision for you and for your cattle."
quran quran,"Therefore he has not here today a true friend, / Nor any food except refuse, / Which none but the wrongdoers eat."
quran quran,"A likeness of the garden which the righteous are promised; there now beneath it rivers, its food and shades are perpetual; this is the requital of those who guarded (against evil), and the requital of the unbelievers is the fire."
quran quran,"And, O my people! how is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire? / You call on me that I should disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving; / No doubt that what you call me to has no title to be called to in this world, nor in the hereafter, and that our turning back is to Allah, and that the extravagant are the inmates of the fire; / So you shall remember what I say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah, Surely Allah sees the servants."
quran quran,"Therefore I warn you of the fire that flames: / None shall enter it but the most unhappy, / Who gives the lie (to the truth) and turns (his) back."
quran quran,"He who fears will mind, / And the most unfortunate one will avoid it, / Who shall enter the great fire; / Then therein he shall neither live nor die."
quran quran,"Most surely the righteous are in bliss, / And most surely the wicked are in burning fire, / They shall enter it on the day of judgment."
quran quran,"By no means! Surely it is a flaming fire / Dragging by the head, / It shall claim him who turned and fled (from truth), / And amasses (wealth) then shuts it up."
quran quran,"Lay hold on him, then put a chain on him, / Then cast him into the burning fire, / Then thrust him into a chain the length of which is seventy cubits."
quran quran,"Surely with Us are heavy fetters and a flaming fire, / And food that chokes and a painful punishment, / On the day when the earth and the mountains shall quake and the mountains shall become (as) heaps of sand let loose."
quran quran,"Because of their wrongs they were drowned, then made to enter fire, so they did not find any helpers besides Allah."
quran quran,"And the jinn We created before, of intensely hot fire."
quran quran,"And whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle and goes beyond His limits, He will cause him to enter fire to abide in it, and he shall have an abasing chastisement."
quran quran,"So they shall acknowledge their sins, but far will be (forgiveness) from the inmates of the burning fire."
quran quran,"Indeed there was a sign for you in the two hosts (which) met together in encounter; one party fighting in the way of Allah and the other unbelieving, whom they saw twice as.many as themselves with the sight of the eye and Allah strengthens with His aid whom He pleases; most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight."
quran quran,"Fighting is enjoined on you, and h is an object of dislike to you; and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and it may be that you love a thing while it is evil for you, and Allah knows, while you do not know."
quran quran,"When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts (feelings of) disdain, the disdain of (the days of) ignorance, but Allah sent down His tranquillity on His Apostle and on the believers, and made them keep the word of guarding (against evil), and they were entitled to it and worthy of it; and Allah is Cognizant of all things."
quran quran,Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears.
quran quran,"This is more proper in order that they should give testimony truly or fear that other oaths be given after their oaths; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, and hear; and Allah does not guide the transgressing people."
quran quran,He it is Who shows you the lightning causing fear and hope and (Who) brings up the heavy cloud.
quran quran,"And whoever does good works and he is a believer, he shall have no fear of injustice nor of the withholding of his due."
quran quran,So Musa conceived in his mind a fear.
quran quran,"The hypocrites fear lest a chapter should be sent down to them telling them plainly of what is in their hearts. Say: Go on mocking, surely Allah will bring forth what you fear."
quran quran,Now surely the friends of Allah-- they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.
quran quran,"And if you fear a breach between the two, then appoint judge from his people and a judge from her people; if they both desire agreement, Allah will effect harmony between them, surely Allah is Knowing, Aware."
quran quran,"And let those fear who, should they leave behind them weakly offspring, would fear on their account, so let them be careful of (their duty to) Allah, and let them speak right words."
quran quran,And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.
quran quran,Say to those who believe (that) they forgive those who do not fear the days of Allah that He may reward a people for what they earn.
quran quran,"They shall have coverings of fire above them and coverings beneath them; with that Allah makes His servants to fear, so be careful of (your duty to) Me, O My servants! / And (as for) those who keep off from the worship of the idols and turn to Allah, they shall have good news, therefore give good news to My servants, / Those who listen to the word, then follow the best of it; those are they whom Allah has guided, and those it is who are the men of understanding."
quran quran,You are only a warner to him who would fear it.
quran quran,"What is the matter with you that you fear not the greatness of Allah? / And indeed He has created you through various grades: / Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens ,~ one above another, / And made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp? / And Allah has made you grow out of the earth as a growth: / Then He returns you to it, then will He bring you forth a (new) bringing forth: / And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse, / That you may go along therein in wide paths."
quran quran,Fear God and he will give you knowledge
quran quran,"They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers; a grievous word it is that comes out of their mouths; they speak nothing but a lie."
quran quran,"Or you should say: Only our fathers associated others (with Allah) before, and we were an offspring after them: Wilt Thou then destroy us for what the vain doers did? / And thus do We make clear the communications, and that haply they might return."
quran quran,Nay! I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there came to them the truth and an Apostle making manifest (the truth).
quran quran,"Surely they found their fathers going astray, / So in their footsteps they are being hastened on."
quran quran,"That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless."
quran quran,"Assert their relationship to their fathers; this is more equitable with Allah; but if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brethren in faith and your friends; and there is no blame on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, but (concerning) that which your hearts do purposely (blame may rest on you), and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."
quran quran,"Nay, We gave provision to these and their fathers until life was prolonged to them. Do they not then see that We are visiting the land, curtailing it of its sides? Shall they then prevail? / Say: I warn you only by revelation; and the deaf do not hear the call whenever they are warned."
quran quran,"And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping."
quran quran,"That is because Allah is the Truth, and that what they call upon besides Him-- that is the falsehood, and because Allah is the High, the Great."
quran quran,"That He may manifest the truth of what was true and show the falsehood of what was false, though the guilty disliked."
quran quran,"And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood, nor hide the truth while you know (it)."
quran quran,"And those who are given knowledge and faith will say: Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the day of resurrection, so this is the day of resurrection, but you did not know."
quran quran,"Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even) after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so that Allah should bring about His command; surely Allah has power over all things."
quran quran,"Surely those who have bought unbelief at the price of faith shall do no harm at all to Allah, and they shall have a painful chastisement."
quran quran,"And those who made their abode in the city and in the faith before them love those who have fled to them, and do not find in their hearts a need of what they are given, and prefer (them) before themselves though poverty may afflict them, and whoever is preserved from the niggardliness of his soul, these it is that are the successful ones."
quran quran,"These are they on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal, and these are the heedless ones."
quran quran,"Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy, and do not grieve for them, and make yourself gentle to the believers."
quran quran,"So We revealed to him, saying: Make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our revelation; and when Our command is given and the valley overflows, take into it of every kind a pair, two, and your followers, except those among them against whom the word has gone forth, and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust; surely they shall be drowned."
quran quran,And He it is Who made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts; little is it that you give thanks.
quran quran,They whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they could not even hear.
quran quran,"And when He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes and He made you to appear little in their eyes, in order that Allah might bring about a matter which was to be done, and to Allah are all affairs returned."
quran quran,"Have they feet with which they walk, or have they hands with which they hold, or have they eyes with which they see, or have they ears with which they hear? Say: Call your associates, then make a struggle (to prevail) against me and give me no respite."
quran quran,"Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and there is a covering over their eyes, and there is a great punishment for them."
quran quran,"And certainly they endeavored to turn him from his guests, but We blinded their eyes; so taste My chastisement and My warning."
quran quran,"And We bore him on that which was made of planks and nails / Sailing, before Our eyes, a reward for him who was denied."
quran quran,"And with them shall be those who restrain the eyes, having beautiful eyes; / As if they were eggs carefully protected."
quran quran,"And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about groping for the way, but how should they see? / And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not be able to go on, nor will they return."
quran quran,So no soul knows what is hidden for them of that which will refresh the eyes; a reward for what they did.
quran quran,"When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes turned dull, and the hearts rose up to the throats, and you began to think diverse thoughts of Allah."
quran quran,"And you did not veil yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did."
quran quran,"Does he think that no one sees him? / Have We not given him two eyes, / And a tongue and two lips, / And pointed out to him the two conspicuous ways? / But he would not attempt the uphill road, / And what will make you comprehend what the uphill road is? / (It is) the setting free of a slave, / Or the giving of food in a day of hunger / To an orphan, having relationship, / Or to the poor man lying in the dust."
quran quran,"And he turned away from them, and said: O my sorrow for Yusuf! and his eyes became white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor (of grief)."
quran quran,"He created man, / Taught him the mode of expression."
quran quran,"Therefore if you overtake them in fighting, then scatter by (making an example of) them those who are in their rear, that they may be mindful."
quran quran,"So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who came after it, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil)."
quran quran,"Allah sets forth an example: There is a slave in whom are (several) partners differing with one another, and there is another slave wholly owned by one man. Are the two alike in condition? (All) praise is due to Allah. Nay! most of them do not know."
quran quran,"And set out to them an example of the people of the town, when the messengers came to it."
quran quran,He calls upon him whose harm is nearer than his profit; evil certainly is the guardian and evil certainly is the associate.

Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth, and they have read what is in it; and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Do you not then understand? / And (as for) those who hold fast by the Book and keep up prayer, surely We do not waste the reward of the right doers."
quran quran,"So when they neglected what they had been reminded of, We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who were unjust with an evil chastisement because they transgressed."

quran quran,"And his people came to him, (as if) rushed on towards him, and already they did evil deeds.
