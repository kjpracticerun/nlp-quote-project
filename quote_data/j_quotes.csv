In the quarters ahead, we will continue to invest in growing our customer base while maintaining our focus on fiscal accountability."
Peter Jackson,"Sometimes the shooting of it is extremely arduous, because it's not an exact science."
Peter Jackson,"The board and management have not made any decisions on what any clash guernsey might look like. Suffice to say when a design is agreed, members will be given the opportunity to make comments."
Peter Jackson,He is a cheeky little prick but that's what we love about him.
Peter Jackson,"I tried to make it as brutal as I could, ... I've been dying to make this movie my whole life, and I enjoyed every minute of it."
Peter Jackson,We take as much inspiration from what he's doing and how he's handling it as he takes from the club.
Peter Jackson,"Wow, ... You're giving us an incredibly overwhelming night."
Peter Jackson,New Zealand is not a small country but a large village.
Peter Jackson,"If we can improve the awareness of the AFL as a sport (in Japan), we can also use it as a vehicle for business activity."
Peter Jackson,"As a gaming fan, I'm excited to bring 'Halo's' premise, action and settings to the screen with all the specificity and reality today's technology can provide, ... Fran and I are intrigued by the unique challenges this project offers, and we're delighted to be working again with our friends at Universal, and with our new ones at Fox and Microsoft. I'm a huge fan of the game and look forward to helping it come alive on the cinema screen."

Peter Jackson,"It is a great achievement and no surprise to me that we have the most Academy players coming through into the first team,"
Phil Jackson,"He is still a long ways from being smooth in what we anticipate will be a system that he'll take to and enjoy, ... It's going to take him a while, as it will everybody, especially a guy who's a lead guard in a situation like that. It takes some time."
Phil Jackson,"I wouldn't ask him to go on the trip. We want him to stay behind, work out and get an opportunity to condition himself. It makes no sense for him to go along on the trip and stay in the hotel while we play."
Phil Jackson,"This trip, you've got to do a lot of PR work for the league, pump up that Miami game on Christmas Day because they're asking you to do this all the time. And don't forget, Orlando is just as important in the win-loss column."
Phil Jackson,"I don't see how you're going to get value out of this player who, in my estimation, is one of the most valuable players in the league. Of course, I estimate him perhaps higher than other people. I think he's a terrific player. He adds a big dimension in every game he plays in."
Phil Jackson,He stayed very well inside of what we're trying to do.
Phil Jackson,"He (Lakers owner Jerry Buss) knew what he was trying to get accomplished, but still in all, it never quite seems to match up."
Phil Jackson,We got in a situation where we were waiting for Kobe?s hand to get hot. We started trying to force it in to him and that hurt us. Kobe had a hard time chasing Dixon around screens.
Phil Jackson,"I think it's a matter of trust, a matter of rebuilding the trust that we had, ... And yes, I have talked to Kobe; he actually called me this morning to congratulate me on the job. And I felt confident that he's confident that we can go forward."
Phil Jackson,"Kobe had to take some heat for that, as if he was the one who manufactured that (O'Neal) trade. All those things were made to look like there was a scapegoat in this situation, and there wasn't."
Phil Jackson,"In Phil Jackson, they chose a proven winner. That is something I support."
Phil Jackson,"I think that it can provide a space away from the other things that I'm sure have encroached upon his life and really give him a chance to do what he does best, ... His genius is basketball, and to do that he's got to play it at the highest level."
Phil Jackson,"I've talked to other players that were there, but that was played in like complete silence. I guess there was a radio announcer there, but there was nothing else that you could even document it. People don't even know if they had a backboard or nets."
Phil Jackson,I felt they were self-directed out there. They knew what they wanted to run. They broke down the double-teams and I didn't have to burn timeouts to explain it to them. That was satisfying to me.
Phil Jackson,"And then mentally, do I have the patience to see that through?"
Phil Jackson,He plays beyond pain a lot of times. He'll be fresh-legged.
Phil Jackson,I don't feel like we missed an opportunity. We'll have better opportunities as we go along. We're figuring out how to play against them.
Phil Jackson,We remind our players that this is something that was a special night in a heated situation but it's not going to be a steady diet for us. The onus on Kobe is to stay inside the team offense. The onus on the players is to pick it up a little bit better.
Phil Jackson,"They know they can get scoring from three players every night, and sometimes all five can score. It's an all-inclusive thing."
Phil Jackson,"You can't read my man's mind, ... It's cool. It was a good way to finish the game."
Phil Jackson,I think the only thing it did was take our mind off the game.
Phil Jackson,"We couldn't overcome a tough shooting game for Kobe. They threw an extra man at him, and we didn't make good adjustments. Offensively, I don't think we grasped the concepts of what we are trying to do here."
Phil Jackson,"We're exploring life without Shaq, ... and enjoying it, too."
Phil Jackson,"With our team, we're still learning what's a good enough lead. We didn't use the clock wisely and they made some big plays."
Phil Jackson,"They have that inner knowledge that (makes them) capable of going in, being tired and making the game come to them, how they want to play the game."
Phil Jackson,You get in that pressure situation where you feel like you have to win at home.
Phil Jackson,"We have nothing to crow about, our home record has been atrocious, we've got a long ways to go before we feel we're on top."
Phil Jackson,"It seems like they played really hard against Sacramento, didn't they? That was their other opponent they had an option to play. It would seem like they want to choose us."
Phil Jackson,Kobe is missing out by not finding a way to become part of a system that involves giving to something larger than himself.
Phil Jackson,"Kobe?s going to have a lot of detractors. Unfortunately, we?re not 10 games over .500. We are going to be in the playoffs, that says something about his performance."
Phil Jackson,"I've seen some remarkable games, but never anything like that."
Phil Jackson,Teams that have lost a lot of games are dangerous teams and we knew that coming in. We just have no excuses. They outplayed us tonight.
Phil Jackson,"We played about as well as we played all season. They had back-to-back games like we did, but you could see their legs getting tired. I had a suspicion that we could win this game tonight, but they played above my expectations."
Phil Jackson,"That was something to behold. It was another level. I've seen some remarkable games, but I've never seen one like that before."
Phil Jackson,"Some players, you say at the end of the game, maybe it'd be a higher percentage. But he hasn't shown he makes that shot at the end of the game."
Phil Jackson,It's just fun to have Mark in the league. He's easy to tweak.
Phil Jackson,"Kobe was waiting for his game to get hot and it never happened, and we tried to force the ball into him and it cost us."
Phil Jackson,autistic in some form or fashion.
Phil Jackson,"The two teams were both tired, but we were able to ride a little energy in the second half. We were able to build a lead that was tough to overcome."
Phil Jackson,"We have a lot of players at that position and, obviously, we've got to make cuts soon. Our desire is to find a place for him and a good opportunity for him and Charlotte was a team that really and truly did want him."
Phil Jackson,I just think he's a very determined player and dedicated to what he's doing. He's doing a lot of letting things develop on their own.
Phil Jackson,It came to a point where there was that curiosity factor: Was he going to hit 80? I'm sure it went through his head.
Phil Jackson,"That was all well and fine, but there was still some unfinished business, I felt, with the Lakers,"
Phil Jackson,"I was disappointed with our fourth-quarter beginning. We put ourselves in good position, then didn't score for three minutes. We gave it away."
Phil Jackson,"I was disappointed in our fourth quarter beginning. We put ourselves in a good position, and didn't score for the first three minutes of the fourth quarter. We gave it away in the fourth, and went from one to eleven."
Phil Jackson,"He was a great student and a really fine leader on the basketball court. He directed a lot of what happened, he was very much one of the reasons why we were successful over those six championships."
Phil Jackson,I think we are playing relatively good basketball. Tonight we were quick to the ball and did a good job on defense.
Phil Jackson,"I have my hopes as to how we can grow as a basketball club,"
Phil Jackson,We're not even going to discuss it. It's a basketball team and we've got to focus on what we need to do.

Randy Jackson,A little pitchy in sports.
Randy Jackson,"We didn't play well, and (Wellington) is a good team that took advantage of our mistakes. But to be champions you have to win on tough nights."
Randy Jackson,"They all hate each other deep down, but they aren't going to say it on camera."
Randy Jackson,"The theory is that Mariah Carey can sing anything. You hear that expression, 'She can sing the phone book.' So if you can really sing, you should be able to sing anything, so we're testing them. That's the whole competition."
Randy Jackson,"I think the talent is better than ever, and it's more balanced than ever. There are some great boys and great girls. Every year that the show does well and the public tunes in, it validates it more, so better and better singers come out."
Randy Jackson,"There's great girls, great boys, I mean I know you hear us say it every time but truly, truly good talent. And I think it's the year for the boy, finally!"
Randy Jackson,"You worked it out, baby."
Randy Jackson,I can't touch Simon anymore.

Reggie Jackson,"I used to dream how good it would be to be Willie Mays or Mickey Mantle. My dreams have died. Even the rotten rings aren't what they're supposed to be. I'll buy my own diamonds. I can afford it now. No one gives you anything, you've got to get it for yourself."
Reggie Jackson,Babe Ruth was great. I'm just lucky.
Reggie Jackson,"After Jackie Robinson the most important black in baseball history is Reggie Jackson, I really mean that."
Reggie Jackson,"I have a hard time believing athletes are overpriced. If an owner is losing money, give it up. It's a business. I have trouble figuring out why owners would stay in if they're losing money."
Reggie Jackson,"I don't mind getting beaten, but I hate to lose."
Reggie Jackson,The only difference between me and those other great Yankees is my skin color.

Reggie Jackson,"When you take a pitch and line it somewhere, it's like you've thought of something and put it there with beautiful clarity."
Reggie Jackson,You don't face Nolan Ryan without your rest. He's the only guy I go against that makes me go to bed before midnight.
Reggie Jackson,"In the building I live in on Park Avenue there are ten people who could buy the Yankees, but none of them could hit the ball out of Yankee Stadium."
Reggie Jackson,"A baseball swing is a very finely tuned instrument. It is repetition, and more repetition, then a little more after that."
Reggie Jackson,"I was reminded that when we lose and I strike out, a billion people in China don't care."
Reggie Jackson,"I'm human and I've played my butt off for ten years. I'm not a loafer, I'm not a jerk, I'm a baseball player."
Reggie Jackson,"October, that's when they pay off for playing ball."
Reggie Jackson,"I didn't come to New York to be a star, I brought my star with me."
Reggie Jackson,The greatest manager has a knack for making ballplayers think they are better than they think they are.
Reggie Jackson,The only reason I don't like playing in the World Series is I can't watch myself play.
Reggie Jackson,When you've played this game for ten years and gone to bat seven-thousand times and gotten two-thousand hits do you know what that really means? It means you've gone zero for five-thousand.
Reggie Jackson,"[Jackson gave a better explanation later, anyway.] He has a good move to the ball, ... He has the ability to pull the ball. He has the ability to hit the ball to leftfield. And he doesn't have enough power to get too far off the track."
Reggie Jackson,Fans don't boo nobodies.
Richard Jackson,"There's really not much of a precedent for such long-living reptiles, so we're basing our estimate on the fact that she really shows no signs of slowing down."
Richard Jackson,"I was very hungry today, ... I couldn't wait any longer to take this gold medal. This win means a lot for me. I want dedicate it to my uncle and my 3-month-old daughter."

Samuel L. Jackson,"I've been fortunate to be in films that are classic, that are going to be around."

Samuel L. Jackson,"Dictionaries are like watches; the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to be quite true."
Stephen Jackson,"It's hard when both of us are in foul trouble. If one of us is in foul trouble, the other can play but, when both of us are out, it's hard."
Stephen Jackson,"He's not here. We're not worrying about where he's going ... We've got a job to do. I think we're worrying about these 12, 15 guys coming out and playing together trying to gain some kind of relationship on and off the court so we can get this thing done the right way."
Stephen Jackson,I think everybody is at the point where they hate losing. It's 'When can we turn this thing around?' Nobody is going to lay down now that we're under .500. I think everybody is trying to stay positive. We've got to give ourselves a chance until everybody is back healthy.
Stephen Jackson,"I hate the fact that he's gone. I hate the way he left,"
Stephen Jackson,There's no excuse to lose to those guys. We know that we're a better team.
Stephen Jackson,"Once he starts playing basketball and continues to play how he's been playing, a lot of the negativity will soon blow away."
Stephen Jackson,"A lot of the guys who are wearing chains are my age and are black, ... I wore all my jewelry today to let it be known that I'm upset with it. It's one thing to have a dress code and it's another thing if you're attacking cultures."
Stephen Jackson,"He's got to take advantage of his opportunities. He knows that with J.O. out, he's going to be one of our big men that can score. We're going to rely on him a lot. He's doing real good."
Steven Jackson,let the league know the Rams are planning to do something this year.
Steven Jackson,It makes the region tournament kind of (unimportant).
Steven Jackson,"There's no hard feelings at all, ... If anything, we're closer than we were last year. He helps me with the little things my young eyes don't see yet or understand. Sometimes, the coaches can be too technical. Marshall can act as a player and a coach. He's seen it and done it all. That helps."
Steven Jackson,Nobody would let go of the cup. It was really cute.
Steven Jackson,"It's more laid-back. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing, but it's more of a comfort zone. Guys are smiling a lot more around here. I think everyone is starting over anew, a breath of fresh air."
Tim Jackson,"Now the overhead for running dealerships has grown so much, it costs a lot more to operate all those franchises. If you're lucky, you're making a 1.5 percent to 3 percent profit."
Tim Jackson,"Just considering where this program was a few years ago, they've made so much progress in so little time."

Wanda Jackson,"On that show, I did country and some rock, too, whatever record I had out at the time, I'd sing that."
Wanda Jackson,"But, we didn't have all the media that we do today."
Wanda Jackson,"So, it's nice to know that you've inspired someone to do their life's work."
Wanda Jackson,"As I go back and listen, the other girls weren't singing quite like I was."
Wanda Jackson,"Getting comments like that from even the young people at the shows who probably aren't singers, the girls who just tell me that I'm an inspiration to them, for one reason or another."
Wanda Jackson,"It would be nice to say that I planned all of this, that this was exactly what I'd planned, but it was just one of those things that happened."
Wanda Jackson,"I'd been working with Elvis, but I just recorded Country, so he, definitely, like you said, encouraged me to try it, but I didn't, right then."

Ellis Jacob,"Empire' s recent acquisition of 27 of our theatres located across Canada on September 30, 2005 makes adding the University 4 Cinema to their group a perfect match.

Dennis Jacobe,"A lot of business executives have a hard time getting away from the job and when you own a small business, the returns are very close."

Dennis Jacobe,"Increasing home prices and the ability of consumers to cash out their growing home equity has been a key driver of consumer spending over the past several years. As the housing market slows and housing prices stabilize, consumers are less likely to draw on their home equity, suggesting consumer spending will also decline."

Jane Jacobs,The port authority is the single greatest impediment to a revitalized waterfront.
Jane Jacobs,"Some men tend to cling to old intellectual excitements, just as some belles, when they are old ladies, still cling to the fashions and coiffures of their exciting youth."

Jane Jacobs,The point of cities is multiplicity of choice.
Jane Jacobs,Design is people.

Jay Jacobs,"We are very saddened by the passing of Mr. Billy. A true gentleman, he was a very compassionate and giving person who meant a great deal to this university.

Jay Jacobs,"They are only giving the impression of mounting a campaign for the top of the ticket, but are working much harder down ballot."

Jim Jacobs,"Youâ€™ll never know the joy, the happiness that these guys showed today,"

Marc Jacobs,"Happy, happy fashion - there is not much more to it than that,"

Marc Jacobs,"We're developing things, but I don't know what we'll go with for the show, so I don't like to talk about it."
Marc Jacobs,"That was a time when I did love music, I couldn't get enough of what was going on. Maybe it was Nirvana that brought me back. I guess it was a comfort because something that sounded so right - and non-commercial - had become so influential, so immediately."
Marc Jacobs,"Stephen can do anything! I was always intimidated by Stephen, because he was so quiet and he seemed very to-himself. But one thing plays off another."

Marc Jacobs,"Sometimes I miss hamburgers, I should say that. I miss the tuna pizzas at Mercer Kitchen."
Marc Jacobs,"Sofia is so active, and she made The Virgin Suicides, which I thought was great - all these things are inspiring to me, not in terms of creating a particular dress, but just in terms of knowing that there is this type of woman out there."
Marc Jacobs,It's quite nice to see that I didn't have to change who I was to reach two very different types of people.
Marc Jacobs,"It just seemed too weird to me. I don't know, maybe they were smoking a joint in the car downstairs from their parents' apartment. I had to go that far to put together a scenario of how they could have possibly recognized me."
Marc Jacobs,"I'd like to believe that the women who wear my clothes are not dressing for other people, that they're wearing what they like and what suits them. It's not a status thing."
Marc Jacobs,"I think of many people and no one as a muse. I love the way Sofia looks always, and I love the way Kim looks always. Fashion may be part of their world, but it's not their whole life. It's not everything."
Marc Jacobs,"I said, 'Okay, it's the year 2000, I'm getting a computer and a Palm Pilot.' I know how to check my e-mail, and I've listed some phone numbers on it. Half the time the battery has gone out so I can't use it."
Marc Jacobs,"I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent."
Marc Jacobs,I love to take things that are everyday and comforting and make them into the most luxurious things in the world.
Marc Jacobs,"I like spending time at home. In Paris, people drop by and have a bite to eat, or they drop by and watch Friends on TV. I take my dog to the office there, and I walk to work sometimes."
Marc Jacobs,"I don't think, 'Gee, I'd like to dress this person.' There was a picture in Us magazine. It was a jersey dress, and Courtney Love was wearing it. I have this thing about Courtney Love, this funny worship."
Marc Jacobs,"I always find it kind of embarrassing, kind of funny, and kind of exciting. In New York I'm recognized a lot, although nobody says anything. You know, they stare at you just a second too long. But in Paris it's not as commonplace to be recognized."
Marc Jacobs,"You don't have the same reaction to a girl walking around the street today in a nightgown and a vintage coat and sneakers, that you did six years ago."
Marc Jacobs,I wouldn't know how to find eBay on the computer if my life depended on it.
Arne Jacobsen,The primary factor is proportions.
Arne Jacobsen,"If a building becomes architecture, then it is art."
Arne Jacobsen,"Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty. They are like huge blocks, from which the air has been literally hewn out between the columns."
Arne Jacobsen,"Architecture tends to consume everything else, it has become one's entire life."
Hugh Jacobsen,The permanent power brokers of this city are the columnists.
Hugh Jacobsen,It is our art that has an opportunity to leave a footprint in the sand. They don't wrap fish in our work.
Hugh Jacobsen,"When you look at a city, it's like reading the hopes, aspirations and pride of everyone who built it."
Hugh Jacobsen,Washington is the only city in the world where you can go to a black-tie dinner and there at the foot of the table is a television set up to catch a press conference.
Peter Jacobsen,You could bury three elephants in that bunker. I think Nicklaus designed that bunker at night.
Peter Jacobsen,"I'm still not feeling that hot, but this event means so much for the kids, ... That's what it's really all about. For the kids, this is an important week."
Peter Jacobsen,"Loren is no surprise to me. He understands golf, and he knows he's not a power player. His short game is one of the best in all of golf."
Peter Jacobsen,"You see a lot of bad golf shots. I was playing with a guy once who took a wild swing with a 3-wood or something, and he hit the ground behind the ball and the divot flapped over the ball. He stood there looking down the fairway, and we were on the ground laughing because his ball was underneath the divot, and he didn't even know that he did not hit the ball."
Peter Jacobsen,"What makes this course fun is you hit all your shots, which is great. Plus it's a beautiful course in a tranquil setting."
Peter Jacobsen,"I have a good time every round, but today was really fun because the three of us are such good friends. I mean, sometimes when I play with him, I have to pretend like I like Stadler."
Peter Jacobsen,He's got the best swing on Tour. He's the best conditioned athlete -- I think he's surpassed Tiger -- and he seems to want it the most. The guy's relentless.
Michael Jacobson,"Canadian corrections are generally much more into rehabilitation in prisons and re-entry, ... They're not as punishment-oriented as we are. There is an emphasis on dealing with the underlying issues."
Michael Jacobson,"Listening to them, you would think they want studies done on humans."
Michael Jacobson,Their weight is front and center. And it's a far greater risk to their health than these artificial sweeteners.
Michael Jacobson,Our goal is to get it out of the food supply. There are healthier alternatives.
Michael Jacobson,Parents do bear the primary responsibility to ensure their kids eat a healthy diet. But the food industry is making their jobs nearly impossible. The industry needs to accept its fair share of the responsibility.
Michael Jacobson,Denmark has in effect banned partially hydrogenated oil; Canada is considering it. The United States ought to do the same.
Charles A. Jaffe,"Whales only get harpooned when they come to the surface, and turtles can only move forward when they stick their neck out, but investors face risk no matter what they do."
Charles A. Jaffe,"It's not your salary that makes you rich, it's your spending habits."
Charles A. Jaffe,"Stock prices have been quoted in fractions for two centuries, based on a system descended from Spanish pieces of eight. Each dollar was cut into eight bits worth 12.5 cents each."
Charles A. Jaffe,"For a lot of people, the weekly paycheck is 'take-home pay' because home is the only place they can afford to go with it."
Mick Jagger,"He twice asked me how much it was worth. He then said 'a thousand,' but I never replied,"
Mick Jagger,Anything worth doing is worth overdoing.
Mick Jagger,"He said, 'Don't worry about it Mick, we can sort it all out.' I said 'No, we can't.' He said, 'Come on, how much is it worth to you?' He seemed to want me to name a figure but I did not want to,"
Mick Jagger,I came into music just because I wanted the bread. It's true. I looked around and this seemed like the only way I was going to get the kind of bread I wanted.
Mick Jagger,"My mother has always been unhappy with what I do. She would rather I do something nicer, like be a bricklayer."
Mick Jagger,"I took her for granted, ... I played with her mind. I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life."
Mick Jagger,"The network television, they're always worried about how many times you're going curse on the air. They had another crisis this morning because they heard Aretha (Franklin) was going to strip when she was doing the Star Spangled Banner. But always it will all be worked out in the night. They needn't worry about it. Just calm down more and take life as it comes."
rahul jaiswal,the only things in this world which are never satisfied are WOMEN and GREED...
rahul jaiswal,man can satisfy his needs but not his greed
rahul jaiswal,fear of failure takes you nowhere
Arun Jaitley,He has embarrassed the government. By continuing as minister without portfolio he has earned himself a price for silence.
Arun Jaitley,"Without the presence of separatists on the round-table conference on Kashmir called by the Prime Minister, the entire exercise has turned futile."
Arun Jaitley,This (headcount) is a terrible mistake. The Government must stop this exercise immediately.
Arun Jaitley,"The Constitution has defined the office of profit; it is being interpreted by the judiciary and the Election Commission. Now, Parliament should define it."
Arun Jaitley,Mrs. Sonia Gandhi's party and her government was caught red-handed trying to subvert the constitution and parliament. She became a victim of her own conspiracy.
Arun Jaitley,"The government prevails on the CBI not to appeal. In the face of this attempt to scuttle the investigations, I think one's conscience should question as to the propriety of what the government and the (Congress) party have been doing and certainly not question the merits of the case."
Shahab Jalinoos,"We need to keep an eye on Japan's trade number. Also, the country's monetary policy is very loose, pointing toward a weaker yen."
Shahab Jalinoos,It will be seen as a green light for further currency strength.
Shahab Jalinoos,"(The) low-yielding yen is currently a global funding currency in a risk-loving environment, while Asian currencies are beneficiaries of risk-seeking global capital seeking returns in their asset markets."
Shahab Jalinoos,"There's lots of speculators betting that we're going to break the 8 yuan per dollar level soon. The authorities are very averse to speculators trying to make money, so they're making it hard for them."
Bob James,It's unfortunate the bears had to be put down out of the stupidity of the parent or parents involved. That's the worst aspect of this very unfortunate situation.
Bob James,"Even if one is thinking about elevator music, or Weather Channel music, there isn't any necessity for that music to be bad music. I remind people all the time that Mozart would probably sound great in an elevator. A lot of Mozart is very smooth to our ears, but that doesn't mean there isn't an amazing amount of subtlety there for the listener who digs deeper."
Bob James,Our board of directors wanted to honor Lawrence for his years of outstanding leadership and personal commitment to First Charter. His long association with Davidson College made it the perfect choice for this honor.
Bob James,We're just overwhelmed by the generosity of Great Falls citizens and those in the surrounding area. We're really pleased with how much money we've raised in this short amount of time.
D. James,Philosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human pursuits.
D. James,"Human kindness is like a defective tap, the first gush may be impressive but the stream soon dries up."
D. James,We English are good at forgiving our enemies; it releases us from the obligation of liking our friends.
Edgerrin James,"It could be a running game every week. Whenever they call my number, I'm ready."
Edgerrin James,"I take pride in whatever I do. If you told me to clean the room up, I'd clean it up real good."
Edgerrin James,look into the potential of a trade.
Edgerrin James,"Coach Dungy is doing a great job of keeping everything in perspective. He's not letting anybody get ahead. He won't let you talk about two weeks, three weeks down the road. Everything is strictly on the opponent we have the upcoming week."
Edgerrin James,"Peyton is happy doing it this way. And if he's happy, we've got to be happy."
Edgerrin James,It'll never be the last game. We're always together. We're going to meet up at the Hall of Fame.
Edgerrin James,"We have always stated our desire to do a long-term contract with the Colts, or work out a trade."
Edgerrin James,"Hopefully, he's the highest-paid coach out there. He deserves it."
Jennifer James,Gary has definitely instilled a lot of confidence in the team this year.
Jennifer James,Black mothers are deciding to stay home because they want to be there when their children come home after school. They want to take a hands-on approach to their children's upbringing. Some black stay-at-home mothers are also home-schooling because they are tired of low academic achievement and racism of all sorts in the schools.
Jennifer James,"Really, there have been conflicting reports about caffeine and whether it's good or bad for the body."
Kevin James,"Our objective is to make it easy for our customers and members to understand their benefit and get their prescriptions filled. Although some new enrollees may not have received their plan enrollment cards, we want to reassure them that Wal-Mart and SAM'S CLUB pharmacists are ready to help them right away by using the information on their plan enrollment forms."
Kevin James,"We want to make it easy for our customers and members to understand their benefit and get their prescriptions filled. Although some new enrollees may not have received their plan enrollment cards, we want to reassure them that Wal-Mart and SAM'S CLUB pharmacists are ready to help them right away by using the information on their plan enrollment forms. Our pharmacists can also help them by calling their drug plan administrators, or by contacting Medicare directly to confirm their enrollment."
Kevin James,I took a public speaking class in college and managed to make the class laugh a little bit.
Kevin James,I really wasn't a class clown.
Kevin James,"From there, I tried out for a community theatre play, joined an improv group... it all started opening up."
Kevin James,"Thanksgiving, man. Not a good day to be my pants."
Kevin James,There's no better feeling in the world than a warm pizza box on your lap.
Larry James,"We are proposing to develop 209 units of high quality, very affordable housing, including about 100 units of housing for formerly homeless individuals and 100 units of housing for low-income individuals."
Larry James,"We are proposing to develop 209 units of high-quality, very affordable housing, including about 100 units of housing for formerly homeless individuals and 100 units of housing for low-income individuals."
Larry James,We love fireplaces and this is our third one. It's also a garage-sale find.
Larry James,"This porch is the first place we hit when we come home at night. And where we like to stay all weekend. Sometimes, we never want to leave. And we don't plan to. The mortgage is almost paid off and this house is just perfect for us. We don't need anything bigger and the porch is nicer than anything we've seen on a new house."
Larry James,"Absolutely, with the growth we experienced last year, Lithia Toyota recognized the opportunity that exists here in Odessa."
Larry James,"It is the newest in what Toyota wants to go to in the future. It provides the nicest facilities, the greatest ease of getting in and out. All the dealerships will maintain the same image that Toyota wants."
LeBron James,"Everybody that came into the game attacked. We have some things to work on, but we got the win and that's all that matters."
LeBron James,"We didn't trust our teammates as much as we should have in the fourth quarter. If they are going to double-team me, I'm going to give up the ball. We're just not knocking down shots."
LeBron James,I was just showcasing my talent.
LeBron James,"Ask me to play. I'll play.Ask me to shoot. I'll shoot.Ask me to pass. I'll pass.Ask me to steal, block out, sacrifice, lead, dominate.ANYTHING.But it's not what you ask of me.It's what I ask of myself."
LeBron James,"Record-wise and going into the playoffs, we can't improve. I'm trying to get as much rest as I can. I don't want to try to force the action by playing on an ankle that's not 100 percent."
LeBron James,"We had some slow progress. It takes a few years to put up a building, even in Vegas."
LeBron James,"That's something we stressed more today in practice. (We'll) try to work inside out and, hopefully, that will open the lane a little more. Z has had a tough time in this series, but he hasn't had an opportunity to have a good time. We are going to get him the ball early in the game and see how it goes."
LeBron James,"I will have no problem coming to practice on time. The locker room is great, but we have to prove ourselves on the court."
LeBron James,"I put all the blame on myself. It was a bad performance by me, simple as that."
LeBron James,We were very excited to have 'Z' come in and play well. We missed him the other night. Tonight we executed and made the big shots.
LeBron James,"We've got that in mind. We know he has a lot of pressure on him being a rookie head coach. But we don't look at him as being a rookie coach. He seems like he's been doing it forever. He hasn't showed us any nervousness, but I know he will be before the game."
LeBron James,We don't want to get frustrated because it sticks in your mind too much. We have to work at it and see what we did wrong.
LeBron James,My knee kind of stiffened up on me. I didn't get as much lift as I wanted to.
LeBron James,"Working with all of these kids is great. It doesn't get any better than this, to come down and inspire kids who want to play the game of basketball and put smiles on their faces."
LeBron James,We're going to be hurt by it; he's one of our main guys. Someone else is going to have to pick it up.
LeBron James,"It's a great honor, but it's over and done."
LeBron James,"When you get to know some of the history of the game, Oscar Robertson is one of the names that pops up first."
LeBron James,"Yeah both of them. I mean I saw them live too, we were sitting watching the game , we were sitting in the training room, unbelievable. You know it shows us how far the women's game has come."
LeBron James,This is a job and we want to have fun. But it's a job and we should look like we're going to work.
LeBron James,All the hard work paid off. We're going to have a little fun tonight.
LeBron James,"When you're on fire like that, you just keep shooting them. We had great spacing on the floor."
LeBron James,It was crazy. I had a great time. It was a great experience.
LeBron James,The third quarter was a disaster. We weren't able to counter their attack. They made big shots and we weren't able to make any shots. We knew they would heat up but we didn't counter it.
LeBron James,It would have been a disaster if we couldn't win this game after being up by 25.
LeBron James,"The third quarter was a disaster. They put pressure on us and we couldn't make shots. If we want to be an elite team, we can't let teams come back like that."
LeBron James,"I was able to attack at times, draw the defense in and kick it out -- sometimes we made the shots, sometimes we didn't. We try to do the exact same things they try to do, only they do it about five times better right now."
LeBron James,"I went at four seconds, got to my comfort zone and made a tough shot. They were not going to get an opportunity to go down and make a shot on us."
LeBron James,"I got in a comfort level, and I took over the game. My guys, you know, were with me."
LeBron James,I told Coach to take me out. It's [the virus] still in there.
LeBron James,I don't feel too much pressure. I never have. I don't believe in pressure.
LeBron James,"So many great basketball players haven't won championships before, and they're still great. But that's what people judge you by."
LeBron James,"There is a lot of pressure put on me, but I don't put a lot of pressure on myself. I feel if I play my game, it will take care of itself."
LeBron James,"To all the positions, I just bring the determination to win. Me being an unselfish player, I think that can carry on to my teammates. When you have one of the best players on the court being unselfish, I think that transfers to the other players."
LeBron James,I am just happy to be part of the Nike family.
P. James,"There comes a time when every scientist, even God, has to write off an experiment."
P. James,Great literature cannot grow from a neglected or impoverished soil. Only if we actually tend or care will it transpire that every hundred years or so we might get a Middlemarch.
P. James,"Jealousy, he thought, was as physical as fear; the same dryness of the mouth, the thudding heart, the restlessness which destroyed appetite and peace."
P. James,"In 1930s mysteries, all sorts of motives were credible which aren't credible today, especially motives of preventing guilty sexual secrets from coming out. Nowadays, people sell their guilty sexual secrets."
P. James,What a child doesn't receive he can seldom later give.
P. James,It was one of those perfect English autumnal days which occur more frequently in memory than in life.
P. James,It was not... that she was unaware of the frayed and ragged edges of life. She would merely iron them out with a firm hand and neatly hem them down.
Ron James,"His system isn't as flexible as I would like it to be. Not that it doesn't work. Certainly, it does work."
Ron James,"We came out of the locker room flat, expecting to win and not willing to work to win. That first half was one of the worst offensive productions I've seen in eight years coaching in this league, and the second half wasn't much better."
Ron James,It's not just straight-line speed. He's got the agility and the quickness to go with it. His vision on the field is phenomenal. It just opens the playbook so much as a coach that I'm really looking forward to it.
Ron James,"What you have to guard against (in) a second start is that he's not trying to do too much. Of the two interceptions, one was a bad decision, and the other one was getting hit when he was throwing the football. I think those were isolated incidents and that he played well."
Ron James,"We have a lot of trust in Jason. The primary thing with Jason is, once we get the surrounding cast to be more consistent, he will be more consistent."
Ron James,"Most guys would've taken the rest of the season off. He was able to come back at the end of the season, and really he was anxious to get out there sooner. It's just the doctors wanted to make sure the healing process was complete."
Ron James,"At the end of the game we gave ourselves the opportunity to come back, but we turned the ball back over on downs. At that point, we could have turned it into a four-point game."
Ron James,"We're of the mind-set that if it does come down to the last play, we're going to make the play. You can't expect anything more than (being close at the end). We haven't been in that situation for a few weeks, and that's disappointing."
Ron James,This program is not new to Hill or the industrial world. It's actually a management system that starts at the employee level. You get them to take charge of their safety program and then all the way up through management you develop a level of accountability.
Ron James,"Obviously, our point totals that we're giving up aren't what we would expect defensively with some of the players that we have. But in all fairness, the turnovers are the big issue. Defensively, you're going to give up points when you're turning the ball over and giving the other team more opportunities (and) that's what we've been doing."
Ron James,"In arena football, the offense is a timing offense. If you give the quarterback time and vision, he should be able to move the ball properly."
Ron James,"We can't rest on losing a football game. If you notice our transactions, every time we lose a game, somebody either goes home or something gets changed. And I'm not waiting around. I'm going to be aggressive about this thing. I'm going to make sure we've got the right people playing."
Ron James,"Particularly defensively, we're starting to come into our own. In an Arena Football League game, when you're getting above four stops, you should be able to win every one of those games going away, and we did."
Ron James,Our execution in the second half was suspect in a couple areas.
Ron James,"Their pass rush did give us some issues in the first half, there's no doubt about that. But also, we knew they were going to give us tight coverage, and we didn't win a lot of the one-on-one battles you need to gain first downs and move the ball."
Ron James,"Erratic play. What we're trying to develop is consistency. We had that for two weeks, and we won. All of a sudden, we had a game where we needed consistent play and veteran leadership, and we didn't get either from those two guys when we needed it."
Ron James,Every game as far as team confidence is make or break for us. We've got to develop that type of a winning attitude.
Ron James,"The Wabash River - Indiana's largest body of water, containing the longest unimpeded waterway east of the Mississippi - constitutes a fascinating chapter in our nation's history. From the corridor's impact on the Hoosier landscape to its role in influencing the lives of the people who live along it, this is truly a story worth telling."
Selma James,"It is not women's fault if we are so tender. It is in the nature of the lives we live. And further, it would be a terrible catastrophe if men had to live men's lives and women's also. Which is precisely what has happened today -- to women."
Selma James,"Revolutions are notorious for allowing even non-participants -- even women! -- new scope for telling the truth since they are themselves such massive moments of truth, moments of such massive participation."
Selma James,"Caring for others is accomplished by a dazzling array of skills in an endless variety of circumstances. As well as cooking, shopping, cleaning, laundering, planting, tending, harvesting for others, women comfort and guide, nurse and teach, arrange and advise, discipline and encourage, fight for and pacify. Taxing and exhausting under any circumstances, this service work, this emotional housework, is done both outside and inside the home."
Tom James,This puts in place a number of consumer protections that give people an opportunity to take a break from the treadmill of debt they get locked into with payday loans.
Tom James,The truth of the matter is that this year will not be a good year for many of the big commodity traders -- innovation and new approaches are what matter going forward.
Tom James,The Muppets bring a wink and a smile to it. It's pizza after all - it's not something that serious. It's about fun and enjoyment.
Tom James,"Since we chose HSI as our point-of-sale solution over six years ago, the HSI level of service and responsiveness has been excellent. The HSI software was able to manage the transaction volume a property of our size generates into a single database solution, which has proved to be both reliable and efficient."
Tom James,"I believe oil majors are a real competitive force against investment banks, as the overlap in services being offered... in the energy sector becomes smaller and smaller."
Tom James,"Pizza is the perfect food for sharing, but add these 28 cheesy bites to the outside of the pizza and now you've got a combination that gives everyone what they love. Kids and adults alike won't be able to keep their hands off the irresistible, great-tasting bites. Just pull off a piece, and pop it into your mouth. Playing with your food has never been so deliciously fun."
Tom James,We're helping our customers 'pare' down dinnertime dilemmas by offering more choices to satisfy all tastes. Pizza is fun food for sharing and we think pairing the perfect deal for customers is a great way to allow everyone to get what they want.
William James,"Whenever you're in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude."
William James,The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.
William James,"Most people live, whether physically, intellectually or morally, in a very restricted circle of their potential being. They make very small use of their possible consciousness, and of their soul's resources in general, much like a man who, out of his whole bodily organism, should get into a habit of using and moving only his little finger."
William James,"If any organism fails to fulfill its potentialities, it becomes sick."
William James,Begin to be now what you will be hereafter.
William James,Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
William James,Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.
William James,Footnotes -- little dogs yapping at the heels of the text
William James,"Where quality is the thing sought after, the thing of supreme quality is cheap, whatever the price one has to pay for it."
William James,The sovereign cure for worry is prayer.
William James,Whatever universe a professor believes in must at any rate be a universe that lends itself to lengthy discourse. A universe definable in two sentences is something for which the professorial intellect has no use. No faith in anything of that cheap kind!
William James,Truth is what works.
William James,We never fully grasp the import of any true statement until we have a clear notion of what the opposite untrue statement would be.
William James,Why should we think upon things that are lovely? Because thinking determines life. It is a common habit to blame life upon the environment. Environment modifies life but does not govern life. The soul is stronger than its surroundings.
William James,Need and struggle are what excite and inspire us.
William James,Man lives for science as well as bread.
William James,It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all.
William James,The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.
William James,"I am done with great things and big plans, great institutions and big success. I am for those tiny, invisible loving human forces that work from individual to individual, creeping through the crannies of the world like so many rootlets, or like the capillary oozing of water, which, if given time, will rend the hardest monuments of pride."
William James,"What every genuine philosopher (every genuine man, in fact) craves most is praise -- although the philosophers generally call it ''recognition''!"
William James,"We have grown literally afraid to be poor. We despise anyone who elects to be poor in order to simplify and save his inner life. If he does not join the general scramble and pant with the money-making street, we deem him spiritless and lacking in ambition."
William James,"Compared to what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses power of various sorts which he habitually fails to use."
William James,"Whenever two people meet there are really six people present. There is each man as he sees himself, each man as the other person sees him, and each man as he really is."
William James,"I know that you, ladies and gentlemen, have a philosophy, each and all of you, and that the most interesting and important thing about you is the way in which it determines the perspective in your several worlds."
William James,To be a real philosopher all that is necessary is to hate some one else's type of thinking.
William James,"As there is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood by those who hear it, so reasonable arguments, challenges to magnanimity, and appeals to sympathy or justice, are folly when we are dealing with human crocodiles and boa-constrictors."
William James,Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second. Give your dreams all you've got and you'll be amazed at the energy that comes out of you.
William James,"If the grace of God miraculously operates, it probably operates through the subliminal door."
William James,"The union of the mathematician with the poet, fervor with measure, passion with correctness, this surely is the ideal"
William James,"If this life be not a real fight, in which something is eternally gained for the universe by success, it is no better than a game of private theatricals from which one may withdraw at will. But it feels like a real fight."
William James,"Everybody should do at least two things each day that he hates to do, just for practice."
William James,"Knowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a place in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another."
William James,A great many people think they are thinking when they are rearranging theirprejudices.
William James,"If you want a quality, act as if you already had it. Try the ''as if'' technique."
William James,"An idea, to be suggestive, must come to the individual with the force of revelation."
William James,"A new idea is first condemned as ridiculous and then dismissed as trivial, until finally, it becomes what everybody knows."
William James,I now perceive one immense omission in my psychology -- the deepest principle of Human Nature is the craving to be appreciated.
William James,Philosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human pursuits.
William James,A cowboy is a man with guts and a horse.
William James,Act in earnest and you will become earnest in all you do.
William James,I don't sing because I'm happy; I'm happy because I sing.
William James,"Happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply, to enjoy simply, to think freely, to risk life, to be needed. which give happiness. Thomas Jefferson We never enjoy perfect happiness; our most fortunate successes are mingled with sadness; some anxieties always perplex the reality of our satisfaction."
William James,"We must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible, as many useful actions as we can...in the acquisition of a new habit, we must take car to launch ourselves with as strong and decided initiative as possible. Never suffer an exception to occur till the new habit is securely rooted in your life."
William James,"Get but that peace of God which passeth understanding, and the questions of the understanding will cease from puzzling and pedantic scruples be at rest.."
William James,Genius... means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an inhabitual way.
William James,"Genius, in truth, means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way"
William James,We don't laugh because we're happy -- we're happy because we laugh.
William James,"Only necessity understood, and bondage to the highest is identical with true freedom."
William James,"Every man who possibly can should force himself to a holiday of a full month in a year, whether he feels like taking it or not."
William James,"Individuality is founded in feeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder strata of character, are the only places in the world in which we catch real fact in the making, and directly perceive how events happen, and how work is actually done."
William James,"Our faith is faith in someone else's faith, and in the greatest matters this is most the case."
William James,There is but one cause of human failure. And that is man's lack of faith in his true Self.
William James,"Failure, then, failure! so the world stamps us at every turn. We strew it with our blunders, our misdeeds, our lost opportunities, with all the memorials of our inadequacy to our vocation. And with what a damning emphasis does it then blot us out! No easy fine, no mere apology or formal expiation, will satisfy the world's demands, but every pound of flesh exacted is soaked with all its blood. The subtlest forms of suffering known to man are connected with the poisonous humiliations incidental to these results."
William James,"I am often confronted by the necessity of standing by one of my empirical selves and relinquishing the rest. Not that I would not. If I could, be... a great athlete and make a million a year, be a wit, a born -- vivant and a lady killer, as well as a philosopher, a philanthropist ... and saint. But the thing is simply impossible. The millionaire's work would run counter to the saint s; the bon-vivant and the philanthropist would trip each other up; the philosopher and the lady killer could not well keep house in the same tenement of clay. Such different characters may conceivably, at the outset of life. Be alike possible for a man. But to make any one of them actual, the rest must more of less be suppressed. So the seeker of his truest, strongest, deepest self must review the list carefully and pick out on which to stake his salvation. All other selves thereupon become unreal, but the fortunes of this self are real. Its failure are real failures, its triumphs real triumphs carrying shame and gladness with them."
William James,"An experience, perceptual or conceptual, must conform to reality in order to be true."
William James,"It is true that so far as wealth gives time for ideal ends and exercise to ideal energies, wealth is better than poverty and ought to be chosen. But wealth does this in only a portion of the actual cases. Elsewhere the desire to gain wealth and the fear to lose it are our chief breeders of cowardice and propagators of corruption. There must be thousands of conjunctures in which a wealth-bound man must be a slave, whilst a man for whom poverty has no terrors becomes a freeman."
William James,Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways: I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out. I will do at least two things I don't want to do.
William James,There can be no existence of evil as a force to the healthy-minded individual.
William James,"Evil is a disease; and worry over disease is itself an additional form of disease, which only adds to the original complaint."
William James,"The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be."
William James,Wisdom is learning what to overlook.
William James,Events are influenced by our very great desires.
William James,To give up pretensions is as blessed a relief as to get them ratified.
William James,"Much of what we call evil is due entirely to the way men take the phenomenon. It can so often be converted into a bracing and tonic good by a simple change of the sufferer's inner attitude from one of fear to one of fight; its string can so often depart and turn into a relish when, after vainly seeking to shun it, we agree to face about and bear it..."
William James,"Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different."
William James,"Our civilization is founded on the shambles, and every individual existence goes out in a lonely spasm of helpless agony. If you protest, my friend, wait till you arrive there yourself!"
William James,Men's activities are occupied into ways -- in grappling with external circumstances and in striving to set things at one in their own topsy-turvy mind.
William James,"When you have to make a choice and don't make it, that is in itself a choice."
William James,"Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there."
William James,The path to cheerfulness is to sit cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there.
William James,"No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no matter how good one's sentiments may be, if one has not taken advantage of every concrete opportunity to act, one's character may remain entirely unaffected for the better."
William James,"It is well for the world that in most of us, by the age of thirty, the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again."
William James,"It is wrong always, everywhere, and for everyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."
William James,"If you believe that feeling bad or worrying long enough will change a past or future event, then you are residing on another planet with a different reality system."
William James,"Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact."
William James,"Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact"
William James,"The belief in free-will is not in the least incompatible with the belief in Providence, provided you do not restrict the Providence to fulminating nothing but fatal decrees."
William James,Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible
William James,"It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult undertaking which, more than anything else, will determine its successful outcome."
William James,"It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome."
William James,The deepest principle of human nature is the craving to be appreciated.
William James,"Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their agreement, as falsity means their disagreement, with reality."
William James,"We, the lineal representatives of the successful enactors of one scene of slaughter after another, must, whatever more pacific virtues we may also possess, still carry about with us, ready at any moment to burst into flame, the smoldering and sinister traits of character by means of which they lived through so many massacres, harming others, but themselves unharmed."
William James,"How can the moribund old man reason back to himself the romance, the mystery, the imminence of great things with which our old earth tingled for him in the days when he was young and well?"
William James,Action may not bring happiness but there is no happiness without action.
William James,"If you want a trait, act as if you already have the trait."
William James,I will act as if what I do makes a difference.
William James,"Do something everyday for no other reason than you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test."
William James,"Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not."
William James,"The emotions aren't always immediately subject to reason, but they are always immediately subject to action"
William James,To spend life for something which outlasts it.
William James,Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.
William James,The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.
William James,Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second.
William James,"This life is worth living, we can say, since it is what we make it."
William James,The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.
William James,Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact.
William James,"If you want a quality, act as if you already had it."
William James,"If you care enough for a result, you will most certainly attain it."
William James,Belief creates the actual fact.
William James,"Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing, moving at different speeds. A sense of humor is just common sense, dancing."
William James,"The world we see that seems so insane is the result of a belief system that is not working. To perceive the world differently, we must be willing to change our belief system, let the past slip away, expand our sense of now, and dissolve the fear in our minds."
Anna Jameson,The only competition worthy a wise man is with himself
Anna Jameson,A man may be as much a fool from the want of sensibility as the want of sense.
Anna Jameson,Trust in my affection for you.
Fredric Jameson,The more worrying feature of the new global corporate structures is their capacity to devastate national labour markets by transferring their operations to cheaper locations overseas.
Fredric Jameson,"So is it always nationalist to resist US globalization? The US thinks it is, and wants you to agree; and, moreover, to consider US interests as being universal ones."
Fredric Jameson,"Often, these downplay the power of cultural imperialism - in that sense, playing the game of US interests - by reassuring us that the global success of American mass culture is not as bad as all that."
Fredric Jameson,"For when we talk about the spreading power and influence of globalization, aren't we really referring to the spreading economic and military might of the US?"
Fredric Jameson,"And this fear that US models are replacing everything else now spills over from the sphere of culture into our two remaining categories: for this process is clearly, at one level, the result of economic domination - of local cultural industries closed down by American rivals."
Fredric Jameson,"A further point is that, little by little, in the current universe, everything is slowly being named; nor does this have anything to do with the older Aristotelian universals in which the idea of a chair subsumes all its individual manifestations."
Fredric Jameson,"The standardization of world culture, with local popular or traditional forms driven out or dumbed down to make way for American television, American music, food, clothes and films, has been seen by many as the very heart of globalization."
Jenna Jameson,Lots of women tell me I'm their idol.
Jenna Jameson,you can actually become a role model for women.
Jenna Jameson,"We look forward to running a great, clean club for adults to enjoy."
Jenna Jameson,A lot of things that happened [in the past] would have broken anybody else. I was able to survive. That's all that really matters.
Jenna Jameson,"The contract girls will be lending their beautiful assets to set us apart in the wireless market, ... I'm really jazzed that with our proven management team and extensive content library, jennawireless.com will be #1 in this exciting new technology space."
Jenna Jameson,"I always look at both sides and totally understand their fears of the unknown, ... Whenever there is any type of adult stigma surrounding the fear, the worst is always assumed."
Jenna Jameson,"My heart is a gypsy - continuously searching for a home, fighting within itself, wondering whether it is weak or even right for that matter to be searching in the first place. Lonliness is what it feels like..."
Antawn Jamison,"He always brings his 'A' game against us. He plays well every night, but he has had some spectacular games against the Wizards."
Antawn Jamison,"I know a lot of people will say we're in the entertainment industry, but we represent franchises that are sometimes among the biggest businesses in that city. I'm fine with a jacket and shirt with a collar and pants that aren't jeans. We're professionals and we should be putting forth a professional image. I don't see what the problem is."
Antawn Jamison,"The one thing that could make this thing go in the right direction is to get a couple games early. We don't want to do like we did the first road trip when we lost the first couple, and were scratching and clawing and putting pressure on ourselves."
Antawn Jamison,"I've never felt like this before. I've never felt this comfortable shooting them. Coach [Eddie Jordan] has been comfortable letting me shoot them, and he's been giving me the green light."
Gerald Jampolsky,"Join us, share your vision, and help us build a stronger network of awareness. You will come away inspired, and connected to a global network of people making a difference in their own lives, in their communities, and in the world. The conference will change your life,"
Gerald Jampolsky,The best way to navigate through life is to give up all of our controls.
Gerald Jampolsky,You can be right or you can be happy.
Gerald Jampolsky,I can have peace of mind only when I forgive rather than judge.
Gerald Jampolsky,Through our willingness to help others we can learn to be happy rather than depressed.
Gerald Jampolsky,A truly creative person rids him or herself of all self-imposed limitations.
Gerald Jampolsky,Other people do not have to change for us to experience peace of mind.
Gerald Jampolsky,Peace of mind comes from not wanting to change others.
Gerald Jampolsky,"Inner peace can be reached only when we practice forgiveness. Forgiveness is letting go of the past, and is therefore the means for correcting our misperceptions."
Gerald Jampolsky,"When I am able to resist the temptation to judge others, I can see them as teachers of forgiveness in my life, reminding me that I can only have peace of mind when I forgive rather than judge."
Gerald Jampolsky,"Love is the total absence of fear. Love asks no questions. Its natural state is one of extension and expansion, not comparison and measurement."
Gerald Jampolsky,Forgiveness means letting go of the past.
Elizabeth Janeway,Such simplicity cannot be taught. But it can be denied and lost.
Elizabeth Janeway,"It seems to me highly improbable that women are going to realize their human potential without alienating men - some men, anyway"
Elizabeth Janeway,"As long as mixed grills and combination salads are popular, anthologies will undoubtedly continue in favor."
Elizabeth Janeway,"The Goddamn human race deserves itself, and as far as I'm concerned it can have it."
Elizabeth Janeway,"Growing up human is uniquely a matter of social relations rather than biology. What we learn from connections within the family takes the place of instincts that program the behavior of animals; which raises the question, how good are these connections?"
Elizabeth Janeway,"Like their personal lives, women's history is fragmented, interrupted; a shadow history of human beings whose existence has been shaped by the efforts and the demands of others."
Elizabeth Janeway,Power is the ability not to have to please.
Kip Janvrin,It was a glorified training meet. We wanted to make progress and we did.
Kip Janvrin,Steven is our top thrower. He did well and started his year off well. He's one of our leaders.
Kip Janvrin,"Overall, this meet was good to reaffirm the kids that we could potentially have a good team this year if we continue to work. We've got several All-Americans on this team that I think have improved over last year."
Kip Janvrin,"I was pleased with the results from this meet. Overall, it was good for our kids to begin competition. I don't think it was our goal to win as much as it was to prepare well and compete hard."
Kip Janvrin,"It will be a good way to get our feet wet. We are definitely going to see some tough competition, but we have prepared well in practice, and I think we are going to see that in the performance."
Kip Janvrin,"It will be nice for our kids to sleep in their own bed and race on their own track. More than anything, it will be good for our kids to gain some experience and maybe improve on some things."
Lee Janzen,"I know a lot of guys love it, but I couldn't care if I ever played it again. And I've won here."
Lee Janzen,Part of his learning process is helping other guys.
Lee Janzen,"The last round of the British Open, (Woods) was flawless. That's the sort of thing we kind of fear. If he plays like that, he's impossible to beat."
Lee Janzen,Just another example. We see it week after week. The guys who hit it 290 â€” and that's not chopped liver â€” are getting penalized for not being able to hit it 320.
Rudy Jaramillo,"The power is there, the only question was his health. But he's definitely showing the power and the bat speed that he's shown in the past."
Rudy Jaramillo,I have a lot of faith. That's the main thing why I'm not scared at all.
Rudy Jaramillo,"Some things happen, and this will make me mentally stronger. I've always had a lot of faith in God and am a positive person. This will make me appreciate each day even more. Baseball is my passion, and I want to get back to these kids as soon as I can."
Rudy Jaramillo,Mark has got a lot of ability. He's learning more about himself and more about the pitchers in the American League. He's still growing as a player and doing the things that will enable him to reach his full potential.
Steve Jarding,"If you follow through on when he was Navy secretary, his record of appointing women to high-level positions at the Department of the Navy was unprecedented."
Steve Jarding,Victory makes all your ideas look smarter.
Steve Jarding,"This is a unique individual whose base is very strong. In this year of corruption in Washington, being a voice from the outside is a good position to be in."
Dale Jarrett,"You know, driver-crew chief relationships, if you get six good years, that is longer than a lot of marriages, ... We do have a huge amount of respect for each other, and Todd has brought back a leadership that we haven't seen since he left, really."
Dale Jarrett,There's no doubt that it's a totally different type of racing now. It's a little more in-your-face and stand your ground. You have to do that.
Dale Jarrett,"I know you're supposed to slow down, and I know that I saw the caution lights, but I was just making sure."
Dale Jarrett,"We have a lot of work to do. We just can't find anything that helps these cars in the front. Elliott (Sadler, his teammate) and I have been having the same problems each week. We really have our work cut out for us."
Roni Java,"We regret that there was any misunderstanding. Hopefully, this will get us on the road to resolution."
Roni Java,Merced is making good progress.
Roni Java,These Christmas tree recycling programs have really taken off in the last 15 years.
Ron Jaworski,"[Bledsoe may be considered old school, but it is the school most quarterbacks attend, including Manning.] They're almost clones, ... They're that similar in their style and how they play the game. I don't think the game has changed from the time Drew was drafted until Eli was drafted."
Ron Jaworski,"[The problem I'm having with Harrington is he should be beyond some of the mistakes he continues to make in his fourth season. He has thrown 1,564 passes, but if the light bulb has gone on, it isn't burning brightly.] I thought I really liked him coming out, ... I saw an upside. But I don't see the growth you like to see in a young quarterback, decision-making wise and throwing wise."
Ron Jaworski,"To lead the league in attendance is mind-boggling. I know as well as anyone, you've got to win in Philadelphia and that's our goal. You've got to start winning."
Ron Jaworski,I know how much the coach puts into it. Everybody in Kansas City understands the work ethic of the man. You just don't walk away from that and not take a piece of it with you.
Ron Jaworski,"I just hope that's enough, ... because the Eagles have a lot of things working against them now, too."
Ron Jaworski,It's as hard as I've ever seen it on anybody.
Ron Jaworski,"I thought I really liked him coming out. I saw an upside. But I don't see the growth you like to see in a young quarterback, decision-making-wise and throwing-wise."
Ron Jaworski,"When you're involved in the National Football League, the competitiveness never leaves you,"
Ron Jaworski,I think A.J. is a little slower in processing information. Gus has more experience and playing time; he's a little quicker at reading defenses and getting the ball out. But A.J. has all the tools to assimilate more as time goes on.
Ron Jaworski,"People may want to call it the Moss factor or whatever they want, but there is no doubt in my film study, the vertical stretch that Randy brought that offense is sorely missed right now. When I look at the tape from last year with Moss in that lineup, you've got safeties sitting back there 18, 19, 20 yards, sometimes not even on the screen (of the coaching tape)."
Ron Jaworski,"He only had to make one or two plays a game, and he could play to that defense. Not to denigrate the job he did there, because he did a terrific job."
Ron Jaworski,"In every meeting I've ever been in, the quarterbacks and receivers sit with each other and the quarterbacks coach is constantly directing things at those guys and they're constantly going over details,"
Ron Jaworski,"Positive thinking is the key to success in business, education, pro football, anything that you can mention. I go out there thinking that I'm going to complete every pass."
Sanath Jayasuriya,Not playing test cricket will help me keep fit and allow me to play on until next year's World Cup. I will definitely retire from all cricket after that tournament.
Sanath Jayasuriya,My message to youngsters is to never compromise with hard work.
Sanath Jayasuriya,It was good to see the boys playing good cricket and it was really good for the confidence of the boys before we play Australia.
Mahela Jayawardene,"This is going to be a tough tour but a great opportunity for us to learn, both as a team and also as individuals."
Mahela Jayawardene,"There is a good probability him making into the XI. He batted really well, he has done his fitness test and the fielding schedules as well."
Mahela Jayawardene,There are no fears out there. There is nothing we cannot handle. It is just how we prepare ourselves mentally and physically and what we want to do.
Mahela Jayawardene,"Marvin and I have been a partnership for quite some time now, so our thinking is in the same direction. It is a temporary thing for me to take the team."
Mahela Jayawardene,We played bad cricket yesterday and that one hour was really disappointing.
Mahela Jayawardene,He has taken 580-odd wickets in Test cricket. So every team will want to have him in the side. His presence here for the Test is of course a big encouragement for us.
Mahela Jayawardene,We want to win everything we play. So we are here for win with a high confidence.
Mahela Jayawardene,I thought our team showed a lot of character in coming back so strongly after the setback in the second match. We had decided to keep up the run-rate and bat them out of the match.
Mahela Jayawardene,"We shouldn't take anything away from him, he batted really well - to bat for eight hours and nearly 400 balls is a magnificent effort."
Michaelle Jean,I once was a little girl who saw her father strike her mother. My younger sister and I lived with the anguish that all children feel when the family unit breaks down.
Michaelle Jean,I think that it's a compliment.
Michaelle Jean,"Here in Toronto, the Canadian model is showcased for the world to see. It is an achievement that has eluded many societies and one that we Canadians sometimes take for granted, and that is unfortunate."
Wyclef Jean,"All that violence in the world, we need to stop that."
Wyclef Jean,"When you're sleeping or getting up to go to school, that's when we're just leaving the studio, and we'll be gone for three hours and then come back and be working another 15 to 20 hours."
Wyclef Jean,What I'm trying to do is break the genre from what is rap and what is music.
Wyclef Jean,"The way that we're moving forward toward music, it's all about using music together. We have hip-hop, we have rock, (but) all the kids now, we all listen to the same thing. If you're listening to rock, you're listening to rap."
Wyclef Jean,"For everybody who lost somebody out there and stuff, when you need therapy, music is the best way."
Wyclef Jean,"I think it's cool to do stuff in a different language. Basically, I learned English through listening to rap. A lot of people think it's funny. But it's true; I used to try to get the accents."
Wyclef Jean,I'm 27 years old. I'm going to go into Hollywood really arrogant. I'll be breaking a lot of rules. It's going to be hot.
Wyclef Jean,"I'm like Cab Calloway: I love the entertainment, and I've loved entertaining people ever since I was little."
Wyclef Jean,"It's ike being in college and being undecided about your major. As soon as you choose your major, you focus in on it."
Wyclef Jean,"They said somehow I used to run out of the house and while the Carnival's passing, with no clothes on, and I'm jigging my body, they used to come and pull me in. They said that ever since I was little, I always had the rhythm in me."
Wyclef Jean,"Her beauty lies in her work. She looks the most beautiful in the field -- natural, no makeup, nothing."
Wyclef Jean,I think the greatest thing about America is the American dream. America allows you take that dream and bring it back to your country and help you inspire more people.
Wyclef Jean,I think the greatest thing about America is the American dream.
Wyclef Jean,"Right now, we're working on a script for my life story and two kids coming from Haiti to America. One turns out to be a musician, one is a gangster. That's all I can say."
Wyclef Jean,"We're living in the modern age now. I call it the Year of the Matrix. Back in the day, you had these mixed-tape circuits where if you wanted to get (unreleased) music to your fans, you could go through DJs. Now all our fans have to do is go to their phones, and they'll be the first ones to hear something. And we're not talking about a ring tone here. We're talking about downloading a whole song, or a video."
Wyclef Jean,"I do music for the love of it, and I've been doing it from a very young age: about 11."
Wyclef Jean,"When you're in the studio at a young age, you're not aware that there's a union where you can hire musicians. So you have all of this equipment and you just learn how to play it yourself."
Richard Jefferson,It's tough to put it into words. And that's something that's rare for me to say.
Richard Jefferson,"The ball was moving, to tell you the truth. It was drive, drive, pass, pass and then somebody had an open shot and we just knocked them down."
Richard Jefferson,"We've shown improvement and I believe our schedule gets a little more favorable. If we keep everybody healthy, I believe we can (win 50). I think we're going to be a team that makes a real good push. Sometimes, people forget about what we can do."
Richard Jefferson,"Coming into this series, he wasn't really known as a defensive stopper. But he's been coming in and giving us unbelievable minutes on Stevie Jackson. He's been in the passing lanes. He's been a great defender for us."
Richard Jefferson,"I was teasing him in the guts of the game. Hey, are you going to make a shot? That's the way we are as a group. We have so much confidence in each other, there is no need to get on anybody."
Richard Jefferson,"I have a lot of faith in my teammates and coaching staff. There are no major moves. We'll find a way. Somehow, someway, things will come up roses for us."
Richard Jefferson,Just because he had an off night when all eyes were on our team doesn't mean that we have to question what we do and what we did to get here.
Richard Jefferson,"He received criticism from the media, he received criticism from different people, but it wasn't from anyone in this locker room. It wasn't from anyone in the coaching staff, because we believed in him and believed that he had the right intent."
Richard Jefferson,"Hey, we've been playing the same way the whole year and we've been successful. I believe in my teammates. I believe in my coaching staff. We've been playing one way, all year long."
Richard Jefferson,"I'm insanely optimistic. For odd, weird reasons, things always work out."
Richard Jefferson,I try to be as efficient as possible.
Richard Jefferson,Businessmen... were not born chief executives. They were often people first.
Richard Jefferson,Do we get an advantage if we're 3-1? Mental advantage my [butt]. I'd rather give them the mental advantage and we have home-court.
Richard Jefferson,We knew we had the ability to beat good teams on their floor. So we knew if we could just establish some consistency (at home) we could string together some wins.
Richard Jefferson,Any team coming in has the ability to beat us.
Richard Jefferson,"He understands what the coaches want, understands different people's game and he really understands his own ability. He's a lot more aggressive."

Thomas Jefferson,The glow of one warm thought is to me worth more than money.
Thomas Jefferson,"Laws that forbid the carrying of arms...disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes...Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."
Thomas Jefferson,Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.
Thomas Jefferson,Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.
Thomas Jefferson,"Leave all the afternoon for exercise and recreation, which are as necessary as reading. I will rather say more necessary because health is worth more than learning."
Thomas Jefferson,How much pain worries have cost us that have never happened?

Thomas Jefferson,We rarely repent of having eaten too little.
Thomas Jefferson,Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Thomas Jefferson,"Sound principles will not justify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which might not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered by that treasure"
Thomas Jefferson,"In matters of principals, stand like a rock; in matters of taste, swim with the current."
Thomas Jefferson,"While wading through the whimsies, the puerilities, and unintelligible jargon of this work [Plato's Republic], I laid it down often to ask myself how it could have been that the world should have so long consented to give reputation to such nonsense as this?"
Thomas Jefferson,"Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms [of government] those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny."
Thomas Jefferson,To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.

Thomas Jefferson,"Without society, and a society to our taste, men are never contented"

Thomas Jefferson,"Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms (of government) those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny"

Thomas Jefferson,"I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground that 'all powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people.'

Thomas Jefferson,"Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law,' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the right of an individual."

Jim Jeffords,"I fear that this bill, without the sufficient resources, will merely highlight our shortcomings. I fear it will not provide the assistance, both financial and technical, that schools will need to meet the goals of having every student meet their full academic potential."
Jim Jeffords,"After careful review, I have concluded that there was such a failure that this was an intentional an illegal attempt to circumvent the law and that it was designed to benefit big energy companies at the expense of the public health."
Jim Jeffords,"This policy breaks that commitment, ... And it fails to acknowledge that we are responsible for emitting 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gasses. Under this policy our share would continue to grow."
Jim Jeffords,"I am not precluding the hope and belief that when the president fully understands what this means and what my amendment would mean, that we will hopefully have a change in attitude and that my goal is the same as John Breaux's. I would like to see us vote out a budget by 90 votes ... not just hanging on by a vote or two."
Brian Jenkins,"I was looking for a space heater today, which I found, but a lot of the other stuff I bought isn't stuff that I really need."

Brian Jenkins,"What we've learned from the British experience is that if people are admonished to notify authorities of suspicious activity or abandoned parcels, if you then readily have communications systems for them to do that -- telephones that are marked -- and you provide rapid response when reports are made, then in effect you have closed the loop."
Brian Jenkins,"This demonstrates their resolve and courage to impact us, to create fear. But it also is aimed at their own audience, their own constituents to demonstrate their prowess to their own warrior subculture."
Brian Jenkins,"Get the plane on the ground. Let the authorities deal with the hijackers. As in a mugging, the thing you don't want to do is grab the pistol out of the mugger's hand. Give the mugger your wallet. In a hijacking the proper thing to do is sit tight and not challenge the hijackers,"

Brian Jenkins,"The Internet gives them direct access. It even allows them to segment their audiences so they can communicate with potential recruits, with those who are already in the organization, and with broader sympathetic audiences as well as their enemy. They can do ... modern marketing and these communications have enabled them to be very, very effective and they've been increasingly adept in exploiting this. I don't think we have yet fully fathomed the sophistication of their communication strategy."

Dan Jenkins,"College football is the sport where 80, 000 people show up to watch a Poll Bowl, half of them wearing one color, half of them wearing another color. This is important because 80, 000 people wearing any color never filled a stadium to watch a math quiz."
Dan Jenkins,"I married a homecoming queen, which means I know as much about college football as the next person, as long as the next person is not Darrell Royal or Bear Bryant. As the NFF Historian, I'll have a new platform to indulge my passion for the most emotional, colorful and hysterical game ever developed by mankind and Walter Camp."

Jason Jennings,"Back when we went to the four-man rotation (in 2004), I said the more you do something, the better you get at it, whether you're pitching, swinging a golf club, whatever. Maybe we can get stronger and get off to a better start."
Jason Jennings,He's still Barry Bonds. He can get hot quickly and go 10-for-10 and hit a few home runs. He hit a lot this spring. He could come in here and get hot.
Jason Jennings,"Pitching can be hard at times, but when you think about it, it's very simple. I've thrown a million pitches in my life, so I shouldn't be out there making sure my leg kick goes here, my arm comes here. I should just be out there nice and slow and relaxed and letting my arm go to work."
Jason Jennings,I'm going to win 90 percent of my games pitching like that.

Peter Jennings,"I can't imagine that we would do anything radical about our coverage in the immediate future. The story has a whole new dimension with this measure of sovereignty, which is going to make this a really interesting story between now and the election."
Peter Jennings,"When you think about the events that we've been through, from the fall of the Berlin Wall to, I guess you'd say, 9/11 being the culmination at the end of that, of that scope, what extraordinary changes there have been."

Luke Jensen,"Yesterday I was on the court with Roger Federer, so I can bring something like that or a conversation I had with him to this clinic. I communicate that to players here in Montana and then they're a little bit closer to the top of the game and what big time players are thinking about what it takes to become a better tennis player."

Jeffrey Joerres,"The labor markets in North America have been incredibly stable and, as is so often the case, the Mexican labor market is moving in tandem with its northern neighbor.

Alan Johnson,"Rather than rest being the best remedy for back pain, for example, research now shows it can actually delay recovery and make things worse. Advising patients to stay active can help them get back to work and on with their life."
Alan Johnson,"ACOA has come under some harsh criticism. By putting it under the watchful eye of a progressive MP like Mr. MacKay, we can only be confident about its continuation."
Alan Johnson,Call this Son of Herbie. It sounds like a pretty good idea. There's not usually a lot of creativity in this space.
Alan Johnson,"Comfort level is a big deal. You don't have to get to know anybody new or learn personalities. Plus, you already know what he's going to tell you."
Alan Johnson,Corporate America has not signaled that they are not going to pay themselves.

Alan Johnson,"Often a patient will think they want a sicknote, when the best advice a critical friend can give might not meet their initial expectations,"
Alan Johnson,The case raises important issues that affect the public's right to know and the government's ability to use the attorney-client privilege as a shield to deny access to documents that reflect its operations at the highest levels.
Amy Johnson,"This is wonderful because there is math correlation, science correlation and history correlation."
Amy Johnson,"I can't imagine actually singing on this show like I did on 'Felicity,' but it would be kind of funny."
Amy Johnson,My mom taught me to go after my dreams. I have this faith in myself that I must have gotten from her.
Amy Johnson,The point is to be OK with your stuttering - and meet adults who stutter who are doctors and lawyers and engineers.
Amy Johnson,"I certainly don't think the hospital is a hostile environment for anyone working here or delivering babies here. We have births all the time with minimal intervention. It is a very homey environment, and we respond to all the individual patients' needs."
Angela Johnson,See all us? We neighbors. We got to stick together.
Angela Johnson,We ran a fair program before. But the standard of excellence is higher. The quality is higher.
Angela Johnson,"It's important to travel and feel, ... It's important to leave your environment to see how other people live."
Barbara Johnson,No one likes change but babies in diapers.
Barbara Johnson,Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved.

Barbara Johnson,Patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears.
Brandon Johnson,"I was always the kid in school that teachers were getting after to be quiet. My report card had math, A, reading, A, spelling, A, science, A, conduct, F. I was always talking to somebody. They would always take me and put me over in a corner by myself."
Brandon Johnson,I thought we played hard at times but our execution was not very good. We felt that they were bigger but I thought we were faster. They turned it in to a half court game and they beat us. We just didn't make the plays we needed to make in order to win the game.
Brandon Johnson,"I guess it's something that has kind of developed, ... By the time the game starts, coach Reggie and I have studied the opponent so much I know the percentages of what a team will do on third down or second down or out of a certain formation. When you look at football scientifically and probabilities you can guess right. And sometimes it's just common sense. When they've got three or four guys over here and one over there, you can guess the ball is going over there."
Brian Johnson,"It's all stainless steel, which is high-end work."
Brian Johnson,"I think his work ethic is unmatched. When he first came into the league he was more of a winger who would just get forward, get forward and get forward, and never come back. I think he's really developed a lot of defensive abilities."
Brian Johnson,"It's been a long time coming and I'm glad the school put financial resources up to do this. We also appreciate what Mr. Krause so generously donated. Without his generous donation, I don't think we could have done it."
Brian Johnson,"You need to lean forward, from the ankles more. It's like you're running with your brakes on."
Brian Johnson,"It won't be that much different than running into the top of the fence. That would pack quite a wallop. With track, kids will be warned, so they know it's coming."
Brian Johnson,"The auto industry is a relatively unattractive place to allocate capital. So the bottom line is, if you're running a business that can span two or three industrial sectors, there are more attractive sectors to be in."
Brian Johnson,"It's embarrassing and it does highlight the fact that there seem to be some real operational risk issues in NAB. Every time they write a loan, they code what sector it should be and they've been misallocating some of those codes."
Brian Johnson,The banks are expensive compared to the rest of the local market and they're expensive compared with overseas banks.
Brian Johnson,"That's huge. Now we're in the thick of the race, ... There's so much parity in this conference, it would be hard for a team to sweep right through it like we did last year."
Brian Johnson,"I brought a cooler, comforter, pillow and snacks, ... I watched the game last night, and decided I'd get here as soon as possible. It's been 12 years since we've been in the playoffs, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity."
Brian Johnson,"As a coach, I can really appreciate having a group of kids like this. There are a lot of kids out there who are obsessed by distance, and all they want to do is pound their drivers. Our kids aren't like that. They understand the game. They get it. They realize that the goal is to get the ball in the hole, and the best way to do that is to practice your iron shots, your wedges, your chipping and your putting. If you develop those skills to a high degree, you're going to beat the bombers most of the time."
Brian Johnson,"These kids never quit. That was the difference from a couple of our losses. Once they got down, they would give up the game. But at the end tonight, they never stopped going hard, and they took over at the end."
Brian Johnson,You give him a job and he's going to do it.
Brian Johnson,"We hope that other towns can see this being done. If they see it doesn't take that long, we might get everybody a home."
Brian Johnson,"They don't have a lot of height, but they have a lot of heart."
Brian Johnson,Anyone who assumes any kind of rebound for GM assumes some level of capacity reduction and health-care cuts. It's been a bit surprising they didn't have a report already.
Brian Johnson,"What that means is higher growth, captive clients and bigger synergies. And the more you diversify, the less risk there is."
Brian Johnson,It's a God thing. He's led us every step of the way through this and made it possible.
Brian Johnson,"I don't think about leaving anymore â€” I love it too much here. But I have so many friends who are leaving. Not because they want to, but because the city is not taking care of them. The people making the decisions are the ones who held onto the steel industry for too long. They don't want to let go of how Pittsburgh used to be."
Brian Johnson,That's stuff you can't do if you want to win football games.
Brian Johnson,I heard dogs barking and calves hollering. One of the dogs was at least part pit bull.
Brian Johnson,"In any open society, there is going to be a continuum between freedom and security, and I think any debate about how to strike that balance is a good debate, ... I do believe the Patriot Act strikes a good balance, but I'm also a Libertarian at heart. I want to hear good arguments on both sides."
Brian Johnson,It's a step forward in the culture of Ford. Whether it translates into increased profits remains to be seen.
Brian Johnson,There were those saying they had difficulty acclimating themselves to the community. With this first event they already feel more comfortable.
Brian Johnson,We had no other choice. There's good people in the world. This really is all we have. We have friends here. We have our lives here.
Brian Johnson,The combination of double-digit housing loan growth and above average business loan growth supports St.George's earnings outlook.
Brian Johnson,He's a man amongst boys.
Brian Johnson,"They are bringing more horsepower to fix North America. His background seems to be in line with what is needed in the U.S., which is getting people off the payroll."
Brian Johnson,It does have some ability to create incremental value by getting to non-GM customers and dealers.
Brian Johnson,We see this as a test of their ability to face reality.
Calvin Johnson,He told us it'd be a great opportunity for us. And it turned out it was.
Calvin Johnson,"We still need to play fundamental football, and we must rise to the occasion if nothing else."
Calvin Johnson,"I am here to put out a positive athlete,"
Carl Johnson,"Herbert has been an inspiration to us, ... It took courage for Herbert to do what he has done and to experience what Herbert has experienced."
Carl Johnson,"We feel we have a sound plan in place that will satisfy our vendors and continue moving the company forward,"
Carl Johnson,The doors are always open here for a lot of community groups.
Carl Johnson,"Yeah, I just want to enjoy it. You know they aren't giving the money to charity. That's why they get busted."
Chad Johnson,"There's no need for me to guarantee a victory. No point, ... We're 7-2. We are one of the best teams in the NFL right now. So there's no need for me to go out on a limb like that."
Chad Johnson,There's no need for me to guarantee a victory. No point. We're 7-2. We are one of the best teams in the NFL right now. So there's no need for me to go out on a limb like that.
Chad Johnson,"We're playing Pittsburgh, it's not rocket science. Our offense is going to have to execute and we're going to have to do what we do. Throw it all over the place."
Chad Johnson,"It was an honor and a pleasure,"
Chad Johnson,"Peyton has the freedom to do that when he sees something he doesn't like, ... That's something we've done without having to go to our coaches."
Chad Johnson,"You're hurting my feelings right now, seriously. Is he down?"
Chad Johnson,He took it. That could have made the Hall of Fame of all lists. That was a good one.
Chad Johnson,"You're out there on an island all by yourself. All eyes are on you. Everything is magnified. All mistakes are seen. It's you. It's the position now, the position to play."
Chad Johnson,He's definitely a guy I look up to. He leads by example. He's a gifted and talented hockey player.
Chad Johnson,"Oh, man, it's like Hollywood out here. We have to keep it going. The buzz and the electricity around here is crazy. It's been a long time since people have felt this way about our team."
Chad Johnson,"Our defense is playing ridiculous right now. As long as they play like that, we can put up 50 points if we want to."
Chad Johnson,Tennessee is a very country-type state. Maybe I can practice on some type of country-western dance where they'll know what I'm doing.
Chad Johnson,This last preseason game would put me in a better comfort zone with Carson. Make a catch and you'll see both of us smiling.
Chad Johnson,"Thanks to higher authority, I can't open my mouth, period, all week."
Chris Johnson,We're going to have to try to work a little harder. We're the best in South Carolina. Now I guess we'll have to try to be the best in the Carolinas.
Chris Johnson,I was falling down and just hit it. It was all luck. I just hit it. We can play a lot better than we played tonight.
Chris Johnson,"If it weren't for the faith-based groups helping out, the city of Waveland would be half the size it is now."
Chris Johnson,"It has changed our lives. If it weren't for the faith-based groups helping out, the city of Waveland would be half the size it is now."
Chris Johnson,"It could be something as simple as eating breakfast, moving your body more or getting more sleep."
Dan Johnson,I don't think it's worth it.
Dan Johnson,"I'd guess the ethanol gasoline makes up probably half of all our sales. It's such a good product, we deliver a lot of it to farms. Once you convince the people in town that there are benefits to using it, they seem to go to that pump all the time."
Dan Johnson,"The event is primarily for youth, but his music should be enjoyable to people of any age, including families."
Davey Johnson,"What (Cox) has been able to do, infuse young talent throughout the years, young pitchers and win is one of the toughest jobs to do. Nobody has done it better."
Davey Johnson,"I really enjoy having these guys - Double-A, Triple-A - in this Olympic team. It's been a joy getting them together."
Davey Johnson,Are you sure you want to do this job?
Davey Johnson,"He was a great guy. Dwight at 17 was the most mature, most eager young athlete. He was the earliest at the ballpark. He was always in the game."
David Johnson,"This is not an end-all motion. This gives (the Negaunee Commission on Aging) the council's support to continue their endeavor. Whatever they come up with, they still have to come back to the council for approval prior to proceeding."
David Johnson,"Her drive is what grabbed me. She's more than ambitious. She's relentless. She doesn't eat much. She doesn't sleep. You almost have to force her to stop working ... on a routine, or she's rehearsing songs, or just studying music."
David Johnson,School is grade-motivated: You're looking for the A. This is personally motivated: How you can improve yourself.
David Johnson,I think the administration has an agenda to keep themselves in power.
David Johnson,The biggest thing is that we've worked so hard together. It's important to be able to work with other people toward a common goal.
David Johnson,She needs to overcome the negative image planted in everyone's mind during the 2000 election.
David Johnson,"When I was a little boy, 40-plus years ago, I remember listening to the Palmetto State Quartet on my radio. Of course, none of them singing now are the same men I heard then."
David Johnson,They said they had a lot of life and spirit.
David Johnson,The biggest overarching trend is just the growth in the Hispanic consumer.
David Johnson,It's not like they're just getting slapped. These girls are getting violently abused.
David Johnson,They came in and gave us great games. They got us back in the game. That's what a team is - different players stepping up.
David Johnson,"In terms of having to play Bob personally, it's not fun. I have to play the girls I joke and laugh with and spend time with in the summer. It's not fun."
David Johnson,"We are poised for breaking away from our competitors in the food industry, ... This strategic growth plan is designed to vault our company into the ranks of the world's renowned consumer goods companies, in terms of financial profile and market multiple."
David Johnson,I don't want to see this end at this project. I am so excited about the enthusiasm of this group; I've seen a couple of scripts and my jaw has dropped. (This) is a group that came together with chaotic synergy.
David Johnson,"That's the plot of the movie. The dogs' struggle for survival, without people, after they are stranded. Also, instead of 13 dogs being left, only eight get left behind in the movie."
David Johnson,I'm pretty excited about it. You never think of your dogs doing something like that.
David Johnson,"By creating this culture of fear the administration has been able to charge through with all these different issues, like the (USA) PATRIOT Act, than if the population was a little less frightened."
David Johnson,"This is spinning out of control. I think she's going to have to drop out, no matter how defiant she is now."
David Johnson,"Letting it spiral out of control is a public-relations nightmare. They should have done damage control. For an administration known for its rapid responses and e-mails, this one looks like they were tone deaf."
David Johnson,(The run) gave us confidence. We showed them a lot of different looks. We showed them different defenses.
David Johnson,"Once we didn't hit a couple of shots, for some reason our girls' confidence went down. There were shots we should have made that just rolled out tonight. East played great defense, but I thought we had some good looks."
David Johnson,"We had $20,000 in this year's budget and we had to increase that to $40,000 for the next budget. If it's approved, we'll be building it this fall."
David Johnson,"I do believe the matter has been concluded, but that's really all I can say."
David Johnson,"I think it is from playing point guard in basketball. You have to have good vision. As a point guard, you are always looking for the open man."
David Johnson,Clearly the baby boomer demographics are driving the phenomena.
David Johnson,"Most people are savvy enough in this day and age that they know they have to investigate a product before they buy, People are more suspicious of the media today than they've ever been."
David Johnson,"It's impossible to say now it would give an advantage to any proposed candidate. But it's really for the benefit of Florida, to have a real voice in selecting the nominee. The only way to be heard is to speak up sooner."
Dwayne Johnson,The one thing I couldn't identify with was the blue cowboy outfit he put on.
Dwayne Johnson,When he speaks to you he speaks with an earnest vibe and an earnest energy.
Dwayne Johnson,"That's a traditional Samoan dance. I was lucky that I was able to fly my cousins, who are professional dancers, up from Hawaii and they were able to be in the movie with me. We had a great time."
Dwayne Johnson,"I liked his ability to deal with a lot of the negativity that surrounded him. Even though he was in a world that he didn't want to be in, he still saw the bigger picture."
Dwayne Johnson,For me it came from the material. It was so well written and brought the opportunity to work with great actors. And of course the opportunity to 'mince about' was an added element that I wanted to take advantage of!
Eddie Johnson,"It was like (for FC Dallas), why did you trade me? But I don't have anything against Dallas. It was my home."
Eddie Johnson,"We just want to put on a good performance for them, its going to be an exciting feeling once I step on the field."
Eddie Johnson,"I'm getting there. It's more from the mental standpoint now. There will be a little bit of pain, and in my head I think I'm making it worse and I know I'm not."
Eddie Johnson,"This is the only place the law, the authorities, will let us stay."
Eddie Johnson,I'm happy. I'm going there to score goals.
Eddie Johnson,It's a necessary evil. I'm trying to get him to a few of the All-American camps.
Eric Johnson,The odds of that must be a million to one.
Eric Johnson,"Very little sleep. It's been on-going, one thing after another."
Eric Johnson,Is there an option for a sales tax increase for roads and schools? Yes. Is it an option the commissioners are exploring? No.
Eric Johnson,"He did not repeat the language that he used, which would embarrass me as an old salt."
Eric Johnson,The clock ticks and time runs out. Our founding fathers wanted to make it hard to pass legislation and it is hard. It's hard to pass legislation for a reason.
Eric Johnson,"It's fun for 3-year-olds. But older kids will also enjoy dogs playing ball, driving a car, working with different tools. Stuff humans do."
Eric Johnson,The congressman's heart went out to them. He just might be the right member of Congress who can help them.
Eric Johnson,"Bleep theory belongs in philosophy, not a science class. But I think it does have enough merit to be a topic of conversation somewhere other than the backwoods and closets."
Eric Johnson,"Like most budgets, it's a roller coaster, ... We will strap ourselves in and see how many loop-de-loops there are."
Frank Johnson,"Most of our girls are accustomed to playing several games in a short time frame. As a coach and as a team, you want to play games. Plus, you might see a different brand of softball than you are accustomed to playing, and that can be beneficial as well."
Frank Johnson,"To have six or seven Division-I prospects, that's unheard of, even in 5A football. This football game is about competing. That's all I expect my kids to do."
Frank Johnson,"I don't believe it's as simple as just better shooting. It's just a case of we've really been running our plays well and are getting better open looks. And we've been knocking them down, so execution has been the biggest thing."
Frank Johnson,"Well, I have gotten together with this fellow from Canada. He is good with computers -- let's leave it at that."
Gary Johnson,"She's been suffering from some lower leg issues that really haven't been well-defined -- shin splints and some other muscular issues. It's gonna depend on her mental toughness to determine how far she can take her performances. Spring break will help her to rehab a little. She got off to a good start, though."
Gary Johnson,"With the matches coming so quickly - two in the space of three days - I'm afraid it means if a player misses the first game, then they probably won't be fit for the second. We'll keep an eye on them, but I think that will be the case."
Gary Johnson,"Out of this tragedy came a joy,"
Gary Johnson,"Notwithstanding [the Apple setback], we believe the pace of innovation behind our new technologies is accelerating."
Gary Johnson,"He's six foot one inch tall, and very mobile. He can not only score goals but create them for others."
Gary Johnson,This fire is not over with and nobody here is pretending it is.
Gary Johnson,"If it's bad for the families, we're going to be up (in Santa Fe) fighting it; if it's good for the families, we're going to be there supporting it,"
Gary Johnson,"He is a great, great man. A great communicator in education."
Gary Johnson,I will deal with any breach of club discipline with a heavy hand... I have left all the players in no doubt that there must be no repeat.
Gary Johnson,The Competition Coupe is a mature and reliable car and we are looking to do very well this year with it. And we have some new drivers that we're looking to perform strongly.
Gary Johnson,common sense out the window.
Gary Johnson,"We don't have another option, so I guess we'll need to reconsider the future of Early College ."
Gary Johnson,It's a reward for the Christmas matches. It will be nice to have a few days with the sun on our backs.
Gary Johnson,"The kids that didn't score were setting personal records -- both on the boys and girls sides. The younger kids are surprising us every meet. Those kids that did score, obviously had a good meet."
Gary Johnson,"My advice to all New Mexicans is document, document, document your losses."
Howard Johnson,"The potential offensively is pretty good. If we can stay healthy and these guys continue to do what they did all spring, we'll be fine. We're going to be exciting at the top of the lineup."
Howard Johnson,"[After that fight, Johnson told the Patriot News of Harrisburg, Pa., that several ex-teammates attacked him.] I was fighting about six-on-one, ... I was like a gladiator or something."
Howard Johnson,"The MRA takes the heat for everything that happens in the watershed, ... But they have no enforcement authority or responsibility."
Hugh Johnson,We might get blindsided by some (hedge fund) announcement that nobody's anticipating. You worry about another big bolt out of the blue.
Hugh Johnson,"We might get blindsided by some (hedge fund) announcement that nobody's anticipating, ... You worry about another big bolt out of the blue."
Hugh Johnson,"When all of the markets around the globe simultaneously go down, that's the message. That's what you have to worry about."
Hugh Johnson,"There's an old adage on Wall Street: bull markets climb a wall of worry. Needless to say, there are a lot of worries out there."
Hugh Johnson,I don't worry about volatility. I worry about down .
Hugh Johnson,"The truth is with Harley-Davidson, like a lot of other companies, like Wal-Mart and Target, we've seen ongoing, strong demand, ... Harley-Davidson's production has had to ramp up 15 percent per year for the last 10 years. That's pretty impressive and it's all been done to meet that ongoing demand."
Hugh Johnson,"When you see buying in that (technology) sector in a bear market, it implies that there are investors out there who see improvement around the corner, and it's usually technology and cyclical stocks that lead the market out of a downtrend. The bias towards Friday's data may be that the data will be consistent with the view that the economy is showing some expansion."
Hugh Johnson,"When you see buying in that (technology) sector in a bear market, it implies that there are investors out there who see improvement around the corner, and it's usually technology and cyclical stocks that lead the market out of a downtrend, ... The bias towards Friday's data may be that the data will be consistent with the view that the economy is showing some expansion."
Hugh Johnson,"If you separate out all the sectors of the market, it's no longer the case that technology is the most overvalued sector of the market, health care and energy actually carry higher valuations than technology now. So we are starting to get the levels overall in technology that really make some sense. And interestingly enough, if you take it even further, if you go to the individual stocks, stocks like Sun, Cisco, Texas Instruments, Oracle -- great names, they're starting to get to levels which, again, don't call them cheap, but call them cheaper and interesting,"
Hugh Johnson,"You really want to stay with the large-cap (stocks), ... the big names in technology."
Hugh Johnson,Momentum investors are looking for something that works. What works is technology.
Hugh Johnson,It's very hard to make sweeping statements when it comes to technology.
Hugh Johnson,Technology -- you really have to have exposure there.
Hugh Johnson,I like the large-cap technology names. Over a three- to five-year period they are going to be real winners.
Hugh Johnson,"[That can be done, but it can be frustrating.] The world doesn't wait for you to go through your research, ... You're sitting there doing your research and while you twiddle your thumbs, Rome is burning."
Hugh Johnson,"It has been a solid performance, but there's still a healthy level of skepticism because stocks aren't cheap right now."
Hugh Johnson,"I get worried about so much optimism and the fact that the market is overvalued,"
Hugh Johnson,Sometime managements are the ones that make the mistake and think they're the ones that are going to survive. They have no perspective and don't understand that sooner or later they're going to go away.
Hugh Johnson,"Sometime managements are the ones that make the mistake and think they're the ones that are going to survive, ... They have no perspective and don't understand that sooner or later they're going to go away."
Hugh Johnson,I think the yield has worried investors. Some investors believe that it's a signal that a recession lies ahead. I believe that is a faulty interpretation.
Hugh Johnson,"I think everybody knew this before, but this kind of takes it from the back page and moves it to the front page, ... He certainly carries a lot of weight in the market."
Hugh Johnson,"Their (Exxon's) profits were very strong, and December personal income was higher than forecast."
Hugh Johnson,"Those [stock-market] returns will be much better than the alternatives. You name it, gold, bonds, cash -- stocks are still likely to be the best performing asset class for the next five years."
Hugh Johnson,"It is encouraging that the market has been able to hold together. The overall message is that the events in Southeast Asia will in time have an impact on the U.S. economy, but not a major impact in 1998. And that is really good news."
Hugh Johnson,"Trying to manage money in this environment, you can't imagine how stressful this is."
Hugh Johnson,I expected the market to inch or edge forward. I wouldn't have expected this in my wildest dreams.

Hugh Johnson,Common sense alone says energy is not going to be the leader.
Hugh Johnson,[They] face each other across the road like mad old duchesses in party clothes.
Hugh Johnson,"Tomorrow, the market will probably continue upward driven by the dollar, but it won't go up much because of caution before the employment figures."
Hugh Johnson,It's coming from southern Canada. We're in that time of year where even Canada is warming up now. We might make a run at 70 by the end of the week.
Hugh Johnson,Usually what happens is that it really reduces the appetite of investors to borrow money to buy stocks for years. Not months - years.
Hugh Johnson,"To some extent everybody is a little exhausted. In the absence of big news we'll see a quieter day. It feels like we were hit by a tidal wave over the past three or four days and today is like the aftermath, picking up the pieces."
J. J. Johnson,"They make a rout about universal liberty, without considering that all that is to be valued, or indeed can be enjoyed by individuals, is private liberty"
J. J. Johnson,I was lucky enough to occasionally break out of that racist situation that prevails in the Hollywood film production community. But it was racist then and it will always be that way. It will never be otherwise.
J. J. Johnson,Midi is my hobby.
J. J. Johnson,"There are no black film composers doing the likes of Star Wars, doing the likes of E.T., doing the likes of Jurassic Park. There are none, nor will there ever be one. That ain't about to happen!"
J. J. Johnson,"The jazz scene - or the lack of it - has no correlation to my move back to Indianapolis. I wanted Indianapolis to be my home, and it is my home."
J. J. Johnson,Sometimes you need to stand with your nose to the window and have a good look at jazz. And I've done that on many occasions.
Jack Johnson,"I heard some words from a friend on the phone, it didn't sound so good. The doctor gave him two weeks to live, I'd give him more. If I could."
Jack Johnson,We are deploying resources to house our new citizens and to ease their suffering.
Jack Johnson,"We aren't going to lose sleep over being bigger, faster and stronger and hitting hard. We know that's how we will have to play against the Canadians. We aren't going to change our game."
Jack Johnson,"He was a natural at the position. A lot people talk about arm strength and size, but there's also something to playing quarterback that involves the brain. David processed things very fast and did not make a mistake. He was like a control pitcher in baseball."
Jack Johnson,"They were just people who loved being out in nature all the time,"
Jack Johnson,There were so many fewer questions when stars were still just the holes to heaven...
Jack Johnson,What a fortunate fool...
Jack Johnson,The possession of muscular strength and the courage to use it in contests with other men for physical supremacy does not necessarily imply a lack of appreciation for the finer and better things of life.
Jack Johnson,All the choices are made just purely on what seems like it would be fun. We don't always want to grow things. I think we're at a point where we feel pretty comfortable if we can keep things about the same.
Jack Johnson,"It's easy to play on the edge when you are in an environment like this, especially playing against Canada. I feel I have to play like that in order to play a good game."
Jack Johnson,We're just a bubble in a boiling pot.
Jack Johnson,"It takes a long, hard effort and sustained determination to reduce crime. We will stay the course and we are confident that the numbers will continue to go down."

Jack Johnson,"I made a lot of mistakes out of the ring, but I never made any in it."
Jay Johnson,"I definitely think there's nothing better than learning from an experienced guy. Dustin, having taken all the reps he has, is certainly one they can learn from."
Jay Johnson,"He never flinched. Even though he was sticking himself with the knife, he never changed his expression."
Jay Johnson,"You eyeball them and if you've got anything jiggling, we'll know. If your body fat is 25 percent, I wouldn't fire you, but I'd tell you to back away from the Twinkies."
Jay Johnson,That's the beauty of it. It's still their grease.
Jay Johnson,"This agreement is a significant step towards further commercialization of the Gorgon area gas resources,"

Jeff Johnson,"If we don't address these issues, we're going to be facing significant security issues."
Jeff Johnson,"One of the big things we'll be able to do now is give pre-arrival instructions. In the past we haven't been able to. (In the case of) choking, we would be determining the appropriate age group."
Jeff Johnson,"As the population grows, we're not creating enough jobs as it is to keep up with the levels we have. What we need is stronger growth that is more employment-creative, or employment-intensive."
Jeff Johnson,"When you walk 10 guys, you're not going to win too many games. (Brock) was just wild and didn't throw any strikes. He just couldn't find the strike zone."
Jeff Johnson,"I felt good about the way our pitchers played except for probably three of the 12. But in three games we gave up three runs or less. If we can continue to do that, we'll win a bunch of games."
Jeff Johnson,"They've been coming out of the woodwork, which is nice for the future. The girls have the athleticism to make a little noise at the end of the year. It's still a rebuilding and learning year, and while I'm looking for the returning players to improve, Celebration's going to be real strong again."
Jeff Johnson,"It's funny. No matter what, we have always competed well against Plainfield. It's a rivalry game and our kids get up for it. Our kids really stepped up and that was nice to see on Senior Night."
Jeff Johnson,Fear...Paralyzes!
Jeff Johnson,"Coming in with a 2-11 record, for us to start a good like that was huge for our confidence. We've played in games this season not called as tight and we're not strong enough to counter that, so to get to the foul line and getting them off of us definitely helped our offense."
Jeff Johnson,"As a company founded by a competitive cyclist who wanted to create the first great-tasting, nutritious energy bar, we're ecstatic about helping bring professional cycling to California. We also value the opportunity to reduce the environmental footprint of this event while raising awareness about global warming."
Jeff Johnson,We've got a good group of sophomores and hopefully they can communicate to the freshmen what it takes to get it done in conference play. We just have to understand that it's a marathon and not a sprint. It' s a matter of who's got the most perseverance.
Jeff Johnson,seems a bit of a stretch to me ... but I think there's a straight-faced argument to be made.
Jimmie Johnson,"One (DNF), I spun out here and crashed, ... I was frustrated. I got too aggressive and crashed. That was worth at least 100 points. All I needed was to be safe."
Jimmie Johnson,Talladega is a wild-card event. We're just going to go out and try to stay out of trouble. There's really nothing else you can do.
Jimmie Johnson,"This is a huge statement and something that I'm very proud of. We know that there are rules, a set of rules."
Jimmie Johnson,"Talladega is a huge risk, ... I think everybody is real nervous about Talladega, and hopefully everybody drives that way and we don't have any big pile-ups."
Jimmie Johnson,"Talladega is a huge risk. I think everybody is real nervous about Talladega, and hopefully everybody drives that way and we don't have any big pile-ups."
Jimmie Johnson,He probably would have won the race and it would be a different story.
Jimmie Johnson,"If you're hitting your stride, you're all about the Chase starting. If you're downhill fighting your way up, you'd want a couple of weeks before the Chase starts so you can sort out your own stuff. We didn't get off to a good start last year and almost won it so we'll just have to work hard and see what happens."
Jimmie Johnson,"We went back in the spring for the Advance Auto Parts 500, and all the emotions came back,"
Jimmie Johnson,"Back in the spring, all the emotions came back."
Jimmie Johnson,"I was fading so I don't really have any complaints with the way that he raced me. I passed him two or three times earlier in the day and found another line and worked my way around the outside of him. I was a little surprised that he continually drove it in and kept trying to blast me in the center. I think he probably hit me for four or five laps and the time that he got by me, he really had my wheels off the ground and I couldn't get in the gas and he got inside of me and from there drove on and drove away from me. This is short track racing."
Jimmie Johnson,I don't really have any complaints about the way he raced me.
Jimmie Johnson,The communication that we have is amazing. We know each other better than I expected. He has obviously been paying close attention to what Chad has been doing and it is showing at the track.
Jimmie Johnson,"If it was somebody else, I don't think I would have had the same comfort. I didn't have any concerns over any aggressive driving."
Jimmie Johnson,"I was slowly catching Matt before that last caution. I think we could have got up there to race with him but, if it stayed green, I believe Matt had it in the bag. Then we got that last yellow. I thought long and hard about what I would do if I was protecting the lead. I knew I wanted to be on the outside. I faked kind of to the bottom and he kind of bought it."
Jimmie Johnson,"The drivers, we just get in and drive the cars. I do know that the team and crew chief are going to work as hard as they can to work the gray areas, and with that in mind gray areas were looked at and worked over and when the car came back the template didn't fit. So, Chad, the team, myself will accept what happened."
Jimmie Johnson,"Another person I'm going to be thinking of is Brian Vickers, ... The plane crash was on his birthday, of all things."
Jimmie Johnson,Our (Hendrick) engineers and crew chiefs all get together and compare notes. That's when you really see the benefit of a four-car team.
Jimmie Johnson,I know my team believes that. I believe that. We knew we would round the corner eventually and thankfully we've done it earlier in the Chase rather than as late in the Chase as we did last year.
Jimmie Johnson,We just seem to thrive on adversity.
Jimmie Johnson,"I give him a lot of credit. One, for his intelligence and ability to build great race cars. And two, for stepping up with all the focus and pressure. He's been able to have a clear mind and stay relaxed and make great decisions."
Jimmy Johnson,"Defensively they actually have picked it up a little up, ... I think they have made some improvement defensively. But offensively, you just can't turn the ball over like they have. You turn the ball over with a struggling team and you have a loss there."
Jimmy Johnson,I'd hate to be the coach that sits him down.
Jimmy Johnson,"They need to work on their Internet strategy. So far, their design has gotten them through, but they need to think about whether to bundle ISP [Internet service] with their computers, as [direct seller] Gateway has done."
Jimmy Johnson,"Two to three years down the road, other companies not on a model like Dell's will be in trouble."
Jimmy Johnson,"Treat a person as he is, and he will remain as he is. Treat him as he could be, and he will become what he should be."
Jimmy Johnson,"Military leaders aren't made. They are born. To be a good leader, you have to have something in your character to cause people to follow you."
Jimmy Johnson,An objective truth and individual reason are feared above all.
Jimmy Johnson,The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
Jimmy Johnson,"Give people enough guidance to make the decisions you want them to make. Don't tell them what to do, but encourage them to do what is best."
Jimmy Johnson,The only thing worse than a coach or CEO who doesn't care about his people is one who pretends to care. People can spot a phony every time.
Jimmy Johnson,"Treat a person as he is, and he will remain as he is. Treat a person as if he were where he could be and should be, and he will become what he could be and should be."
Jimmy Johnson,I can't confirm any rumors. I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I have no interest in going back to coaching.
Jimmy Johnson,"Do you want to be safe and good, or do you want to take a chance and be great?"
Joe Johnson,"Our normal average is 104 sales a month, and we're going to probably end up September with 165. And 37 percent of our sales are coming from areas affected by Hurricane Katrina."
Joe Johnson,"Our normal average is 104 sales a month, and we're going to probably end up September with 165, ... And 37 percent of our sales are coming from areas affected by Hurricane Katrina."
Joe Johnson,"The Beatles sang 'Until There Was You,' and they sang 'All You Need is Love,' and they sang 'I'll Follow The Sun,' and they sang 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' and 'She Loves You.' And those songs hung in there and they were very meaningful and they have great melodies and beautiful lyrics,"
Joe Johnson,"I never had a situation where Jim said, 'This is who you've got to hire, who you've got to fire, what you've got to pay or else,'"
Joe Johnson,At halftime we knew we could make a run at them. Our consistency this season has been terrible. We need to find a way to get ourselves up and be aggressive against every team.
Joe Johnson,Becky has a wonderful talent for communication and an outstanding gift for connecting people and organizations for their mutual benefit. Becky has a unique ability to see a vision through from imagination to accomplishment. She was the right person for this public role as our West Volusia hospitals were developing relationships with our communities.
Joe Johnson,These guys are extremely committed to the welfare and well-being of the animals.
Joe Johnson,"It is a great accomplishment and I look forward to doing more of that. I'm a versatile player and that allows me to not only score, but rebound and get my teammates involved. It makes it easy on myself and the team."
John H. Johnson,You spend so much time in your profession it ought to be something you love.
John H. Johnson,"When I go in to see people - and I sell an occasional ad now - I never say, 'Help me because I am black' or 'Help me because I am a minority.' I always talk about what we can do for them."
John H. Johnson,"Retirement is not in this company's vocabulary. If you are well and able to work, you can stay at the company and that's what I plan to do."
John H. Johnson,It's better to get smart than to get mad. I try not to get so insulted that I will not take advantage of an opportunity to persuade people to change their minds.
John H. Johnson,Failure is a word that I simply don't accept.
John H. Johnson,"Dream small dreams. If you make them too big, you get overwhelmed and you don't do anything. If you make small goals and accomplish them, it gives you the confidence to go on to higher goals."
John H. Johnson,"All have disappointments, all have times when it isn't worthwhile."
John H. Johnson,"To succeed, one must be creative and persistent."
John H. Johnson,My mother was the influence in my life. She was strong; she had great faith in the ultimate triumph of justice and hard work. She believed passionately in education.
Joshua Johnson,"I didn't really know about the school, but I knew about Coach Harbaugh from his playing days. I knew that, with a guy like him, the program would be going in a good direction. It's a win-win situation â€“ get a good education and play on a good football team."
Joshua Johnson,"It's a simple process, but it can save a lot of money."
Joshua Johnson,"I didn't really know about the school, but I knew about Coach Harbaugh from his playing days. I knew that, with a guy like him, the program would be going in a good direction. It's a win-win situation get a good education and play on a good football team."
Justin Johnson,I think about plays and stuff. I kind of run through the game in my mind.
Justin Johnson,"Part of the function of icons is for private devotional purposes. Early in the church's history, icons made it easier for worshipers to understand biblical themes and stories, as they could not read. Icons also create an atmosphere that enhances the worship and act as constant reminders of the divine."
Justin Johnson,"The misconception is that icons are worshipped when in actuality they are venerated, a way of making an environment more conducive for worshipping. This is how the Orthodox Church supports the creation and use of icons within the church."
Ken Johnson,The committee is going to get the truth out and won't let Stewart's tactics stop them.
Ken Johnson,We have three different stories and frankly we don't know who is telling the truth. The sooner we talk to Ms. Stewart the sooner we can clear this mess up.
Ken Johnson,That is simply not true. America's pharmaceutical research companies are firmly committed to HIV/AIDS vaccine research and development with 15 potential vaccines in development today.
Ken Johnson,"She's kind of one of those players that doesn't come around too often. She's got all the physical tools, the work ethic, and the dedication. And she's just a great kid."
Ken Johnson,We have developed new information that is aiding the investigation and that is painting a clearer picture of what happened.
Ken Johnson,"There is a tremendous amount of information that we're pouring through, everything from tire tests to rollover data going back 10 years,"
Ken Johnson,"You don't see lobbyists in the office any more than you see people from back home. Lobbyists have influence on the Hill, but not as much as you might think."
Ken Johnson,"At a certain point, it became clear that funding local health projects became a priority,"
Ken Johnson,"His doctors have assured him he'll live a long, healthy and productive life."
Ken Johnson,No one at any time approached him during the Medicare debate.
Ken Johnson,Perhaps Nancy Pelosi will now realize that Billy's decision to retire from Congress had more to do with getting well physically than getting well financially.
Ken Johnson,"There's no doubt that the competition steps up next week,"
Ken Johnson,"The system was set up so that robust competition among private insurance companies would drive prices down, ... More competition equals lower prices. It is simple economics."

Ken Johnson,Right now he faces the choice of either turning over the records or running the risk of facing contempt of Congress charges.
Ken Johnson,"If a doctor breaks securities laws or his or her confidentiality agreement with a pharmaceutical research company to gain financially, they should be severely punished."
Ken Johnson,"This action only confirms our suspicions that we are on the right track and getting very close to the truth, ... but we continue to pursue leads relating to public statements she has made."
Keyshawn Johnson,"Trust me, I am fine. I'm healthy, I'm free from a horrible situation, and in a couple of months I'll be one of the two hottest receivers on the free-agent market, along with Terrell Owens . That means I'm going to get a nice payday and play for a team that wants me. I'm stunned and disappointed by what happened, but honestly, I'm relieved."
Keyshawn Johnson,"It was luck, totally luck."
Keyshawn Johnson,"It was luck, totally luck. We're entitled to have a bad game and still win, at least once."
Keyshawn Johnson,"That's not a leader. That's a fictitious, phony person selling something. I am not selling my leadership. I am just going to do what they ask me to do. That's leadership for me."
Keyshawn Johnson,I'm sure he can. It's just a matter of protecting him and giving him opportunities.
Keyshawn Johnson,We added some good parts. We should be a much better football team.
Keyshawn Johnson,"We're playing decent football right now. We're not playing great football by any stretch of the imagination. And decent football is only going to get you so far. We've got to eventually get good, then get great."
Keyshawn Johnson,I'm sad to see it happen. My regards go out to the family. I will try at some point to get in contact with some of his family.
Keyshawn Johnson,"I don't care how quiet a guy is. If he's a receiver, he has a big ego."
Keyshawn Johnson,"They'll continue to show it on television, ... They'll show it on ESPN 40 times. They'll say I'm a cancer. The crowd loved it. The fans love it. The producers in the truck love it because it's big news. But to us, it's a joke."
Kirk Johnson,It's the opposite of science.
Kirk Johnson,"[The census] makes the difference look very stark, when in reality it should be much closer together, ... There is more economic opportunity in this country."
Kirk Johnson,"It was sweet, innocent and nice, I liked the idea of cartoon characters coming to life."
Kirk Johnson,built into the labor market.
Kirk Johnson,"Intelligent design is clearly not a scientific theory. It's sort of anti-science, in a way, because it says that the world is too complicated, too hard to figure out, so there must be a supernatural answer."
Kirk Johnson,They kept the integrity and charm of the old stadium and added a lot of fan amenities.
Kirk Johnson,It's an interesting kind of arrogance to dismiss something that you don't know a lot about.
Kirk Johnson,They're a wake-up call. Middle America has been told not to count on government covering its long-term care.
Larry Johnson,The technology and resources are there to effectively fight this. We just need to work smarter to do this.
Larry Johnson,"By keeping my weight on my heels and running kind of flat-footed. I'm already flat-footed, so I don't run much on my toes and I tried not to plant as hard. But when I saw a hole, I made sure I got enough underneath me to hit the hole."
Larry Johnson,I don't want to waste three or four years of my prime running behind somebody - period. I don't care who it is. I feel like I should start somewhere in this league.

Larry Johnson,"Don't tie up your retirement portfolio in one stock,"
Larry Johnson,It is part of our responsibility to make sure that our product is being used efficiently by our customers. That certainly is one of our challenges.
Larry Johnson,"Basically, I will say this. It is an unfortunate event that happened to me Friday night,"
Larry Johnson,"We just started our investigation, ... The SBI is here now, and it is suspicious in nature."
Larry Johnson,"For me, the most interesting thing was that... much of our interactions with Electric Sheep took place in Second Life , avatar to avatar. The social aspects of Second Life were a very interesting part of the project for me because a lot of this took place in that world, even though it was a real-world contract between two companies."
Larry Johnson,An exposure like that required an immediate operational and counter intelligence damage assessment. That was done. The results were written up but not in a form for submission to anyone outside of CIA.
Larry Johnson,There's so much information in such volumes that there's a limit to what any analyst can absorb.
Larry Johnson,We knew the yards were going to be hard. We knew they would try to shut down the run as much as they could. Trent did a good job hitting the receivers on some third-down passes.
Larry Johnson,The president has flip-flopped on his promise to fire anyone in the White House implicated in a leak.
Larry Johnson,It's just tradition. It's been going on so long. My family has been coming here for generations now.
Larry Johnson,"No excuses here. Our scores have to come up,"
Larry Johnson,"Send the families to us, ... We don't have much for older adults without children, but we can help families out financially with benefit checks and food stamps. Those who haven't ever applied for food stamps will still be able to fill out an application."
Lee Johnson,"I think he's been explicit telling people what they really don't want to hear because of the way the rules are written. Unfortunately, the state legislature is the only one that can change things."
Lee Johnson,Teens sometimes feel that inflicting pain on yourself will transfer the pain somewhere else. Teens doing this should find a trusted adult like a teacher or counselor to talk to.
Lee Johnson,We want to treat independent living youth who are in foster care the same as any other child in the world. Just because they're in foster care doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to drive.
Lee Johnson,"I think (the leaders) are there. It's whether or not they know how to do that yet is what we've got to find. I'm not sure they know who they are yet, so we'll see."
Lee Johnson,Grieving is natural. It is not a disease.
Lee Johnson,We've prided ourselves in that defense now for five games. We've got a lot of pride in that defense. We feel like we're playing real good defensive football and we have some room to get better.
Lee Johnson,"One thing we talked about is being an inexperienced team, when you get adversity, everybody's got to come together and pick it up. I think when they saw Laura go down, who's one of our tougher kids, the kids had a little bit of an emotional letdown."
Linda Johnson,"Kinesthetic learners are the most active learners, and they're remembering if they're jumping up and down or playing sports."
Linda Johnson,Living in a small apartment requires some ingenuity to find a good location where it doesn't take up your whole living room.

Martin Johnson,Race and hip hop is kind of the elephant in the room.

Martin Johnson,"After talking to my family and friends and after a lot of thought, I have decided to retire from international rugby with immediate effect,"
Martin Johnson,"You start with the technology, because we really need standardized health care data in this country. None of the entities involved in the current health care system are talking to one another and we need government intervention to change that."
Martin Johnson,You might not believe it but he does laugh every now and again.
Matt Johnson,"The risk of acquiring a customer is lower. They can get a 20 [percent] to 50 percent conversion off an existing base, plus growth. They are strong, stable customers."
Matt Johnson,"I think the market has had an unbelievable run over the past seven days and what you see is profit taking. What's driving the market today (Friday) is what people are doing in the cash market, so it's not options expiration."
Matt Johnson,"To my knowledge, it's the first series of paintings in a modern style of Fort Myers."
Matt Johnson,It is a fair trade of information to resolve any issues we all are having.
Matt Johnson,It certainly leads to a lot of late nights and hard work. There is a quality established with their brand and reputation and certainly we take personal responsibility for living up to that.
Matt Johnson,"They came out really strong, and we weren't ready for it. It's just hard."
Matt Johnson,"From a macro standpoint, clearly we're looking for information regarding employment (data from the government) on Friday as the next catalyst, ... There's been no information that's been market-moving as of late. But in general, the environment for tech investing has been good."
Matt Johnson,"While they are having fun and getting dirty, they are also learning something. But don't tell the kids that."
Matt Johnson,"This is my favorite weather, ... I love it. Because we get dirty and we play football."
Matt Johnson,"Everyone who's going has already seen the meet, so it won't be an overwhelming experience. It won't just be a thrill to be there, it will be a thrill to compete."
Matt Johnson,He's got all the confidence in the world.
Matt Johnson,"These guys made a commitment that they wanted to get here, and once they got here they wanted to win a championship. They believed that's done on the defensive end of the floor. In the semis and the finals they showed that."
Matt Johnson,We weren't coming from some other industry where we had some adjunct business.
Matt Johnson,We were just trying to wear on him a little and body him up when he came into the lane. He's got such good hands and nice touch around the hoop. He's going to get his points; we just tried to contain the rest of their players.
Michael Johnson,"He's an inside runner and he's smaller than I am. I know he's not the premier back in the league, but he's dependable so that's why I watch him."
Michael Johnson,They don't give you gold medals for beating somebody. They give you gold medals for beating everybody.
Michael Johnson,"[The British Automobile Association, a persistent campaigner for lower fuel costs, believes such action is pointless.] Perhaps there is a psychological effect, ... but on a practical level, it's not going to do a thing."
Nick Johnson,"It's going to be sore the rest of the year, ... But when you get between the lines, you just do it."
Nick Johnson,It didn't seem likely that states would take health insurance from a million people ... but that's what a number of states have done and are proposing to do -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg. They have to balance the budget somehow.
Nick Johnson,"I got serious about golf in the ninth grade. I played some when I was younger, but it was when I got to high school that I really became interested. I think I got my mom and dad interested in golf, too. Now, they are always asking me what are they doing wrong."
Nick Johnson,They have this really interesting behavior that can be monetized somewhere else.

Nick Johnson,The concept of industry domination of regulatory agencies was well known and documented in the literature by the 1960s.

Nick Johnson,You look at all the great players that they've had and the potential of playing in Yankee Stadium.
Nick Johnson,"I just try to get on anyway that I can, hit, hit-by-pitch, walk, home runs, anything."
Nick Johnson,"I'll get mine in a few years, when I get up there and when the time comes."
Nick Johnson,"I was happy that I was drafted, and then it was the Yankees and that just made it even better."
Nick Johnson,A lot of the things that until now seemed unthinkable are starting to be thinkable.
Nick Johnson,"I think maybe L.A. or San Francisco could be rushed, but Sacramento is just laid back!"
Nick Johnson,"I don't plan on going back to legal work. I wanted an international career, and finance seemed to be where some interesting career opportunities were."
Nick Johnson,"When you get on base, holes open up and things happen and you're able to find a way to score runs."
Nicole Johnson,"We did a great job blocking their middles - that's something the girls haven't done before, and we did a great job with that."
Nicole Johnson,"There is no such word as 'can't' if you show Him love and honor Him, He will show it back. I truly believe that."

Nicole Johnson,"The dire circumstances are that you've got people who have been without insulin or oral medications for four days now, and they're dying,"
Phil Johnson,I think we're feeling good going into the (All-Putnam County) race next Wednesday. We feel like we can take the county title. We know we'll have a good race with Palatka.
Phil Johnson,"I think we're feeling good going into the (All-Putnam County) race next Wednesday, ... We feel like we can take the county title. We know we'll have a good race with Palatka."
Phil Johnson,"Eventually, in years to come, we hope to regain some parking in that area, but this year there's no parking due to the construction south of Edison Road,"
Phil Johnson,This was wonderful. We had to run through the wind and the rain and the sand. It was a fun afternoon. The kids enjoyed it.
Phil Johnson,"I'm expecting a lot from the boys, ... And they are hyped up."
Philip Johnson,"Raymond started industrial design and the streamlining movement,"
Philip Johnson,We do pretty much whatever we want to.
Philip Johnson,"The sale of the painting is a disservice to artists, to art, to architecture, to the architecture profession and to the public,"
Philip Johnson,"All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space."
Philip Johnson,I'm about four skyscrapers behind.
Philip Johnson,"Architects are pretty much high-class whores. We can turn down projects the way they can turn down some clients, but we've both got to say yes to someone if we want to stay in business."
Philip Johnson,All architects want to live beyond their deaths.
Philip Johnson,"I hate vacations. If you can build buildings, why sit on the beach?"

Randy Johnson,"It's clear we don't have enough workers with math and science degrees and in a workforce of 140m a cap of 65,000 is way too low. The cap has filled almost immediately over the past two years."
Randy Johnson,"When you're still making quality pitches in their third time up, you can feel your progression. I faced them three times."
Randy Johnson,"I feel pretty good overall. When I'm out there throwing batting practice, it's just what it is, batting practice. To work on my pitches and trying to get something out of it a little bit as far as some intensity."
Randy Johnson,"I do acknowledge that I have a daughter from a previous relationship, which ended years before my marriage. I have fully financially supported her and have made every effort to protect her privacy."
Randy Johnson,Last year was a good learning process. I learned a lot about what I need to adjust to this coming year. That's why I'm coming into this year feeling a lot more relaxed.

Randy Johnson,"She was star-gazing. She was looking up to the sky, and her eyes had a blank look to them. They were empty."
Randy Johnson,"Typically the northern and western side of the Sacramento Valley enjoys a head start in ground prep and planting over other areas of the valley. My son and I drove up I-5 to Willows and were amazed at the amount of water and its depth out in the fields. Usually this time of the year in this part of the valley, tractors are everywhere preparing the fields for planting."

Randy Johnson,I was barely a .500 pitcher before my dad died and I got married and had a baby... my wife and baby brought me down to earth.

Randy Johnson,I expect to win. I've never been content with anything I've ever done.
Randy Johnson,"Maybe I've lost a little, but I think everyone does over time. People have been writing that I'm getting old every year, and eventually they're going to be right. There's nobody in this game that's doing the same things they once did in the peak years of their career."
Randy Johnson,"I learned a lot from not having success, and realizing when you do have success, how hard it is to maintain it, and what you have to do to maintain it."
Randy Johnson,The word 'potential' used to hang over me like a cloud.
Randy Johnson,"I had a long conversation with Steve Carlton. He told me that on the days he pitched, he felt it was his responsibility to make everyone around him better, to lift his teammates. That's what I try to do."
Randy Johnson,"When you win, you want more of it. You can't win enough."
Randy Johnson,"I've refined my mechanics, refined my pitches. I've gotten more confidence, and I've gotten more determination. I've got a better idea what I'm doing out there."
Randy Johnson,"I threw a lot of balls and walked a lot of batters. Not something I'm proud of, but something I learned from."
Randy Johnson,"With all the adversity this team has been through, it's very gratifying to see how things panned out for everybody. It's pretty satisfying considering I haven't been as consistent as I'd like to be, and to still win 17 games ... that's pretty satisfying."
Randy Johnson,His ability is endless.
Randy Johnson,"I just wanted to stay calm and trust my ability and trust my stuff and I did that all day, ... I never deviated from what I wanted to do."
Richard Johnson,"We have a lot of space to fill, so having a nemesis that we can bash regularly just makes our job easier -- and quite a bit more fun."
Richard Johnson,I think workers are increasingly going to be on their own as they plan for retirement. They are not going to be able to rely on their employers and on the government as they have in the past.
Richard Johnson,It's always tough following a popular guy. But a lot of his ideas made sense. He impressed a lot of people.
Richard Johnson,I'm extremely thrilled. I just couldn't believe it. Things like this just don't happen everyday. It's such on honor to be considered for a performance at Carnegie Hall.
Richard Johnson,"I'm not giving interviews right now, not a word. I have nothing to say."
Richard Johnson,I believe there's a weeks worth of food in here.
Richard Johnson,I loved coming back again. There's an energy here and a feeling of interest. The students definitely were into the music once we got going. I liked that.
Richard Johnson,The danger of driving to the airport is probably greater than the danger of eating meat in Europe.
Richard Johnson,I think he felt he was part of a Hollywood community. He would do wedding announcements and birth announcements. He wasn't interested in sexual peccadilloes and drug habits. And my readers are much more interested in sexual peccadilloes and drug habits.
Richard Johnson,We are very happy that the commission took action to deny the application and preserve the floodplain.
Rick Johnson,"My first question would be about the propriety of tattoos, period. We have a responsibility of taking care of the body God has given us and maintaining it. I'm not sure that shows the best attitude toward the value of human beings."
Rick Johnson,"Every subdivision in Lawrenceville has complaints,"
Rick Johnson,It adds more choices for residents to have. Twenty years ago people would have to go into nursing homes and now they can go into assisted living.
Rick Johnson,"It seems ludicrous that's the kind of business people would be talking about. Thankfully, there's been a lot of action lately."
Robert Johnson,"The deepest thing I have to say in comment to that is that the principle work is to be done within the individual him/herself, and to learn to cope with one's own masculinity and femininity within is an absolute prerequisite before one has the right to talk about exterior relationships."
Robert Johnson,"The notion is to strengthen security, reduce hassle. Do that by creating a program that is unpredictable to the enemy."
Robert Johnson,It makes it easy in the passing game when you have guys like (our running backs) who can go the distance every time they touch it.
Robert Johnson,No other girl finished under 20 (minutes). Another very strong performance for her.
Robert Johnson,I saw the other night. He had the one-handed catch.
Robert Johnson,"[FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Matt Jones' former teammates are still enjoying his highlights.] I saw the other night, ... He had the one-handed catch."

Robert Johnson,"We think it shows when you have a force better trained, better motivated and more enthusiastic, ... this is the kind of result you get."
Robert Johnson,Guys around here grow up dreaming of playing in the SEC. But that is not a realistic option for everybody. Huntingdon is giving these guys a chance to continue playing and get a good education.
Robert Johnson,"What intrigues me about it is if you really want to create a dominant urban network that really stresses diversity, you combine a cable station like BET with a network television station focusing on urban markets like UPN, ... It would be a very attractive venture."
Robert Johnson,"Usually, they're sent overseas when there is a disaster,"
Robert Johnson,The price of cable has gone up exponentially. It's directly a result of a lack of competition.
Robert Johnson,"I don't think of it as a competition. I just do what I need to do, and improve on it."
Robert Johnson,The challenge is we're looking for people who can speak business Spanish.
Robert Johnson,We don't have the authority under law to reform CAFE standards for passenger vehicles. We need Congress to give us the authority to do passenger cars.
Robert Johnson,"At first, me not playing quarterback, I didn't want to do it, ... I'm an athlete, so maybe coach Leach saw something in me, so I didn't complain. I'm out here making plays, so I'm just going to keep on doing what I'm doing."
Robert Johnson,History seems to be so clumsy.
Robert Johnson,I had a patient once who dreamed she kept her husband in the deep freeze except for mating. Lots of men feel that way.
Robert Johnson,"Nothing will see us through the age we're entering but high consciousness, and that comes hard. We don't have a good, modern myth yet, and we need one."
Robert Johnson,"A man will treat a woman almost exactly the way he treats his own interior feminine. In fact, he hasn't the ability to see a woman, objectively speaking, until he has made some kind of peace with his interior woman."
Robert Johnson,"If she has a good, strong, reliable father image, which is hard to find these days, that will be her image of men, probably for the rest of her life. She'll look for a husband who embodies those qualities."
Robert Johnson,"History has always been a series of pendulum swings, but the individual doesn't have to get caught in that."
Robert Johnson,Employees who are old enough to retire don't necessarily want to. (Federal age discrimination law) prohibits disparate treatment based on age and forbids forced retirement.
Samuel Johnson,"Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful."
Samuel Johnson,"In the decline of life shame and grief are of short duration; whether it be that we bear easily what we have borne long; or that, finding ourselves in age less regarded, we less regard others; or, that we look with slight regard upon afflictions to w"
Samuel Johnson,"Youth enters the world with very happy prejudices in her own favor. She imagines herself not only certain of accomplishing every adventure, but of obtaining those rewards which the accomplishment may deserve. She is not easily persuaded to believe that the force of merit can be resisted by obstinacy and avarice, or its luster darkened by envy and malignity."
Samuel Johnson,"So different are the colors of life, as we look forward to the future, or backward to the past; and so different the opinions and sentiments which this contrariety of appearance naturally produces, that the conversation of the old and young ends generally with contempt or pity on either side."
Samuel Johnson,"The greatest part of a writer's time is spent in reading, in order to write; a man will turn over half a library to make one book."
Samuel Johnson,"In all pointed sentences, some degree of accuracy must be sacrificed to conciseness."
Samuel Johnson,"I know not, Madam, that you have a right, upon moral principles, to make your readers suffer so much."
Samuel Johnson,He is no wise man who will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.
Samuel Johnson,"Wickedness is always easier than virtue, for it takes a short cut to everything."
Samuel Johnson,Virtue is too often merely local.
Samuel Johnson,The wise man applauds he who he thinks most virtuous; the rest of the world applauds the wealthy.
Samuel Johnson,The longer we live the more we think and the higher the value we put on friendship and tenderness towards parents and friends.
Samuel Johnson,"Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an understanding."
Samuel Johnson,Power is not sufficient evidence of truth
Samuel Johnson,"This mournful truth is ev'rywhere confess'd,- Slow rises worth by poverty depress'd"
Samuel Johnson,"Except during the nine months before he draws his first breath, no man manages his affairs as well as a tree. We are inclined to believe those whom we do not know because they have never deceived us."
Samuel Johnson,"He that travels in theory has no inconveniences; he has shade and sunshine at his disposal, and wherever he alights finds tables of plenty and looks of gaiety. These ideas are indulged till the day of departure arrives, the chaise is called, and the progress of happiness begins. A few miles teach him the fallacies of imagination. The road is dusty, the air is sultry, the horses are sluggish. He longs for the time of dinner that he may eat and rest. The inn is crowded, his orders are neglected, and nothing remains but that he devour in haste what the cook has spoiled, and drive on in quest of better entertainment. He finds at night a more commodious house, but the best is always worse than he expected."
Samuel Johnson,"As the Spanish proverb says, ''He who would bring home the wealth of the Indies, must carry the wealth of the Indies with him.'' So it is in travelling; a man must carry knowledge with him, if he would bring home knowledge."
Samuel Johnson,"The use of traveling is to regulate imagination by reality, and instead of thinking how things may be, to see them as they are."
Samuel Johnson,"In traveling, a man must carry knowledge with him, if he would bring home knowledge."
Samuel Johnson,Worth seeing? Yes; but not worth going to see.
Samuel Johnson,Sorrow is the rust of the soul and activity will cleanse and brighten it.
Samuel Johnson,"There is no wisdom in useless and hopeless sorrow, but there is something in it so like virtue, that he who is wholly without it cannot be loved."
Samuel Johnson,"Sorrow is a kind of rust of the soul, which every new idea contributes in its passage to scour away. It is the putrefaction of stagnant life, and is remedied by exercise and motion."
Samuel Johnson,"If you are idle, be not solitary; if you are solitary, be not idle."
Samuel Johnson,"Solitude is dangerous to reason, without being favorable to virtue. Remember that the solitary mortal is certainly luxurious, probably superstitious, and possibly mad."

Samuel Johnson,"Nay, Madam, when you are declaiming, declaim; and when you are calculating, calculate."
Samuel Johnson,Life will not bear refinement. You must do as other people do.
Samuel Johnson,"You hesitate to stab me with a word, and know not - silence is the sharper sword"
Samuel Johnson,"My Dear Sir:  Are you playing the same trick again, and trying who can keep silence longest?  Remember that all tricks are either knavish or childish; and that it is as foolish to make experiments upon the constancy of a friend as upon the chastity o"
Samuel Johnson,"He that undervalues himself will undervalue others, and he that undervalues others will oppress them."
Samuel Johnson,That kind of life is most happy which affords us most opportunities of gaining our own esteem.
Samuel Johnson,Security will produce danger.
Samuel Johnson,"Where secrecy or mystery begins, vice or roguery is not far off."
Samuel Johnson,To keep your secret is wisdom; but to expect others to keep it is folly.
Samuel Johnson,The vanity of being known to be trusted with a secret is generally one of the chief motives to disclose it.
Samuel Johnson,"It is better to live rich, than to die rich."
Samuel Johnson,"It is wonderful to think how men of very large estates not only spend their yearly income, but are often actually in want of money. It is clear, they have not value for what they spend."
Samuel Johnson,"One cause, which is not always observed, of the insufficiency of riches, is that they very seldom make their owner rich."
Samuel Johnson,"Don't think of retiring from the world until the world will be sorry that you retire. I hate a fellow whom pride or cowardice or laziness drive into a corner, and who does nothing when he is there but sit and growl. Let him come out as I do, and bark."
Samuel Johnson,"The blaze of reputation cannot be blown out, but it often dies in the socket; a very few names may be considered as perpetual lamps that shine unconsumed."
Samuel Johnson,He that embarks on the voyage of life will always wish to advance rather by the impulse of the wind than the strokes of the oar; and many fold in their passage; while they lie waiting for the gale.''
Samuel Johnson,"He is a benefactor of mankind who contracts the great rules of life into short sentences, that may be easily impressed on the memory, and so recur habitually to the mind."

Samuel Johnson,Pride is seldom delicate; it will please itself with very mean advantages.
Samuel Johnson,Prejudice not being funded on reason cannot be removed by argument.
Samuel Johnson,"The real satisfaction which praise can afford, is when what is repeated aloud agrees with the whispers of conscience, by showing us that we have not endeavored to deserve well in vain."
Samuel Johnson,"He who praises everybody, praises nobody."
Samuel Johnson,"A continual feast of commendation is only to be obtained by merit or by wealth: many are therefore obliged to content themselves with single morsels, and recompense the infrequency of their enjoyment by excess and riot, whenever fortune sets the banquet before them."
Samuel Johnson,"This mournful truth is everywhere confessed, slow rises worth by poverty depressed."
Samuel Johnson,"Poverty is often concealed in splendor, and often in extravagance. It is the task of many people to conceal their neediness from others. Consequently they support themselves by temporary means, and everyday is lost in contriving for tomorrow."
Samuel Johnson,"Nature makes us poor only when we want necessaries, but custom gives the name of poverty to the want of superfluities."
Samuel Johnson,"Resolve not to be poor: whatever you have, spend less. Poverty is a great enemy to human happiness; it certainly destroys liberty, and it makes some virtues impracticable, and others extremely difficult."
Samuel Johnson,"It is the great privilege of poverty to be happy and yet unenvied, to be healthy with physic, secure without a guard, and to obtain from the bounty of nature what the great and wealthy are compelled to procure by the help of art."
Samuel Johnson,Pleasure is very seldom found where it is sought. Our brightest blazes are commonly kindled by unexpected sparks.
Samuel Johnson,"If pleasure was not followed by pain, who would forbear it?"

Samuel Johnson,Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.
Samuel Johnson,"In all evils which admits a remedy, impatience should be avoided, because it wastes the time and attention in complaints which, if properly applied, might remove the cause."
Samuel Johnson,"Pleasure that is obtained by unreasonable and unsuitable cost, must always end in pain."
Samuel Johnson,He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.
Samuel Johnson,Pain is less subject than pleasure to careless expression.
Samuel Johnson,"Difficult do you call it, Sir? I wish it were impossible."
Samuel Johnson,"Men know that women are an over-match for them, and therefore they choose the weakest or most ignorant. If they did not think so, they never could be afraid of women knowing as much as themselves."

Samuel Johnson,What is read twice is usually remembered more than what is once written.

Samuel Johnson,"When making your choice in life, do not neglect to live"
Samuel Johnson,"Prudence keeps life safe, but it does not often make it happy."
Samuel Johnson,"Prudence operates on life in the same manner as rule of composition; it produces vigilance rather than elevation; rather prevents loss than procures advantage; and often miscarriages, but seldom reaches either power or honor."
Samuel Johnson,"Money and time are the heaviest burdens of life, and the unhappiest of all mortals are those who have more of either than they know how to use."

Samuel Johnson,"Turn on the prudent ant thy heedful eyes. Observe her labors, sluggard, and be wise."
Samuel Johnson,Nature has given women so much power that the law has very wisely given them little.
Samuel Johnson,Lawyers know life practically. A bookish man should always have them to converse with.
Samuel Johnson,"I would be loath to speak ill of any person who I do not know deserves it, but I am afraid he is an attorney."
Samuel Johnson,"What provokes your risibility, Sir? Have I said anything that you understand? Then I ask pardon of the rest of the company."
Samuel Johnson,Language is the dress of thought.
Samuel Johnson,"Language is only the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas."
Samuel Johnson,"I am always sorry when any language is lost, because languages are the pedigrees of nations."
Samuel Johnson,"Labor, if it were not necessary for existence, would be indispensable for the happiness of man."
Samuel Johnson,Excellence in any department can be attained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at a lesser price.
Samuel Johnson,Man is not weak; knowledge is more than equivalent to force.
Samuel Johnson,"Knowledge is of two kinds: We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information about it."
Samuel Johnson,Knowledge is more than equivalent to force.
Samuel Johnson,"Knowledge always demands increase; it is like fire, which must first be kindled by some external agent, but will afterwards always propagate itself."
Samuel Johnson,That observation which is called knowledge of the world will be found much more frequently to make men cunning than good.
Samuel Johnson,"Wine gives a man nothing. It neither gives him knowledge nor wit; it only animates a man, and enables him to bring out what a dread of the company has repressed. It only puts in motion what had been locked up in frost."
Samuel Johnson,The next best thing to knowing something is knowing where to find it.
Samuel Johnson,"I have found men to be more kind than I expected, and less just."
Samuel Johnson,To cultivate kindness is a valuable part of the business of life.
Samuel Johnson,"To act from pure benevolence is not possible for finite human beings, Human benevolence is mingled with vanity, interest, or some other motive."
Samuel Johnson,"A Judge may be a farmer; but he is not to geld his own pigs. A Judge may play a little at cards for his own amusement; but he is not to play at marbles, or chuck farthing in the Piazza."

Samuel Johnson,"I am a great friend to public amusements, for they keep the people from vice."
Samuel Johnson,"I hate mankind, for I think of myself as one of the best of them, and I know how bad I am."
Samuel Johnson,"Great abilities are not requisite for an Historian; for in historical composition, all the greatest powers of the human mind are quiescent. He has facts ready to his hand; so there is no exercise of invention. Imagination is not required in any degree; only about as much as is used in the lowest kinds of poetry. Some penetration, accuracy, and coloring, will fit a man for the task, if he can give the application which is necessary."
Samuel Johnson,Claret is the liquor for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero must drink brandy.
Samuel Johnson,For who is pleased with himself.
Samuel Johnson,"To strive with difficulties, and to conquer them, is the highest human felicity."
Samuel Johnson,"Sir, that all who are happy, are equally happy, is not true. A peasant and a philosopher may be equally satisfied, but not equally happy. Happiness consists in the multiplicity of agreeable consciousness."

Samuel Johnson,"Where grief is fresh, any attempt to divert it only irritates"
Samuel Johnson,"While grief is fresh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You must wait till it be digested, and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it."
Samuel Johnson,"Avarice is generally the last passion of those lives of which the first part has been squandered in pleasure, and the second devoted to ambition. He that sinks under the fatigue of getting wealth, lulls his age with the milder business of saving it."
Samuel Johnson,The superiority of some men is merely local. They are great because their associates are little.
Samuel Johnson,No one ever became great by imitation.
Samuel Johnson,"He was dull in a new way, and that made many think him great."

Samuel Johnson,"He that tries to recommend (Shakespeare) by select quotations, will succeed like the pedant in Hierocles, who, when he offered his house to sale, carried a brick in his pocket as a specimen"
Samuel Johnson,To let friendship die away by negligence and silence is certainly not wise. It is voluntarily to throw away one of the greatest comforts of the weary pilgrimage.
Samuel Johnson,The endearing elegance of female friendship.
Samuel Johnson,"Never, my dear Sir, do you take it into your head that I do not love you; you may settle yourself in full confidence both of my love and my esteem; I love you as a kind man, I value you as a worthy man, and hope in time to reverence you as a man of exemplary piety."
Samuel Johnson,"I look upon every day to be lost, in which I do not make a new acquaintance."

Samuel Johnson,Life has no pleasure higher or nobler than that of friendship
Samuel Johnson,All theory is against freedom of the will; all experience for it.

Samuel Johnson,The triumph of hope over experience
Samuel Johnson,"I know not anything more pleasant, or more instructive, than to compare experience with expectation, or to register from time to time the difference between idea and reality. It is by this kind of observation that we grow daily less liable to be disappointed."
Samuel Johnson,"The appearance and retirement of actors are the great events of the theatrical world; and their first performances fill the pit with conjecture and prognostication, as the first actions of a new monarch agitate nations with hope and fear"
Samuel Johnson,"Subordination tends greatly to human happiness. Were we all upon an equality, we should have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleasure."

Samuel Johnson,"It is better that some should be unhappy than that none should be happy, which would be the case in a general state of equality."

Samuel Johnson,"A am a great friend of public amusements, they keep people from vice."
Samuel Johnson,"Fear is implanted in us as a preservative from evil; but its duty, like that of other passions, is not to overbear reason, but to assist it. It should not be suffered to tyrannize"
Samuel Johnson,"It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than open one's mouth and remove all doubt."

Samuel Johnson,"If your determination is fixed, I do not counsel you to despair. Few things are impossible to diligence and skill. Great works are performed not by strength, but perseverance."
Samuel Johnson,"Idleness and timidity often despair without being overcome, and forbear attempts for fear of being defeated; and we may promote the invigoration of faint endeavors, by showing what has already been performed"
Samuel Johnson,"Let him who desires to see others happy, make haste to give while his gift can be enjoyed, and remember that every moment of delay takes away something from the value of his benefaction"
Samuel Johnson,"The two great movers of the human mind are the desire for good, and the fear of evil"
Samuel Johnson,"Some desire is necessary to keep life in motion, and he whose real wants are supplied must admit those of fancy."
Samuel Johnson,"Life is a progress from want to want, not from enjoyment to enjoyment."
Samuel Johnson,"The present time is seldom able to fill desire or imagination with immediate enjoyment, and we are forced to supply its deficiencies by recollection or anticipation."
Samuel Johnson,"I have always considered it as treason against the great republic of human nature, to make any man's virtues the means of deceiving him."

Samuel Johnson,Curiosity is one of the most permanent and certain characteristics of a vigorous intellect.
Samuel Johnson,"Criticism, as it was first instituted by Aristotle, was meant as a standard of judging well."
Samuel Johnson,"Criticism is a study by which men grow important and formidable at very small expense. He whom nature has made weak, and idleness keeps ignorant, may yet support his vanity by the name of a critic."
Samuel Johnson,I would rather be attacked than unnoticed. For the worst thing you can do to an author is to be silent as to his works. An assault upon a town is a bad thing; but starving it is still worse.
Samuel Johnson,"There are innumerable questions to which the inquisitive mind can in this state receive no answer: Why do you and I exist? Why was this world created? Since it was to be created, why was it not created sooner?"
Samuel Johnson,"I hate a fellow whom pride, or cowardice, or laziness drives into a corner, and who does nothing when he is there but sit and growl; let him come out as I do, and bark."

Samuel Johnson,"Shame arises from the fear of men, conscience from the fear of God."
Samuel Johnson,"Those who attain to any excellence commonly spend life in some single pursuit, for excellence is not often gained upon easier terms."
Samuel Johnson,Life cannot subsist in society but by reciprocal concessions.
Samuel Johnson,"Hunger is never delicate; they who are seldom gorged to the full with praise may be safely fed with gross compliments, for the appetite must be satisfied before it is disgusted."
Samuel Johnson,"By taking a second wife he pays the highest compliment to the first, by showing that she made him so happy as a married man, that he wishes to be so a second time."
Samuel Johnson,"To hear complaints with patience, even when complaints are vain, is one of the duties of friendship"
Samuel Johnson,"When any anxiety or gloom of the mind takes hold of you, make it a rule not to publish it by complaining; but exert yourselves to hide it, and by endeavoring to hide it you drive it away."
Samuel Johnson,The usual fortune of complaint is to excite contempt more than pity.
Samuel Johnson,"The wretched have no compassion, they can do good only from strong principles of duty."
Samuel Johnson,"There is, indeed, nothing that so much seduces reason from vigilance, as the thought of passing life with an amiable woman."

Samuel Johnson,"It is better to suffer wrong than to do it, and happier to be sometimes cheated than not to trust."
Samuel Johnson,There are charms made only for distance admiration.

Samuel Johnson,"I have thought of a pulley to raise me gradually; but that would give me pain, as it would counteract my natural inclination.

Samuel Johnson,"The trade of advertising is now so near perfection that it is not easy to propose any improvement. But as every art ought to be exercised in due subordination to the public good, I cannot but propose it as a moral question to these masters of the public ear, whether they do not sometimes play too wantonly with our passions."
Samuel Johnson,"Adversity leads us to think properly of our state, and so is most beneficial to us"
Samuel Johnson,Things don't go wrong and break your heart so you can become bitter and give up. They happen to break you down and build you up so you can be all that you were intended to be.

Scott Johnson,Tough times breed tough men and we are taking a tough team to Dublin to play tough rugby. We are going to look squarely in the face of adversity and show a different side to our characters this weekend.
Scott Johnson,"The luck was not with us. That's rugby, those decisions can go either way. But I'm not John McEnroe, I don't complain about every line call."
Scott Johnson,They get in a cycle. They don't have economic development or the high land value they need to raise the revenue they need for good schools. And they can't attract businesses for economic development without good schools.

Scott Johnson,"If 'Knuckles' (Connolly) is coming over, I am sure he will pay me a visit, there will be no doubt about that."
Scott Johnson,"We need to do what is in the best interests of Gareth Thomas in this situation, listen to the doctors' advice and leave him at home to rest.

We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to have him back with us soon."

Scott Johnson,"A lot of my anxiety was returning to a class full of kids who had known me as one person and coming back as, what I felt, a different person."

Steve Johnson,It is so hard to have principles and have anything to do with television.

Steve Johnson,"It will be difficult because you have a lot of history behind all of these things and a culture of government has grown up, and so changing that _ not only in the minds of local officials but in the minds of the electorate as well _ is a long-term task."

Tom Johnson,I had no idea. It?s a huge honor.
Tom Johnson,"In a world of music where success is defined by gold or platinum, our friend Phil Walden was best defined by his heart of gold."
Tom Johnson,"I was happy with the play of the team, especially with our defensive play. To give up five goals in four games is a real accomplishment for this team. We have been able to play all four lines most of the time, and I think that has really helped us in the third period wearing teams down."
Tom Johnson,a minimum number of thoughts and emotions.
Tom Johnson,They have a hand in a lot of the decisions. They own a lot of what we're doing.
Tom Johnson,"So much of my self worth was tied with my position. It felt like I was being enveloped in darkness. It was a sense of loss of enthusiasm, a loss of happiness, a significant decline in self worth."
Tom Johnson,"It was kind of surprising that nobody from (Southern Miss) got drafted. I don't know who's to blame for that, but it was kind of crazy."
Tony Johnson,"I'm talking about folks with good jobs who work here in Greenwich, who work for the hospital, who work for the school. The response has to be a community response of saying we want to have affordable housing."
Tony Johnson,"The town has some decisions to make, because it's going to change the character of this community. Greenwich is going to have decisions to make about what kind of community it wants to be, and that would have to include providing housing for the citizens of Greenwich."
Tony Johnson,"We wanted to maintain the integrity of the older home, preserving the charm and feel."
Virginia Johnson,Sure! Why should any experts be the arbiters... That's like telling someone they can't be a vegetarian.

Walter Johnson,You can't hit what you can't see.

Andrew Johnston,The feel of small-town America is still strong here.
Craig Johnston,I want to learn from this mistake and learn what I have to. I feel real bad about this. Parents were watching. I wasn't trying to pull anything.
Craig Johnston,"We came here tonight feeling like we could be balanced on offense, but you know how it goes: As the game went on, we tried to see what they were giving us, and the running game ended up being the key to the win for us. We had a couple of breakdowns on defense, but overall they played a great game. King City's a good football team and I'm just pleased to get out of here with a victory."
Craig Johnston,There is a reason I sit up in the booth and observe. I have a lot of faith in my staff.
Craig Johnston,I'm not denying anything. I wasn't trying to deceive anyone. But it was wrong. I overstepped the rule. It has happened before. But it won't happen in the future. I should have known better.
Mike Johnston,Our customer diversification continues as non-Ford sales were 36 percent of total sales in the second quarter and we continue to win new business with these customers in our key growth products.
Mike Johnston,We feel like we've made significant progress.

Mike Johnston,Water is Michigan's natural economic advantage. The legislation ensures water will always be available to create high paying manufacturing jobs for Michigan citizens.
Mike Johnston,"You saw everything, ... You saw one group on horses. How far they were going I don't know, but they were on horses on Interstate 10. We saw pickup trucks with people in wheelchairs, dogs, cats, you name it. ... It was unbelievable."
Mike Johnston,"It's nice to have (Perez) because he's tough up in between the tackles, ... and you have to honor (Hicks) because of his speed. And then (Craig) Smith can come in with nice quickness with the counters between the tackles. Sometimes teams will forget about him."
Mike Johnston,"If our viewers were worried about one specific thing, ... it was where 'Jeopardy!' and 'Wheel of Fortune' were going to be."
Mike Johnston,It is our duty to provide storm coverage. It's part of our license - to serve the public. That's one of the differences between over-the-air and cable stations.

Mo Johnston,"We are very excited to get Marvell. He has strength and pace, and those two qualities will make for a very good defender in this league."
Mo Johnston,"We are excited to add another quality striker to our club. Jean Philippe is a strong, quick forward who is very good in the air. He has proven he can score goals in this league and we believe he can contribute to our team immediately."
Mo Johnston,"He's physical, he's strong and he's fast and with Edson next to him we could give teams real problems."
Mo Johnston,"When you look at it, we're building, it takes time, there's still teething problems. Come Sunday, it's a brand new team again because nobody's ever played with Edson, nobody's played with Danny, [and] Amado hasn't been on the field much."
Mo Johnston,It was interesting. It was good practice. It's always good to see them in a different light so we put them on the big field. There were a few plusses and a few minuses.
Mo Johnston,There's no question it all has been a distraction. Practice this week has been (bad) and part of it is not knowing what is going to happen. We need to put it all behind us and focus on D.C. because if we don't we are going to lose.
Mo Johnston,He fit right in. He is a very talented kid who has the potential to be a great player in this league.
Mo Johnston,"From our standpoint, our performance was totally unacceptable."
Mo Johnston,I told him about it at halftime. He buckled down in the second half when in the past he might have been sent off.
Mo Johnston,"Bob is a good friend, and now I'm picking up the pieces. But it's my opportunity to move the team forward. It's an emotional day, tough on the players, tough on the staff."
Mo Johnston,There was a nice buildup of about six or seven passes and Eddie did a great job of keeping his composure and finishing.
Mo Johnston,"It doesn't matter if they're hurt or not. It doesn't matter to me whether they play or not. They're going to be banged up anyway, because when they come in here they're in for a fight."
Mo Johnston,"Magnificent. He's been magnificent all season. There is a door open now for the World Cup and I hope he's on it because of his performance here, not only tonight, but throughout his time here has been tremendous."
Mo Johnston,"It's a tremendous honor. He deserves it. He's been the best goalkeeper in this league for the last 10 years, by far."
Mo Johnston,I might never see him. [But] we're just happy to have him.
Mo Johnston,"So far, Johnny X has shown a bit more than most. He's one for the future. He's one that you look at and spend some time on. He's a threat. He has good pace. He's got an eye for the goal."
Mo Johnston,"He's still great at 40. It's great to see him still doing it, and it's fun to watch."
Mo Johnston,Magee has had a very good training camp. He has worked on his fitness and it shows. His finishing this entire camp has been in a different class.
Mo Johnston,It's all about fitness. I'm not interested in the result. I'm interested in seeing certain things. Mike Magee's been great. He's been great the whole preseason. I'm very pleased with him.
Mo Johnston,"I'm not a quitter, I'm in here fighting and I'll always stand by my players. That's the way I've always been. Hopefully I can look them in the eye on Wednesday night and they can give me a good performance."
Mo Johnston,"He has a wealth of experience, national team, obviously [a] championship here in MLS. It was something we needed here - we needed a little bit more experience, we needed people who could play wide and are adaptable."
Mo Johnston,D.C. was the better team. There's no way I'm going to stand up here and make excuses when we got beat 4-1.
Mo Johnston,"He's had a tremendous camp. His pace is unbelievable and his recovery is tremendous. There's no doubt in my eyes that you're going to see a Rookie of the Year come the end of the season. There's no one running by him and he just needs to get better in his positioning. Mark my words, he's going to be Rookie of the Year come the end of the season."
Mo Johnston,"Obviously, we need a little more confidence. We're lacking it at the moment."
Mo Johnston,"I'm excited. I would like it to have been under different circumstances, but that's just the way the nature of this game is."
Mo Johnston,I've spoken to Michael. He's a strong character. He has an opportunity to step on the field [tonight] and help us get three points.
Mo Johnston,A lot of people say he's a 35-year-old with a 30-year-old body. He's very fit.
Robert Johnston,Northrop Grumman has been aggressively pursuing emerging technologies to combat the growing threat from mines. The transformational mine-detection technology used in ALMDS is critical for creating safer passage around the world for our servicemen and women.
Robert Johnston,Clearly some operational issues need to be addressed. These are just lost sales and frustrated customers that may never come back.
Robert Johnston,"The last couple of quarters we've talked publicly about being dissatisfied with the performance. It was going south, so we thought this was a good time because we think we can bring value to the company."
Robert Johnston,"It's a big headache and I knew I wasn't going to make any money off it, but I have a love for the game and a love for the community."
Robert Johnston,"Obviously, you can't increase the price until you do the due diligence. That was putting the cart before the horse."
Martin Jol,"He has been involved in three of the four goals we have scored so far (this season), so that is very pleasing,"
Martin Jol,"If you have two small strikers against two big centre-backs, then you need to move to cause them problems,"
Martin Jol,"I feel we can still improve further. I don't think we've played to our potential, but you can't expect that yet. We have a lot of new faces and we are jelling together."
Martin Jol,"You know our philosophy, we want young players at this club and if they are already internationals like Jermaine it is always a very good thing for us."
Martin Jol,If he can play with the pain it will be okay - but it is a problem.
Martin Jol,"I thought for a long time on Friday night about whether I should play them all but in some cases I did not have other options,"
Martin Jol,It was frustrating that we had a man sent off because it killed the game. I don't think the referee made the right decision.
Martin Jol,"It was frustrating that we had a man sent off,"
Martin Jol,I'm focussed on this club. This is my first club as a manager and I love this club. My plan is to stay here.
Martin Jol,We know that so many other clubs would love to lure him from us so we are really pleased he has agreed a new deal.
Martin Jol,In the last home game Defoe and Keane played well.
Martin Jol,They are very strong at home. It will be very difficult and ideally we would have had a bigger gap.

Martin Jol,This is one of the biggest clubs in Europe and I want to be a part of its history.
Martin Jol,"We aren't scoring goals, and we don't look like scoring goals, which is even worse and is not good enough,"
Martin Jol,"We had the chances, I can't complain about that. It is all about scoring goals."
Martin Jol,I still have a bad taste about the first goal. In Europe there won't be a lot of linesmen giving this as a goal. You can't tell your defenders to keep a high line if they are given goals like this.
Martin Jol,If we are a bit cleverer we can win these sorts of games. Last year we could not do it and I think we have improved in certain areas and it showed.
Martin Jol,"We still have nine games -- four home, five away - and against rivals as well so it will be exciting stuff until the end."
Martin Jol,"Before the game we would have taken this result because we had a few key players injured and this was our fourth match in nine days,"
Martin Jol,I think we punished ourselves. I can't remember a game in which we played so well and we're still 2-0 down. The first goal was lack of experience and then they had a break. It is a big disappointment because we had five chances before that. You cannot give away goals against top sides.
Martin Jol,"The coach must fit our profile -- a coach who understands the Dutch league and offensive and distinctive football. We need to find a solution soon, so someone is in place for next season."
Martin Jol,There are so many aspects at a football club which support the playing side and it is important to have someone to focus on these at the club. He is highly rated in his field and I am delighted that he has chosen to come to us. I am looking forward to working with him and have told him that it is a great time to be joining this club.
Martin Jol,"We have the players to play football and we have to take the game to Liverpool _ sometimes you have to try and put teams like Liverpool on the back foot. You want to get the initiative in the game and create opportunities, otherwise you'll have no chance."
Martin Jol,"Everybody is fighting for a European spot, and every game is a big fight. Today, I think we were a bit fortunate."
Martin Jol,"We have a terrific young squad but we lack a winning mentality which you can only get through experience. He has the mentality to help us make a big step. Everybody tells me we have the players, but we have to prove it. Away from home we have to do better. Edgar can help us."
Martin Jol,"We are still sick as parrots [over the Grimsby defeat], because it was the shortest way to Europe but tonight it was all right. I think we deserved the win."
Martin Jol,Andy is out for the Christmas period.
Martin Jol,"It was signed earlier this week when the chairman came back from America,"
Angelina Jolie,"Figure out who you are separate from your family, and the man or woman you're in a relationship with. Find who you are in this world and what you need to feel good alone.

Angelina Jolie,"It is wonderful to hear of the relief efforts that are finally coming to New Orleans and the rest of the region, but as well all know, it is simply not going to be enough."
Angelina Jolie,"I'm extremely honest, and I pride myself on it. I don't try to be shocking. I'm playful, and I know when something I'm saying is maybe shocking, but it's just the truth, I never wanted to be scary to people or upsetting to people. I simply want to live the way I need to live."
Angelina Jolie,"I'm planning on it,"
Angelina Jolie,"Without pain, there would be no suffering, without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes. To make it right, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, without it, there is no way of life."
Angelina Jolie,I need someone physically stronger than me.... I am always on top. It's really unfortunate. I am begging for the man that can put me on the bottom. Or the woman. Anybody that can take me down.
Angelina Jolie,"I knew nothing about their marriage. ... It's obviously been difficult with all this ... going on, ... I've been tied to everybody I ever worked with."
Angelina Jolie,The federal government's response must be dramatically increased in order to prevent a further loss of life.
Angelina Jolie,"We come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly... Only after we have lost everything, are we free to do anything... Throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers to anything and see if people understand"
Angelina Jolie,On furnishing her new house: I saw these plastic horses - we'll have them instead of chairs. People will climb in the saddle to sit.
Angelina Jolie,"I don't think the money people in Hollywood have ever thought I was normal, but I am dedicated to my work and that's what counts."
Angelina Jolie,"I think all women go through periods where we hate this about ourselves, we don't like that. It's great to get to a place where you dismiss anything you're worried about. I find flaws attractive. I find scars attractive."
Angelina Jolie,"I don't believe in guilt, I believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person, and don't judge people in your life. I think you should live completely free."
Angelina Jolie,I am odd-looking. I sometimes think I look like a funny Muppet.
Angelina Jolie,"It's just kind of funny. ... If (Brad) saw this, he would probably understand why I was laughing. Because I just don't know how to address that kind of thing."
Angelina Jolie,I'm odd looking. Sometimes I think I look like a funny muppet.
Angelina Jolie,"If I make a fool of myself, who cares? I'm not frightened by anyone's perception of me."
Angelina Jolie,"I ... I don't even know. They're all the same, every single one of them. From wanting to scratch eyes out to you name it,"
Angelina Jolie,There's another disaster that could happen very soon.
Angelina Jolie,"We are at a unique threshold in human history, where the crisis we face in Africa is matched only by our degree of hope that we can and will be a force for positive change, ... I'm hopeful that increased awareness of the issues in Africa will bring about a new wave of progress and activism among young people everywhere."
Angelina Jolie,"If you have enough people sitting around telling you you're wonderful, then you start believing you're fabulous, then someone tells you you stink and you believe that too!"
Angelina Jolie,"I've realized that being happy is a choice. You never want to rub anybody the wrong way or not be fun to be around, but you have to be happy. When I get logical and I don't trust my instincts - Thats when I get in trouble."
Angelina Jolie,"I like everything. Boyish girls, girlish boys, the heavy and the skinny. Which is a problem when I'm walking down the street."
Angelina Jolie,She's like ? she has gained 6 pounds. ... We are calling her chubby. ... Good Morning America.
Angelina Jolie,"There are so many wonderful places. There are many parts of Asia, Africa, South America, so sooner or later I'll end up everywhere, I'm sure."
Angelina Jolie,I always play women I would date.
Angelina Jolie,"When I get logical, and I don't trust my instincts - that's when I get in trouble."
Lil Jon,[Miami] is just the perfect city. The good thing is you can go to two or three parties a night.
Lil Jon,I'm just happy to be honored as someone who's making music.
Lil Jon,"Basically 50 and Scrappy were already good friends, ... While we were out on tour, 50 came to me with the business proposition, and we sat down and worked it out."
Andruw Jones,It's great to see. There's a lot of talent down there.
Andruw Jones,I wanted to go out there and start something. I felt good in batting practice.
Andruw Jones,It's good to see our starting pitchers go out and perform the way they did the past two days. I'm really proud of the way they've been pitching.
Andruw Jones,We just take advantage when he makes mistakes.
Andruw Jones,"Things didn't go our way. [We made] a couple of mistakes, and not taking advantage when we had opportunities. Then they took over again."
Andruw Jones,"We just take advantage when [Nats starter Livan Hernandez] makes mistakes,"
Andruw Jones,When guys make mistakes you have to take advantage. He made a mistake with the fastball the first time.
Andruw Jones,[Martinez] just made a mistake. He made less mistakes than our pitcher and that's why they came out on top.
Andruw Jones,"If you have the love for the game, you're going to do whatever your heart wants to do. You've got the ability to play this game, take care of yourself. Look at Julio Franco. He's 47 and he's still playing."
Andruw Jones,"Hank Aaron's in the Hall of Fame; it's a good record. But I don't worry about it. My goal this year was not to hit 40 home runs, but just to improve my consistency. When the season's over, that's when I'll look at that stuff."
Andruw Jones,Baseball isn't about money. I want to play the game for my country and have a good time. I'll get my at-bats and hopefully I'll be ready when I get back to the Braves. I just want to play the game.
Andruw Jones,"It was close, but I had it. You don't trap balls with your hand like that. When I came up there was no dirt or grass on the ball."
Bobby Jones,Sometimes the game of golf is just too difficult to endure with a golf club in your hands.
Bobby Jones,"Golf is assuredly a mystifying game. It would seem that if a person has hit a golf ball correctly a thousand times, he should be able to duplicate the performance at will. But this is certainly not the case."
Bobby Jones,"During the season on Saturdays, I usually sleep in until about 1."
Bobby Jones,Cornell? I don't know why we're really playing that game. It messes up our rest.
Bobby Jones,I don't know why it's been that way. It's just kind of weird.
Bobby Jones,We wanted to do something to show our gratitude. We will never forget what Sergeant Jordan did for us.
Bobby Jones,Nicklaus plays a kind of golf with which I am not familiar.
Bobby Jones,Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half-inch course...the space between your ears.
Bobby Jones,"It doesn't matter that we've never seen the family. They lost someone defending our freedom, and we owe them more gratitude than we can ever give them. We're really happy to be able to do this."
Bobby Jones,"We're feeling pretty good right now. With our [No. 10] ranking, there's been a lot of criticism and skepticism, people saying we aren't playing up to our ranking. But that's just how it is. It could have been bad [after the WSU loss], but we ended up turning it around and making it good."
Bobby Jones,They probably had a couple of things up their sleeves. Coach saw the sombreros. They had to keep it to a certain point. I'm happy they didn't (say nasty things). It would have just brought negative attention to us.
Bobby Jones,"When I'm a little fatigued, sometimes I baby it. I don't try to do it. I'm not 100 percent. I probably won't be the rest of conference play. I just have to play through it. I've never really been injured before."
Bobby Jones,Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half-inch course... the space between your ears.
Bobby Jones,You might as well praise a man for not robbing a bank.
Bobby Jones,The secret of golf is to turn three shots into two.
Bobby Jones,Some people think they are concentrating when they're merely worrying.
Bobby Jones,"If ever I needed an eight foot putt, and everything I owned depended on it, I would want Arnold Palmer to putt for me."
Bobby Jones,It is nothing new or original to say that golf is played one stroke at a time. But it took me many years to realize it.
Bruce Jones,"The best scenario is the truth about what happens comes out, ... There is a problem in the way officers responded to this incident and their use of deadly force. It's not only what the standard is, its how you train your officers to apply that standard and minimize the use of deadly force."
Bruce Jones,The initial response is always to blame the police and CHP.
Bruce Jones,"When I met with police, we told them the only thing we wanted out of this was integrity of the investigation, so that this doesn't ever happen to another family,"
Bruce Jones,Peoples' lives are changed forever by these accidents. Three fatalities in the last two months qualify that road as extremely dangerous.
Bruce Jones,"Our immediate focus is reduction of speed, enhanced enforcement and center-safety barriers to reduce serious and fatal accidents."
Charles ''Tremendous'' Jones,Leaders are readers.
Charles ''Tremendous'' Jones,"If you can't be happy where you are, it's a cinch you can't be happy where you ain't."
Charles ''Tremendous'' Jones,Everyone has a success mechanism and a failure mechanism. The failure mechanism goes off by itself. The success mechanism only goes off with a goal. Every time we write down and talk about a goal we push the button to start the success mechanism.
Charles ''Tremendous'' Jones,You will be the same person in five as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read.
Charles ''Tremendous'' Jones,No one is a failure until they blame somebody else.
Chipper Jones,Sometimes you can do too much work and work yourself into a funk.
Chipper Jones,"Don Baylor used to say, 'Don't take batting practice. Just show up, get dressed, stay loose and go out there, see it, hit it."
Chipper Jones,And I don't think they've reached their full potential.
Chipper Jones,We just have to wait and see how the pain is the next couple of days. Right now I feel the ankle took the brunt of it.
Chipper Jones,"I would give anything to be able to have another opportunity to play in this tournament. If it meant going to some kind of camp on Feb. 1, I'd go."
Chipper Jones,"We needed to exorcise some demons from last night. It was a little worrisome what happened last night. But tonight, what more can you say? They did a great job."
Chipper Jones,That's him maturing and learning.
Chipper Jones,"When I came up in'95, ... David Justice started calling me the Golden Child. What he meant was that he felt I would become the face of the Braves organization. Frenchie [a Francoeur nickname] is the new Golden Child. His face is going to be the face of the Braves."
Chipper Jones,"A lot of hard work has gone into building these fields. You guys enjoy it. Make as much use as you can out of it, and maybe one day we'll see you in a Braves uniform."
Chipper Jones,"I think he's a landslide winner. You're talking about a guy who plays Gold Glove defence, the best center fielder in the game, bar none. Everybody's just been waiting for him to turn the corner offensively, and now he's done that."
Chipper Jones,It's going to prevent people from playing the number of games they want to play because they relied on it for so long.
Chipper Jones,"If this year doesn't satisfy people, then Andruw is fighting a battle he's never going to win. We always thought he could hit 40 homers and drive in 120. It was just a matter of putting it all together."
Chipper Jones,"These guys may not experience success right away like our group did. But before they're said and done, they might have a bigger impact on the success of this organization."
Chipper Jones,"After the first couple of innings, I would have probably called off the dogs. But it was nice to get a big lead and relax."
Chipper Jones,You've got to throw strikes. You're helpless against walks. There's no defense against them. We have trouble throwing strikes.
Chipper Jones,"Probably not, but it's a tremendous compliment to him and his abilities that he's even considered."
Chipper Jones,"You have to have the desire to succeed and you can do that without cheating. Well, some people can."
Chipper Jones,"We got a wakeup call. If it had been the right score between Mexico and Canada, we were heading home."
Chipper Jones,"I have confidence in whoever goes out there. Even when Kolbie was struggling at the beginning of the season, I always felt like his last outing would be the one when he turned it around. It took him being demoted and he's figured it out. He's getting key outs. Reitsma will do the same."
Chipper Jones,"It's the best baseball experience of my life. Period. Bar none. It beats any World Series win, any World Series loss, any All-Star Game."
Chipper Jones,"It was probably the best baseball experience of my career. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Every day was a new memory, a new career high."
Chipper Jones,We can bunt guys over. But we're built on power. That's American baseball.
Eddie Jones,I think we would struggle to get that one through
Eddie Jones,We are certainly going to struggle to keep Drew.
Eddie Jones,"I was trying my best to calm everybody down, because we're going to make mistakes. We've just got to be a little bit smarter with the ball."
Eddie Jones,"There's no magic solution for us, we just don't have the resources at the moment. The guys we've got here are the best front-rowers in Australia at the moment."
Eddie Jones,We were reasonably happy with the way we started the tour against Scotland and haven't seen the need to make any changes at this stage.
Eddie Jones,"I knew if we could somehow take him away from his game or make it tough for him to score, our chances of winning the game were high."
Eddie Jones,"I saw that we were sort of struggling to get points. We'd let (Minnesota) get the game manageable. When I came in the game, the opportunity presented itself so I took advantage of it. I was just being aggressive because I had legs."
Eddie Jones,We got ourselves into a position to win the game and we let ourselves down again. It's not good enough.
Eddie Jones,"Only idiots repeat failure, and that's what's been happening there."
Eddie Jones,Shot-clock violation. No doubt about it. It was a shot-clock violation.
Eddie Jones,I'm not saying it's the city's fault. But I'm saying it's the city's fault that those two dogs are walking around the city attacking people. And I think that the city should do something about helping her to the best of their ability.
Eddie Jones,I take no credit at all. This is a talented team with a real desire to follow a specific style of play.
Eddie Jones,"I'll be a resource for him if he wants to use me, he'll have my full cooperation."
Eddie Jones,Jeff's the coach. The only thing that might happen is that I could be there for the final week of the Super 14 when it's time for the debriefings.
Eddie Jones,There's nothing he did wrong. No blame is pointed at him whatsoever.
Eddie Jones,The advice from the medical staff is to give Jeremy the opportunity to rest his injury and unfortunately that means missing out on the tour.
Frederick Jones,"The U.S. is dependent on foreign sources of energy. Because of innovation, we are on the verge of dramatic improvement in the way we power our vehicles. And in turn, we will improve our national and economic security."
Frederick Jones,We are working in close cooperation with Pakistani officials. Mr. Pearl should be released immediately and unconditionally. His continued detention is no help to the cause of those who hold him.
Frederick Jones,"Saddam Hussein was given every opportunity to comply, but he chose continued defiance, even after being given one final opportunity to comply or face serious consequences. Our public and private comments are fully consistent."
Frederick Jones,This is not the agreement that they signed. We will give them some time to reflect upon what they agreed to.
Jack Jones,"I've known him since he was about 5 years old. I watched him grow up. In his school, in his community, he was always willing to help and always led by example. He brought out the best in other people in athletics and I think he set the example in the classroom by performing and doing the things he was asked of him."
Jack Jones,"People always question it, and then they go ahead and burn anyway. There's a reason why the law is in effect and this is an absolute case in point."
Jack Jones,"They're so wrong, it's not right. They're breaking the law, and they better watch out."
Jack Jones,"This could be the first one we have direct knowledge of,"
Jack Jones,"We?re really going to have even more demand on the food bank than in the past because of high energy costs. ?Can I pay my heating bill, or do I eat, this week?? That?s a tough spot to be in."
Jack Jones,"With humidity as low as this, you don't watch the fire creep, you just have to get out of its way, because it is moving quickly."
Jack Jones,The fire season remains. It's a bad time for fires.
Jack Jones,I feel this is more family to me and I get along better and cope better than I can with my own flesh and blood. I leave sometimes but I always come back.
James E. Jones,"You weren't going to the theater to change the world, but you had a chance to affect the world, the thinking and the feelings of the world."
James E. Jones,"You sang in church, you know, and you didn't act at all. You tried not to act, you tried to tell the truth. The idea of being a troubadour on the road singing for your supper was very disturbing to him."
James E. Jones,You don't build a bond without being present.
James E. Jones,"When I was in New York after I left the Army, I studied for two years at the American Theater Wing, studied acting, which involved dance and fencing and speech classes and history of theater, all that."
James E. Jones,We children learned responsibility automatically.
James E. Jones,"The goal wasn't to be a millionaire or to be a Hollywood star. That was not the goal. The goal was something about - the goal was to find the goal, but I knew where it was."
James E. Jones,"The arts have always been an important ingredient to the health of a nation, but we haven't gotten there yet."
James E. Jones,"So in my junior year, I switched to the drama department."
James E. Jones,"So I was determined to use my last two years in college doing something I thought I would enjoy, which was acting. And it was probably because there was girls over in the drama school too, you know?"
James E. Jones,So by the time I got to Michigan I was a stutterer. I couldn't talk. So my first year of school was my first mute year and then those mute years continued until I got to high school.
James E. Jones,"Reading was a big thing, yes. Books were a big thing. But the things that stick out were the newspapers."
James E. Jones,"One day, my youngest uncle - the other one who was first to go to college, Randy - and I were sitting out on the front porch. And he was brilliant. He ended up - he just retired from Boeing Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas."
James E. Jones,"No one asked me to be an actor, so no one owed me. There was no entitlement."
James E. Jones,My youngest uncle Randy and I were the first members of our entire family to ever go to college.
James E. Jones,"My grandmother though, began to prepare in her own neurotic - and I think psychotic - way to face racism. So she taught us to be racist, which is something I had to undo later when I got to Michigan, you know."
James E. Jones,"My grandmother had the most dramatic effect on my life because she set me in one direction, and I had to go back the other direction for my sanity, and for my ability to be a social human being."
James E. Jones,"More and more, when I single out the person out who inspired me most, I go back to my grandfather."
James E. Jones,"It has to be real, and I think a lot of the problems we have as a society is because we don't acknowledge that family is important, and it has to be people who are present, you know, and mothers and fathers, both are not present enough with children."
James E. Jones,"In the wintertime, in the snow country, citrus fruit was so rare, and if you got one, it was better than ambrosia."
James E. Jones,"I was preparing myself for the theater, and... I got a little job here and a job there, but it wasn't going well, and I considered some time before the mid-60s that maybe I should consider something else."
James E. Jones,"I was as content Off-Broadway as I was in a big Hollywood movie, and, I just try to be content wherever I am, you know."
James E. Jones,"I was an adopted child of my grandparents, and I don't know how I can ever express my gratitude for that, because my parents would have been a mess, you know."
James E. Jones,"I think the extent to which I have any balance at all, any mental balance, is because of being a farm kid and being raised in those isolated rural areas."
James E. Jones,"I really think I ambled through a lot of my life, or ambled from one thing to the other."
James E. Jones,"I mean, my people were very, very simple. They were peasant people, you know?"
James E. Jones,"I knew real show business from my father, who had been an actor since he left the world of boxing."
James E. Jones,"I happened to happened to land in a time, in the middle '60s, that without knowing it, and without being told by the history of theater - which we now see from a historical point of view was an explosive time."
James E. Jones,"I got out of the Army - in my world - I came to New York, for instance, when the civil rights movement was just beginning, and that created a certain energy, a certain rumble, a certain impetus for black actors."
James E. Jones,I don't ever want to be a sentimentalist. I prefer to be a realist. I'm not a romantic really.
James E. Jones,"Before my grandpa built his own church, we went to the neighboring town, and it was a white community. You know, up north, mostly middle European people and Indians, Chippewa Indians. We were welcome to that church, but once we got in, they didn't know what to do with us."
James E. Jones,"And nothing embittered me, which is important, because I think ethnic people and women in this society can end up being embittered because of the lack of affirmative action, you know."
James E. Jones,"And it was the idea that you can do a play - like a Shakespeare play, or any well-written play, Arthur Miller, whatever - and say things you could never imagine saying, never imagine thinking in your own life."
James E. Jones,"And I think, on the other end, there were actors who were not as good as I was, perhaps who could have hung in too, but began to blame everything on race."
James E. Jones,"Acting is not about anything romantic, not even fantasy, although you do create fantasy."
James E. Jones,"So in my sophomore year, I took a senior anatomy class. I thought anatomy - being the thing that I should be most interested in - and if I could hack, as we called it, a senior class, I would continue. I didn't hack the senior class."
James E. Jones,It was always hard in those days for the university theater wing to get enough boys to match the number of girls you had in those acting classes.
Jennifer Jones,It doesn't really make a lot of sense. We're all just trying to deal with this. It's really shocking.
Jennifer Jones,"The pieces can be difficult, but he teaches you how to feel the music and not just play a bunch of notes."
Jennifer Jones,"My mother told me never explain, never complain. Even as a young actress, I determined I would never give personal interviews, since they made me so uncomfortable."
Jennifer Jones,I've been jealous of the men for a long time. We've needed an event like this for years. And it's definitely good money.
Jennifer Jones,"They're a great team and we love playing great teams. It's going to be a great game and it will likely come down to last end, last rock. And that's just the way we like it."
Jennifer Jones,"I love lighting that is soothing. A beautiful hanging fixture, nothing harsh in the way of lighting for the bedroom."
Jennifer Jones,"When a girl gets cut, it's not like we're being snobs or anything. The girls pick the sororities they want, the sororities list the girls they want, it all goes into a computer, and the computer matches everybody up. We're not sitting in a room, going down a list, and saying 'Oh, I hate her.' It's a mutual match. Kind of like online dating...but that's a really rough comparison."
Jennifer Jones,"When a girl gets cut, it's not like we're being snobs or anything. The girls pick the sororities they want, the sororities list the girls they want, it all goes into a computer, and the computer matches everybody up, ... We're not sitting in a room, going down a list, and saying 'Oh, I hate her.' It's a mutual match. Kind of like online dating...but that's a really rough comparison."
Jennifer Jones,"She had a young family and time was hard to come by. But she approached us and said she had a plan in place. Obviously, (second) Jill (Officer) and I played with her before and she's one of my very best friends so, that should be an easy feeling-out process."
Jennifer Jones,It's been really easy with George. She's a very good player with lots of experience. She throws an excellent rock and I know exactly how she'll throw it every time.
Jennifer Jones,That's our goal and it will be a huge commitment.
Jennifer Jones,"Create a bedroom just like a luxury hotel that costs $600 a night. A great bed, wonderful linens, a chocolate on the pillow. Light candles and dim the lights. Male or female, anyone would love a room that has that feel."
Jennifer Jones,"If you could choose one characteristic that would get you through life, choose a sense of humor."
Jeremy Jones,I've been praying a lot for strength and (to give) thanks for what I did.
Jeremy Jones,Last year they washed our trucks but they did a really bad job with it.
Jeremy Jones,"It's great food. Southern hospitality. Being from Southern California, we don't get too much of that."
Jerry Jones,Would you describe yourself as prone to violence?
Jerry Jones,I think you have risks in every player that you sign. I wouldn't call this a high-risk move. Not at all.
Jerry Jones,It has the potential to have that kind of impact.
Jerry Jones,"It has the potential to have that kind of impact. I don't mean to get ahead of myself, but it can be a tremendous confidence booster for us and make us a different team from here on out."
Jerry Jones,Some teams had to sacrifice to get this done. This proposal (from the union) is really a mean mother. It forces us to really make some adjustments to how we do business.
Jerry Jones,The proposal was really a mean mother from the union.
Jerry Jones,The proposal was a mean mother. It really forced us to make some adjustments.
Jerry Jones,"We could probably put together ... close to 1,700 acres if the party wanted to buy the whole available land."
Jerry Jones,"If they want the tackle, and Ferguson is out of reach, Justice would be the obvious target. I've seen him rated all the way from No. 8 all the way down to 23 or 24, and I'm only talking about people whose judgment I trust. He's No. 19 on my list. Isn't that odd?"
Jerry Jones,I had a couple of teams call and ask to interview each coordinator for head coaching jobs. This is to be expected.
Jerry Jones,I'm not happy with the proposal.
Jerry Jones,We're not going to force people not to come here. They're going to come here whether we like it or not. They're going to have an impact on our infrastructure whether we like it or not. We have no way of closing our borders.
Jerry Jones,I'm not happy with the proposal. I didn't think we'd be entertaining the type of proposal we got from the players.
Jerry Jones,"I didn't think that we would be entertaining the kinds of propositions that we got from the players. I'm not happy with it at all. As you well know, I don't think anyone particularly cares how happy I am."
Jerry Jones,"As I have said for the past three years, I am encouraged by Bill's enthusiasm and determination, and that hasn't changed in any way. From a personal perspective I have enjoyed every aspect of our working relationship, and I am optimistic about the organization's future."
Jerry Jones,"With the free agents, we were really able to cover our needs spots. That allows us not to compromise our pick in any way. We don't have to take a lesser player because he plays a position of need."
Jerry Jones,"I had high hopes we could come together under these circumstances and push through a deal. It had everything to do with the time frame. But more important than anything, we were probably able to speak with a lot more candor these last two days than we have over the last few years."
Jerry Jones,"My fingerprints were not on the knife, my blood was not on the knife, and my DNA is not on the knife. How on earth is it possible to stab someone 63 times and yet leave no physical evidence whatsoever?"
Jerry Jones,"You're not only gaining fans by coming to California and gaining supporters, it also sends a message that the Dallas Cowboys are America's team."
Jerry Jones,"We feel good about our running backs as we have them right now, and we will continue to see how they progress."
Jerry Jones,"This is about heart, about character."
Jerry Jones,"Personally, it was hard to see Emmitt in red."
Jerry Jones,Nobody is thinking they're going to come out here and put a team here and become a multimillionaire. I don't know anybody that comes into the NFL like that.
Jerry Jones,"Look, many of us here are regular marines... I will die as a marine because that is my dream."
Jerry Jones,"I think if we ultimately see something that is do-able between labor and the league, then you can have it without any additional revenue-sharing."
Jerry Jones,"But if you look at teams that want to share more revenues, they're teams that don't have a lot on the table. They've long since not had any serious investment in their team."
Jerry Jones,It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we didn't have a salary cap.
Jerry Jones,"We were going to need better corner play and better nickel corner play. That's why we brought in Henry, and that's why we're bringing in Glenn."
Jerry Jones,We can both disappoint each other in this agreement. But this is no free lunch to the Dallas Cowboys. We made a commitment to him. That means something.
Jerry Jones,"The Cowboys have joined the NFL in this action. We will not be able to comment on specifics of the litigation other than to say we are standing side by side on the matter,"
Jerry Jones,The Cowboys have joined the NFL in this action. We will not be able to comment on specifics of the litigation other than to say we are standing side by side on the matter.
Jim Jones,"Chant Music: Explanation, Interpretation and Practical Uses,"
Jim Jones,We couldn't have gotten a better pro. This guy loves being out here. You can see it in his eyes.
Jim Jones,"A typical attack, for example from the agent to the end victim, may take as many as 20 or 30 hops,"
Jim Jones,"He'll go back and forth between the two events. Basically, we're just using this indoor season to get him ready for the spring."
Jim Jones,"You have to know going in that it's year round, there is a huge commitment and not a lot of money in it. If you've got a wife and younger kids at home, it can be difficult."
Jim Jones,"A lot of people are tired around here, but I'm not sure they're ready to lie down, stretch out and fall asleep."
Judy Jones,"See, it's all worth this."
Judy Jones,"They need to be a people person ? not just talk the talk, but walk the walk, too."
Judy Jones,"In December, we found out we were selected to be part of the music program featured on PBS to be broadcast March 9. It is part of their pledge drive. As a part of a pilot program, they are spotlighting music education in Kansas at that time."
Judy Jones,It's kind of always been a curiosity for the scientists.
June Jones,We're just waiting on the NCAA appeal process. They can practice while they're in limbo. So hopefully we'll get good news shortly.
June Jones,"He didn't know the blocking before, but he's learning it. I think he'll be OK."
June Jones,"He has done a great job of progressing along as a coach. He was one of the smartest kids that I had, and very competitive."
June Jones,He's had a real productive spring and we have great hopes for his future.
June Jones,"He's done a nice job. He's the perfect example of someone who knows his assignments and knows what to do. He gets the most out of his abilities, and he's helped us."
June Jones,"Dennis said, 'Why don't you go to the baseball field? It made perfect sense. He came all the way here (from San Diego) to tell us that."
June Jones,I can't remember any other guys doing that here. Very few guys in America can lift 500 pounds.
Ken Jones,It's important to keep supporting people that are writing in any form.
Ken Jones,"[His parents, Kenny and Becky Jones,] loved him and are going to miss him, ... They are very proud of what he was doing, proud he died doing something he believed in as much as he did."
Ken Jones,"Employees are the ones who kind of get stuck with the consequences. ... Ironically, a large percentage of our staff smokes cigarettes but that's completely out of our hands."
Ken Jones,"We're hoping the association with Hartnell College will bring in some new, young writers. Any effort that builds up the power if writing is going to help a community."
Ken Jones,"We had a plan for when he got out of the Army,"
Kim Jones,We are excited. We were only three strokes behind the top school and we still didn't play our best golf. We had some water hazards and some shots go out of bounds. It's something the girls know that they can improve on.
Kim Jones,The girls are excited to be out on the course.
Kim Jones,"The girls aren't satisfied, but that's a good thing. They know they can do better, we just have to work at some areas."
Kim Jones,We're still learning about our game. I think the girls learned some things about their game.
Kim Jones,"It was mainly a struggle. None of the girls are happy with the way they played, but they made it through 18 holes in those conditions."
Kim Jones,It's a fairly straight and flat course. It should be a good place to start less experienced girls.
Kim Jones,All those girls could do better with their short game.
Kim Jones,"Sun has been hosting the WWERC for more than 20 years in order to bring together education thought leaders to discuss the evolution of education and the role technology plays in enhancing global learning, teaching and research. Together with Sun, world leaders in education and technology will discuss the many ways that IT skills development can enhance employee readiness, help create communities and extend access to resources."
Leisel Jones,I was shocked by the performance as I haven't been feeling the best all week. I screamed out after I hit the wall because I was just in absolute shock. I couldn't believe it.
Leisel Jones,"It was pretty exciting. All life experiences coming into one race. I'm comfortable with my result, I trust my coach and this is only a warm up experience."
Leisel Jones,Life has changed dramatically for me since the 2004 Athens Olympics. With every meet I'm learning more. I have no real pressure on me since I have both breaststroke (100m/200m) world records.
Leisel Jones,There's nothing like competing in front of a home crowd and they're absolutely incredible suits.
Leisel Jones,"Great job, girls! It tops off great preparation we've had all week."
Leisel Jones,We're the girls' version of the awesome foursome.
Leisel Jones,It's funny that we are performing like them and are clean as a whistle. It's a nice comparison.
Leisel Jones,"I think America has always had that (intimidation factor) in the past. Now, I think it has reversed a little bit. I think we are probably pretty intimidating (to others)."
Levi Jones,"You can't be comfortable. You always have to be hungry. With our past, where we're coming from, we know how to lose. Now we're trying to find out how to win."
Levi Jones,We're not supposed to talk about injuries. It's football. Guys get hurt.
Levi Jones,"We had guys like John Jackson and Richmond Webb coach things like professionalism. As far as technique and what Paul wants done, Willie is the guy for the tackles. He can put it into a player's perspective. He knows exactly what Paul wants, and then he can tell you exactly what's going to happen in a game."
Lloyd Jones,The men who try to do something and fail are infinitely better than those who try nothing and succeed
Lloyd Jones,The man who tries to do something and fails is infinitely better than he who tries to do nothing and succeeds.
Lloyd Jones,The men who try to do something and fail are infinitely better than those who try nothing and succeed.
Marion Jones,"About two weeks after he was born, I got back and started jogging and running. Now I'm full blast and I hope to make my return pretty soon."
Marion Jones,I'm not going to make those predictions anymore. I'm 27 now and I've learned from my mistakes.
Marion Jones,I want to be an Olympic champion.
Marion Jones,"A lot of women say they love being pregnant, but I wasn't such a big fan."
Marion Jones,My father wasn't really involved and my mom is the light in my life.
Matt Jones,I'm very happy with it. Any time I get called up it's an honor.
Matt Jones,"It was unbelievable, an awesome experience."
Matt Jones,I get to share it with customers. They can now understand what it took to grow this.
Matt Jones,"It gives them an option to learn new skills, get interested in artwork and be a part of their community."
Matt Jones,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime, world-class event. Making sure our customers are satisfied is what it's all about. This is an opportunity to showcase Detroit to the world."
Matt Jones,"I came back and got fourth in states [last year], and now I'm a state champion. It's the greatest feeling in the world."
Matt Jones,I've been serious about the whole retail business.
Michael Jones,The idea down here is you (still) have civic responsibility.
Michael Jones,"It is with regret that the board has decided to close Celtica at the end of March 2006. Unless external organisations find Â£250,000 of capital investment by December 2005, the attraction will close at the end of the tourism season."
Michael Jones,"If food and other essential items can no longer be airlifted into the mountain valleys, the earthquake survivors, who have no other means of subsistence, will be at further risk."
Michael Jones,"In the environment that we are in right now, where the market is growing rapidly, the most common area that we tend to see investors running into problems is in cold calling,"
Mike Jones,I don't think it is right to use the petition system when you have no intention or likelihood of prevailing. That is not what the system was intended for and to misuse it now is reckless.
Mike Jones,These letters are like touchstones in history to me. I really want to put them out.
Mike Jones,You can make smart investing choices even when the winds of the investing world don't favor your style.
Mike Jones,"We knew that we'd have an advantage inside with Nate. Once he started catching it and going up strong, he started getting easy shots."
Pacman Jones,I regret that these recent incidents have occurred and that my name has been falsely dragged into these matters that are completely unrelated to me.
Pacman Jones,"I am just happy to get my feet wet. I just need some reps to get better and Coach Fisher has my back 100 percent. I am just letting one game come at a time. I know when he puts me back there to return, I'll be ready."
Pacman Jones,"I stood up well. He caught two balls on me, both of them curls, no deep balls. I'm happy with my play for the most part. I'm getting better every game."
Peter Jones,"After a thorough review of the many DMS solutions available we felt sure that Power, along with the company's dedicated support, would equip us to meet the business opportunities and challenges going forward."
Peter Jones,"In the past, information was presented as black text on white paper. As the world becomes more and more computer dependent, particularly in classrooms and in offices, not being able to easily differentiate between colors becomes more of a liability. Students can be left behind their classmates, and career advancement can be thwarted-all due to the challenges a color blind person faces trying to interpret colors on a computer screen."
Peter Jones,"Generally speaking, food has to be spicier than it would be if you tasted it on the ground,"
Peter Jones,"You have to restore law and order, and that's being done, and the (police) are in action on that."
Quincy Jones,"It's worth about a half-billion dollars now. He had magazine publishing, too, with Liberty. It's ironic because I ended up being the founder of Vibe magazine. There are just a few people who will teach you what that's about."
Quincy Jones,"I don't deserve a Songwriters Hall of Fame Award. But fifteen years ago, I had a brain operation and I didn't deserve that, either. So I'll keep it."
Quincy Jones,Your future is so bright it burns my eyes
Quincy Jones,"When I was about five or seven years old my mother was placed in a mental institution and so we were with our father who worked very hard, and we had to figure a lot of things out."
Quincy Jones,"We were in the heart of the ghetto in Chicago during the Depression, and every block - it was probably the biggest black ghetto in America - every block also is the spawning ground practically for every gangster, black and white, in America too."
Quincy Jones,We spent most of our life almost like street rats just running around the street until we were ten years old.
Quincy Jones,"We got into all the trouble you could ever imagine. We figured that if the Jones boys and all the gangsters ran Chicago, we had our own territory now. All the stores, all the crime, we were in charge of everything, my stepbrother and my brother."
Quincy Jones,"My father was a carpenter, a very good carpenter. He also worked for the Jones boys. They were not family members, we weren't related at all. They started the policy racket in Chicago, and they had the five and dime store."
Quincy Jones,"Just blow in it and sound bad for about a year and then make it sound a little bit better, and you get a little band together, and then you get a few jobs. You take four guys that sound half bad, but if they're 25 percent each, they can give 100 percent, you know?"
Quincy Jones,"It's easy to get next to music theory, especially between your peers and music classes and so forth. You just pay attention. I had a good ear, so I realized that printed music was just about reminding you what to play."
Quincy Jones,It's amazing how much trouble you can get in when you don't have anything else to do.
Quincy Jones,If you started in New York you were dealing with the biggest guys in the world. You're dealing with Charlie Parker and all the big bands and everything. We got more experience working in Seattle.
Quincy Jones,I went with Lionel Hampton for three years. Out of that came a trip to Europe.
Quincy Jones,"I was inspired by a lot of people when I was young. Every band that came through town, to the theater, or the dance hall. I was at every dance, every night club, listened to every band that came through, because in those days we didn't have MTV, we didn't have television."
Quincy Jones,"I got in the school band and the school choir. It all hit me like a ton of bricks, everything just came out. I played percussion for a while, and stayed after school forever just tinkering around with different things, the clarinets and the violins."
Quincy Jones,I got a scholarship to Seattle University and I was writing arrangements for singers and everybody. But the music course was too dry and I really wanted to get away from home.
Quincy Jones,"It slaps your dignity just right. I loved the idea of these proud, dignified black men, and I saw the older ones wounded, and it wounded me ten times as much because I couldn't stand seeing them hurt like this."
Quincy Jones,"Imagine what a harmonious world it could be if every single person, both young and old shared a little of what he is good at doing."
Quincy Jones,We stole a box of honey jars one time and went out in the woods and took care of the whole box. I don't think I touched honey again for 20 years. I never wanted to see honey again.
Sarah Jones,She was the best teacher I ever had. She helped me get into nursing school and she was always there to stay after class and help us study.
Sarah Jones,Everybody has their own little niche in character in the show.
Sarah Jones,"If you came to a rehearsal, you'd think 'what are you doing?' but it helps get into character."
Sarah Jones,"Anybody can memorize lines, ... but you have to find the heart in the character for it to really come out to the audience."
Sir Jones,They represent a growing market for value-added goods that we can produce and deliver.
Sir Jones,"Anyone with a foreign language under their belt, whether at GCSE, A-level or as a graduate, will have an immediate advantage in the job market because they can deliver their company an edge in the world market."
Sir Jones,I am very pleased [Mr Blair] has started a debate on nuclear energy. That's all he's done.
Sir Jones,We are never going to win the argument unless we put our head over the parapet.
Stephen Jones,"An enormous professional responsibility and burden has been lifted from me, and for the first time in 2 1/2 years, my life is again my own."
Stephen Jones,"If we let sympathy overcome reason, then sympathy becomes what race became in another case."
Stephen Jones,"We've tried to duplicate the problem but haven't been able to. We haven't had problems with the systems in the five elections we've used it, but we're concerned about what caused this."
Stephen Jones,The concert was all French music except for my solos. We tried to keep it in a French mode because the second half of the concert was all French pieces.
Stephen Jones,"Our information indicates Tim was somewhere other than Cassville, Missouri. That's what our research shows."
Stephen Jones,"Was the person you delivered (food) to Mr. McVeigh?,"
Steve Jones,"There's a lot of talent in Mississippi this year, especially at linebacker and running back. There's a lot of good players who aren't in either Mississippi All-Star game."
Steve Jones,"I just run as hard as I can for 20 miles, and then race."
Steve Jones,"If I am still standing at the end of the race, hit me with a board and knock me down, because that means I didn't run hard enough"
Steve Jones,All of the conditions and elements were there for major problems out of these storm cells. I'd say it was divine intervention that we didn't get hit harder than we did.
Steve Jones,"The potential existed for a highly devastating storm. Really, it could have been much worse â€” and we were ready."
Steve Jones,"What I've learned with kindergarten students, especially with their parents, it's a big transition with them,"
Steve Jones,"We had a little jam session, and it didn't take long to realize we both like the music of John Denver. I ran into Brad again in Cheyenne over Labor Day. They have a thing at the festival where you sing a 30-minute set for your supper at a local restaurant. We just happened to be scheduled back-to-back with Brad, and he invited us on stage to do a couple of Denver songs. The next day we rehearsed a 45-minute set and performed it on stage."
Steve Jones,"Innovation is rarely seen as taking things away or making them simpler. We've had so much time to come up with a computer and Internet that are easier to use and work better, but we haven't done it."
Todd Jones,Natural is better. Now guys with power mean more since not everybody has it.
Todd Jones,"Totally luck, totally luck. Lance Berkman is a great hitter and he knew what I was going to throw. I get it in maybe just a hair, just enough. I don't want to have to do that again tomorrow because he's a great hitter and I consider it dodging bullets when I do that. Seriously."
Todd Jones,That had a big influence on the outcome of the game.
Todd Jones,"Oh, was I happy to see them."
Todd Jones,"I thought I was finished then. I was thinking if I can't make the Devil Rays, can I pitch anymore? Is this it, is this how I go out? It was embarrassing not to be able to make that team."
Todd Jones,I don't know if I can have this kind of year again so I want to try and take advantage of it as best I can and just make pitches and try to get outs. I was with Boston in 2003 and I wasn't an important part of the team and that kind of hurt. But I learned a lot from that and it feels good to be part of the team this year.
Erica Mann Jong,"Since flesh can't stay, We pass the words along"
Erica Mann Jong,"There is simply no dignified way for a woman to live alone. Oh, she can get along financially perhaps (though not nearly as well as a man), but emotionally she is never left in peace. Her friends, her family, her fellow workers never let her forget that her husbandlessness, her childlessness -- her selfishness, in short -- is a reproach to the American way of life."
Erica Mann Jong,"Growing up female in America. What a liability! You grew up with your ears full of cosmetic ads, love songs, advice columns, whoreoscopes, Hollywood gossip, and moral dilemmas on the level of TV soap operas. What litanies the advertisers of the good life chanted at you! What curious catechisms!"
Erica Mann Jong,Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads.
Erica Mann Jong,Solitude is un-American.
Erica Mann Jong,"And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."
Erica Mann Jong,"The trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."
Erica Mann Jong,"Men and women, women and men, It will never work."
Erica Mann Jong,"Men and women, women and men; it will never work."
Erica Mann Jong,Bigamy is having one husband too many. Monogamy is the same.
Erica Mann Jong,"If you don't risk anything, you risk even more."
Erica Mann Jong,Women are the only exploited group in history to have been idealized into powerlessness.
Erica Mann Jong,Gossip is the opiate of the oppressed.
Erica Mann Jong,Gossip is the opiate of the oppressed
Erica Mann Jong,Men have always detested women's gossip because they suspect the truth: their measurements are being taken and compared.
Erica Mann Jong,Where is Hollywood located? Chiefly between the ears. In that part of the American brain lately vacated by God.
Erica Mann Jong,I have accepted fear as a part of life - specifically the fear of change.... I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back.
Erica Mann Jong,"I have not ceased being fearful, but I have ceased to let fear control me. I have accepted fear as part of life specifically fear of change and fear of the unknown;and I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says, turn back, turn back,you'll die if you venture too far."
Erica Mann Jong,Fame means millions of people have the wrong idea of who you are.
Erica Mann Jong,Jealousy is all the fun you think they had.
Erica Mann Jong,Show me a woman who doesn't feel guilty and I'll show you a man.
Erica Mann Jong,The job of the writer is to seduce the demons of creativity and make up stories. Often you go to bed with a man who claims to be a demon and later you find out he's just an everyday slob.
Erica Mann Jong,"Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."
Erica Mann Jong,"When I was a ten-year-old book worm and used to kiss the dust jacket pictures of authors as if they were icons, it used to amaze me that these remote people could provoke me to love"
Erica Mann Jong,Take your life in your own hands and what happens? A terrible thing: no one is to blame.
Erica Mann Jong,"No one to blame! That was why most people led lives they hated, with people they hated. How wonderful to have someone to blame! How wonderful to live with one's nemesis! You may be miserable, but you feel forever in the right. You may be fragmented, but you feel absolved of all the blame for it. Take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame."
Erica Mann Jong,Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.
Ben Jonson,"A woman, the more curious she is about her face, is commonly the more careless about her house"
Ben Jonson,Let them call it mischief: When it is past and prospered t'will be virtue
Ben Jonson,"O, for an engine, to keep back all clocks, or make the sun forget his motion!"
Ben Jonson,"To speak and to speak well, are two things. A fool may talk, but a wise man speaks."
Ben Jonson,"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair, / Now the sun is laid to sleep, / Seated in thy silver chair, / State in wonted manner keep: / Hesperus entreats thy light, / Goddess, excellently bright."
Ben Jonson,A good poet's made as well as born.
Ben Jonson,"Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short; And done, we straight repent us of the sport: Let us not rush blindly on unto it, Like lustful beasts, that only know to do it: For lust will languish, and that heat decay, But thus, thus, keeping endless Holy-"
Ben Jonson,"Language most shows a man, speak that I may see thee."
Ben Jonson,"They say Princes learn no art truly, but the art of horsemanship. The reason is, the brave beast is no flatterer. He will throw a prince as soon as his groom."
Ben Jonson,I do honor the very flea of his dog
Ben Jonson,"When a virtuous man is raised, it brings gladness to his friends, grief to his enemies, and glory to his posterity."
Ben Jonson,"Ramp up my genius, be not retrograde; But boldly nominate a spade a spade."
Ben Jonson,"Fortune, that favours fools."
Ben Jonson,Ill fortune never crushed that man whom good fortune deceived not.
Ben Jonson,They that know no evil will suspect none.
Ben Jonson,"When a virtuous man is raised, it brings gladness to his friends, grief to his enemies, and glory to his posterity"
Ben Jonson,"Talking and eloquence are not the same: to speak, and to speak well, are two things."
Ben Jonson,He threatens many that hath injured one.
Ben Jonson,"Reader, look / Not on his picture, but his book."
Ben Jonson,"Cares that have entered once in the breast, will have whole possession of the rest."
Ben Jonson,Talking is the disease of age.
Ben Jonson,"Good men are the stars, the planets of the ages wherein they live, and illustrate the times"

Janis Joplin,"It's hard to be free but when it works, it' s worth it!"
Janis Joplin,I'd trade all my tommorows for a single yesterday
Janis Joplin,"I gotta go on doin' it the way I see it...I got no choice but to take it like I see it. I'm here to have a party while I'm on this earth...I'm gettin' it now, today. I don't even know where I'm gonna be twenty years from now, so I'm just gonna keep on rockin', cause if I start saving up bits and pieces of me...man, there ain't gonna be nothing left for Janis."
Janis Joplin,"On stage, I make love to 25,000 different people, then I go home alone!"
Janis Joplin,"It's gonna be a long hard drag, but we'll make it."
Janis Joplin,"I hope you're going to edit this stuff. I don't want to sound like a senile, self-pitying chick babbling on and on about her days of glory."
Janis Joplin,"All my life I just wanted to be a beatnik. Meet all the heavies, get stoned, get laid, have a good time. That's all I ever wanted. Except I knew I had a good voice and I could always get a couple of beers off of it. All of a sudden someone threw me in this rock 'n' roll band. They threw these musicians at me, man, and the sound was coming from behind. The bass was charging me. And I decided then and there that that was it. I never wanted to do anything else. It was better than it had been with any man, you know. Maybe that's the trouble."
Janis Joplin,Don't compromise yourself. It's all you've got.
Janis Joplin,"I feel, you know, I hurt, please help.' I'm saying words, man, and if I look at an audience and they ain't understanding me, it's just like getting kicked in the teeth."
Janis Joplin,I'd trade all my tommorows for a single yesterday.
Janis Joplin,I'm one of those regular weird people.
Janis Joplin,Being an intellectual creates a lot of questions and no answers. You can fill your life up with ideas and still go home lonely. All you really have that really matters are feelings. That's what music is to me.
Janis Joplin,"If I hold back, I'm no good. I'm no good. I'd rather be good sometimes, than holding back all the time."
Janis Joplin,Fourteen heart attacks and he had to die in my week. In MY week.
Janis Joplin,Don't ever compromise yourself. You're all you've got.
Janis Joplin,Don't compromise yourself. You are all you've got.
Janis Joplin,My Baby
Janis Joplin,Audiences like their blues singers to be miserable.
Janis Joplin,Being an intellectual creates a lot of questions and no answers.
Janis Joplin,"My father wouldn't get us a TV, he wouldn't allow a TV in the house."
Barbara Jordan,We must exchange the philosophy of excuse -- what I am is beyond my control for the philosophy of responsibility.
Barbara Jordan,What the people want is very simple - they want an America as good as its promise.
Barbara Jordan,"Think what a better world it would be if we all, the whole world, had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down on our blankets for a nap."
Barbara Jordan,Do not call for black power or green power. Call for brain power.
Eddie Jordan,We're going to hug him and kiss him. We're going to show him his way to the basket. He's a terrific guy. We love him.
Eddie Jordan,"We said there were three keys to victory. We wanted to defend Redd, we wanted to rebound and be physical."
Eddie Jordan,Guys made their minds up that they were going to trust each other tonight.
Eddie Jordan,"The message I sent to them at halftime was that we were getting by on our talent, not on our execution and that has to improve, ... We were not organized on and our press offense wasn't good so those are things we worked on [in practice Wednesday]. We have to be sharper."
Eddie Jordan,"It's good to have physical practices, but we have rules. We want competitive practices, and when we emphasize a physical approach, it's going to happen where you have some physical contact."
Eddie Jordan,"The shot selection was questionable. It was a shot, but was it a quality shot? Was it a shot we could rebound? There weren't a whole lot of those. That's not having discipline or being organized. That's not trusting what we do. We belied all trust [Saturday]."
Eddie Jordan,"Not to the best of my knowledge. I haven't had any contact with Superintendent Compass, ... It's unclear to me what the reasons were for his decision to resign, other than the information that he provided to the public."
Eddie Jordan,"We played hard, but they played harder. They made plays and we couldn't make plays at the offensive end. I thought we competed very hard, but we couldn't keep up with their offense."
Eddie Jordan,We're going through some hard times. Let's see how tough and resilient we are.
Eddie Jordan,"Thank goodness we had one game under our belt with everybody, ... Sometimes that kind of thing can happen in training camp and you never get everyone healthy. It's something that happens to pretty much every team in the league. The teams that stay healthy are able to have success."
Eddie Jordan,We're giving up too many points. We ran our offence well. We didn't respond when they attacked us.
Eddie Jordan,I haven't put a lot of stock into that number. It's good that we won a game tonight and that we are continuing to move up in the standings.
Eddie Jordan,"I need to put you in the locker room because they're looking for excuses too,"
Eddie Jordan,"It's unconscionable that some of our citizens have decided to take advantage of this natural disaster, ... It's indefensible. It violates every code of morality. And it's against the law."
Eddie Jordan,It is unconscionable that some of our citizens have decided to take advantage of this natural disaster by stealing from their own fellow citizens. This is a time when people need to come together.
Eddie Jordan,"It says a lot about the direction we're going in, with the new starting lineup a huge, huge defensive emphasis. Some guys didn't play as many minutes tonight as normal, but we really cared about doing the things that it takes to win and not about what's going to shoot up in the stat sheet."
Eddie Jordan,"I think that we have to begin a process of removing the stain of corruption from Louisiana, and I think that, in this case, we have confronted corruption squarely in the face and we have dealt with it appropriately and fairly,"
Eddie Jordan,"He just said, 'OK, Coach,' and that was the extent of it. It was a very brief conversation, and he was agreeable. I'm sure he's going to be professional. He's always played well under these circumstances. He's always responded the right way on the floor."
Eddie Jordan,"He's a professional. He probably made a slight mistake by going public before he had a conversation with the GM, but I've said all along he's been a professional on the floor at practice, in the locker room, on the planes, on busses. I never saw any real unhappiness or anything like that."
Eddie Jordan,I think police officers are using common sense in making arrests. A person taking water would be a certain kind of situation versus a person taking a big screen television.
Eddie Jordan,"I've always said that it's about talent, toughness, experience and character in this league, ... We've added two other players, and Antonio Daniels, who give us all of those qualities. The heart is bigger than the man sometimes, and that's what we have. We have competitive players. Guys who are experienced, guys who are talented. We think that is going to take us to another level."
Eddie Jordan,"It's talent, toughness, experience and character. We've added two players that give us all those qualities. The heart is bigger than the man sometimes. That's what we have. We think that's going to take us to another level."
Eddie Jordan,"The rooms are in chaos, ... It looked like a hurricane had been inside the evidence room. The stench was overwhelming."
June Jordan,"As a poet and writer, I deeply love and I deeply hate words. I love the infinite evidence and change and requirements and possibilities of language; every human use of words that is joyful, or honest or new, because experience is new... But as a Black poet and writer, I hate words that cancel my name and my history and the freedom of my future: I hate the words that condemn and refuse the language of my people in America."
June Jordan,"Lately... Americans have begun to understand that trouble does not start somewhere on the other side of town. It seems to originate inside the absolute middle of the homemade cherry pie. In our history, the state has failed to respond to the weak. You could be white, male, Presbyterian and heterosexual besides, but if you get fired or if you get sick tomorrow, you might as well be Black, for all the state will want to hear from you."
June Jordan,"As I am a poet I express what I believe, and I fight against whatever I oppose, in poetry."
June Jordan,"To rescue our children we will have to let them save us from the power we embody: we will have to trust the very difference that they forever personify. And we will have to allow them the choice, without fear of death: that they may come and do likewise or that they may come and that we will follow them, that a little child will lead us back to the child we will always be, vulnerable and wanting and hurting for love and for beauty."
June Jordan,"Body and soul, Black America reveals the extreme questions of contemporary life, questions of freedom and identity: How can I be who I am?"
Michael Jordan,"My attitude is that if you push me towards something that you think is a weakness, then I will turn that perceived weakness into a strength."
Michael Jordan,There is no i in team but there is in win
Michael Jordan,"I've missed over 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot . . . and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."
Michael Jordan,"[The city told him it was not their responsibility] even though it's their property, ... They said, if you want it done, do it yourself."
Michael Jordan,We have made real progress in turning around the network performance.
Michael Jordan,"Obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."
Michael Jordan,My heroes are and were my parents. I can't see having anyone else as my heroes.
Michael Jordan,"There are plenty of teams in every sport that have great players andnever win titles. Most of the time, those players aren't willing tosacrifice for the greater good of the team. The funny thing is, inthe end, their unwillingness to sacrifice only makes individualgoals more difficult to achieve. One thing I believe to the fullestis that if you think and achieve as a team, the individual accoladeswill take care of themselves. Talent wins games, but teamwork andintelligence win championships."
Michael Jordan,I've never been afraid to fail.
Michael Jordan,"I can accept failure, but I can't accept not trying."

Carl Gustav Jung,"The unconscious is not just evil by nature, it is also the source of the highest good: not only dark but also light, not only bestial, semi-human, and demonic but superhuman, spiritual, and in the classical sense of the word, Adivine."
Carl Gustav Jung,"Today as never before it is important that human beings should not overlook the danger of the evil lurking withing them. It is unfortunately only too real, which is why psychology must insist on the reality of evil and must reject any definition that regards it as insignificant or actually non-existent."
Carl Gustav Jung,Psychology does not know what good and evil are in themselves; it knows them only as judgments about relationships.
Carl Gustav Jung,"In the end, the only events of my life worth telling are those when the imperishable world erupted into this transitory oneâ€¦ All other memories of travels, people and my surroundings have paled beside these interior happeningsâ€¦ But my encounters with the 'other' reality, my bouts with the unconscious, are indelibly engraved on my memory.

Carl Gustav Jung,"It is on the whole probably that we continually dream, but that consciousness makes such a noise that we do not hear it."
Carl Gustav Jung,"The most intense conflicts, if overcome, leave behind a sense of security and calm that is not easily disturbed. It is just these intense conflicts and their conflagration which are needed to produce valuable and lasting results."
Carl Gustav Jung,"Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment, and especially on their children, than the unlived lives of the parents"
Carl Gustav Jung,"In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order."
Carl Gustav Jung,"Caution has its place, no doubt, but we cannot refuse our support to a serious venture which challenges the whole of the personality. If we oppose it, we are trying to suppress what is best in man --his daring and his aspirations. And should we succeed, we should only have stood in the way of that invaluable experience which might have given a meaning to life. What would have happened if Paul had allowed himself to be talked out of his journey to Damascus?"
Carl Gustav Jung,Without this playing with fantasy no creative work has ever yet come to birth. The debt we owe to the play of the imagination is incalculable.
Carl Gustav Jung,"I could not say I believe. I know! I have had the experience of being gripped by something that is stronger than myself, something that people call God."
