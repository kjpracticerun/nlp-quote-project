From this moment onwards you can be an entirely different person, filled with love and understanding, ready with an outstretched hand, uplifted and positive in every thought and deed."

Nicolas Cage,"[While the scenes depicting shootouts, romances with beautiful women and close-call escapes from a relentless Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) will keep audiences on the edge of their seats, Cage hopes the film will make people, and governments, consider the kinds of people making money off their weaponry purchases.] Knowledge is key; it's power, ...

Nicolas Cage,Don't lose the best thing in your life just because you are not sure.
Nicolas Cage,"I don't like it when people on the street say ''smile'' or ''cheer up.'' It's a real cheap line. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling real grateful for everything. It's a solid time in my life. When people say I look sad, they're wrong."
Nicolas Cage,"The idea that kids younger than mine are fighting guerilla wars using guns sold for profit is just mind-boggling to me. And the question is, who are the people supplying those weapons? How do they sleep? What kind of people are they?"

Nicolas Cage,"It's for Weston. Weston likes animals. I do, too. I like octopuses. I can't help it."

Mark Caine,"A barrier is of ideas, not of things."
Mark Caine,The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.

Teresa Calcutta,"Even the rich are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own."
Teresa Calcutta,"The trouble is that rich people, well-to-do people, very often don't really know who the poor are; and that is why we can forgive them, for knowledge can only lead to love, and love to service. And so, if they are not touched by them, it's because th"
Teresa Calcutta,Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.
Teresa Calcutta,"Spread love everywhere you go: First of all in your own house... let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be the living expression of God's kindness; kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile, kindness."
Teresa Calcutta,"Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace. The rest will be given."

Teresa Calcutta,"I do not pray for success, I ask for faithfulness."

Teresa Calcutta,"If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies."
Teresa Calcutta,"The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted"
Teresa Calcutta,"I have come to realize more and more that the greatest disease and the greatest suffering is to be unwanted, unloved, uncared for, to be shunned by everybody, to be just nobody [to no one]."
Teresa Calcutta,The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.
Teresa Calcutta,"I have found the paradox that if I love until it hurts, then there is no hurt, but only more love."
Teresa Calcutta,"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."
Teresa Calcutta,"Love is a fruit in season at all times, and in reach of every hand."
Teresa Calcutta,Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
Teresa Calcutta,"We cannot all do great things, but we can do small things with great love."
Teresa Calcutta,"If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."
Teresa Calcutta,"Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless."
Teresa Calcutta,There is more hunger for love and appreciation in this world than for bread.

Teresa Calcutta,"Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person."

Teresa Calcutta,"Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing."
Teresa Calcutta,"We the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful.  We have done so much, with so little, for so long, we are now qualified to do anything, with nothing."
Teresa Calcutta,"Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action."
Teresa Calcutta,I am a little pencil in the hand of a writing God who is sending a love letter to the world.
Alexander Calder,"The underlying sense of form in my work has been the system of the Universe, or part thereof. For that is a rather large model to work from."
Alexander Calder,"To an engineer, good enough means perfect. With an artist, there's no such thing as perfect."
Alexander Calder,I paint with shapes.
Jim Caldwell,"They work together. And that's the great thing, ... I mean these guys work. Peyton works with those receivers consistently. In-season, out-of-season. They get to know one another extremely well. And it takes a familiarity with one another to be able to do the things that they do. They have a great feel for one another."
Jim Caldwell,His job is the one that we need to certainly support and pray about.
Jim Caldwell,"They're professionals, when they take the field, they want to win. So it's a matter of professional pride, and also our head coach expects us to go out and play hard and play well."
Jim Caldwell,They were happy to have an opportunity to see their head coach. They hadn't seen him for almost a week. They wanted to show their support for him in this tough time. They had a chance to talk with him and see him and in some cases touch him.
John Caldwell,"Our fourth quarter results demonstrate our continuing progress in improving our financial results. Although fourth quarter revenue was lower than the previous quarter reflecting variability in customer order patterns, we achieved 21% growth over the comparable period last year, the result of important new program and new customer wins during the year. It was also the third consecutive quarter of earnings growth."
John Caldwell,"There are noticeable recoveries. Just in the health care sector, the DRG index is outperforming the overall market, and Pfizer is the largest component. Clearly, there's something favorable happening in that group, but it's not the only one."
John Caldwell,The underlying fundamentals of the market still remain very healthy. We are looking at good solid earnings growth in the first quarter and economic growth that has bounced back.
John Caldwell,The point to remember is that what the Government gives it must first take away
John Caldwell,"With the increased focus on the potential of an economic slowdown, driven by the higher energy prices, anything that comes out of the economic data to either support or refute that is going to be key."

Sarah Caldwell,We must continuously discipline ourselves to I remember how it felt the first moment.
Sarah Caldwell,The fact is that great musical pieces take and hold the stage because they provide great emotional experiences.
Sarah Caldwell,"That's what it is that you rehearse - the making of music, not the playing of notes as abstractions."
Sarah Caldwell,"That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased."
Sarah Caldwell,Music - opera particularly - is a process which is endurable or successful only if it is achieved by people who love to collaborate.
Sarah Caldwell,"I enjoy doing both of them very much, concert work particularly, and the division varies from season to season."
Sarah Caldwell,"As the director of an opera, it is my responsibility to unify the style of the particular performance, but one can certainly approach the piece from different points of view. That's what makes it interesting and keeps it alive."
Sarah Caldwell,Success is important only to the extent that it.
Sarah Caldwell,"If you approach an opera as though it were something that always went a certain way, that's what you get. I approach an opera as though I didn't know it."
Sarah Caldwell,Success is important only to the extent that it puts one in a position to do more things one likes to do.
Sarah Caldwell,"If you can sell green toothpaste in this country, you can sell opera."
Sarah Caldwell,"Learn everything you can, anytime you can, from anyone you can - there will always come a time when you will be grateful you did."
Jim Calhoun,"I said, 'You guys are special."
Jim Calhoun,We weren't prepared. We were living on an 11-0 season that meant absolutely nothing because you have to play the next one.
Jim Calhoun,I told Rashad he only waited 38 minutes for that three. It was worth the wait.
Jim Calhoun,"When I did my voting, it was very difficult. Normally I can get a better feel. But there were so many kids that had so many great seasons."
Jim Calhoun,"If, in fact, you felt it was a mistake of malice, a mistake of violence, a mistake repeated, those are all factors."
Jim Calhoun,[A victory] would really swing their season.
Jim Calhoun,"My understanding is the athletic director is going to now, hopefully, put it on the front burner this year. In my personal opinion, they were going to fix football before they fixed basketball. I know a couple of the people are basketball people who gave money to football and that's fine. They gave money to the university."
Jim Calhoun,"He's one of the best assistants and one of the best evaluators of talent that I've ever been around, ... I think in the next week or two we are going to try to name him associate head coach because he's been that good."
Jim Calhoun,"I know what it's like to be A) at another level, and B) overwhelmed with talent. Tonight, it didn't come easy. ... We had to work harder than we have had to work recently. Sometimes scores can be very deceptive."
Jim Calhoun,"Talent eventually wins out, and in this particular game it certainly did."
Jim Calhoun,The team just wasn't comfortable. The score is not indicative. [The sign] of a struggle is the game Rashad [Anderson] and Rudy [Gay] had.
Jim Calhoun,"He?s not only a leader, he?s an emotional leader. He has some of what Khalid has, his strength and confidence level. ... He gets fans involved."
Jim Calhoun,"We just shut the engine off. We just couldn't get it back. It's a hard thing to do in sports and I think all of us have seen it and unfortunately an experienced team like this, it shouldn't happen to."
Jim Calhoun,We just shut the engine off. You can't go to sleep.
Jim Calhoun,Certainly Hilton will come in with a lot more attention than he had before. A full 40 minutes of focus is what we?re going to need.
Jim Calhoun,We've taken the quality of teams and just increased them in quantity. I don't think anybody truly understands how difficult this league will be day in and day out.
Jim Calhoun,The person who believes less in Josh is Josh. It's a daily progress with him to get him to believe.
Jim Calhoun,"Providence has given us lots of problems and Timmy (Welsh) has prepared his team well. I think the only difference between Providence and maybe somebody a little bit higher in the (Big East) standings, quite frankly, is that these are young kids."
Jim Calhoun,I'm bursting with pride about this team.
Jim Calhoun,"They space the floor, and that can cause problems sometimes because our game is a game of power. And Villanova's backcourt disrupted us, so we couldn't use our power."
Jim Calhoun,"He put it in perspective and told me exactly what happened to him. Jim took me through the scenario of what would happen. Jim has been in my life more than I realize. We're the two old-timers in the league, but we're also two friends."
Jim Calhoun,"Jimmy put it in perspective and told me exactly what had happened to him, ... He encouraged me to get the best medical advice I could get. He took me through the scenario of what would happen."
Jim Calhoun,"I'm mixing and matching both those things, ... Given my nature, unless I had planned that this would be the summation of everything, then I'm going to keep going on with my job."
Jim Calhoun,"There's no good losses, no moral victories, nothing of that nature. But the champion in them did come out. They weren't going away without trying to win a game."
Jim Calhoun,They've caught some magic in my opinion and they're feeling really good about themselves. When a team feels good about itself they're really tough to beat.
Jim Calhoun,"We were living on an 11-0 season that meant absolutely nothing. We took a 15-8 lead and from then, didn't play an ounce of basketball."
Jim Calhoun,We were living on an 11-0 season that meant absolutely nothing. We never were much of a factor.
Jim Calhoun,He was very outspoken and talked about the kind of sacrifices he was willing to make for the team to win. You can't get a kid to do that unless it comes from the heart. And trust me it does.
Jim Calhoun,I pulled Marcus off and berated him as much as I possibly could. Marcus didn't come out with the kind of enthusiasm that he needs to.
Jim Calhoun,Sometimes I'd like to see them with more swagger. Perhaps we'll walk out of here with that kind of swagger.
Jim Calhoun,"It's something they probably couldn't have imagined. There is joy in Fairfield County, I'm sure."
Jim Calhoun,"Will it hurt us? Sure. I think Jeff has been a factor in every game he has played. So it will hurt us, but hopefully the depth we have will come into play."
Jim Calhoun,Will it hurt us? Sure. Jeff has been a factor in every game he's played in. Hopefully the depth that we have will come into play in this game.
Jim Calhoun,"Their 7-for-9 shooting in the second half from 3-point land was something that really, really hurt us deeply. But the inability of us to get the ball into the paint was probably the thing that killed us."
Jim Calhoun,"I would hope that I represent them,"
Jim Calhoun,"This is the greatest honor I could ever receive,"
Jim Calhoun,"I don't find it unusual for Kentucky, with its incredible history and a great coach like Tubby (Smith), for it to turn into that type of game. I thought Kentucky played awfully good."
Jim Calhoun,"Roscoe Baker, Jimmy Walker, Billy Blair, Dennis Lynch - so many names - we would go into the heart of Roxbury and play, ... The name of the local team was the Roxbury Royals. They had a court that you could see into from the apartment buildings, so it was like a double-deck and they played their opening theme song loudly and it was `School's Out.'"
Jim Calhoun,"When my dad died at 15 [of a heart attack], ... one of the sacred places I could go was with a ball, a hoop and a dream - by myself. It's one of the few sports that allows you to do that. In those moments of solitude, I was able to work out some of my life issues. It was a very difficult time for me."
Jim Calhoun,"It's going to get tougher by the moment, ... I hate to see Bob Huggins go, but having Rick [Pitino] come in, and Freedom Hall, I see the future of the Big East being great."
Jim Calhoun,It's a tribute to the hard work the kids put in because they played in the best league in the country. I think our kids should be honored. We have an awful lot of good players in this league. I couldn't be prouder of our kids.
Jim Calhoun,I've been in a (locker) room with some talented teams and some teams that bordered on greatness. But I don't know if I've been in a room before with so many kids that have sacrificed so much.
Jim Calhoun,"My dad was a god to me,"
Jim Calhoun,I wish to God they were in the NBA.
Jim Calhoun,"Over the last 15 years, the type of players we've had here, the fortune to be successful, we've had the bull's-eye. Now there's the added bull's-eye of a new league, being No. 1. They just pile up. That's exactly where you want to be. You want to be playing from the top. I hear guys say they like to be the underdog. But there's a reason you're the underdog. I'd like to be playing from the top any time I can."
Jim Calhoun,"Villanova is always scary, because of the way they space the floor and force you to play small ball."
Jim Calhoun,"Every Saturday, my dad took me to a football game,"
Jim Calhoun,"We are delighted with the reaction that the Muppets are getting from some of the top fashion boutiques around the world, and we are proud to be able to team up with today's stars to do something special for Childrens Hospital Los Angeles."
Jim Calhoun,"He was a Hall of Fame coach in his own right at UMass, ... But playing in the Yankee Conference, he was never going to get the recognition."
Jim Calhoun,"We have weaknesses; we know that. So we have to become an execution team, particularly on a team that comes up and ball-pressures us, a team that says 'beat me off the dribble.' And you can, but they're daring you and trying to take you out of your offense."
Jim Calhoun,"As a friend and as a colleague, it's only fitting that we go in together. ... The way he's maintained excellence through all those years, Jim's had an incredible run."
Jim Calhoun,He plays a great game with great enthusiasm. What a wonderful thing.
Jim Calhoun,"There are no easy routes in this tournament. I thought we could eventually take control of this game, but Kentucky kept fighting back."
Jim Calhoun,"I thought we would eventually take control of the game, and Kentucky kept fighting back. That was not in the game plan."
Jim Calhoun,This is one of those games where I don't have an awful lot of complaints.
Jim Calhoun,"I'm not complaining, but that takes a toll. The league is just so difficult."
Jim Calhoun,"It?s a time we have to play. I don?t think for college kids it makes any difference. I talked to players today and asked them, ?How?d you sleep last night?? They said they went to bed early ? they were in bed by 1:15 a.m."
Jim Calhoun,"Only two of the six kids have college degrees - my brother, who is a cardiologist, and me, ... We were a large Irish family, and in those days, the boys went to college. My sisters gave me $50 here and there and came to my games. They all gave me something. When people love you and believe in you, it instills confidence. Confidence comes from the people around you."
Jim Calhoun,I think it's the very charm of exactly what this tournament is about and I truly believe that. We played Gonzaga in 1999 and everybody in Phoenix was attached to them. That's a very natural thing.
Jim Calhoun,"This whole idea of David and Goliath is a real natural thing to root for the underdog. The charm of this tournament is every single night, we're all surprised by the things that happen."
Jim Calhoun,I think that's the charm of what this tournament is about.
Jim Calhoun,"Sometimes you're blessed with teams that are incredibly talented, but there's chaos. But sometimes you're blessed, as I have been this year, to have kids who think the same way you do."
Jim Calhoun,"The thing that scares me always the most and the thing I caution our players on is that next week, you go home. You go home for the Big East tournament. And then next time you go home, we pack up the uniforms. And this team is good enough to get to Indianapolis. Will it get to Indianapolis? I have no idea. ... Maybe the first round of the tournament some team gets up, plays us tough and we don't execute."
Jim Calhoun,He responded well after being very leery when he got hit. And I don?t blame him. The scratch was pretty good.
Jim Calhoun,"They shot 6-of-7 from 3 in the second half. That's decent shooting, I believe."
Jim Calhoun,"Whether it was 50 bucks being sent to me at school, traveling through a snowstorm to                                                                                                                         see me play, coming to a football game in high school, all those things gave me a sense of love and belief and those things inspired confidence."
Jim Calhoun,I just believe 100 percent in Marcus Williams and he's reinforced that belief every step of the way.
Jim Calhoun,"Their big guys dominated us. Last night when I went to bed or this morning when I woke up, I would never have thought that would have happened. Maybe a wash, but certainly not that."
Jim Calhoun,He's comfortable being the best sixth man in college basketball.
Jim Calhoun,I don't have any question that was a very well-coached basketball team. He's got complete control of the way that teams runs.
Jim Calhoun,"He learned at the feet of the master, ... To have someone full-time for basketball issues is a great, great situation."
Jim Calhoun,This is where our basketball culture stands. Whether I agree with kids leaving after two or three years really is of no consequence.
Jim Calhoun,"They are a tough, tough basketball team. They made our life awfully, awfully miserable. We thought the game was going to be as easy as it was early."
Jim Calhoun,They gave us a tremendous shot. We withstood it and stood up to it. I couldn't prouder of my basketball team.
Jim Calhoun,We are incredibly happy to be here today. We survived an incredible basketball game. Washington gave us everything we could ever imagine to handle. But we were able to withstand it and advance. And that is what you want to do in the NCAA Tournament.
Jim Calhoun,"Their arrogance doesn't show. They are not doing any kind of chest thumping that some teams carry, in my opinion, too far."
Jim Calhoun,I still think we can beat anybody in America and get to Indianapolis.
Jim Calhoun,"I still think we can beat anybody in America and get to Indianapolis. And I still think we can lose to anybody along the way. But we got into a situation where we had to make plays, and we made plays."
Jim Calhoun,Jack is probably one of the best point guards in America. He did an incredible job on him.
Jim Calhoun,It's a tremendous sense of accomplishment and an amazing feeling to win. This field was one of the best ever and there isn't anyone here who didn't get their money's worth.
Jim Calhoun,"We've been to nine of 12 [Sweet 16s] and that's a good achievement, but nine straight is incredible. Mike has had terrific players."
Jim Calhoun,The ability to take somebody off the bounce is incredibly important. It's really tough to defend a guy who can go by you.
Jim Calhoun,"The sky's the limit with his ability and his vision of the game. I watch some of those NBA games and I happened to be watching Boston down the stretch, and I said, 'You throw him in that uniform and all of a sudden they'll be a different basketball team.' I believe that much in him."
John Calipari,Go ball. Go ball. I'll worry about the coaching. You just get out there and ball.
John Calipari,I second the motion. His record is spotless. He graduates every kid. He doesn't look at other women. He doesn't smoke.
John Calipari,"What I'm seeing now, what I saw at [Massachusetts], it's like the machine is up and running now. But it's taken six years. At Mass, it took me five."
John Calipari,"Obviously, we have policy and team rules, and this is a case that I'll deal with like all the others. I'll deal with it in a fair way, and deal with him in a fair way. But we've got to look into it first."
John Calipari,We made a couple of shots and couple of plays because we are a little bit longer. The reality of it is they were there until there was a minute left and they easily could have won the game.
John Calipari,Those guys on TV and radio have to come up with some opinions and some upsets.
John Calipari,"It was my mistake,"
John Calipari,I was happy for Joey. One of the things we had talked about was getting him more looks. He stepped up and we did that.
John Calipari,We are chasing greatness with this team.
John Calipari,How 'bout that. We're chasing greatness.
John Calipari,"There was no one that played well. In this kind of game, you must have two or three guys that really play well and that everyone talks about after the game. We didn't have anybody."
John Calipari,People thought I was crazy. I've had more fun coaching this style.
John Calipari,They could be playing like this is destiny and find the adrenaline to go crazy. Or they could be worn down.
John Calipari,"Obviously I didn't make the game fast enough. I didn't coach up to snuff. So, you know, it's a little bit of everything. We move on."
John Calipari,This is what Conference USA should be in every game and every building. This is a basketball environment.
John Calipari,"Not an arrogance, because that gets away from you. The swagger that says, 'You may beat us, but you better come out swinging.' But it is not his swagger, it is our swagger, and he has to get everybody believing. 'Can (Washington) help me be that way?'"
Bill Callahan,"It was a great victory for our team and for the state of Nebraska. It was a great way to close out 2005. We said before the beginning of the game, no matter what the outcome was, we were going to learn from this game and grow."
Bill Callahan,But I'm on the same page with Al. I share his visions. I share his passion and I know what's expected of me. And that is to win. But I don't think those expectations are any different from any coach in the NFL.
Bill Callahan,"They were possession calls and boundary calls and things of that nature. I think it was well done. The calls were well-represented and logically thought out before they pulled the trigger and asked for a replay. What occurred was valid, was logistical."
Bill Callahan,"Every home game at Nebraska has a great atmosphere, but there is added electricity for a night game at Memorial Stadium. It will also allow us the opportunity to get prospects here from all parts of the country into Lincoln to see the best game-day atmosphere in college football."
Bill Callahan,"We put in a whole new system with much different terminology last year. Sometimes it was hard to communicate this system to the players, but they're adapting to it now."
Bill Callahan,"I'm going to fight for my team, for my players, and that's my prerogative as a head coach. If I don't think something is right, if I think something is unjust, I'm going to speak up. I certainly did that on Saturday."
Edward Callahan,"We're at Mother Nature's mercy, until it rains, ... We could use all the water in Somerset County and it would still burn."
Edward Callahan,"The fire creates its own uptrack, ... It's one of our worst areas."
Edward Callahan,"It's somewhere in the order of 150 to 180 acres, ... It's a long skinny fire. It's runs the length from Fairhope to Bedford"
Edward Callahan,"(Monday) the fire got running a little but and we weren't able to get line entirely in place, ... We now have a line across the top of the fire."
Edward Callahan,"We have two dozers work on a line from the top, the fire is spotty, ... There's a lot of spots where it has not burned yet."
Edward Callahan,"It's such a long fire and the head of the fire is in a very remote and a hard area,"
Edward Callahan,"It appears to be railroad caused fire, ... What malfunction and what happened no one knows. The exact cause we will determined once it's extinguished."
Maria Callas,"Real friends are very special, but you have to be careful because sometimes you have a friend and you think they are made of rock, then suddenly you realise they're only made of sand."
Maria Callas,"When music fails to agree to the ear, to soothe the ear and the heart and the senses, then it has missed the point"
Maria Callas,"he said, ''but in her face and eyes you can see what the character she is portraying is wearing, where she is, the setting, the other people who are present, and what her relationship to them is -- not to mention her emotional state."
Maria Callas,"When music fails to agree to the ear, to soothe the ear and the heart and the senses, then it has missed its point."
Maria Callas,"If I have stepped on some people at times because I am at the top, it couldn't be helped. What should I do if someone gets hurt... retire?"
Maria Callas,Good teachers make the best of a pupil's means; great teachers foresee a pupil's ends.
Maria Callas,"Don't talk to me about rules, dear. Wherever I stay I make the goddam rules."
Maria Callas,"First I lost my voice, then I lost my figure and then I lost Onassis."
Maria Callas,"I would like to be Maria, but there is La Callas who demands that I carry myself with her dignity."
Maria Callas,I cannot switch my voice. My voice is not like an elevator going up and down.
Maria Callas,That is the difference between good teachers and great teachers: good teachers make the best of a pupil's means; great teachers foresee a pupil's ends.
Maria Callas,"You are born an artist or you are not. And you stay an artist, dear, even if your voice is less of a fireworks. The artist is always there."
Maria Callas,It's a terrible thing to go through life thinking that you have a rock on your side when you haven't.
Maria Callas,I don't know what happens to me on stage. Something else seems to take over.
Maria Callas,"Women are not pals enough with men, so we must make ourselves indispensable. After all, we have the greatest weapon in our hands by just being women."
Maria Callas,"I am not an angel and do not pretend to be. That is not one of my roles. But I am not the devil either. I am a woman and a serious artist, and I would like so to be judged."
Maria Callas,"I don't need the money, dear. I work for art."
Maria Callas,"When my enemies stop hissing, I shall know I'm slipping."
Maria Callas,"On stage, I am in the dark."
Maria Callas,I prepare myself for rehearsals like I would for marriage.
Maria Callas,Love is so much better when you're not married.
Maria Callas,"An opera begins long before the curtain goes up and ends long after it has come down. It starts in my imagination, it becomes my life, and it stays part of my life long after I've left the opera house."
Maria Callas,There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.
Maria Callas,"I was always too mature for my age - and not very happy. I had no young friends. I wish I could go back to those days. If I could only live it all again, how I would play and enjoy other girls. What a fool I was."
Maria Callas,"Don't talk to me about rules, dear. Wherever I stay I make the god dam rules."
Cab Calloway,"You don't think it was because a white man wrote it, a black man wrote it, a green man wrote it. What - doesn't make a difference! Doesn't make a difference. I think he did a good job."
Cab Calloway,"You can't say they look up to him - if you did, you've got to look up to everybody in the show. But he's an outstanding character in the show."
Cab Calloway,"What opera isn't violent? Two things happen, violence and love. And other than that, name something else. You can't."
Cab Calloway,"Well, he didn't have much of a conversation with me. Not that I can remember. I wasn't used to him. That's about all. I don't know. No conversation."
Cab Calloway,We usually never got out of there before four or five o'clock in the morning. Every morning. So it was rough.
Cab Calloway,"We didn't have any segregation at the Cotton Club. No. The Cotton Club was wide open, it was free."
Cab Calloway,"They were all good. Can't say that none was best and none was worst. I don't know, they were all good as far as I was concerned."
Cab Calloway,"The only credit I can give them. They synchronize wonderful. That's all. They synchronize very - you would have thought that they were actually acting, but they were synching all the time, and that's a rough job."
Cab Calloway,"That's what George wrote! He wrote it. Why change it? There was this European company that I was speaking about awhile ago - course, didn't nobody know what Porgy was."
Cab Calloway,"Of course, nobody knows what Porgy was, whether he was on his knees all the time or was pulled by a goat or - they don't know what he was."
Cab Calloway,"It's very difficult to photograph an opera. And they messed up on it. It just wasn't there. And I don't blame the Gershwins for taking it away. Of course, if they had gotten the original company to have done it, it would have been very good."
Cab Calloway,He was a silly guy. Out - do the other guy. That was his effort at all times.
Cab Calloway,"Everybody that you could name would join in our audiences from, Laguardia on down. Everybody came. Everybody came to the Cotton Club."
Cab Calloway,"Everybody did something. It was very entertaining. We had a lot of fun. Lot of fun. And there was no segregation, that I could see. I never saw any."
Cab Calloway,"Bubbles was a very good dancer. Tremendous dancer. He was one of our leading dancers of the country at that time. And, of course, he didn't have much of a voice."
Cab Calloway,At times as a performer they segregated us in some of theatres.
Cab Calloway,"A movie and a stage show are two entirely different things. A picture, you can do anything you want. Change it, cut out a scene, put in a scene, take a scene out. They don't do that on stage."
Cab Calloway,"90%, 100% are going there to hear the singing. The story is another thing. Nobody's interested in the story. Happiness is happiness."
Cab Calloway,"My audience was my life. What I did and how I did it, was all for my audience."
Cab Calloway,"I think it was just an opera. Now, you go to opera, you expect to see and hear what the opera is. So, it was Catfish Row. It was singers. Marvelous voices. It didn't make no difference what color they were."
Cab Calloway,Charleston was a good town. It was a nice town. I played there years ago before Porgy and Bess. And I think the conception wasn't bad. It was good.
Lorne Calvert,"Today, in honour of our troops and in many ways to honour our veterans in this year of the veteran, we raised that flag,"
Lorne Calvert,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me, ... I don't think people are going to fall for that one again."
Lorne Calvert,"I saw a clear majority here this morning indicating support for the direction we're taking the party, but the debate will always signal that when we are dealing with things related to uranium or nuclear that there are concerns ? environmental and otherwise ?"
Lorne Calvert,"They and we are, I think, very realistic about the circumstances that face our families in Prince Albert,"
John Calvin,I consider looseness with words no less of a defect than looseness of the bowels
John Calvin,"Each eye can have its vision separately; but when we are looking at anythingâ€¦ our vision, which in itself is divided, joins up and unites in order to give itself as a whole to the object that is put before it."
John Calvin,Hence that dread and amazement with which as Scripture uniformly relates holy men were struck and overwhelmed whenever they beheld the presence of God men are never duly touched and impressed with a conviction of their insignificance until they have
John Calvin,"For though we very truly hear that the kingdom of God will be filled with splendor, joy, happiness and glory, yet when these things are spoken of, they remain utterly remote from our perception, and as it were, wrapped in obscurities, until that day"
John Calvin,"God preordained, for his own glory and the display of His attributes of mercy and justice, a part of the human race, without any merit of their own, to eternal salvation, and another part, in just punishment of their sin, to eternal damnation"
John Calvin,"God tolerates even our stammering, and pardons our ignorance whenever something inadvertently escapes us - as, indeed, without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray"
John Calvin,"Seeing that a Pilot steers the ship in which we sail, who will never allow us to perish even in the midst of shipwrecks, there is no reason why our minds should be overwhelmed with fear and overcome with weariness"
John Calvin,"It behooves us to accomplish what God requires of us, even when we are in the greatest despair respecting the results"
John Calvin,Man's mind is like a store of idolatry and superstition; so much so that if a man believes his own mind it is certain that he will forsake God and forge some idol in his own brain
Italo Calvino,"When politicians and politically minded people pay too much attention to literature, it is a bad sign -- a bad sign mostly for literature. But it is also a bad sign when they don't want to hear the word mentioned."
Italo Calvino,The struggle of literature is in fact a struggle to escape from the confines of language; it stretches out from the utmost limits of what can be said; what stirs literature is the call and attraction of what is not in the dictionary.
Italo Calvino,"The unconscious is the ocean of the unsayable, of what has been expelled from the land of language, removed as a result of ancient prohibitions"
Italo Calvino,"The satirist is prevented by repulsion from gaining a better knowledge of the world he is attracted to, yet he is forced by attraction to concern himself with the world that repels him."
Italo Calvino,The human race is a zone of living things that should be defined by tracing its confines.
Italo Calvino,"What Romantic terminology called genius or talent or inspiration is nothing other than finding the right road empirically, following one's nose, taking shortcuts."
Italo Calvino,"Viaggi per rivivere il tuo passato? â€” era a questo punto la domanda del Kan, che poteva anche essere formulata cosÃ¬: â€” Viaggi per ritrovare il tuo futuro?"
Italo Calvino,"Novels as dull as dishwater, with the grease of random sentiments floating on top."
Italo Calvino,"The unconscious is the ocean of the unsayable, of what has been expelled from the land of language, removed as a result of ancient prohibitions."
Italo Calvino,"You are at the wheel of your car, waiting at a traffic light, you take the book out of the bag, rip off the transparent wrapping, start reading the first lines. A storm of honking breaks over you...."
Italo Calvino,"Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents."
Joe Calzaghe,It should be as strong as ever and next week I'm starting running.
Joe Calzaghe,"It is a pain. It is wintertime and it gets dark at 5 p.m., but it is one of those things. I'm just training later and adjusting."
Joe Calzaghe,"If I get an opportunity to fight Antonio Tarver, Roy Jones in the States, I'll go for it. Those are the sort of fights I want at this stage of my career."
Joe Calzaghe,"He [Lacy] wants it and I want it and the prospect really  excites me, but I haven't even talked money yet so nothing is cut and  dried."
Joe Calzaghe,I've always been quite into clothes.
Joe Calzaghe,"I've defended my title for eight years, let's see if Ricky is still champion in four years,"
Rich Camarillo,"To have your name up there, it does mean a lot. That's quite an honor to be recognized, especially the way the franchise has come around and is recognized as a top franchise."
Rich Camarillo,"The Cardinals (brought me to the area). It's really close to home for my wife and I, which is California. It was close to family and a lot of people were able to come see my games. I was able to go to California whenever I really wanted, which was a different story than Boston."
Rich Camarillo,"Baseball was something I really enjoyed, growing up. That's all I really played growing up and didn't even play football until high school. I really love being there with my son. Sometimes it's frustrating coaching him because I can get on him a little more than the other kids. He doesn't want to hear it, but that's part of it."
Marcus Camby,It reminded me of the game we had in Washington. I blocked Gilbert Arenas' shot at the end. Right place and right time.
Marcus Camby,We've got a capable point guard running things. I wouldn't trade Andre (Miller) for anybody.
Marcus Camby,"Just came in here and decided to deal with it. Guys were here who are committed to practice, who are committed to trying to change this series around and trying to win the game (tonight). That's pretty much what all our focus was on."
Marcus Camby,"We haven't gotten out of the first round (the past two seasons) and you can't blame him. A team has to get the job done collectively. . . . I think (Anthony) is ready to step out. Hopefully, it will be in (these) playoffs. This will kind of be his coming-out party."
Marcus Camby,I have never been to Africa. It's always been a dream of mine. It's a great opportunity. I get to touch lives of people from my homeland and my blood.
Marcus Camby,It felt good to be out there. I wish the outcome was different. Hopefully (Saturday) night we can contain Brand better. He was hot tonight.
Marcus Camby,"The man has been phenomenal. I don't know his status beyond this year, but I would definitely love to see him back here. I think it will be a shame if he's not, because he's been instrumental in Denver making its resurgence."
Marcus Camby,"I love playing in the Garden. This is the best arena in the world to play in. They have such loyal fans out there, and they gave me a great ovation when I came in. It's always good to see a lot of familiar faces. The ball boys, when I was here, were little kids. Now, they're grown up and married with children."
Marcus Camby,"It was just different, especially when Melo got hurt. We've been playing well with guys out of the lineup, but I think that deflated us a little bit."
Marcus Camby,I hope so. We need wins. I don't care how they come. We have to find a way to get on a wining streak to distance ourselves from teams in our division. It was definitely a great win.
Marcus Camby,"It's a big game. I don't know what their schedule looks like, but I like home-court advantage. It's definitely big in the first round."
Marcus Camby,"If I was in that situation, I would rather (play the Nuggets) too, considering you would have the home- court advantage."
Marcus Camby,"It's frustrating, especially when you don't accomplish your goals you set out at the top of the season. Guys have to hold themselves accountable. Management will have to do something this summer to bring in the right type of guys that want to play the right way."
Marcus Camby,We've got seven games and seven winnable ballgames. I think we can go out there and win every ball game.
Marcus Camby,We've got 10 games left where I feel we're better than those 10 teams we're going to be playing. We just have to go out there and prove it.
Marcus Camby,"We should have won this game,"
Marcus Camby,It was definitely fun to watch. â€¦ Melo was spectacular.
Marcus Camby,I like them a lot. They've put their imprint on this team with their hustle and their energy. It was definitely needed.
Marcus Camby,It's definitely disappointing and frustrating not to get out of the first round. We had dreams of winning the championship.
Marcus Camby,"(Doctors) told me I'm way ahead of schedule. They didn't want to tell me (a timetable). It wasn't a short one, though (from the surgery)."
Marcus Camby,I like the coach we've got now.
Marcus Camby,I don't see it happening unless every NBA player is given a stipend to buy clothes.
Marcus Camby,"It's a tough ordeal for coach, having been through what he been through last year, with his cancer situation. We know Coby real well. He's always here before the season, working out, playing with the guys, and he keeps in pretty good contact with a lot of the guys."
Marcus Camby,We don't want any champagne. None of that stuff like they do in baseball. Just a quick acknowledgment. We have a bigger picture. We want to get a ring.
Marcus Camby,"We don't need any champagne. None of that stuff like they do in baseball. . . . Just a quick acknowledgement. We have a bigger picture . . . (winning the division) hasn't been done in a long time in Denver. It's great for the fans, but we want to get that ring."
James Cameron,"Getting the audience to cry for the Terminator at the end of T2, for me that was the whole purpose of making that film. If you can get the audience to feel emotion for a character that in the previous film you despised utterly and were terrified by, then that's a cinematic arc."
James Cameron,"Otherwise we will have a situation like what happened with the peer-to-peer problems in the music industry, and there will be a loss in revenue in the film industry, and then we won't be able to create the magic that we have in the past."
James Cameron,"You don't rest well as long as you're seeking vengeance. I feel sad justice wasn't done, but it's time to move on and sleep well."
James Cameron,"Bill has come down to Hollywood to make this announcement, and that is a first,"
James Cameron,Northrop Grumman Technical Services is honored to be selected by the Department of Energy for this significant responsibility. This contract demonstrates our commitment to this market segment and the rationale for the creation of Northrop Grumman Technical Services.
James Cameron,"It's a relatively new phenomenon... (Investors) want to invest in clean energy, but want to extract a little more value from dirty energy first. They will get there."
James Cameron,It's about human imagination and curiosity. What's out there? What's in the great beyond? What exists at levels we can't see with our five senses?
James Cameron,It just shows a total disregard and disrespect for wild animals.
James Cameron,"You know, in the film making business no one ever gives you anything."
James Cameron,You have to not listen to the nay sayers because there will be many and often they'll be much more qualified than you and cause you to sort of doubt yourself.
James Cameron,There is a hugely underserved population out there... those who are the least capable of paying pay the highest.
James Cameron,"There are many talented people who haven't fulfilled their dreams because they over thought it, or they were too cautious, and were unwilling to make the leap of faith."
James Cameron,"The magic doesn't come from within the director's mind, it comes from within the hearts of the actors."
James Cameron,The films that influenced me were so disparate that there's almost no pattern.
James Cameron,"The film industry is about saying 'no' to people, and inherently you cannot take 'no' for an answer."
James Cameron,"Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put your name on it as director. Now you're a director. Everything after that you're just negotiating your budget and your fee."
James Cameron,My mother was a housewife but she was also an artist. My father was an electrical engineer.
James Cameron,"It'll be all of our efforts together. It won't won't ever be exactly the way I imagined it. And that is, I think, an important lesson as well, is that in any group enterprise it's going to be the sum total of the group."
James Cameron,It was good training to think spatially and to think in terms of story boarding and so on. So I was already a filmmaker but I hadn't realized it yet.
James Cameron,It took me a long time to realize that you have to have a bit of an interlanguage with actors. You have to give them something that they can act with.
James Cameron,"If you wait until the right time to have a child you'll die childless, and I think film making is very much the same thing. You just have to take the plunge and just start shooting something even if it's bad."
James Cameron,"I watched a couple of really bad directors work, and I saw how they completely botched it up and missed the visual opportunities of the scene when we had put things in front of them as opportunities. Set pieces, props and so on."
James Cameron,"I was always fascinated by engineering. Maybe it was an attempt maybe to get my father's respect or interest, or maybe it was just a genetic love of technology, but I was always trying to build things."
James Cameron,"I mean, you have to be able - you have to have made the commitment within yourself to do whatever it takes to get the job done and to try to inspire other people to do it, because obviously the first rule is you can't do it by yourself."
James Cameron,"I lived in a small town. It was 2,000 people in Canada. A little river that went through it and we swam in the - you know, there was a lot of water around. Niagara Falls was about four or five miles away."
James Cameron,"I had read tons of science fiction. I was fascinated by other worlds, other environments. For me, it was fantasy, but it was not fantasy in the sense of pure escapism."
James Cameron,I had pictured myself as a filmmaker but I had never pictured myself as a director if that makes any sense at all.
James Cameron,I certainly didn't think of myself as gifted. The standards for being gifted in my environment were if you were good in Little League or if you were good in football.
James Cameron,"I actually started as a model builder and quickly progressed into production design, which made sense because I could draw and paint. But I kept watching that guy over there who was moving the actors around and setting up the shots."
James Cameron,"I blame it on Walt Disney, where animals are given human qualities. People don't understand that a wild animal is not something that is nice to pat. It can seriously harm you."
James Cameron,"I do an awful lot of scuba diving. I love to be on the ocean, under the ocean. I live next to the ocean."
James Cameron,So much of literary sci-fi is about creating worlds that are rich and detailed and make sense at a social level. We'll create a world for people and then later present a narrative in that world.
James Cameron,I love short trips to New York; to me it is the finest three-day town on earth.
Nigel Cameron,"Certainly, if these reports are true, it's a tragedy for science."
Nigel Cameron,What we do with dogs we may well end up doing with our kids.
Nigel Cameron,"It seems to me that our culture is going through a crisis of its vision of what it means to be human,"
Nigel Cameron,This is so tiny it can go where no one has ever gone before. (Nano-particles) can cross the blood-brain barrier. The general concern is that the safety work really has to be done or people won't trust the products.
Scott Cameron,"If we had been in a little tighter race (for the playoffs), I obviously wouldn't have considered it."
Scott Cameron,"There's not much to say, really. We gave them four quick goals. You can't give a good team breaks like that. They'll jump all over you. That's why they're in first place."
Scott Cameron,"I'm in awe of what's happening here. If that sign can be used as a force for good, then it's worth it."
Scott Cameron,"I think that's very important, and i think as a society we have to continue to have faith in people and help one and another."
Scott Cameron,"They had lost their checkbook, credit cards- all their identification. We were able to make some leaps of faith and get them in and give them a place where they could start anew and rebuild their lives."
Kathleen Camilli,"Housing continues to remain the anomaly in this downturn, [with] continued strength coming presumably from the impact of a low unemployment rate, good income growth and historically high levels of home affordability."
Kathleen Camilli,"Put in perspective, these levels are as high as they were in the late 1960s, so the fact that we've come off a little bit is most likely the reflection of anticipation of higher interest rates."
Kathleen Camilli,"I think the Fed is erring on the side of caution, as a central bank should. That's why they left the direction in place. It could be this time they're holding tight too long. We'll know that only in hindsight, as unfortunate as that is."
Joe Camp,"The first Benji came out of a shelter and, without a whole lot of mission and passion attached -- just that it was a neat thing -- caused over a million adoptions. And so we said 'If we go back at it with a little fervor, we ought to be able to do a lot better than that and help a lot of these homeless animals,'"
Joe Camp,"By lowering that bar and making kids believe that it's OK to do or say anything you want to at any given time gives no balance whatsoever, ... There's no longer any right or wrong."
Joe Camp,"We spent about a year negotiating with Hollywood. Wound up negotiating real seriously with three studios -- a big one, a medium one and a small one. Every one of them came down to the same thing, control,"
Alastair Campbell,"There is going to have to be another leader in place when the next election comes and you would have to put your money on Gordon,"
Alastair Campbell,"A huge character, Gareth would bring a very different, perhaps more warlike approach,"
Alastair Campbell,"He included plenty of references of specific points of anxiety relating to the training and the day itself. And he put in a few specific trigger words or phrases that he urged me to say to myself whenever I felt I was weakening or panicking. The one that lodged was 'better, faster, stronger."
Alex Campbell,"What we are only now beginning to fully realize is that in seeking material pleasure too constantly, the capacity for enjoyment or fulfillment decreases and eventually becomes exhausted."
Alex Campbell,The reason why I take my life is because I want to go to my wife and boy. My usefulness in this world is at an end. I can not be satisfied in any business and can not be without their companionship.
Alex Campbell,"We, in Prince Edward Island, are fully familiar with this modern phenomenon."
Alex Campbell,"To conquer nature is, in effect, to remove all natural barriers and human norms and to substitute artificial, fabricated equivalents for natural processes."
Alex Campbell,Some would suggest that there has been a dramatic change in our perception of the world and ourselves within the world. Others have observed that there has been an almost complete about-face in a relatively short span of time.
Alex Campbell,"My friends all regarded me as a man of unsound mind because I held the view that my wife was with me in spirit always. I have lived with her spirit guiding me every day and she is with me now as I write this letter, and helps me to do as I am now doing."
Alex Campbell,Mechanization or industrialization of this sort has really only left man with one all-important mission in life: to conquer nature.
Alex Campbell,"If I go among strangers the story of my insanity soon follows, and I do not care to live such a life when I can in a few hours go to my wife and boy."
Alex Campbell,"I hope and trust the infinite, the eternal, and merciful and loving God. I worship Him and feel no guilt in my heart before him for what I am going to do."
Alex Campbell,I have no ill will in my heart against anybody in this world.
Alex Campbell,"I go gladly to my wife and boy, and I leave this world at peace with every one in it and at peace with God."
Alex Campbell,"I do not regard it as wrong to take my life, because I simply change my place of residence and go where my wife and baby are."
Alex Campbell,I believe in God and immortality.
Alex Campbell,"I am through with this body, and what becomes of it will make no difference with me in the future."
Alex Campbell,I am glad to go with my wife and baby boy.
Alex Campbell,"However, if we examine the Canadian scene closely enough, we can see signs of this physical and spiritual rot settling into a number of our Canadian urban centres with a troubling spill-over into many of our more rural areas."
Alex Campbell,"Even with, or perhaps, because of, this background, I have over the past few years sensed a very dramatic change in attitude on the part of Prince Edward Islanders towards the on-going rush for so-called modernization."
Alex Campbell,"But most Canadians have recognized to a greater or lesser extent that despite much of the so-called progress of the affluent society, essential ingredients to a meaningful life seem to be either entirely lacking, or at best, difficult to grasp."
Alex Campbell,"Besides, my usefulness here is destroyed because all of my friends think me a man of unsound mind."
Alex Campbell,"As a consequence, progress has come to mean simply more power, more profit, more productivity, more paper prosperity, all of which are convertible into standards concerned only with size or magnitude rather than quality or excellence."
Alex Campbell,"We, in our Province, are beginning to realize and appreciate that our slowness in keeping up with our North American neighbours may well have been a blessing in disguise."
Alex Campbell,"We must carefully examine change so that we are able to discard those aspects of change which would be detrimental to our way of life, and, at the same time, take advantage of those aspects of change which will enhance and improve our quality of life."
Alex Campbell,"We have witnessed the terrible increases in the incidence of alcoholism, the advent of drug dependency, the protests, marches, strikes and human alienation."
Alex Campbell,"Over the past several years, all of us as Canadians, and as members of the North American cultural and economic environment, have been to a greater or lesser extent party to a significant attitudinal change towards our culture."
Alex Campbell,"Over the past few years, many of us have increasingly begun to question the direction and meaning of our society as it has developed over the past several centuries."
Alex Campbell,"Next to God I worship my wife and boy and will soon be with them and with my father and mother, who are there waiting my coming."
Bruce Campbell,"With a comic book, if you make it take place at night, it doesn't cost you a penny more, ... You can have rain and wind and sets that are vastly decorated, you can have great locations because you're making it all up ... it was a great opportunity to tell more of a true version of the story."
Bruce Campbell,"Make no mistake: given the dearth of black suppliers in key areas such as panel beating, tow-truck operators and the like, the charter targets will not be easily reached."
Bruce Campbell,"Plenty of people will see 'Man With the Screaming Brain' and think it's the worst movie they've ever seen, ... But there's a group out there that'll be fine with it."
Bruce Campbell,Man With the Screaming Brain
Bruce Campbell,I can't think of any organization where there isn't room for improvement.
Bruce Campbell,"If I were pitching it in Hollywood, ... I'd say it's `The Out-of-Towners' with a brain transplant."
Bruce Campbell,"If I were pitching it in Hollywood, ... I'd say it's 'The Out-of-Towners' with a brain transplant."
Bruce Campbell,"Oh my god, every one you can imagine for years and years,"
Bruce Campbell,"I think it would be fun to take questions and to just rag on Hollywood,"
Bruce Campbell,"Not surprisingly, most of the young, primarily male, respondents to our survey said that they want a small, fun-to-drive sports car that can incorporate the technology products that they use on a daily basis, such as cell phones, mp3 players and game consoles."
Bruce Campbell,"We want Urge to replicate the raw motorcycle experience as much as possible, with the exposed engine, door-panel cut-outs and open top. Motorcycles are exhilarating to drive and we want this car to feel the same way."
Bruce Campbell,The Minister really set a positive tone. I think it's the first time an education minister made a public statement that funding in these areas was flat.
Bruce Campbell,"The perception was it was a college movie, but it really wasn't, ... It was a completely professional venture where we formed a limited partnership and gave out shares. It was all above board. And we're so glad it was, because 25 years later we can still keep track of it. No one's suing anyone because we all know what happened."
Bruce Campbell,"And most importantly, it plays pretty well with audiences."
Bruce Campbell,"It totally sounds like an advice book, ... but there's not a shred of advice in the entire book, which is good for any of your readers. It's a novel. It's a humor book. It's sort of a what-if scenario of what would happen if you took a B-movie actor, meaning me -- I take the lead role in the book -- and put him into a big Hollywood movie. The answer is that it's not good. It's a misadventure. I single-handedly take down a big Hollywood movie."
Cassie Campbell,It's kind of sad that the team won't be the same.
Cassie Campbell,"The score may not show it, but it was a tough game."
Cassie Campbell,We wanted to get to the gold-medal game. We're there and now we're going to prepare and do everything in the next two days to be the best we can be.
Cassie Campbell,"The score may not show it, but it was a tough game. This is why we came, to get to the medal round. But there's only one color medal we want. Now we've taken the next step toward it."
Cassie Campbell,Why is women's hockey the only sport that sort of gets put down for excellence? Why should we stop and not get better?
Cassie Campbell,"It's a passion these girls have and our staff has and Mel (coach Davidson) has for the game I think no other country understands yet. We're born with hockey sticks in our hands. When they get a taste of winning like we've had, they'll understand what we do on a regular basis."
Cassie Campbell,"We were the favorites for a reason, and we showed exactly why. We faced much more adversity four years ago, but we were just as determined and just as focused this time. It's really even sweeter when you can come through as the favorite."
Chad Campbell,"I want to play for Jack, ... I hope I can at least get to the 12th spot and give myself a chance."
Chad Campbell,You don't want to get ahead of yourself. I've got 36 holes left. There is a lot of golf left.
Chad Campbell,"The tournament is not over yet, just because you beat one guy. It's definitely an accomplishment, and I'm proud of myself for grinding it out."
Chad Campbell,I expect to win. I think I have the ability to win.
Chris Campbell,"We don't even own a halter, and now we've got two horses. Now we're going to have to figure out what to do with them."
Chris Campbell,This is convenient for both programs. We split the distance. It's good to get college sports at places where it might not otherwise be exposed.
Chris Campbell,"Generally speaking, the business challenges and market factors driving the decision to outsource are similar between the private and public sectors."
Chris Campbell,"Generally from an IT market standpoint, things slowed down in relation to the whole budget. But outsourcing generally remains strong."
David Campbell,"We are extremely excited about the early work on this next generation of search technology. Instead of having to waste time searching for news and other important information on the Internet, our customized SIMS portals search and retrieve exactly the information you and/or your company are interested in."
David Campbell,Everything's really good right now. I think there's potential this weekend to pick up some more. Another 10 fish this season wouldn't surprise me.
David Campbell,He was all over where there was music.
David Campbell,"The general feeling is a potential justice will simply say, 'No, I can't discuss this situation unless I have the facts of the case in front of me,'"
David Campbell,"Companies can use Bloodhound's SIMS to gather information about competitors, identify potential clients, monitor industry trends, track changes in legislation or even to educate the company's employees or other stakeholders about the business and the industry the company is in."
David Campbell,"I'm really resentful (of dad) ..., ... .... I suppose he deserved it. No, I couldn't be prouder."
David Campbell,That's the dirty little secret of Mormon growth. Lots of baptisms don't necessarily translate into long-term membership.
David Campbell,Discipline is remembering what you want.
David Campbell,It has a really timeless feel.
David Campbell,Having that control gives us greater ability to mitigate safety risks.
Don Campbell,"The more connections that can be made in the brain, the more integrated the experience is within memory."
Don Campbell,"It's my hope that teachers and parents will use music just like they use good food and vegetables -- that there's a place for it in their diet, ... The Mozart Effect."
Don Campbell,We have been aggressively reinvesting our net income to deliver new energy supplies in the U.S. and to the world market. A big chunk of our refining in the U.S. is to meet U.S. energy demands and supplies.
Don Campbell,"The evaluation is a combination of economics, supply and market issues, availability of crude oil, transportation and the (potential) return on investment. We are giving careful attention to plans to expand."
George Campbell,"He's credited with quite a spectacular job of revitalizing the (arts) school,"
George Campbell,"[The Air Force unit had a mixture of active duty, Air Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel.] The reservists were able to use their civilian occupations while we were deployed, ... We had people from all walks of life that were able to maker things better."
George Campbell,"Once in a while, every few decades, a real prize class comes along, and that was these kids."
James Campbell,"Get us the cargo, and we'll get you the labor."
James Campbell,"There is community interest on the status of the cleanup out there and the implications to our neighborhood. There are lots of kids here, any parent living this close to Rocky Flats would ask about the risk."
James Campbell,"We believe that somewhere around age 20, we'll begin to see low-lead exposed individuals surpass high-lead exposed individuals in bone mass density. Then, in the 50 to 60 age group ? the age at which any individuals will begin to experience a natural loss of bone ? we expect to see the high-lead exposed individuals losing more bone sooner."
Jane Campbell,"I have been systematically returning firefighters and police, ... We cannot bring back police and firefighters we cannot pay."
Jane Campbell,"OK, my friends: now the general election campaign begins and we are in it to win it, ... We have earned our place in the runoff. Nobody else had seven people running against them."
Jane Campbell,"We got in, rolled up our sleeves. Now the finance department can add and subtract. The law department can write a contract. The building department can issue a permit do an inspection. City Hall works for our citizens,"
Jason Campbell,"That's one thing I don't worry about with Brandon,"
Jason Campbell,"A good defensive line can dominate a football game. That is exactly what happened tonight. They did it in the second half to us last year, and did it the whole night tonight."
Jason Campbell,"I've been criticized for things I didn't have any control over -- I just did what the coaches asked, ... You've got to be in a system that fits you. When coach Borges came in, by the second or third week of spring, I knew we were clicking."
Jim Campbell,This is strictly for the New Orleans Police Department.
Jim Campbell,"To our knowledge, everything in the city and county is going good."
Jim Campbell,"We've seen good results in animals, but that could fail in humans. We're very hopeful here."
Jim Campbell,There's a sense that this is not supposed to happen in the U.S. And that provokes anger and anxiety not only in the Gulf Coast but around the country.
John Campbell,This is TELEVISION. We're doing a SIMPLE analysis.
John Campbell,"The whole point of this bill was to create incentives for a technology that is currently too expensive so that over time it will become cost- competitive, ... Now, the unions will be artificially increasing the cost of the already too expensive technology in order to line their own pockets."
John Campbell,"Hard cases, it is said, make bad law"
John Campbell,"Logging has sometimes been cited as a way to reduce fuels that could feed future fires. But not everything leaves on the log truck. We found that the process of logging in this type of situation actually produces a large amount of fine fuels on the ground that, unless removed, could increase fire risk, not decrease it."
John Campbell,It's purely fiction and Dan Brown recognizes that and promotes that.
John Campbell,"Unfortunately, I am bound by the terms of a confidentiality agreement and so cannot name the domestic airline we intend to acquire but can confirm that contracting is at an advanced stage and we expect to make an announcement within the next two weeks."
Joseph Campbell,"However, if we are wrong and there is a strike, we would expect BA shares to trade down by $2 to $4 per share and we would consider that a buying opportunity."
Joseph Campbell,Out of perfection nothing can be made. Every process involves breaking something up.
Joseph Campbell,"Marriage is not a love affair. A love affair is a totally different thing. A marriage is a commitment to that which you are. That person is literally your other half. And you and the other are one. A love affair isnt that. That is a relationship of pleasure, and when it gets to be unpleasurable , its off. But a marriage is a life commitment, and a life commitment means the prime concern of your life. If marriage is not the prime concern, you are not married."
Joseph Campbell,"The world is full of people that have stopped listening to themselves or have listened only their neighbors to learn what they ought to do, how they ought to behave, and what the values are they should be living for."
Joseph Campbell,"Life is like arriving late for a movie, having to figure out what was going on without bothering everybody with a lot of questions, and then being unexpectedly called away before you find out how it ends"
Joseph Campbell,"The way to find out about happiness is to keep your mind on those moments when you feel most happy, when you are really happy not excited, not just thrilled, but deeply happy. This requires a little bit of self-analysis. What is it that makes you happy? Stay with it, no matter what people tell you. This is what is called following your bliss."
Joseph Campbell,God is a metaphor for that which transcends all levels of intellectual thought. It's as simple as that.
Joseph Campbell,"The goal is to live with godlike composure on the full rush of energy, like Dionysus riding the leopard, without being torn to pieces."
Joseph Campbell,Follow your bliss.
Joseph Campbell,Love thine enemies because they are the instruments to your destiny.
Joseph Campbell,"Smiths' share price targets range from down 4 percent to 20 gain, highlighting a debate about what Smiths should be worth."
Joseph Campbell,"[I have no doubt that I stand here at the very center of creation. Every fir tree, each of its needles, the movement of wind, all that I perceive and even more that I don't, all resonate with a vital hum. It is the hum of the universe, what the Chinese call the ten thousand things, all of them speaking out, saying precisely nothing. Each is its own center, the exact place where the world begins.] The center is where you are standing, ... and the other center is where I am standing."
Joseph Campbell,"Original Experience has not been interpreted for you, and so youve got to work out life for yourself. Either you can take it or you cant. You dont have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself in very difficult situations. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience that is the heros deed."
Joseph Campbell,It Takes Courage To Do What You Want
Joseph Campbell,"A computer is like an Old Testament god, with a lot of rules and no mercy"
Joseph Campbell,"A computer is like an Old Testament god, with a lot of rules and no mercy."
Joseph Campbell,"I had my heart set on three things: One, the choral office; two, the habit; and community life. We spend a lot of time together. We work together, eat together, pray together,"
Joseph Campbell,"Marriage is not a love affair. A love affair is a totally different thing. A marriage is a commitment to that which you are. That person is literally your other half. And you and the other are one. A love affair isnâ€™t that. That is a relationship of pleasure, and when it gets to be unpleasurable , itâ€™s off. But a marriage is a life commitment, and a life commitment means the prime concern of your life. If marriage is not the prime concern, you are not married."
Joseph Campbell,"Whenever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or place. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history, mythology is absurd."
Joseph Campbell,"It's a little too early to tell what happened, ... This had the appearance of a well-planned and well-negotiated deal that was designed to be released on Monday."
Joseph Campbell,Follow your bliss and doors will open where there were no doors before.
Joseph Campbell,"One way or another, we all have to find what best fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life, and dedicate ourselves to that."
Joseph Campbell,"Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy."
Joseph Campbell,"Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain."
Joseph Campbell,"When people get married because they think it's a long-time love affair, they'll be divorced very soon, because all love affairs end in disappointment. But marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity."
Joseph Campbell,"When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self-preservation, we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness."
Joseph Campbell,The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure.
Joseph Campbell,God is a metaphor for that which trancends all levels of intellectual thought. It's as simple as that.
Joseph Campbell,"We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us."
Joseph Campbell,"When you follow your bliss... doors will open where you would not have thought there would be doors, and where there wouldn't be a door for anyone else."
Joseph Campbell,"I don't have to have faith, I have experience."
Joseph Campbell,"It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure."
Joseph Campbell,"Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes?"
Joseph Campbell,A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself.
Joseph Campbell,"If you follow your bliss, doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else."
Joseph Campbell,Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.
Joseph Campbell,I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.
Joseph Campbell,The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.
Joseph Campbell,Life is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is Whatever you ascribe it to be. Being alive is the meaning.
Joseph Campbell,Love is a friendship set to music.
Joseph Campbell,"What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else."
Joseph Campbell,"The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature."
Joseph Campbell,"We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us."
Joseph Campbell,Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself.
Joseph Campbell,Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging.
Joseph Campbell,"When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you're sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship."
Joseph Campbell,"We're so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what it is all about."
Joseph Campbell,"As a white candle In a holy place, So is the beauty Of an aged face"
Joseph Campbell,The big question is whether you are going to be able to  say a hearty yes to your adventure.
Joseph Campbell,The adventure of the hero is the adventure of being alive
Joseph Campbell,"I think the person who takes a job in order to live - that is to say, for the money - has turned himself into a slave."
Joseph Campbell,"Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths."
Joseph Campbell,Computers are like Old Testament gods; lots of rules and no mercy.
Ken Campbell,We are prepared to agree the interests of justice dictate that the applicants should be released from custody.
Ken Campbell,there may be a reasonable basis to conclude a miscarriage of justice has occurred.
Ken Campbell,"Creation 'scientists' must be aware that the informed workers in literary interpretation and in physical and biological sciences regard their stance as irresponsible, and that in the scholarly world as well as in the schools they are doing irreparabl"
Kim Campbell,There is a lot of talent here in Laredo. And we are happy to be a part of it.
Kim Campbell,The man from the east end of Montreal who has worked all his life on the line should not be forced to accept handouts when the plant closes. He should be given the chance to retrain or to start his own business. He should be given every opportunity to continue to contribute to the community that he probably has spent his life helping to build.
Kim Campbell,"It's a great investment in the community,"
Kim Campbell,"For me, unemployment and poverty in the Greater Montreal area is not mainly a problem of structure, or design, or statistics. It is a profoundly human situation."
Kim Campbell,"We have to define and put into practice a better, more coherent and effective policy on income security."
Kim Campbell,It would be naive to imagine we have solved all our income security problems simply because the roles of the federal and provincial governments in the area of skills training have been clarified.
Kim Campbell,I believe that Canadians have the common sense to see that a better future cannot be built on fragmentation.
Kim Campbell,Government cannot and must not replace private initiative.
Kim Campbell,"An increasing number of Canadians must juggle the demands of work with the need to care for children, or for family members who are ill or too frail to care for themselves. Our programs have simply not kept pace with these societal changes."
Kim Campbell,"In all modesty, we must admit that governments are not always the best doctors when it comes to diagnosing economic ailments and prescribing the right treatment."
Kim Campbell,"Too often, governments have operated in a vacuum, believing they could come up with some magic formula to which they have an exclusive patent."
Kim Campbell,I'd be prouder still to say I was Canada's 10th woman prime minister.
Kim Campbell,"Canadians want to see real hope restored, not false hopes raised."
Kim Campbell,"Despite our high rate of unemployment, 300,000 jobs go unfilled largely because many of the unemployed lack the skills needed today as a result of technological progress."
Kim Campbell,"We now know that unity, the cornerstone of Canada's greatness and prosperity, is above all a matter of emotion and reason for every citizen."
Kim Campbell,Our first Prime Minister saw a country that would be known for its generosity of spirit. And so it is.
Kim Campbell,"For too many, to work means having less income."
Kim Campbell,"Canada is the homeland of equality, justice and tolerance."
Kim Campbell,"On the same day I was sworn in as Prime Minister of Canada, I announced the most sweeping reform ever undertaken in the structure of our federal government."
Kim Campbell,"Our Canada is an inclusive country, built by English - and French - speaking Canadians, together with our Aboriginal peoples, who were here first, and the millions who have come since from every corner of the world. And still they come-1 million people a year make inquiries about coming to Canada."
Kim Campbell,"As Canadian citizens, we benefit from a system of social programs that is second to none. But we know that our system has let a lot of people down-that is has not adequately supported their efforts to become self-reliant and to participate in society to the best of their ability."
Michael Campbell,"[Baltusrol's back-to-back closing par 5s, Woods reasoned, offered a safety net ensuring someone would better his 278 aggregate. They had been nettlesome enough, though, to trip up the game's greatest player earlier in the week.] Yeah, I'm surprised, very surprised, ... The last two holes â€¦ anything could happen, especially in that rough. I would have hung around for a playoff."
Michael Campbell,"[Hackett's research does not cover every area where ERP systems have an impact.] We look at the ways in which people use technology to automate processes, ... We don't look at the technology itself, and we don't look at market performance."
Michael Campbell,"I changed management groups. All of these aspects are very important for me to succed this year, ... I've got a great formula going right now."
Michael Campbell,It's been a wonderful journey so far. I just want to ride this rocket as long as I can.
Michael Campbell,"He's the yardstick of how good we can get. He does things with his golf stick that we cannot do,"
Michael Campbell,It's a very fickle golf course. I've just got to be patient the next three days and pick up some ground.
Michael Campbell,"The previous champions are all of the greats in golf,"
Michael Campbell,Last week I was watching a bit of golf on TV and I could feel my fingers and my feet tapping because I'm ready to go now.
Paul Campbell,trying to get a feel for each establishment.
Paul Campbell,"Before we had this, our buyers were at the mercy of the vendors."
Paul Campbell,"It really expanded opportunities for small businesses. Once the law took effect, we began to heavily market the program across the state."
Paul Campbell,Whether or not a land is for sale weighs in hugely for criteria.
Paul Campbell,"No doubt it would increase our tax base, assess the valuation somewhat, increased revenues from the buildings that he would put up and the animals he would have in those facilities,"
Paul Campbell,"We heard from many small-business owners, and (for) all of them it was difficult for them to compete with larger, even global firms."
Paul Campbell,This is a case of applying best business practices. We're fully utilizing our assets.
Paul Campbell,"For other states to really understand and take advantage of what we learned in Illinois, we realized that we'd have to 'walk them' through our process--which led us to the workshop idea."
Rebecca Campbell,"To me, you can't put a dollar amount on our servicemen and women who have given their all for our freedom."

Robert Campbell,"When I find something beautiful and fascinating, I keep coming back to it. I don't work with the part of my brain that has to do with theories or imposing my sense of the world on someone else. Nor do I ask questions about how we view things."
Robert Campbell,"Our much improved earnings resulted largely from the strength of refining margins during the quarter,"
Robert Campbell,I wanted to create a space that looks like a gallery of photographs. It isn't a dark room. It isn't filled with wires. There is no sound.
Robert Campbell,"When we don't get behind, we can slow down the tempo. But we got into a running game with them."
Robert Campbell,They haven't lost this year and they've been very consistent in their efforts against some quality teams.
Robert Campbell,"Some of them didn't even have shoes on their feet-- their feet were cut up. I was giving them lotion to rub on their legs,"
Sol Campbell,I'm just happy to get in there and start playing.
Sol Campbell,"Those decisions are up to Sven,"
Sol Campbell,It is now being dealt with by the authorities.

Thomas Campbell,That would be important to us to honor our dad.
Thomas Campbell,"I think of those weavers working through the damp Christmas months to get the tapestry done in six months per the contract in Florence, and clinging to every minute of daylight. Probably they had the artist breathing down their neck."
Tom Campbell,There are enough people that cared about ethics and integrity that Mr. DeLay was unable to go forward.

Tom Campbell,Exhibit A in their 'culture of corruption' is Tom DeLay.
Tom Campbell,Mr. DeLay has done good for this district but recently he's made some poor ethical choices. It's just time for us to move on.
Laura Campione,"Having the program here on a weekend is a way for parents, who may not be able to get to the fairs, to have their children's information available in case it is needed. I was very pleased to see not only moms, but dads as well. I think the children really enjoyed it. This was a very good learning experience and will help us plan for next year."

Albert Camus,"The truth, as the light, makes blind."
Albert Camus,I was absent at the moment I took up the most space.
Albert Camus,"The society of merchants can be defined as a society in which things disappear in favor of signs. When a ruling class measures its fortunes, not by the acre of land or the ingot of gold, but by the number of figures corresponding ideally to a certain number of exchange operations, it thereby condemns itself to setting a certain kind of humbug at the center of its experience and its universe. A society founded on signs is, in its essence, an artificial society in which man's carnal truth is handled as something artificial."

Or, rather, he has spoken through the voice of Victor Hugo, Zola, Richepin. At least, they said so. And these shameful impostures fed their authors. Cruel irony, the Poor Man tormented with hunger feeds those who plead his case."

Albert Camus,A taste for truth at any cost is a passion which spares nothing
Albert Camus,"In the midst of winter, I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer."

Albert Camus,"The society based on production is only productive, not creative."
Albert Camus,"The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor."
Albert Camus,"Retaliation is related to nature and instinct, not to law. Law, by definition, cannot obey the same rules as nature."
Albert Camus,Stupidity has a knack of getting its way.

Albert Camus,"At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise... that denseness and that strangeness of the world is absurd."
Albert Camus,"Abstract Art: A product of the untalented, sold by the unprincipled to the utterly bewildered."

Elias Canetti,One should not confuse the craving for life with endorsement of it.
Elias Canetti,"Words are not too old, only people are too old if they use the same words too frequently."

Nick Cannon,"Right now, I'm as single as a slice of American cheese."
Nick Cannon,"It's fun having songs about parties and gigolos, but I really wanted to use my music as a form of art. Art is supposed to spark conversation and make people think, and I wanted to do that with this song."
Nick Cannon,"In the hip-hop community, it's about how real are you, or how strong can you be, and really my music just reflects me. If you can accept me, then you can accept my music."
Nick Cannon,"If you want to be in the automotive business, you go to Detroit, and you figure it out. If you want to be in entertainment, go to where it's at. Go to Hollywood, go to New York."
Nick Cannon,"I'm not geeky but I have my geeky, corky moments, and then I've got some aspects of cool in me, I guess."
Nick Cannon,I was rapping at eight.
Nick Cannon,I was attracted from day one. How could you not be attracted to someone who has a great spirit on the inside and beautiful on the outside?

Nick Cannon,"I'm so into playing different characters, even when I was on Nickelodeon. I just observe."

Robinson Cano,"I asked God, 'If we can get two runs here,' ... 'that would be great.'"

Robinson Cano,"I know he loves his fastball, ... So I just said, 'OK, I'm looking for fastballs.'"

Eric Cantona,"When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea."

Eric Cantona,We knew that you don't get to be world champions without a struggle.
Eric Cantona,This is quite an elitist film and I'm not sure that every Manchester United fan would like it. It's not an action movie that you might go to to relax.
Eric Cantona,"There were moments - I would be daydreaming - I would imagine scenes, even if there wasn't a camera around. In my head, I was acting."

Eric Cantona,I don't want to be in Terminator. I don't want to go to Hollywood.

Eddie Cantor,A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.
Georg Cantor,"started to tell his friends that he had not been the inventor of the ideas about infinity that he had published. He was merely a mouthpiece, inspired by God to communicate parts of the mind of God to everyone else."
Georg Cantor,The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom.
Georg Cantor,"The fear of infinity is a form of myopia that destroys the possibility of seeing the actual infinite, even though it in its highest form has created and sustains us, and in its secondary transfinite forms occurs all around us and even inhabits our minds."
Jerry Cantrell,"We're making it up as we go along. It's what we always did in the past. We're writing the book as we live it. We feel confident that we will have a good time and that it's something that will live up to the same level. It's an exploratory thing, and we're just having fun with it. We'd like to go out and play for the people that supported us and love the music as much as we have all these years. We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend."
Jerry Cantrell,"Every record that you do man, is sooo different in every way."

Jeff Capel,"As crazy as it is, with only 2.6 seconds left, we had a chance. We got a great look. Nick had an outstanding shot but just missed it."
Jeff Capel,Their record doesn't indicate it but they have talent. Those two guys that became eligible [after first semester] have had time to practice and become acclimated to what it's like to play in a game. We don't want them to get well against us.
Jeff Capel,"Jesse was very determined, you can tell by the way he played."
Jeff Capel,"He's good. When you have a guy like that who is that good offensively, then compliment the fact that he has an ultimate green light, he is going to play every minute. There is no such thing as a bad shot for him (and) that makes guys like that even more difficult to guard."
Jeff Capel,We were able to make plays down the stretch. We showed our character and toughness.
Fabio Capello,"I think it was a fully deserved victory. However we created a lot of chances but we didn't take them and that meant we had to wait until the 82nd minute to seal the result after our keeper made two important saves,"
Fabio Capello,We have an extremely competitive roster in terms of quality and quantity. And compared to last year we know each other better and have all been together from the first day of training camp.

Lois Capps,It would allow them to serve rich communities and ignore the rest.

Lois Capps,"My experience as a school nurse taught me that we need to make a concerted effort, all of us, to increase physical fitness activity among our children and to encourage all Americans to adopt a healthier diet that includes fruits and vegetables, but there is more."

Rick Carlisle,That's an unbelievable streak. It shows how those guys work to take care of themselves and why they have the best record in the league.
Rick Carlisle,"With him, it usually comes down to the kind of shots he's getting. We have to work to get him high-quality shots. When he gets good quality shots, he plays very efficiently."
Rick Carlisle,"I have been voting for this guy as an all-star for three years. I am no closet fan. I am an out-there fan. I love the way he plays, and he is a guy you really fear."
Rick Carlisle,Anthony Johnson played a terrific game. He's playing with great aggressiveness and savvy and understanding the pulse of the team he is running.
Rick Carlisle,We've moved on. It's unfortunate. But we're just trying to win without him.
Rick Carlisle,"We're trying to hang in. We probably could have done a lot more things over the course of 48 minutes to put ourselves in a stronger position, but we didn't. We don't have much time to hang our heads about this. We've got another one tomorrow."
Rick Carlisle,"We have to defend better, not turn the ball over and stay out of foul trouble."
Rick Carlisle,Jamaal plays a big part of our success. We're going to have to deal with it. It's tough. We got guys that can step in. We'll re-evaluate where he's at after three games.
Rick Carlisle,We hoped he was going to be open and have a pocket of space to get an open shot or drive the ball. Bosh did a great job of switching out defensively. I have to take the blame for that. That was a bad call putting a guy in a position that ended up not being a good position.
Rick Carlisle,"They outworked us and rubbed our faces in it too and they should have. We've got some soul searching to do. We have to play these guys again [Friday], which is not going to be any fun based on what I saw tonight."
Rick Carlisle,"They outworked us and rubbed our faces in it too and they should have, ... We've got some soul searching to do. We have to play these guys again [Friday], which is not going to be any fun based on what I saw tonight."
Rick Carlisle,We dug a hole and we were trying to dig our way out (of) the hole the rest of the game. It's frustrating because we did have some opportunities early. Unfortunately our undoing was the first quarter.
Rick Carlisle,"We dug ourselves into a hole and spent the rest of the game trying to dig ourselves out. We managed to give ourselves a chance in the second half, but the Wizards were able to put together a few scoring runs, and we couldn't stop them."
Rick Carlisle,This game's not a great indicator of reality.
Rick Carlisle,It's going to be a tight race for whatever position you're competing for in the last week of the season. The history of five through eight this year has been that it's been tight the whole year. I think it's going to continue that way.
Rick Carlisle,Those things work their way out. One thing about getting another quality player is you're going to have to earn your time on the court.
Rick Carlisle,"[But the Pacer's aren't planning on letting the Celtics win this one.] There's no way this team is going to go quietly, ... No way. We've been through too much."
Rick Carlisle,It was a terrible performance. It's as simple as that.
Rick Carlisle,It was a terrible performance. It's as simple as that. We'll have to bounce back in a big way. It's a disappointing performance. I'll leave it at that.
Rick Carlisle,"He's experienced and has played him a lot. He's done well with him in the past and he's the best guy that we have. We're fortunate that he's feeling better for a game that we're playing against the biggest, strongest guy in the game."
Rick Carlisle,We fought back after a horrendous first half where we really didn't play with much passion and we really showed signs of being a selfish team. That can't be what our team has to be about. We talked about some things at halftime and our guys really came out and fought and earned one of the toughest wins we've gotten all year long.
Rick Carlisle,The guy's at the top of his game. It's a rare opportunity to see a guy perform at this level.
Rick Carlisle,"Right now, he's a guy who's going to have to step to the forefront. It'll be an opportunity for him, and we're counting on him to come through for us."
Rick Carlisle,It was clear to me he knew the situation. He knew to spread the floor and look for an opportunity to break down the defense. He made a great play.
Rick Carlisle,He played well. He has an opportunity if he keeps developing and working to be a factor in our rotation next season.
Rick Carlisle,Danny had a great night. We're a different team when he plays the way he did tonight. We need him to continue to play at that level.
Rick Carlisle,"Just didn't seem like we were really right, all night. I don't have a reason why that is. We never got anything sustained."
Rick Carlisle,He had us on our heels a lot of the night.
Rick Carlisle,He may have moved his schedule up because of what happened in Memphis last night. We knew he was getting closer and closer. I thought it could be this week some time.
Rick Carlisle,It just didn't seem like we were really right all night. I don't have a reason why that is. Even in the first quarter when we won it by two. We were stagnant at both ends and never really got anything sustained.
Rick Carlisle,"If he's not able to play on the second night, then we just won't play him."
Rick Carlisle,We have the same group that played well and won the other night. We're not going to make excuses. Our undoing tonight was the first quarter when we allowed them to shoot over 77 percent. That got them going early.
Rick Carlisle,"When you make the kind of mistakes we made throughout the course of the whole game, you just leave too much to chance. They were aggressive, they did some things that made it tough on us. But you've got to meet force with force in this league. Early fourth we didn't do it."
Rick Carlisle,"It's not what we had in mind coming in, but it's a meaningful short-term goal."
Rick Carlisle,It's like inviting an assassin to a gathering of living presidents. You know he can score a zillion points. I have the utmost respect for Kobe Bryant. He competes at the highest of the highest echelon.
Rick Carlisle,"It's about learning the league, learning the guys he's playing against, what their tendencies are and what their strengths are because those are important things to defend well, ... We have a system of defense that's solid and he's in the process of learning that. For him, he's an experienced enough player and certainly has a high enough basketball IQ that he can pick it up quickly."
Rick Carlisle,Jack is such an important guy on our team. Our players view him as one of our leaders. You have to have your top players involved and playing at a high level. I thought tonight Jack understood the defensive end was going to be what was going to win the game for us.
Rick Carlisle,"He's been one of our steady, dependable players over the last three years. He's one of the leaders in our locker room because he is a longtime veteran. Those things you're going to miss, but the important thing right now is that he makes a full recovery relative to basketball and day-to-day living."
Rick Carlisle,He's getting the job done; it's as simple as that. My hat's off to him. He's been in and out of the lineup. He keeps showing up every day and coming to work like a pro. He's kept himself ready for this opportunity and he's obviously taking advantage of it.
Rick Carlisle,Detroit played great. They really hurt us on the boards. We didn't play a good game and they had a lot to do with it.
Rick Carlisle,"He hurt it at the end when he got that put-back, so we'll hold our breath and keep our fingers crossed that he'll be OK (on Thursday) and the next day. He's going to be sore, we know that, but if anybody will play hurt, he's certainly a guy who's done it time after time."
Rick Carlisle,Their offensive rebounding hurt us. It was the first game in a while that the rebounding differential on the offensive boards came back to haunt us. You can make a case that was the game (considering how) much that happened at the end of the game.
Rick Carlisle,"The second and third quarters hurt us defensively. We struggled and had some stretches where we couldn't stop them. Detroit is a team that is going to do a good job in the last play type of situations, but I'm more in tune to what happened in the second and third quarters than on the last play."
Rick Carlisle,There won't be any tough decisions when it comes to determining who to keep on the playoff roster. Our hope then is we can get back to 100 percent good health.
Rick Carlisle,It'll be one of the questions when you look back in history. How good could this guy have been? I'm not sure that there was any limit to his potential. It was just not to be.
Rick Carlisle,I won't know what our health situation is going to be until probably Sunday. We have a couple of days to try to get guys healthier.
Rick Carlisle,"He had a clean bill of health when the trade was made and all his past situations were checked out. The one thing he had trouble with was his back, but he hasn't missed any practice time, and that's a totally isolated, different situation."
Rick Carlisle,He's working hard to get to the point where he can come back. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later. We'll see.
Rick Carlisle,It's been like this the last two or three times he's come back. It's been hard to get what you call real practice time because of the frequency of games.
Rick Carlisle,"It's great to see the kind of generosity our players and franchise have shown. You could tell [Mindy] was very touched by the gesture, so that makes everybody feel good."
Rick Carlisle,"We're going to have to win a lot of games, starting with getting our first win, and that's really the only thing that concerns me right now."
Rick Carlisle,"We didn't have one of our better games as a team. Too many turnovers and too many points off turnovers. We've got a long way to go, a lot of work to do. We've got some time, fortunately."
Rick Carlisle,"The last six games, we've done a lot of things very well. We've done certain things better than we were doing them before."
Rick Carlisle,Those games were a long time ago. I don't think there's anything there we can hang our hats on. We've got to really work to get healthy and work to tighten up our game.
Rick Carlisle,It's clear off the last few games that he's a difference maker for us. I'm not going to look to play three guys just to play three guys. I'm going to look to try to have a rotation where guys can be comfortable. But you have to be accountable and play your minutes hard. Otherwise there are good players behind you; that's the fact. Our point position hasn't been this strong in a long time. It's good news for us.
Rick Carlisle,This is going to be a process for him. I would think it's going to be 20 to 30 games before he really starts to feel comfortable after being off for that long.
Rick Carlisle,"It was a disappointing performance, I'll leave it at that. ... We've got two games now where we've had disappointing stretches. We have to do better than that to keep any legitimate playoffs hopes alive."
Rick Carlisle,"The guys got together and decided to make a stand. If we hadn't won three straight games, we could easily be out of the playoff picture."
Rick Carlisle,At the start of the game he struggled. Of all the games that he's played in it was the worst start to a game that he's had. He got three quick fouls.
Rick Carlisle,"With 15 games left, we have to get to the group we feel can make a run."
Rick Carlisle,"Let's just say it's a short-term situation, which potentially makes it a little more than game-to-game possibly."
Rick Carlisle,We're 1-0 in our last one game.
Rick Carlisle,"The whole game we were shooting in the 30s and we could never get anything going offensively to set up our defense. When you get behind big you end up taking more 3s than you want to take, and 32 is a number that's too many. If you're taking that many, you're probably playing from behind and not in a very good position."
Rick Carlisle,Michael Redd was a guy we talked a lot of about before the game. (Jackson) did a good job at the start and our whole team reacted to him.
Rick Carlisle,They played great and we didn't give them much of a game tonight.
Rick Carlisle,"We have an 11-game season to make a push to make the playoffs. There's nothing guaranteed. We'll find out what we're made of during this stretch. The frequency of games is still there. We're a little banged up, but we have to find a way. I have a lot of confidence in our group."
Rick Carlisle,He made a point tonight. He was a key part of the game.
Rick Carlisle,"Richard Jefferson is going to be more involved in Game 2. We know that Jason Kidd is going to be more involved from a scoring standpoint in terms of his aggressiveness. Carter, you can talk about his bad shooting, but he still had 31 points. He missed a lot of point-blank shots he normally makes. They're going to be more balanced in their attack."
Rick Carlisle,We wanted to get the ball into Stephen Jackson's hands. He had been a major force for us the whole game. That last basket of ours was indicative of the whole game. He made the unselfish pass to the open man.
Rick Carlisle,"Detroit is very motivated for a lot of reasons. They're fighting for the best record in the league. They dropped a game to us, which will make them more motivated to win. We have to play our game and play it well."
Rick Carlisle,"I'm sad for him, for his family. A situation like this couldn't happen to a more undeserving person. Jonathan really is a great kid. He wanted to play basketball in the worst way and he wanted to help this franchise in the worst way."
Rick Carlisle,"Both of these guys we're bringing in have NBA experience,"
Rick Carlisle,"I found that the transition to competing in an NBA training camp was not that difficult, especially with my experience at Virginia and playing in the ACC. Fortunately, I kind of caught lightning in a bottle that year, had a great training camp and made the team."
Rick Carlisle,"We've had great execution in the last two games; we won one and lost another. These types of one-possession games come in waves. The way our team is set up, we have players that can make plays."
Rick Carlisle,"Unbelievable sequence of events at the end. When you have opportunities to close out games, you've got to take advantage of them. On the play at the end of regulation, we had a chance to get the rebound, the ball gets knocked loose, and Johnson hits the three."
Rick Carlisle,"As long as he plays with this kind of energy and force, he'll get minutes and make things happen."
Rick Carlisle,"He wanted to give it a try, and he really gave us some defensive energy to start the third, which was big."
Rick Carlisle,"The energy our guys played with was exceptional. It was a much-needed win for us. This is the kind of game we talked about having to play â€” more up-tempo, more movement."
Rick Carlisle,"Not only was he the scoring leader, but defensively he generated a lot of energy for us. Especially in the second half."
Rick Carlisle,Every point counts right now. I know David regrets what happened. We have to channel our emotional energy into emotional strength. That's got to be one our goals as we head down the stretch.
Rick Carlisle,"After games, emotions sometimes take over a little bit. The bottom line is we have six games to make this right. We'll find out if we deserve it or not."
Rick Carlisle,Without a doubt. He is the biggest reason why they're where they are now. There's nothing he can't do.
Rick Carlisle,"It's just too bad, because we really played hard for three quarters. The second quarter was really a disaster for us. It put us in a bad position at halftime, but we fought back and really put ourselves in a good position to win."
Rick Carlisle,It's certainly a step in the right direction. He continues to make gradual progress. We just hope things continue to get better.
Rick Carlisle,"They didn't do a great job with the coverage, but, hey, the way Tinsley played tonight, he put the defense in a tough situation. That was a huge play because it was so hard for Jermaine to get open looks around the basket. It gave our team some energy at the defensive end."
Rick Carlisle,They've become a very strong-willed team. Their defensive toughness is in evidence. They're more consistent on defense and in their rebounding. This is an adjustment in their style that they were playing. They were more of a free-flowing team and that has changed.
Rick Carlisle,"In the second half, his disposition was different at both ends. He made great decisions, he played unselfishly and he made big shots when we had to have them. We couldn't have done it without him."
Rick Carlisle,It's a deceptive final score. It was obviously a very difficult game. It's not easy against a team like Golden State because they are so explosive.
Rick Carlisle,That's something the medical people have to discuss. It's a conversation I haven't been involved in and I don't know what point it's at. You have to look at the long-term future of a young player as well as the short-term gains you have by playing him.
Rick Carlisle,I don't know; it's not really a conversation until it's a reality. We'll see. A lot can happen between now and when (Tinsley) comes back. It's a situation that we'll resolve when it comes time to resolve it.
Rick Carlisle,I thought he did a great job keeping his emotions under control in both series. I look for him to build on that. There's nobody in this league that always has complete control of their emotions. I thought he set a great tone in the playoffs and I look for him to continue in that vein.
Rick Carlisle,"Injuries are going to happen. You don't have any control over it. We just have to hope long-range he's going to be OK. We've got to be ready to go the duration without him, from the sounds of it. So it's not an easy situation."
Rick Carlisle,We have to establish some consistency. We have to have more intensity on defense because that leads to opportunities on offense.
Rick Carlisle,"He's at the point now where rookies are still rookies, but they have a veteran sort of confidence about them, and he should. The other thing he has learned this year is that when he plays well, it's going to be tougher to keep playing well because teams are going to keep getting ready for you."
Rick Carlisle,"We have a lot of confidence in all of our guys. If you have good players you need to use them, because not every team has this kind of depth. If guys play well they stay in the game. It gives us a chance to keep our starters fresh. It was a real key."
Rick Carlisle,"Considering the circumstances, I was happy with our competitive spirit out there. We had a lot of guys that played hard."
Rick Carlisle,You've got to have character to bounce back from a disappointing night like last night. You've got to have character and poise to withstand a furious run in a very loud building. You've just got to keep your boots strapped up and keep playing. Our guys did that and they earned the win.
Rick Carlisle,You do learn a lot about hanging in there. You learn about hard times and the fact that character is often identified in the hardest of times.
Rick Carlisle,"I'm pleased for our team. I thought we showed some real toughness and some real character. Our tough-mindedness has waned lately. That's something that if we're going to be a playoff team, it can't happen."
Rick Carlisle,I would believe the concerns for a loved one in the stands and the fact he just went up to see if everything was OK would be a mitigating circumstance. It would be a scary situation if you had concerns for a wife or child in the stands. I can understand why he went up there.
Rick Carlisle,"No, I don't. I've just got a real strong belief in all of our guys. So, I don't think that way. I don't go around worrying about what might happen."
Rick Carlisle,We're not a very good basketball team right now. This was very disappointing.
Rick Carlisle,We're not a very good basketball team right now. This was very disappointing. We couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle. The ball not going in in the third was key.
Rick Carlisle,We're going up against a guy who's playing a superhuman brand of basketball. He's looked invincible.
Rick Carlisle,We had the game going pretty well and we were playing good basketball. They made a run at the end of the half and they got the game tied and I thought that gave them a lot of momentum going into the second half. They did a great job of finishing off plays.
Rick Carlisle,We have to be honest; we're not a very good basketball team right now. We have to address things that need to be addressed.
Rick Carlisle,"We didn't play a full, hard 48 minutes of basketball and we left too much to chance. You have those types of let-ups and tempt fate with a Pierce bank shot. We're not in a position to do that."
Rick Carlisle,"It's different, but he played college ball at Maryland in the ACC so he's very familiar with American basketball and he knows the NBA game because he studied it a lot and he's played against a lot of the players. The learning curve for him as a 29-year-old shouldn't be that great."
Rick Carlisle,We just gotta try to continue to build on what's been a pretty good week of basketball and we've got one more opportunity before the playoffs start and it's important for us.
Rick Carlisle,"A.J. is playing with great awareness and great savvy. He looks like a guy that understands the pulse of the team he's running. The majority of the game, he's making our calls and directing us into things. He's a guy that really knows this team, as well as any player that I've had the opportunity to work with as a coach."
Rick Carlisle,A.J. is playing with great awareness and great savvy. He just looks like a guy who understands the pulse of the team he runs. He knows his team as well as any player I've had an opportunity to coach.
Rick Carlisle,"He has an affinity for the 'everyman' type of player, ... He's been here the last two summers working out with summer league players. It's something he has a liking for."
Rick Carlisle,He has an affinity for the 'everyman' type of player. He's been here the last two summers working out with summer league players. It's something he has a liking for.
Rick Carlisle,We had chances. We created a lot of open looks. We just couldn't take advantage of it.
Rick Carlisle,it gives him a quickness advantage.
Rick Carlisle,"There's no way to replace his energy, his athleticism and his playmaking ability at that position. We miss him defensively. We're lucky he doesn't have to have surgery, and if we're lucky, maybe we will be able to get him back next week sometime."
Rick Carlisle,"He's not Reggie Miller from the 3-point line, but he's not far from it in terms of his ability to get the ball in the basket, ... For me, Jack is an NBA shooter. He is an NBA-caliber shooter, which means he's going to shoot in the high 30s (percent) from 3."
Rick Carlisle,The thing that drew us to him is . . . he has the ability to enhance the abilities of the players around him. His teams have a way of jelling.
Rick Carlisle,"He's going to be in the picture, for a lot of reasons. His defensive ability is very important to us. He's a young guy who's experiencing a lot right now and that bodes well for this year and the future."
Rick Carlisle,We watched tape of them and we talked about their quickness and ability to get in the passing lanes. Until you get out there it's hard to fathom how effective they are. They are a pesky team and they're going to be one of those teams that will always be hard to play.
Roberto Carlos,"For the players it would be better if he didn't speak so strongly. I earn what I am worth. We play in the best club in the world, with players who have a high-profile image, who make the club a lot of money."
Roberto Carlos,The mentality and grandeur that this club (Real Madrid) has is different to the rest.
Roberto Carlos,"Porto are one of the best sides in Europe, they're playing at home and will be going all out to beat us,"
Roberto Carlos,the team of my heart.

Randy Carlyle,"We're doing something other than going out on the ice. We just felt that with our travel schedule and the games that it was getting monotonous, redundant. What we're trying to do is just bring everybody down, regroup and focus. The mental preparation is as big as the physical preparation when you're stepping into this Game 7 scenario."
Randy Carlyle,"He's a skilled player; as with any skilled player, if you give him time and space, he's going to make plays."

Randy Carlyle,"Our players deserve the credit. They took the responsibility. We got down 3-1, we battled back. We found a way."
Randy Carlyle,We took some inopportune penalties at critical points. We gave them too many opportunities and too many quality chances.
Randy Carlyle,The penalty parade took us out of the game. We can't continue to give a team the quality of Dallas that many power plays. They made us pay for it. ... We took too many. They got momentum from it.
Randy Carlyle,You can't give anybody five-on-threes like we did in the second period. We got ourselves into penalty problems and it turned the whole momentum in their favor.
Randy Carlyle,Our work ethic was there. We got the opportunity on the power play and took advantage of them.

Thomas Carlyle,"When we can drain the Ocean into mill-ponds, and bottle up the Force of Gravity, to be sold by retail, in gas jars; then may we hope to comprehend the infinitudes of man's soul under formulas of Profit and Loss; and rule over this too, as over a patent engine, by checks, and valves, and balances."

Thomas Carlyle,Only the person of worth can recognize the worth in others.
Thomas Carlyle,Go as far as you can see; when you get there you'll be able to see farther.

Andrew Carnegie,No person will make a great business who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit.
Andrew Carnegie,"The day is not far distant when the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth, which was free for him to administer during life, will pass away ''unwept, unhonored, and unsung,'' no matter to what uses he leave the dross which he cannot take with him. Of such as these the public verdict will then be: ''The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.'' Such, in my opinion, is the true gospel concerning wealth, obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of the rich and the poor."
Andrew Carnegie,"This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of wealth: First, to set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and, after doing so, to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community --the man of wealth thus becoming the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience and ability to administer, doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves."

Andrew Carnegie,"The 'morality of compromise' sounds contradictory. Compromise is usually a sign of weakness, or an admission of defeat. Strong men don't compromise, it is said, and principles should never be compromised."
Andrew Carnegie,"The price which society pays for the law of competition, like the price it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries, is great; but the advantages of this law are also greater still than its cost -- for it is to this law that we owe our wonderful material development, which brings improved conditions in its train. But, whether the law be benign or not, we must say of it: It is here; we cannot evade it; no substitutes for it have been found; and while the law may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for the race, because it ensures the survival of the fittest in every department."

Andrew Carnegie,"Here is the prime condition of success: Concentrate your energy, thought and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged.

Andrew Carnegie,You cannot push anyone up the ladder unless he is willing to climb.
Andrew Carnegie,"Think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success. A whole, clear, glorious life lies before you. Achieve! Achieve!"
Andrew Carnegie,"The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity, and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%."
Andrew Carnegie,No amount of ability is of the slightest avail without honor.
Andrew Carnegie,The man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.
Andrew Carnegie,Immense power is acquired by assuring yourself in your secret reveries that you were born to control affairs.

Dale Carnegie,"Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy."

Dale Carnegie,"You have it easily in your power to increase the sum total of this world's happiness now. How? By giving a few words of sincere appreciation to someone who is lonely or discouraged. Perhaps you will forget tomorrow the kind words you say today, but the recipient may cherish them over a lifetime."
Dale Carnegie,Take a chance! All life is a chance. The man who goes the furthest is generally the one who is willing to do and dare. The “sure thing” boat never gets far from shore.
Dale Carnegie,"Are you bored with life? Then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart, live for it, die for it, and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours"
Dale Carnegie,One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon-instead of enjoying the roses blooming outside our windows today.
Dale Carnegie,"The rare individual who honestly satisfies this heart-hunger (praise) will hold people in the palm of his hand, and even the undertaker will be sorry when he dies"
Dale Carnegie,"Many people think that if they were only in some other place, or had some other job, they would be happy. Well, that is doubtful. So get as much happiness out of what you are doing as you can and don't put off being happy until some future date."
Dale Carnegie,Really important goals are accomplished by people who will keep trying even when there seems to be no hope.
Dale Carnegie,"People say I'm cocky, but am I supposed to sit here and be insecure and not know where my future's going or not realize that moviemaking is the greatest thing to happen to me?"
Dale Carnegie,"If you want to win friends, make it a point to remember them. If you remember my name, you pay me a subtle compliment; you indicate that I have made an impression on you. Remember my name and you add to my feeling of importance."

Dale Carnegie,"If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy."
Dale Carnegie,"Happiness doesn't depend on any external conditions, it is governed by our mental attitude."

Rodney Carney,Talent prevails in those situations. We're more physical and we're more talented and that's when we can use it to our advantage.
Rodney Carney,"He's a great defender, yeah, but I missed almost every shot I took."
Rodney Carney,"Both of us, you know, we came from a long way throughout the season. Now we're both great teams."
Rodney Carney,I like the open court and I like to drive to the hole and dunk on people. This style of play really helps me do that.
Rodney Carney,"We love each other. We're looking forward to playing with each other. The chemistry is great, and it's better than it's ever been."
Rodney Carney,"We've never been like this. The guys, we're all happy with each other, and we love being around each other, to come to practice. I couldn't say that about us a couple of years ago."
Rodney Carney,"It's kind of hectic. You really have to slow down and look for your teammates. You can't be out of control out there. If you are out of control, they are going to strip the ball from you, steal it and take charges."
Rodney Carney,"If we can win this, we'll be remembered forever. We can give people joy they'll have for the rest of their lives."
Rodney Carney,"It's real hurtful right now. I'm going back home anyway, but not in the Final Four, not in the way I wanted to go."
Rodney Carney,"No one really looked at me. I took it to heart. I worked hard in the gym. I came to Memphis, and I progressed. It's a great feeling looking back and saying, 'You all didn't want me. But now I'm in Memphis, and we're doing good."
Rodney Carney,The chemistry is here. I hope we continue this because it's been a really fun season.
Rodney Carney,The transition from last year has been a real fun time. We hope we can continue this season.
Rodney Carney,"At this point in the year, I'm really in a groove. I'm coming out playing great defense and knocking down easy shots. We're so talented and so deep that we don't know if that's the best we can play. We might have just scratched the surface."
Rodney Carney,"That's what we've been concentrating on throughout our other victories: defense. Once we got the defense clicking, the lead just extended."
Rodney Carney,"This is a dream senior year for any college player. I thought about the NBA, but I wanted to win and I wanted to improve on where I left off as a junior."
Rodney Carney,"We can't look at it that way. To play those teams, we first have to take care of business in Dallas."
Adam Carolla,"The God's honest truth is that I'm probably funnier, but he's smarter. Here's the thing about Stern -- he's really a smart guy. He's nutty. He's outrageous. He's all those things, but he's also a very smart guy."
Adam Carolla,"When you do television, there's more to do, and when you do new television, there's a lot more to do, especially when you don't have partner. I miss not having that person,"
Adam Carolla,"There's no math equation that equals ratings or demographics or even (takes into consideration) 'The Man Show.' What the (expletive deleted) is 'The Man Show' audience? You either go up there and connect or you go up there and you don't connect,"

Adam Carolla,"I'm really just trying to hash out the next two weeks of my life, ... So, something that is potentially four months down the road is not just a mile down the road for me, it's a million miles down the road."
Adam Carolla,He has a great sense of humor -- but it's in his assembly. It's really his craftsmanship that people overlook. It's not being fair to him just calling him outrageous.
Adam Carolla,"right now, I hope it's later rather than sooner."
Adam Carolla,"Everyone keeps saying, 'Oh my God, oh my God, how intimidating.' It's like saying, 'How could you date Jennifer Aniston after she's been with Brad Pitt ?' I don't care."
Chris Carpenter,I was just lobbing it to the point Mel was catching it with his bare hands. I was just lobbing it to feel it come off my hand and feel the spin it was supposed to have.
Chris Carpenter,"I felt relaxed, ... I felt confident. When I was in trouble, I wasn't concerned about it. I was really focused on what I needed to do and I did it all night long."
Chris Carpenter,"Obviously, it's a big number, ... But I've got five (starts) left, I think, the rest of the season. I'll start getting prepared for New York on Wednesday."
Chris Carpenter,"They are a lot like our club. They take quality at-bats. They are patient and they have an idea about what they are doing and the pitcher they are facing. They've got speed. They've got some guys who can hit the ball out of the park. They have got quality guys from top to bottom, and you've definitely got to be on your game and make quality pitches to get these guys out."
Chris Carpenter,"I located my fastball good, and my breaking ball was good. I made some quality pitches and kept the ball down. The fun thing about early on is getting the feel back and competing."
Chris Carpenter,"The consistency I've had, I think, is the most important thing. When I'm pitching, I feel our team is going to have an opportunity to win the game. I like that the best of everything I've accomplished this year."
Chris Carpenter,"Shows consistency. But that's what my goal is: trying to be consistent as often as I can. I've said this (before): If you go out and be consistent and give this team a chance to win with the defense, offense and bullpen we have, we're going to win a lot of games."
Chris Carpenter,"[One of Carpenter's hardest pitches started with the softest of tosses. With the pitching coach who taught him the cutter, Mel Queen, Carpenter would stand about 15 to 20 feet away and fling the new pitch.] I was just lobbing it to the point Mel was catching it with his bare hands, ... I was just lobbing it to feel it come off my hand and feel the spin it was supposed to have."
Chris Carpenter,"I can't believe I won, ... My son did a little dance for me and my wife gave me a big hug. We were really excited about it."
John Carpenter,"To make Michael Myers frightening, I had him walk like a man, not a monster."
John Carpenter,One could make money and get a career going with a low-budget horror film about killers attacking on holidays. It is always flattering to have somebody copy you.
John Carpenter,"I made a decision back in 1978 that, in a trade off for money when I directed Halloween, I would have my name above the title in order to basically brand these movies my own."
John Carpenter,What scares me is what scares you. We're all afraid of the same things. That's why horror is such a powerful genre. All you have to do is ask yourself what frightens you and you'll know what frightens me.
John Carpenter,Evil hiding among us is an ancient theme.
John Carpenter,"It's a very good time for horror. This business certainly has changed, but there's still room for serious horror films. Look at 28 Days Later, that's not a tongue-in-cheek picture."
John Carpenter,"In England, I'm a horror movie director. In Germany, I'm a filmmaker. In the US, I'm a bum."
John Carpenter,"In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers. Laurie, Jamie Lee's character, was shy and somewhat repressed. And Michael Myers, the killer, is definitely repressed. They have certain similarities."
Liz Carpenter,"I have worked all my life, wanted to work all my life, needed to work all my life."
Liz Carpenter,"Instead of looking at life as a narrowing funnel, we can see it ever widening to choose the things we want to do, to take the wisdom we've learned and create something."

Scott Carpenter,"The Black Swamp, it was an awful place. It was a thick woods full of disease and mosquitoes, and people making their way through here reported being able to travel maybe only a mile a day."
Scott Carpenter,"At this point in the countdown, it seems appropriate to say to the crew of Discovery -- good luck, have a safe flight and to say once again 'Godspeed John Glenn,'"
Scott Carpenter,"We've had to line up different methodologies for different habits, ... Consumers want the ability to get their mortgages in different ways. They go online and apply, or they would like to pick up the phone... Other times, they want to walk into one of our offices, sit down with somebody, and do it face to face."
David Carr,The one thing that hasn't changed is our care for youth.
David Carr,We're more likely to be understanding than to be judgmental.
David Carr,"It starts with running the ball, but No. 1A is getting Andre involved in the game, ... He can turn a five-yard route into a 30- or 40-yard play."
David Carr,"He is a quality guy. If he hasn't taken a step forward, it's because he hasn't been shown the way."
David Carr,Chris has been saying that we can't be too passive and worry about making mistakes. We have to go after them.
David Carr,"I know (Pendry) has some great ideas as far as offensive scheme goes, ... I think he's going to do what's in the players' best interests. I think that's the most important thing that he does for his offensive linemen, he tries to do what they do well. I think that's what we need around here, someone like coach Pendry who's going to do what we do well. I'm kind of excited about that."
David Carr,"We can compete for something more than just respect and pride. We realize there are some obtainable goals, and we want to go out and get them."
David Carr,"The expectation level should be higher, ... I expect to be better. We expect to be better."
David Carr,"He looks like, in terms of athleticism, he's definitely got the ability. He just has to keep his head on and keep focused on the fact that he hasn't forgotten to play football overnight."
John Carr,"When you make a mistake, just smile and go on. Don't be afraid."
John Carr,"All coaches want to be competitive. But in the case of the hurricane, I believe rules were bent and abused."
John Carr,"The last thing the rest of the players on offense need to see is a QB who is frustrated out there, ... It's important for him to keep his composure. Josh is doing that. He's growing and maturing and understanding what he's supposed to do out there."
John Carr,We want to ensure everything possible is done to protect our responsibility to oversee the National Airspace System.
John Carr,You could have problems you didn't think you would have.
John Carr,"tell the mobile phone companies, try and get your number changed and tell the police."
John Carr,"Hopefully, with everyone at the game and with past experiences, we'll raise more than $1,000."
John Carr,The administration is going to attempt to exploit a loophole in the law to avoid collective bargaining. We intend to close that loophole.
John Carr,"I'd like for our controllers to feel much more secure doing their jobs, ... They should be watching their radar scopes, not watching their backs."
John Carr,"I'm proud of our guys for fighting through it. Last year, many times this may have gone the other way. We're trying to turn that around and work on finishing off the game."
John Carr,"Those 20 points, we (the offense) really put the defense in that situation. I was really pleased with the defense. Our coaches had a great gameplan, and the guys played hard."
John Carr,We clearly recognize the danger.
John Carr,We don't want it to go to Congress.
Lloyd Carr,"He's bigger and stronger, and he knows what he's doing. He's matured. That's always the key."
Lloyd Carr,"I don't worry about him bouncing back, ... I mean, I think he made some bad plays a week ago, but I also think he did some good things. What I hear is that it's like he lost the game. Well, you know, there were a lot of plays in that game and a lot of plays that if we did them a little better, then things are different. It's a combination of a lot of things. It wasn't just the quarterback."
Lloyd Carr,I think he's a guy that can make you miss. He's a guy that has great vision. He's one of those guys that can hurt you in a lot of different ways.
Lloyd Carr,He's got great toughness. He's got great vision. And he's got great size.
Lloyd Carr,"When you look at what he did in the fourth quarter, there was not a lot of space in that defense on the last drive."
Lloyd Carr,It was obvious that was a violation of the rules.
Lloyd Carr,"He's been impressive, and he's going to lend at least quality depth to the (center) position."
Lloyd Carr,"Being a quarterback is a process. And I think he made a lot of progress. I think he made some very good throws out there today, then he had some very poor plays that he'd like to have back."
Lloyd Carr,Jake Long got rolled up in practice and will miss a significant amount of time.
Lloyd Carr,Thirty-seven points should have been enough to win. There are no excuses.
Lloyd Carr,"I've interviewed every player on our team, and that's always part of the conversation. There's a lot of things that certainly should be motivating. I don't think there's anybody in this program that wants to go through that kind of season again. I think they'll do everything that they're asked to do to make sure that it doesn't happen again."
Lloyd Carr,"We thought if we get control of the game, Ohio State would have trouble playing from behind, but they played very well from behind. Nobody ever would have thought they would throw for that kind of yardage, but they changed the tempo of the game, they made it very hard for us to pressure the quarterback."
Lloyd Carr,The finest athlete I've ever seen on the field as a quarterback.
Lloyd Carr,"It's a matter of quickness, that's what this game has evolved to - quickness and toughness and ability to sustain an effort over 60 minutes and over four months. Any time you have too much weight, it has a fatigue effect on you, in an individual game and in the season."
Lloyd Carr,Will Paul has really (made) strides. He's got the ability to play there and has picked things up very quick.
Jim Carrey,"New management came in and they cleaned everybody out  so we hit the skids. We lived in a van, so I kind of know what happens to people when this happens."
Jim Carrey,If I'm not back in five minutes... just wait longer!
Jim Carrey,"I enjoy his music, but he scares me, ... His lyrics are totally socially irresponsible. But I think if we just spend more time with our kids, we'll be OK."
Jim Carrey,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
Jim Carrey,"New management came in and they cleaned everybody out â€” so we hit the skids. We lived in a van, so I kind of know what happens to people when this happens."
Jim Carrey,"Green Eggs and Ham was the story of my life. I wouldn't eat a thing when I was a kid, but Dr. Suess inspired me to try cauliflower."
Jim Carrey,"The money can be a hindrance to someone like me because the danger is that you start thinking, 'Is that a $20 million take?' That kind of thing, and being self-critical."
Jim Carrey,"I wake up some mornings and sit and have my coffee and look out at my beautiful garden, and I go, 'Remember how good this is. Because you can lose it.'"
Jim Carrey,"I'm the first to admit this whole salary thing is getting out of control. In the final analysis, it's still about the work."
Jim Carrey,"If you've got a talent, protect it."
Jim Carrey,Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.
Rodney Carrington,"I didn't plan on being a comedian. I didn't plan on getting married and I didn't plan on having kids, but I did all those things."
Rodney Carrington,"I thought comedy would be the hardest thing I could do, and if I could do that, I could do anything."
Rodney Carrington,"You can talk about anything if you go about it the right way, which is never malicious."
Rodney Carrington,I can drink on the job if I want to. I can go on stage with a beer and it's OK. I can say whatever I want. It's a great job to have.
David Carroll,Different problems require different solutions.
David Carroll,It's the last outstanding parcel at the gateway. It's about 150 acres of fine agricultural land just minutes off the Interstate.
David Carroll,"Oh, it comes up every year: the big caution speech. It's a high school rite of passage that can also incorporate other rites of passage you have to caution kids about."
Jack Carroll,"I was gladly cuffed, shackled, loaded into the caged bus and driven through the main gate of Bare Hill Correctional Facility for what I pray to God will be forever."
Jack Carroll,"Perhaps the greatest utopia would be if we could all realize that no utopia is possible; no place to run, no place to hide, just take care of business here and now."
Jack Carroll,The SEAA affords customers the ability to get transferred instantly when calling in. They know as soon as the system picks up they can say a name or department and get connected.
James Carroll,"It has continued to drop in the Department of Interior budget, particularly fish and wild life."
James Carroll,The indictment of the vice president's chief of staff for perjury and obstruction of justice is an occasion to consider just how damaging the long public career of Richard Cheney has been to the United States.
James Carroll,"The Carroll Family and Black Bros. Co. are very pleased to have been able to purchase this machine for the Industrial Arts Department. This American made machine tool will enhance the schoolâ€™s ability to teach students modern machining technologies, which are of vital importance to the U.S. manufacturing sector. Black Bros. and other local manufacturing companies will benefit from the skills learned by the students at MHS on this new machining center as they employ these students in the future."
James Carroll,We spend most of our time and energy in a kind of horizontal thinking. We move along the surface of things... but there are times when we stop. We sit sill. We lose ourselves in a pile of leaves or its memory. We listen and breezes from a whole other world begin to whisper.
James Carroll,I found myself back to the Pentagon...as a protester?and my dad was still inside.
Jim Carroll,Where she fell was in between the cross members that support the fabric. She landed in the middle and it cradled her. She hit it exactly right. A couple feet either way and ...
Jim Carroll,She had been taught to fear them.
Jim Carroll,"I want to speak directly to the kidnappers of my daughter Jill, who could be fathers like me."
Jim Carroll,"No one knows for sure what direction this is all going in, but they all know it's going somewhere that's definitely lucrative. The big networks are scrambling in their own ways to get it all together to make it work and avoid getting left behind. For the moment it's an unknown."
Jim Carroll,"It was a fantastic conversation, obviously. We're feeling ecstatic. It?s been a long haul and we're done with that now."
Jim Carroll,"I guess my message to you is that advertising works, in this case by happenstance."
Jim Carroll,My daughter does not have the ability to free anyone. She is a reporter and an innocent person.
Joe Carroll,"He told me that he had been released, that he was perfectly OK and in an Iraqi government compound having a beer."
Joe Carroll,"Companies that give a million to (the high-profile) campaign don't add to what their normal giving is, ... They cut back (with) local charities. It's been four years in a row now. I joke that God's punishing me."
Joe Carroll,"My fear was that I would be sold on to the Sunni or Islamist groups,"
Joe Carroll,I am utterly delighted for Rory Carroll and his family.
Joe Carroll,"But we kind of knew, given the set-up there, that there must be danger for all journalists working there."
Lewis Carroll,"You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak  For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak - Pray, how did you manage to do it?  In my youth, said his father, I took to the law, And argued e"

Lewis Carroll,I can't go back to yesterday - because I was a different person then.
Lewis Carroll,His answer trickled through my head like water through a sieve.
Lewis Carroll,"Contrariwise, if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."
Lewis Carroll,"But I was thinking of a way To multiply by ten, And always, in the answer, get The question back again."

Lewis Carroll,"There is no use trying, said Alice; one can't believe impossible things. I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."

Pete Carroll,We had hoped to discourage them in the running game.
Pete Carroll,"We've done this before. All through this process, it felt like three years ago, when Carson left and our running backs took off."
Pete Carroll,He has real serious back spasms. He's gonna rest a few days and see how he responds. They don't know if he will be back in a few days or a week.
Pete Carroll,I'm not going to make any excuses for any part of this. I'm going to continue to take responsibility for that. I'm not going to point the finger at somebody else. I'm the one who has to continue to get this done.
Pete Carroll,"We will have to wait and see when he gets to practice today. There is no damage at all to his knee, it is sore from getting banged on it, but he is going to practice today. We will ease him through the week until he is feeling 100%. He might feel 100% today. He is real encouraged, and I am not really concerned about it."
Pete Carroll,We didn't hit the ball cleanly. The ball wasn't as deep as in practice.
Pete Carroll,"When he returns he'll have had the most practice time with us (of any healthy running back). We do have a good feeling for what we can do; we're really excited about his ability to help this football team. He's doing really well, and there's a chance he could (play) now."
Pete Carroll,"But if you look at the difference between the past couple years and this year, we've kind of gone off the charts in all numbers."
Pete Carroll,We're always worried that the parents are going to be shocked.
Pete Carroll,That only makes sense to me. (Booty) feels terrific - he has no pain at all. To see John David feeling so good gives us the feeling he's going to jump out of this rehab. He wants to throw right now - he feels like he can throw right now.
Pete Carroll,"This two-week opportunity for them really makes them dangerous,"
Pete Carroll,"This was a different opportunity, ... But when I walked in here I felt I was ready. I had been in two difficult situations (in the NFL)... I had been through the wars. USC was an awesome opportunity."
Pete Carroll,"This was a night for championships. Texas did a great job, wonderful job, all night. We had to keep scoring all night to outscore them. They were great champions tonight. If you have to step aside for somebody tonight, they're the team to do that for."
Pete Carroll,It really felt this way when we talked as a team last night that this could happen in a big way. It was like we could have kept playing all night and had all that fun.
Pete Carroll,"Without question, that was a phenomenal night by one guy. That's an extraordinary player."
Pete Carroll,That quarterback just ran all over the place. He made the difference. This is their night. Hats off to 'em.
Pete Carroll,"Well, we couldn't stop them when we had to. The quarterback ran all over the place. This is their night. It's wonderful doing what we've been doing. We didn't get it done."
Pete Carroll,This was a night of champions. Two teams went out and battled to the final seconds and Texas did a great job.
Pete Carroll,It was a championship night in all ways. These two teams battled until the finish.
Pete Carroll,"I would think that Texas has a tremendous amount of motivation building into this game, just as we do, and they don't need any more than that. If that helps them, then it's OK. I can't do anything about it."
Pete Carroll,That's the thing. We can't learn from our mistakes in something like this. We can't afford to make a mistake. That's why it's so tough to do.
Pete Carroll,Why stop a game if you're going to make mistakes fixing mistakes?
Pete Carroll,"As long as we understand that, we'll maximize these opportunities to make it a cherished memory in our fortunate lives. It's a big deal, man. It's a real big deal. But it's the game that makes it so special. The fact that you remember it's a game makes it so special."
Pete Carroll,We're just learning about this.
Pete Carroll,"I'm confident that's not where this is going. The information that I have thus far, I don't think that's going to happen at all."
Pete Carroll,"Is it human nature that we're going to be complacent? I don't see that in any way, ... As a staff, we've worked harder and longer and recruited more than ever before. Probably the opposite of what you think has happened  we're more driven then ever."
Pete Carroll,"Matt can hang in those (Hollywood) settings, but he doesn't thrive or dwell on that. It's just because he's in L.A. He's a local kid that's done great. He decided to stay in school and became famous because of that, as well as the other stuff."
Pete Carroll,These are two historic offenses. You just don't see numbers like this except in video games.
Pete Carroll,"We tell recruits we're going to a nice, quiet, homey place. We're going to talk about your future and stuff like that. The next thing they know, John's unbuttoning his shirt and dancing in front of everybody."
Pete Carroll,Our team is well-prepared for his leaving. It'll be fun to see who steps up.
Pete Carroll,It's just fun. And it's supposed to be fun.
Pete Carroll,"We took a shot at a couple guys, we didn't hit it. We'll force our issues next year."
Pete Carroll,That was our moment. I was trying to win the football game. We came within one fourth down of doing it. Missed it by that much.
Pete Carroll,"Gosh, we finished so strong. We just pounded the football in the second half."
Pete Carroll,"You make the first down, you win the football game."
Pete Carroll,He was obviously the difference in the football game. He's really off the charts.
Pete Carroll,He's an extraordinary football player.
Pete Carroll,They move the football better than ever. Sam Keller has just taken over and done a fantastic job.
Pete Carroll,"This is a fantastic and improved football team; the impact of the head coach is obvious,"
Pete Carroll,"This is not the same football team, this is not the same offense, ... The players are the same, but they are performing at a higher level because of the guy who is running the thing."
Pete Carroll,"If you make that first down, you're squatting on the football to win the game. We just missed it. By what -- two inches?"
Pete Carroll,We just could not stop him. Vince Young is just an extraordinary football player.
Pete Carroll,"They have played really good football, and they have tons of highlights and good things to show, ... But they have been unable to get their win in the Pac-10. That just screams about the Pac-10 offenses. They bring in a terrific running back, a terrific receiver."
Pete Carroll,"They have really put it together in great fashion and we owe a tremendous amount to that which they have done and what they have accomplished to set things in motion. It's a remarkable number of wins for any group ever. I can't wait to see them all graduate, finish up and get out of here."
Pete Carroll,They know that they're worked in a fashion that makes them prepare well and perform well. They're into it. They do anything we ask them to do. They deserve to have a great time doing it everyday.
Pete Carroll,"It?s kids, it?s family, it?s football . . . it?s just fun."
Pete Carroll,It's in keeping with the family aspect of our program. You just don't do it when it's convenient. Family is always family.
Pete Carroll,"When you first look at their team, you can't see anything but him. He's a fantastic player. Your eyes are drawn to him."
Pete Carroll,"We didn't have a very big crowd, and there wasn't much enthusiasm about our opener. But we got off to a good start, and we got a win, but we had to savor it because we didn't get another one for a long time."
Pete Carroll,"That was so much fun. That was so exciting. It was very dramatic. For an energy junkie like myself, it can't get any better. It was a wonderful day for college football. Something I'll never forget."
Pete Carroll,It went really well. The doctors made a point that it was something that they had to do.
Pete Carroll,"(The doctors) know the results of the MRI. There's definitely something there (on the MRI), that's why we're being very cautious and taking our time. They need to see how it responds and see how soon he can come back and if he does or he doesn't (need surgery)."
Pete Carroll,"I have not changed one bit since I've been here. There is a way to have great discipline, and have great intensity and have people compete on a level that is hard to match and enjoy every minute of it."
Pete Carroll,will be so explosive that the defense will have to spend a lot of time on the field.
Pete Carroll,"(UA) played really hard, and they had a very good defense, ... Their scheme is very solid. They know how to mix their looks and their pressures. They came after us and were really effective. We respect the heck out of what they are doing and what they are capable of doing."
Pete Carroll,"I've got so much control and call every shot. I haven't changed my outlook on that at all. You know, to do something like I like to do it, you've got to do it over a long period of time. That's why this is a cherished moment for me in my coaching career. I'm right in the middle of something really special, and I can see it, it's very clear."
Pete Carroll,One of the keys to finding consistency is not being knocked any which way by the hype and the buildup. We've found a way of dealing with that and ... taking our best preparation into the big game.
Pete Carroll,"Every coach talks about turnovers, but it's how deeply you emphasize it is where you get consistency. Our guys are riddled with the thought of having to go get the ball at all times in everything that we're doing. It's the number one emphasis in the program for us."
Pete Carroll,A lot of players will be battling for playing time in the secondary and the competition will continue into the fall.
Pete Carroll,"Absolutely, heck yeah. We're counting on that competition."
Pete Carroll,What Coach Wooden did was so special.
Pete Carroll,This is the kind of class where you're going to feel the impact immediately.
Pete Carroll,This is the kind of class that you're going to feel the impact immediately from these guys. You're going to feel it at the running back spot. You're going to feel it at the (defensive back) spot. You're going to see young guys involved from the beginning.
Pete Carroll,"We didn't expect it to be this easy, but the game went our way from the beginning. I was a little surprised."
Pete Carroll,"I think it's a tremendous accomplishment. I made it clear to the guys after the fact,"
Pete Carroll,"Possibly the thing he has that is most unique is his ability to make unbelievable cuts at top speed, that he doesn't have to gather to do those things."
Sean Carroll,"There are many, many cases where DNA has told us about species' relationships that we never would have guessed based on appearances or other characteristics. We need this tree to understand the great story of animal evolution."
Sean Carroll,"I'm saying, 'Police, show me your hands, show me your hands,'"
Sean Carroll,"It is hard to distinguish these events, even with boatloads of data. As you go into deep time, origins are much harder to pick out. And given that there is so much data, you have to ask: why aren't you getting any resolution?"
Sean Carroll,"It turns out that early in the origin of many types of animals, there were a lot of branching events in a short period of time."
Mary Carskadon,"It's a double whammy. They're not getting enough sleep to recharge their brains, and we're asking their brains to be on duty at the wrong time."
Mary Carskadon,We've found another part of the story - the mechanism in the brain that builds up sleep pressure is working at a different rate in adolescents than in pre-pubescent children.
Mary Carskadon,"Teen-agers don't need less sleep the older they get. They still need as much sleep as they did when they were pre-teens, ... We, as a society, are asking them to sleep at the wrong time."
Mary Carskadon,The 'why' questions are the hardest ones to answer in science.
Mary Carskadon,Kids are too sleepy to learn well. They're too sleepy to be happy. And they're at great risk for such things as traffic accidents.
Mary Carskadon,"This can put their circadian rhythm, or biological clock, in conflict with the school bell, ... The result illustrates a critical trend: too many teens come to school too sleepy to learn. And their fatigue often leads to behavior problems that contribute to a negative overall school performance and experience."
Mary Carskadon,"When children are little, their sleep pressure rises faster so they fall asleep early, but when it's slower, like it is for teenagers, it's harder to get to sleep."
David Carson,You'll see everything from gold teeth to hood ornaments. It's almost like Halloween during August.
David Carson,"All of a sudden, you had a culture, ... It was THE lifestyle. Kids believed, 'We might not have had all the amenities of other cities, but man, we have the best music.'"
David Carson,"[With six million unique viewers each month, Heavy.com encourages its audience to leave the reruns on the cutting room floor and experience its politically incorrect line up of] Must Stream TV. ...

David Carson,"Must See TV' is a snore. 'Must Stream TV' is where the action is&mdash;where Adult Swim meets the X Box. Nowhere but Heavy.com will you find a full new season of fall original programming&mdash;humorous, outrageous programming that TV can't do.

Johnny Carson,I know you've been married to the same woman for 69 years. That is marvelous. It must be very inexpensive.

Rachel Carson,The human race is challenged more than ever before to demonstrate our mastery - not over nature but of ourselves
Rachel Carson,"The ''control of nature'' is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and the convenience of man."
Rachel Carson,Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one species -- man -- acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world.
Rachel Carson,"If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder without any such gift from the fairies, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement, and mystery of the world we live in."
Rachel Carson,"One way to open your eyes is to ask yourself, 'What if I had never seen this before? What if I knew I would never see it again?'"
Rachel Carson,"If facts are the seeds that later produce knowledge and wisdom, then the emotions and the impressions of the senses are the fertile soil in which the seeds must grow."
Rachel Carson,The discipline of the writer is to learn to be still and listen to what his subject has to tell him
Rachel Carson,"Millions of stars blazed in darkness, and on the far shore a few lights burned in cottages. Otherwise there was no reminder of human life."
Rachel Carson,"We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road -- the one less traveled by -- offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth."
Rachel Carson,"If a child is to keep his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in."

Angela Carter,"Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us."
Angela Carter,"I was sitting in the looping studio late one night, and I had this epiphany that they weren't paying me for my acting, for God's sake, but to own me. And from then on, it became clear and an awful lot easier to deal with."
Angela Carter,"If Miss means respectably unmarried, and Mrs. respectably married, then Ms. means nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
Angela Carter,"There's a theory, one I find persuasive, that the quest for knowledge is, at bottom, the search for the answer to the question: ''Where was I before I was born'.' In the beginning was what? Perhaps, in the beginning, there was a curious room, a room like this one, crammed with wonders; and now the room and all it contains are forbidden you, although it was made just for you, had been prepared for you since time began, and you will spend all your life trying to remember it."

Angela Carter,"To pin your hopes upon the future is to consign those hopes to a hypothesis, which is to say, a nothingness. Here and now is what we must contend with."
Angela Carter,I think it's one of the scars in our culture that we have too high an opinion of ourselves. We align ourselves with the angels instead of the higher primates.
Angela Carter,A day without an argument is like an egg without salt.
Angela Carter,What a joy it is to dance and sing!
Angela Carter,"That is what I'm looking forward to the most, practical learning. I want to be a registered nurse so getting to talk to people who already work in those jobs can really teach me what to expect when I get out in the real world."
Angela Carter,Hollywood... was the place where the United States perpetrated itself as a universal dream and put the dream into mass production.
Angela Carter,The notion of a universality of human experience is a confidence trick and the notion of a universality of female experience is a clever confidence trick.
Angela Carter,"In the mythic schema of all relations between men and women, man proposes, and woman is disposed of."
Angela Carter,It is far easier for a woman to lead a blameless life than it is for a man; all she has to do is to avoid sexual intercourse like the plague.
Angela Carter,"Reading a book is like re-writing it for yourself. You bring to a novel, anything you read, all your experience of the world. You bring your history and you read it in your own terms."
Angela Carter,There are lots of things that you can brush under the carpet about yourself until you're faced with somebody whose needs won't be put off.
Angela Carter,"Mother goddesses are just as silly a notion as father gods. If a revival of the myths of these cults gives woman emotional satisfaction, it does so at the price of obscuring the real conditions of life. This is why they were invented in the first place."
Angela Carter,"Nostalgia, the vice of the aged. We watch so many old movies our memories come in monochrome."
Angela Carter,"It's every woman's tragedy, that, after a certain age, she looks like a female impersonator. Mind you, we've known some lovely female impersonators, in our time."

Angela Carter,"Language is power, life and the instrument of culture, the instrument of domination and liberation"
Angela Carter,Comedy is tragedy that happens to other people.
Angela Carter,I think the adjective ''post-modernist'' really means ''mannerist.'' Books about books is fun but frivolous.

Angela Carter,The bed is now as public as the dinner table and governed by the same rules of formal confrontation.

Angela Carter,"Iconic clothing has been secularized. A guardsman in a dress uniform is ostensibly an icon of aggression; his coat is red as the blood he hopes to shed. Seen on a coat-hanger, with no man inside it, the uniform loses all its blustering significance and, to the innocent eye seduced by decorative color and tactile braid, it is as abstract in symbolic information as a parasol to an Eskimo. It becomes simply magnificent."
Angela Carter,"Aeneas carried his aged father on his back from the ruins of Troy and so do we all, whether we like it or not, perhaps even if we have never known them."
Billy Carter,There is no such thing as a bad beer. It's that some taste better than others.
Billy Carter,"Beer is not a good cocktail-party drink, especially in a home where you don't know where the bathroom is."
Billy Carter,I had this beer brewed just for me. I think its the best I ever tasted. And I've tasted a lot. I think you'll like it too.
Billy Carter,"Yes, sir. I'm a real Southern boy. I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer."
Billy Carter,"Paintings are like a beer, only beer tastes good and it's hard to stop drinking beer."
Bruce Carter,"The wind has really gotten quite strong, so it's been prohibiting some of the air carriers from running on time in and out of O'Hare, so that's been giving us a few problems."
Bruce Carter,By no means would we send people to a disaster shelter that was not ready to accept them.
Bruce Carter,We do get good compliments about the terminal and its cleanliness.
Chris Carter,"Even though he let in six goals, Jacob measured up to the task. He did a great job spotting shots."
Chris Carter,"His point [however] was that David [Duchovny] and Gillian [Anderson] are getting older, so how far back in time can you go? And now quite a number of years have gone by. So whether the cigarette-smoking man can make a believable appearance other than a ghost, I don't know ... [but] I'd love to do it. It'd be great."
Chris Carter,"If we make it steep, it'll get their attention and get their animals under control."
David Carter,"But to get on real solid economic footing, it has to embrace the everyday sports fan. And if the only time the everyday fan gets exposed to hockey is with a scandal, that doesn't help."
David Carter,"I don't think the WNBA is going to disappear from the sports landscape anytime soon. It's likely to keep chugging along. It's never going to be part of the mainstream in pro sports leagues, but it can find its place as long as expectations don't get too high."
David Carter,Is there risk if they don't live up to the hype? Yes. But there's dramatic upside if you can convince someone who is 13 or 14 to start wearing your shoes or get their parents to get them your cell phone because of that endorsement.
David Carter,You can run into an issue where the quality is compromised by the quantity. But the sponsor is not just involved to reach people on site. It's part of a broader marketing strategy. Any potential clutter is offset by greater tactical opportunities.
David Carter,"When the boating safety message comes from your neighbors, fellow boaters or well-respected local organizations, it has much more credibility,"
David Carter,"Their lives were intertwined in need, driven by greed and lust. Nevertheless, the court is convinced of his love for her,"
David Carter,"The traditional Fortune 500 companies have to steer clear (of Bryant). McDonald's, Sprite, they have the pick of the litter of who they can work with, and they don't have to work with athletes. I think he's probably out for good for Fortune 500 guys. They could get an emerging star who lacks the baggage and rap sheet Kobe has."
David Carter,"Fighting for marketing shelf space alongside Jeter and A-Rod may prove problematic if, over time, Damon is merely perceived as just another all-star player added to Steinbrenner's stable."
David Carter,"They're paying to milk the controversy. Will they draw criticism? Absolutely. But for a company like Nike that can afford to take a risk or a smaller company looking to make a splash, it may be worth it."
David Carter,"In order for baseball to succeed in this latest attempt to go global, you need the players and their agents to get behind it. You need players to market the game, not diminish the game's stature."
David Carter,Advertisers are looking to penetrate these markets. We are getting close to saturation [in the U.S.].
Hodding Carter,"There are only two lasting bequests we can hope to give our children. One of these is roots, the other, wings."

Howard Carter,"As the work proceeded we found that the western end of the cutting receded under the slope of the rock, and thus was partly roofed over by the overhanging rock."
Howard Carter,"With such evidence, as well as the sealed doorway between the two guardian statues of the King, the mystery gradually dawned upon us. We were but in the anterior portion of a tomb."
Howard Carter,"We were totally unprepared for such a large quantity of visitors, and in view of the preservation of the antiquities they being very crowded and in poor preservation, we were obliged to refuse admission until some preparation was made to safeguard the objects."
Howard Carter,We were astonished by the beauty and refinement of the art displayed by the objects surpassing all we could have imagined - the impression was overwhelming.
Howard Carter,"Towards sunset we had cleared down to the level of the 12th step, which was sufficient to expose a large part of the upper portion of a plastered and sealed doorway."
Howard Carter,"They were of many types of seals, all bearing the insignia of the King."
Howard Carter,"These ancient huts were soon cleared of the rubbish covering them. I planned them, and removed them for investigation below, which undertaking took until the fourth of Nov."
Howard Carter,"The news of the discovery spread fast all over the country, and inquisitive enquiries mingled with congratulations from this moment became the daily programme."
Howard Carter,"It was a sight surpassing all precedent, and one we never dreamed of seeing."
Howard Carter,"Here before us was sufficient evidence to show that it really was an entrance to a tomb, and by the seals, to all outward appearances that it was intact."
Howard Carter,"Feverishly we cleared away the remaining last scraps of rubbish on the floor of the passage before the doorway, until we had only the clean sealed doorway before us."
Howard Carter,Commenced operations in the Valley of the Kings.
Howard Carter,"After clearing 9 metres of the descending passage, in about the middle of the afternoon, we came upon a second sealed doorway, which was almost the exact replica of the first."
Howard Carter,"All we have to do is to peel the shrines like an onion, and we will be with the king himself."
Howard Carter,It soon became obvious that we were but on the threshold of the discovery.

Jimmy Carter,"We live in a time of transition, an uneasy era which is likely to endure for the rest of this century. During the period we may be tempted to abandon some of the time-honored principles and commitments which have been proven during the difficult times of past generations. We must never yield to this temptation. Our American values are not luxuries, but necessities - not the salt in our bread, but the bread itself."
Jimmy Carter,"There is no other mandate whose implementation could more to profoundly improve international relationships,"
Jimmy Carter,"I still pray for peace...between the Israelis and the Palestinians, between the Israelis and the Jordanians and Lebanese and Syrians, ... I pray that God will have his hand on the shoulders of those who still seek peace."
Jimmy Carter,not a single word of that peace treaty has been violated by either side.
Jimmy Carter,"I still pray for peace in the Middle East, ... the only obstacle to peace."
Jimmy Carter,"Another thing that we share is a need to earn a living after we leave the White House. Rosalyn asked me to announce, by the way, that our books are still on sale."
Jimmy Carter,"We urge the leaders of the new parliament, both ruling party and opposition, to work together to devise new rules and practices to ensure that all voters' interests are represented in parliament,"
Jimmy Carter,"The law is not the private property of lawyers, nor is justice the exclusive province of judges and juries. In the final analysis, true justice is not a matter of courts and law books, but of a commitment in each of us to liberty and mutual respect."
Jimmy Carter,"The Carter Center has been monitoring elections down here for more than 12 years, ... This one was almost perfect."
Jimmy Carter,"In 1988, there was no doubt that the election was shot through with fraud. In 1994, there was tremendous improvement. In 1996, the major parties got together and helped to evolve a new electoral law that made an independent commission to conduct the whole election,"
Jimmy Carter,"Seen from the air, it is very clear that this disaster is worse than the earthquake of 1972, ... I have known other cases of disaster, and I know the worst is yet to come -- cholera and dengue."
Jimmy Carter,"Some states have passed abominable laws that are a disgrace to democracy,"
Jimmy Carter,"We differ, Mr. Castro and I, on the definition of democracy."
Jimmy Carter,"There is extreme interest in voting, total determination for democracy and freedom,"
Jimmy Carter,"There have always been abnormalities in elections including in my own country, the United States. My hope is opposition party members would take their seats in parliament and ensure that voters' interests are represented,"
Jimmy Carter,"A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world,"
Jimmy Carter,"Congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay, ... It will be money well spent. Unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil, these funds will be paid by Americans to Americans."
Jimmy Carter,"In repudiating extremism, we need to recommit ourselves to a few common-sense principles that should transcend partisan differences."
Jimmy Carter,"the essential decency, compassion and common sense of the American people will prevail."

Jimmy Carter,"The existing and long-standing use of the word 'evolution' in our state's textbooks has not adversely affected Georgians' belief in the omnipotence of God as creator of the universe,"

Jimmy Carter,"For this generation, ours, life is nuclear survival, liberty is human rights, the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants."
Jimmy Carter,"I thought then, and I think now, that the invasion of Iraq was unnecessary and unjust. And I think the premises on which it was launched were false."
Jimmy Carter,My decision to register women confirms what is already obvious throughout our society-that women are now providing all types of skills in every profession. The military should be no exception.
Jimmy Carter,"We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams."
Jimmy Carter,"Human rights is the soul of our foreign policy, because human rights is the very soul of our sense of nationhood."
Jimmy Carter,"The experience of democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing, infinite in its variety, sometimes turbulent and all the more valuable for having been tested by adversity."
Jimmy Carter,"If you're totally illiterate and living on one dollar a day, the benefits of globalization never come to you."
Jimmy Carter,We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.
Jimmy Carter,To deal with individual human needs at the everyday level can be noble sometimes.
Jimmy Carter,It's not necessary to fear the prospect of failure but to be determined not to fail.
Jimmy Carter,Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. People have the right to expect that these wants will be provided for by this wisdom.
Jimmy Carter,New Yorkers love it when you spill your guts out there. Spill your guts at Wimbledon and they make you stop and clean it up.
Jimmy Carter,"America did not invent human rights. In a very real sense, it is the other way around. Human rights invented America."
Jimmy Carter,"The personal attacks on the president and the condemnations of America by Hugo Chavez from Venezuela, I think, are completely unjustified and uncalled for, ... Chavez is a difficult person with whom to deal personally. I know from my own experience."
Jimmy Carter,"They enhanced human rights in all nations. At the same time, they transformed our relationships in America, breaking down racial barriers that existed for almost two centuries."
Jimmy Carter,"Unless both sides win, no agreement can be permanent."
Jimmy Carter,"If you fear making anyone mad, then you ultimately probe for the lowest common denominator of human achievement."
Jimmy Carter,"In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: 'We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.'"
Rosalynn Carter,"If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try -- you don't take the risk."
Rosalynn Carter,"If we have not achieved our early dreams, we must either find new ones or see what we can salvage from the old. If we have accomplished what we set out to do in our youth, we need not weep like Alexander the Great that we have no more worlds to conqu"
Rosalynn Carter,There was no way I could understand our defeat. I had to grieve over our loss before I could look to the future. Where could our lives possibly be as meaningful as they might have been in the White House?
Rosalynn Carter,"Informed journalists can have a significant impact on public understanding of mental health issues, as they shape debate and trends with the words and pictures they convey, ... They influence their peers and stimulate discussion among the general public, and an informed public can reduce stigma and discrimination."
Rosalynn Carter,"You must accept that you might fail; then, if you do your best and still don't win, at least you can be satisfied that you've tried. If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try - you don't take the risk."
Rosalynn Carter,"If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try - you don't take the risk."
Rosalynn Carter,"Don't worry about polls, but if you do, don't admit it."
Rosalynn Carter,"Do what you can to show you care about other people, and you will make our world a better place."

Rosalynn Carter,"You have to have confidence in your ability, and then be tough enough to follow through."
Rosalynn Carter,"There is nothing more important than a good, safe, secure home."
Rubin Carter,We wanted to give people a chance to come out and prove that they can come from high school and play at this level.
Rubin Carter,We want to see the things that the players have learned. They should have a good understanding of what we are trying to do by now.
Rubin Carter,"Normally, we like to get a year ahead on recruiting and evaluating talent. But even in the time we had, we were very thorough in looking at each player academically and character wise, along with his athletic abilities."
Rubin Carter,"I think there would be great support for a game here, and I know it would generate a lot of revenue here in Tampa."
Rubin Carter,We still won't be great risk-takers. That is something that I am going to mandate for myself. We have to do a great job of evaluating potential recruits. It's also our role as coaches to motivate and let them know what they need to do to graduate.
Rubin Carter,Koonce brought a little bit of spirit and veracity out there at practice. It was good to have him back out there.
Rubin Carter,We have to stop the madness. That was the first thing I said. It's not just MEAC schools. We've got schools in Alabama and Georgia that have made a feast out of Florida players. There is no reason why those players can't stay here if they chose to do so. That's one of the things we are really trying to emphasize - keeping our kids in the state.
Rubin Carter,It's a little bit difficult because they are in transition right now. They are learning how to do things. They are learning about our work ethic and pace of our practices.
Rubin Carter,But we did have a conversation or two about advantages and disadvantages.
Rubin Carter,He (Chester) showed his ability to scramble and make plays on the run. Those are his assets. He throws the ball well on the run. He made some good decisions out there.
Vince Carter,We consider Miami one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference and we see it as a test each and every time. We felt we could really give them a run.
Vince Carter,"The starters came out playing hard and made a statement early. For us, having a lead instead of being on the other end where we had to play catch up was a relief for us."
Vince Carter,"With our talent, when we step on the court, we expect to win and can't expect anything less, ... They just kept coming and coming and out-hustled us in the second half."
Vince Carter,"He's going to sleep well tonight. Not comfortable, but he's going to sleep well."
Vince Carter,"[For Peterson, five months removed from high school, to run for 225 yards in a game of that magnitude is jaw-dropping. At least to everyone but his teammates.] He's been doing this since Day 1, ... When he doesn't do it, then we'll be surprised."
Vince Carter,"It helps bring us back to reality, that we're definitely good enough to be one of the better teams in this league. We just have to consistently do it."
Vince Carter,"It's important to us to find time to rest. There's not much practice time and it's go, go, go. We want to push hard early."
Vince Carter,"We made them take tough shots. We got the rebound and kind of got into transition, tried to get as many easy buckets and make it tough for them, and take them out of their comfort zone."
Vince Carter,"We always felt (catching Miami) was a possibility. But we have to take care of our jobs and just win. If we just win, everything will fall into place."
Vince Carter,Just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hurt.
Vince Carter,"I play to win. I had the opportunity at the end. I blew it. I blew the opportunity. I hate that I had to miss those for us to end our streak. It's going to make me want to come out and play harder tomorrow. Missing that free throw hurt the most. If I made that, it would have been a tie game, and I might not have had to worry about that jumper."
Vince Carter,"I play to win, and I had the opportunity to win twice and I blew it. I hate that I missed that free throw that ended our streak."
Vince Carter,"Once they started stepping it up, it was hard to slow them down."
Vince Carter,I used to block field goals in junior high. Seriously. Check the technique out.
Vince Carter,"I used to block field goals in junior high, so I just pulled out that technique. In a situation like that, you always want to get a hand on the ball, but mainly you just want to disrupt the pass however you can."
Vince Carter,I was just taking what they were giving me. On pick-and-rolls they were loose and I was able to get in the lane and make things happen.
Vince Carter,I was taking what they were giving me early. I was free on some pick-and-rolls and was able to get into the lane and make things happen. Later I was able to find open guys and they were knocking them down.
Vince Carter,"It's always fun, it's not like it hurts my feelings or anything, that's just the way it is, ... It's just basketball at its finest. I enjoy it and take it all in stride."
Vince Carter,"When it was all about V.C. the Raptors played with fear, and that's not how you win games."
Vince Carter,He was relentless. He wanted to win this game. You could see it in his eyes.
Vince Carter,I was just enjoying the show.
Vince Carter,"That's definitely number one. The atmosphere, the emotion, the hostility in the arena: It was a fun game."
Vince Carter,I think we make a commitment to defend them.
Vince Carter,"All day I've been watching TV and they were mentioning the Christmas Day game without mentioning they had a game tonight, or to watch the Nets. We're just trying to earn respect."
Vince Carter,My first dunk was actually in sixth grade.
Vince Carter,I don't want or need to gain respect with what I do off the court. I want respect for what I do on the court.
Vince Carter,"I don't care how I got here. In the books, when you look at it 10 or 20 years from now, it's not going say how he got here, it's going to say he's here and he represented the team."
Vince Carter,"I play some fighting games, but mostly I just play sports."
Vince Carter,"There's not a thing that any of you guys can say bad about me that would hurt my feelings... I'm not coming at you, what I'm saying is that, I'm willing to take that heat for my team, if we're playing well or if we're not playing well."
Vince Carter,"I think people are going to like my new shoes. I like them. I had a lot of success with the one last year, but this year's shoe is going to be a little different, but at the same time it's going to be a little spin-off on last year's shoe."
Vince Carter,"Teams tend to double off him sometimes and leave him open. He's shooting with confidence. If he plays with aggression, it puts a lot of pressure on some big men. And if he attacks shot blockers it helps us get in the lane a little easier."
Vince Carter,His ability was always there. I think with the confidence it's just made him flourish. He's going to get what he deserves.
Henri Cartier-Bresson,"To photograph is to hold one's breath, when all faculties converge to capture fleeting reality. It's at that precise moment that mastering an image becomes a great physical and intellectual joy."
Henri Cartier-Bresson,He made me suddenly realize that photographs could reach eternity through the moment.
Henri Cartier-Bresson,"We photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing, and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth can make them come back again. We cannot develop and print a memory."
Henri Cartier-Bresson,"To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event."
Henri Cartier-Bresson,"The creative act lasts but a brief moment, a lightning instant of give-and-take, just long enough for you to level the camera and to trap the fleeting prey in your little box."
Bill Cartwright,"You can lead a team in a lot of different ways. It can be talking to somebody who is down or, during the course of a game, looking to penetrate and then dropping the ball off to someone else for an easy bucket."
Bill Cartwright,"I remember when I was in college, people told me I couldn't play in the NBA. There's always somebody saying you can't do it, and those people have to be ignored."
Bill Cartwright,The triangle is a foundation to an offense.

David Caruso,"Television, as you know, can kind of jettison you into a whole new world."
David Caruso,"If you're in over your head, go out tomorrow and see a consumer credit counseling service, ... Talk to someone if you can't do the things on your list, or go find a financial planner to get some help."
David Caruso,"In a funny way, we are more resonant in the foreign markets than we are domestically. That's why I think it is very important to come and connect with the journalists here and viewers here because our relationship with the larger landscape is here."
David Caruso,"Fear is a much bigger motivator than greed, but you've got to save money and put it in stocks, ... It's like a diet - to lose weight you have to eat less and exercise."
David Caruso,"Fear is a much bigger motivator than greed, but you've got to save money and put it in stocks. It's like a diet - to lose weight you have to eat less and exercise."
David Caruso,"Once they go through it, they see what their stomachs can take. It's all in emotions."
David Caruso,"The key to success is having some discipline, ... You don't have to be rocket scientist."
David Caruso,"Do what every human being in America is considering: refinance,"

Paul Carvel,Your God is crying.
Paul Carvel,To witness the birth of a child is our best opportunity to experience the meaning of the word miracle.
Julian Casablancas,That's nice of you to say. We're sort of staying afloat despite not fitting into . . . the corporate rules of commercial success. Somehow we've arrived somewhere cool despite not knowing where the ship was going to pop out after the storm.
Julian Casablancas,Vanity can easily overtake wisdom. It usually overtakes common sense.
Julian Casablancas,"The best solutions are often simple, yet unexpected."
Julian Casablancas,"With a hundred ways to do a dozen things, why not try it all?"
Julian Casablancas,"It was 100,000 years before we figured out what to do with fire. Humans learned how to use fire to cook 100, 000 years after they discovered how to make it. Imagine cavemen, sitting in front of a fire, eating raw meat for 100 thousand years."
Julian Casablancas,The period of earthly life in your greater existence is similar to the 15 minutes of fame you get down here...Everyone gets to share you in a different way. And both are dreams.
Julian Casablancas,"Austin is the most swinging of towns, this is one of the greatest audiences we've ever had."
Julian Casablancas,Desire is individual. Happiness is common.
Pablo Casals,Let us not forget that the greatest composers were also the greatest thieves. They stole from everyone and everywhere.
Pablo Casals,"I am perhaps the oldest musician in the world. I am an old man but in many senses a very young man. And this is what I want you to be, young, young all your life, and to say things to the world that are true."
Pablo Casals,"To strip human nature until its divine attributes are made clear, to inform ordinary activities with spiritual fervor, to give wings of eternity to that which is most ephemeral; to make divine things human and human things divine; such is Bach, the g"
Pablo Casals,"We ought to think that we are one of the leaves of a tree, and the tree is all humanity. We cannot live without the others, without the tree."
Pablo Casals,"Bach is the supreme genius of music... This man, who knows everything and feels everything, cannot write one note, however unimportant it may appear, which is anything but transcendent. He has reached the heart of every noble thought, and has done it"
Pablo Casals,"Each person has inside a basic decency and goodness. If he listens to it and acts on it, he is giving a great deal of what it is the world needs most. It is not complicated but it takes courage. It takes courage for a person to listen to his own good"
Pablo Casals,"The child must know that he is a miracle, that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been, and until the end of the world there will not be, another child like him."
Pablo Casals,The love of one's country is a splendid thing. But why should love stop at the border?
Giacomo Casanova,Love is three quarters curiosity.
Giacomo Casanova,"Real love is the love that sometimes arises after sensual pleasure: if it does, it is immortal; the other kind inevitably goes stale, for it lies in mere fantasy."
Giacomo Casanova,I have always loved truth so passionately that I have often resorted to lying as a way of introducing it into the minds which were ignorant of its charms
Giacomo Casanova,"As for myself, I always willingly acknowledge my own self as the principal cause of every good and of every evil which may befall me; therefore I have always found myself capable of being my own pupil, and ready to love my teacher."
Dwane Casey,"Everybody's going to make a run and when they did, we didn't collapse. It's not fun losing the lead, but the important thing is that we didn't give in."
Dwane Casey,"We could've benefited from it, but we made a different trade."
Dwane Casey,"That's going to be an ongoing struggle with him, because he wants to be out there for 48."
Dwane Casey,You don't want something like that to happen in sports. But nobody feels worse than Kevin.
Dwane Casey,That's something you don't want to happen in sports. Nobody feels worse about it than Kevin.
Dwane Casey,I don't think the commissioner had any race intentions whatsoever with the new dress code. I just think he's trying to improve the image.
Dwane Casey,"As the season goes on, that's going to be the recipe for him, cutting back his practice time. If you're a 10-year veteran, there are not a lot of new things you're going to learn."
Dwane Casey,"Kevin has opinions and is frustrated. We're all frustrated. We're not happy with where we are. Nobody wants to not be fighting for the division lead. I think he just spoke his mind on the feeling of everyone, from (owner) Glen Taylor all the way down to our trainer."
Dwane Casey,They would have laughed if you walked in with long shorts.
Dwane Casey,He's a handful for us down there wrestling with him. He's really played well and been a force.
Dwane Casey,"The expectation level is sky-high for all of us. Their goal was to win the division, thinking they could run away with it like we did last year. I don't know if that's a realistic goal."
Dwane Casey,"Same story in the third quarter, we had a tough third quarter, execution-wise and scoring-wise. They went on a 14-point run. I think we had a lead almost every game on this road trip in the first half. In the third quarter, I don't know where we go to. We go stagnant in the third quarter."
Dwane Casey,"I thought we had a quality, quality game tonight. Guys played to win down the stretch ? except execution and closing out games, on both ends of the floor."
Dwane Casey,"Justin has grown by leaps and bounds. Playing with his type of energy is an NBA skill. I've had players like that before (in Seattle) ? Reggie Evans, Ruben Patterson. In those guys' careers, they've always been underestimated as far as what they bring to the table."
Dwane Casey,"I want to win, for these young guys. If they go out and beat Memphis, we'll deal with the consequences later."
Dwane Casey,"You lose that many close games, it will shake your confidence."
Dwane Casey,"Right now, Marcus is our point guard. Marko continues to work. I think that competition makes your team better. Right now, Marcus is doing a good job and has done nothing wrong to lose his position."
Dwane Casey,"Kevin has never said, 'I don't like who we have, I don't like you as a coach, I don't want this coach. I've known Kevin for a while. He and I hit it off right from the start. To say there's not going to be bumps in the road - there's always going to be bumps in the road in any relationship. But it's always a matter of respect. Like I told him the first time I met him, if there's one player in this league that I would pay to watch play, it would be him. Because he brings it every night."
Dwane Casey,Earl came in and changed the game. He has the speed and the ability to push the ball after makes and misses. He pressured full court and did all the things that you want your point guard to do.
George Casey,"The Iraqis are seeing that they need to take a stand against the foreign fighters and the Iraqis that support them so they can get on with their future,"
George Casey,"Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of occupation. It contributes to the dependency of Iraqi security forces on the coalition, ... It extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self-reliant. And it exposes more coalition forces to attacks."
George Casey,"[The training of Iraqi security forces is] very much on track, ... This Week."
George Casey,"The development of the Iraqi security forces is very much on track,"
George Casey,reducing the visibility and ultimately the presence of coalition forces as we transition to Iraqi security self-reliance remains a key element of our counter-insurgency strategy.
George Casey,"They were involved in about a monthlong planning cycle with us. And they were well-integrated with us. ... I've heard nothing but positive things about how they performed,"
George Casey,do everything in their power to try to stop the march of freedom. And our troops are ready for it.
George Casey,"Fighting insurgencies is a long-term proposition, and there's no reason that we should believe that the insurgency in Iraq will take any less time to deal with."
George Casey,"We've looked for the constitution to be a national pact, and the perception now is that it's not."
George Casey,"Now this constitution has come out, and it didn't come out as the national compact that we thought it was going to be. And there's division there, ... And that caused the situation to change a little bit."
George Casey,"I think that's entirely possible, senator, ... I mean, as we've looked at this, we've looked for the constitution to be a national compact, and the perception now is that it's not, particularly among the Sunni."
George Casey,Army ... in bad shape
John Casey,We are not proposing that the Navy buy more submarines than they are currently planning. What we are proposing is to buy them in a more cost-effective manner.
John Casey,We'd like to make parents aware of the signs of gangs and gang activities.
John Casey,carefully consider the submarine design construction life cycle support capabilities inherent with Electric Boat and the unique synergy between Electric Boat and New London Submarine Base....

Johnny Cash,"The Master of Life's been good to me. He has given me strength to face past illnesses, and victory in the face of defeat. He has given me life and joy where other saw oblivion. He Has given new purpose to live for, new services to render and old wounds to heal.Life and love go on, let the music play."
Johnny Cash,"[You can tell they're all having fun, as Johnny Cash sings that he'll live forever, coming back like a single drop of rain again and again. Waylon Jennings joins in with more of such verse, all of it in the vein of some down-home Longfellow.] With the four of us, we had 135 years on the road, ... I almost did live forever."
Johnny Cash,"You've got to know your limitations. I don't know what your limitations are. I found out what mine were when I was twelve. I found out that there weren't too many limitations, if I did it my way."
Johnny Cash,"When I record somebody else's song, I have to make it my own or it doesn't feel right. I'll say to myself, I wrote this and he doesn't know it!"
Johnny Cash,"I start a lot more songs than I finish, because I realize when I get into them, they're no good. I don't throw them away, I just put them away, store them, get them out of sight."
Johnny Cash,"That was the big thing when I was growing up, singing on the radio. The extent of my dream was to sing on the radio station in Memphis. Even when I got out of the Air Force in 1954, I came right back to Memphis and started knocking on doors at the radio station."
Johnny Cash,Sometimes I am two people. Johnny is the nice one. Cash causes all the trouble. They fight.
Johnny Cash,"You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space."
Johnny Cash,"It's like a novelist writing far out things. If it makes a point and makes sense, then people like to read that. But if it's off in left field and goes over the edge, you lose it. The same with musical talent, I think."
Johnny Cash,For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide.
Johnny Cash,"When I think about country music, I think about America,"
Rosanne Cash,"In normal circumstances, you would be allowed the time to process your grief and then to get some distance so you can get back to your own life. Me and my sisters and my brother, we've never gotten any distance."
Rosanne Cash,"Yeah, I was in the phase for the last ten years or so where every record I made I said OK, that's the last one, I don't want to record anymore, I don't want to do this any more, I don't want to have a public life."
Rosanne Cash,"When my dad died a lot of songs came, and they're still coming."
Rosanne Cash,"Well, the first year I lost my voice I didn't mind so much because I was going to have a baby and I was distracted with him anyway, I didn't even think about it that much, well, OK, this is what's happening."
Rosanne Cash,"The new record started out being about loss, but it's morphed into being about how relationships go on even though one person is not in a body anymore."
Rosanne Cash,"Once your kids get older and get out of the house, it's not like it stops. They're on the phone with me every day; I'm intimately involved in their problems."
Rosanne Cash,"No, my step-daughter just opened a theatre school for children, I have another daughter who works in the record industry and another who is going back to collage and I have two little ones at home."
Rosanne Cash,"My record label is treating me like I'm a new artist, which is exciting after all this time."
Rosanne Cash,It's a little dangerous for me to get outside myself and think about how I want people to see me.
Rosanne Cash,It is the people who scream the loudest about America and Freedom who see to be the most intolerant for a differing point of view.
Rosanne Cash,If a relationship is founded on love it doesn't end.
Rosanne Cash,"I was down with Lucinda Williams and Mary Chapin-Carpenter. We did an acoustic tour, just the three of us, three chicks and three guitars."
Rosanne Cash,I needed to carve out my own place and find out what I was going to do.
Rosanne Cash,I love mixing up my genres.
Rosanne Cash,I love live performance because it only happens for that two hours or whatever. It's so ephemeral and that makes it so beautiful to me.
Rosanne Cash,I have daughters who are writers and actors but no musicians.
Rosanne Cash,I found it was really impossible for me to write songs when I couldn't sing.
Rosanne Cash,"I choose not to give energy to the emotions of revenge, hatred or the desire to subjugate."
Rosanne Cash,"I am so sick of reading about another car bomb, another suicide bomber, another 10, 20, 30, 70, 100 people dead in a day, both Americans and Iraqis."
Rosanne Cash,"For the first time in 23 years I'm enjoying the process of supporting it, of going out and doing shows, and doing the interviews, and doing everything."
Rosanne Cash,Every person's every action has an effect.
Rosanne Cash,"But there's nothing that gives me more thrill than when I'm writing and a couplet works. I find the right rhyme, or it's just perfect. There's nothing that exciting."
Rosanne Cash,"But I also love being in the studio because there's none of the anxiety of pre-show stuff, and worried is my voice going to work and blah blah blah."
Rosanne Cash,"Being in the studio is like painting, you know, you can really take your time, and try different things, and kind of go deep into it."
Rosanne Cash,Because I was starting out in my 20's. I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't want to use my dad or have people say I was using him.
Rosanne Cash,And I kind of said to myself if I get my voice back I'm not going to take back the old anxiety about it and just focus on the limitations. I'm really going to enjoy it.
Rosanne Cash,"And I don't think that success is going to destroy me at this point in my life, like I used to think."
Rosanne Cash,The key to change... is to let go of fear.
Rosanne Cash,"I think it is wrong that we went against The U.N. and that we have alienated our allies and invaded a country that hasn't threatened us, that it is a pre-emptive strike."
Brian Cashman,"Anything you can do to help. You don't realize what kind of impact the name 'Yankees,' or anybody in sports for that matter, can have on people's lives on a daily basis."
Brian Cashman,"Maybe it'll help, ... We've done it in the past. I don't remember the last time we did it, but he's available if guys want to hit off him. It's up to Joe and Donnie."
Brian Cashman,We were looking to make some changes and add some youth. We never could have expected this.
Brian Cashman,"She's not going to get the job because she's a woman, and I don't think she's getting interviewed because she's a woman. I think she's getting interviewed because she deserves to have that opportunity because of that hard work she's put forth."
Brian Cashman,"Joe has a great deal of trust in him. Joe has worked close with Ron for a number of years, and he's been talking to him for three years about replacing Mel when Mel decided to retire. This is the man he wanted."
Brian Cashman,"As with any player who doesn't have a no-trade clause, I would listen if someone came up with something that might make us better. That's the nature of the business."
Brian Cashman,"This particular free-agent market is difficult. Because of that, it's going to promote a lot more aggressive trade discussions."
Brian Cashman,"He doesn't need to see him. He wants him to continue the therapy program he has been doing, and says as soon as he feels up to it he can get up on the mound."
Brian Cashman,"He's a unique player. Not only is he someone who is incredibly talented on the field, but that talent actually translates to success in New York,"
Brian Cashman,So far he looks fine. He's still building up arm strength.
Brian Cashman,"They put it in horse terms and said the lead horse is retirement. It makes no sense to speculate on my end. If he changes his mind, he knows our interest level."
Brian Cashman,"Before we progress, we want the specialist to make sure there's nothing we're not missing. We're not going to do anything until the back specialist has a chance to give his opinion, tell us there's nothing going on."
Brian Cashman,"Obviously, this winter, where it's such a thin market, the reason the money has gotten so high is because there's very little choices."
Brian Cashman,"That's what's required of them. That's what a No. 1 and a No. 2 guy's job is, to lead a staff. And we have full confidence in them."
Brian Cashman,He's been heaven sent.
Brian Cashman,"I'm not commenting on anything regarding my future. I've asked that we wait until after the season to discuss all that, and the way we're going to handle it."
Brian Cashman,"Let's get what we can get accomplished and let's concentrate on the future at a more appropriate time, which is after we get through the season."
Brian Cashman,"He hasn't performed to his expectation or ours, but that's not something that hasn't happened before, either."
Brian Cashman,"I know Hideki wanted to stay and we wanted to keep him, and that created a great environment for us to get it done. Thankfully, we got it done with a few hours to spare."
Brian Cashman,I trust Randy. Randy says he's not hurt [and] I have no reason to doubt him.
Brian Cashman,"These guys have been huge for us, no doubt about it. Wang and Cano could have been had in the past, but they can't be had now."
Brian Cashman,"It took us a long time for some reason to get together and push in the right direction,"
Brian Cashman,"It was never discussed. I just know that the desire was very strong for him to keep playing. He believes, without question, that he's got a lot to offer. We're not bringing him back just because he wants to come back; we feel he can be a contributor as well."
Brian Cashman,I just know the desire was very strong for him to keep playing. He believes without question he has a lot to offer.
Brian Cashman,"We've always considered Roger a Yankee. If he decides to play, he'll give us the courtesy of an audience. We'll have to take a look at it when the time comes."
Brian Cashman,Nothing official. Just a good conversation letting him know where we're at.
Brian Cashman,We'll need choices. We always do.
Brian Cashman,"He provides a lot of interest from Japan. What generally sells -- because we?re a business -- is team and winning,"
Brian Cashman,There is a business side that comes along with us because of his status. That?s certainly a factor in this.
Brian Cashman,He's a real quality baseball man. He's been a big asset for us this year. I know he hasn't had any managerial experience but he's managed the game behind the plate for so many years that I think it makes up for a lot.
Brian Cashman,"[The Dodgers continued to tell the Yankees that the deal would take place. The teams reached a formal agreement on Monday at midnight, but the Dodgers added a wrinkle: all players must take physicals by 5 p.m. on Wednesday.] There was an issue for one of the clubs that they wanted physicals to take place, ... It was Monday at midnight, and the only way it could work is if you could take the physical by a certain time on Wednesday. And that was not feasible."
Brian Cashman,"He's got some ability, even though the batting average has been low. We'll see what he can do and whether he can help us."
Iker Casillas,In the second half we were better and I am happy also with my own performance. We can now build from here.
Iker Casillas,"It was a terrible piece of bad luck for Canizares... and I am certainly not happy because a teammate has been injured,"
Iker Casillas,This is the revenge match for us because that 3-0 defeat hurt us because of the way it damaged our image and our fans.
Greg Casini,"We pride ourselves on empowering ordinary citizens to be the Sierra Club where they live. In essence we're asking local leaders to be members of boards of directors in local organizations and to run them. We're asking them to take on administrative tasks, which has to come with the territory of being a leader, but it's not something that they initially got involved with the Sierra Club to do."
Greg Casini,"It's going to be the largest gathering of our members, activists and leaders ever. This is going to really be the first time that all of our activists are coming together to discuss where we should go and what we want to do nationwide."
Greg Casini,My hope is that we will leave here with a course of action that will galvanize the club and America's communities. Let's create a new Sierra Club.
Lewis Cass,"People may doubt what you say, but they will believe what you do."
Lewis Cass,Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom. - A theme for a great poet would be God's boredom on the seventh day of creation.

Carlos Castaneda,"They took money away from us for years, and we never got it back."
Carlos Castaneda,Being timid prevents us from examining and exploiting our lot as men
Carlos Castaneda,"The world around us is a mystery, and men are no better than anything else."
Carlos Castaneda,I am only a man â€¦ who knows that heâ€™ll never understand all that is around him.
Carlos Castaneda,â€œA warrior never worries about his fear.â€
Carlos Castaneda,"â€œAll paths are the same: they lead nowhere. However, a path without a heart is never enjoyable. On the other hand, a path with heart is easyâ€”it does not make a warrior work at liking it; it makes for a joyful journey; as long as a man follows it, he is one with it.â€"
Carlos Castaneda,"The spirit of a warrior is not geared to indulging and complaining, nor is it geared to winning or losing. The spirit of a warrior is geared only to struggle, and every struggle is a warriors last battle on earth. Thus the outcome matters very little to him. In his last battle on earth a warrior lets his spirit flow free and clear. And as he wages his battle, knowing that his intent is impeccable, a warrior laughs and laughs."
Carlos Castaneda,"A rule of thumb for a warrior is that he makes his decisions so carefully that nothing that may happen as a result of them can surprise him, much less drain his power."
Carlos Castaneda,it's better to get something worthwhile done using deception than to fail to get something worthwhile done using truth.
Carlos Castaneda,But we just had to explain to them the advantages and disadvantages of amending our Constitution.

The spirit of a warrior is geared only to struggle, and every struggle is a warriorâ€™s last battle on earth. Thus the outcome matters very little to him. In his last battle on earth a warrior lets his spirit flow free and clear. And as he wages his battle, knowing that his intent is impeccable, a warrior laughs and laughs.â€"
Carlos Castaneda,"Only as a warrior can one withstand the path of knowledge. A warrior cannot complain or regret anything. His life is an endless challenge, and challenges cannot possibly be good or bad. Challenges are simply challenges."
Carlos Castaneda,"Look at every path closely and deliberately, then ask ourselves this crucial question: Does this path have a heart? If it does, then the path is good. If it doesn't, it is of no use."
Carlos Castaneda,"A man of knowledge lives by acting, not by thinking about acting."
Carlos Castaneda,The only thing that is real is the being in you that is going to die.
Carlos Castaneda,"All paths are the same, leading nowhere. Therefore, pick a path with heart!"
Carlos Castaneda,"Personal history must be constantly renewed by telling parents, relatives, and friends everything one does. On the other hand, for the warrior who has no personal history, no explanations are needed; nobody is angry or disillusioned with his acts. And above all, no one pins him down with their thoughts and their expectations."
Carlos Castaneda,"When a man has fulfilled all four of these requisitesto be wide awake, to have fear, respect, and absolute assurancethere are no mistakes for which he will have to account; under such conditions his actions lose the blundering quality of the acts of a fool. If such a man fails, or suffers a defeat, he will have lost only a battle, and there will be no pitiful regrets over that."
Ana Castillo,"He's still my most important project in progress. There were years even though he was living with me, he went away emotionally. The last years I've seen him coming back and maturing. I'm betting that in a few years, he'll be my best friend."
Ana Castillo,I started having dreams that there was a home for me there. The desert motivates me in a very different way than the city. There's a very harsh brutality that calls upon your survival instincts. It's a harshness that is very beautiful to me. I feel very much a part of this wilderness.
Ana Castillo,Our goal should be to achieve joy.
Ana Castillo,Human sexuality has been regulated and shaped by men to serve men's needs.
Ana Castillo,"For things to have value in man's world, they are given the role of commodities. Among man's oldest and most constant commodity is woman."

Ana Castillo,"There are things coming from me that I felt I wanted to talk about. My search for my own blend of spirituality, my acknowledgement of my sexuality, my being the single mother of a young man."

Fidel Castro,"Where is the ethic, the justification, the respect for the most basic human rights and the common sense of such policies?"
Fidel Castro,to turn it into a body which is truly representative of the interest of all the peoples of the world.
Fidel Castro,"I feel my belief in sacrifice and struggle getting stronger. I despise the kind of existence that clings to the miserly trifles of comfort and self-interest. I think that a man should not live beyond the age when he begins to deteriorate, when the flame that lighted the brightest moment of his life has weakened."
Fidel Castro,A revolution is not a bed of roses. A revolution is a struggle between the future and the past.
Fidel Castro,"In the army of the workers there must be discipline; there must be comradeship, there must be unity; you are the officers of this army, you are the leaders."

Juan Castro,"I have nothing against him. We're grown men. We talk about things ? good things and bad things. And that's good. Since I've been here, he's shown me a lot of respect, and it's the same thing from me to him."
Juan Castro,"I think it was a little bad luck situation. I was ready. As much as I want to come back and play, sometimes you have to understand what's going on."
Juan Castro,"That was the best pitching I've seen from him. He had a lot of control, a lot of command. He had a good fastball. He's got a lot of talent. I think he's matured a lot."
Helio Castroneves,"They have to worry about finishing ahead of me. I have to just finish ahead of them. At this point of the season, you don't think what might happen or keep track of the points; you just go for it, and that is what we are planning right now."
Helio Castroneves,We had some trouble with the engine electronics this afternoon. I still think we're in good shape.
Helio Castroneves,Let me show that I have that (talent).
Helio Castroneves,"Everything is going the way we are planning but until the checkered flag, you can't count on it. Today, we are extremely happy. That's what we need to be thinking about and enjoy this moment."
Helio Castroneves,"You can't make a grave move with 60 laps to go. It's a lack of patience, ... If a guy is not in the points, he doesn't have to take your points away. He went from hero to zero -- to be in the pole position and then to make a move like he did."
Helio Castroneves,This is a good way to improve your concentration.
Helio Castroneves,"I'm definitely optimistic about our competitiveness in 2006. I think if this team works hard all year, we'll be in good shape for the championship. There are so many good drivers in this series, it won't be easy, but that is what makes winning all the better."
Helio Castroneves,I need my blood to calm down.
Helio Castroneves,"Close to the end, when I saw Sam coming, I tried to make a move. I tried to take advantage of the momentum, put me side by side with Dan. But it just was not enough. If we would be like NASCAR and have bumpers, I'm sure we would have won the race by now."

Kim Cattrall,Sexual Intelligence
Kim Cattrall,"[Imagination] helps me to become part of that journey that I'm going through in font of the camera, or in front of an audience. I used to think you had to disappear within a character, but I find that puts a mask on what I do."
Kim Cattrall,Theatre can't be done again and again and again and again - it's organic.
Kim Cattrall,The roles for women in theatre are much better than they are in film.

Kim Cattrall,I've always thought that less was a lot more.

Kim Cattrall,"If you stick with a vision, it might not all work, but some of it will be absolute genius. To me, 15 minutes worth of absolute genius in a film is so much better than two hours of mediocrity. I would rather pay to see something different like that."
Kim Cattrall,I'm a trisexual. I'll try anything once.
Kim Cattrall,I think the wonderful thing about doing theater is that it's more of an actor's medium. I think that film is more of a director's medium. You can't edit something out on stage. It's there.

Kim Cattrall,Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.

Jim Cavanaugh,The exercise is one of teamwork.
Jim Cavanaugh,"It's been an annual event for as long as anyone can remember. We have pictures dating from the turn of the century, but we're not exactly sure how many there have been."

Margaret Cavendish,A rude nature is worse than a brute nature by so much more as man is better than a beast: and those that are of civil natures and genteel dispositions are as much nearer to celestial creatures as those that are rude and cruel are to devils.
Margaret Cavendish,"And not only my own brothers and sisters agreed so but my brothers and sisters in law; and their children, although but young, had the like agreeable natures and affectionate dispositions."
Jim Caviezel,I look at this as a service. I enjoy that.
Jim Caviezel,opportunity of a lifetime.

Jim Caviezel,I still put my pants on the same way. I still walk on my pool twice a day.

Miguel de Cervantes,"Liberty is one of the most precious gifts which heaven has bestowed on man; with it we cannot compare the treasures which the earth contains or the sea conceals; for liberty, as for honor, we can and ought to risk our lives; and, on for the other hand, captivity is the greatest evil that can befall man."

Shami Chakrabarti,"Of course these records should be accessed by police to solve serious criminal cases, but this power cannot be used indiscriminately."
Shami Chakrabarti,"We need to be more careful about senior police officers rushing in front of TV cameras defending positions before there has been time to reflect and take stock,"

Shami Chakrabarti,Public safety can be enhanced by passenger screening but police must not heighten tensions by targeting young men from ethnic minorities.

Jackie Chan,"These things just happen. I always put safety first when filming, but still, sometimes things just go wrong. It was just an ordinary accident. The stunt man working with me had on the wrong shoes and I got hurt."
Jackie Chan,"For example: a child wanted to eat something and the parents refused, and as the child began to act up and pretended to cry because there were no tears his parents immediately surrendered and offered the little master food with two hands."
Jackie Chan,"When I look back to when I was young, when parents said no they meant no, no matter how much you cried and how many times tears would run out, it would be useless. We knew that losing our temper and crying would not get us what we wanted so we wouldn't dare to lose our temper or cry easily."

Chanakya,Knowledge is lost without putting it into practice; a man is lost due to ignorance; an army is lost without a commander; and a woman is lost without a husband.
Chanakya,Contentment with little or nothing to eat although one may have a great appetite; to awaken instantly although one may be in a deep slumber; unflinching devotion to the master; and bravery; these six qualities should be learned from the dog.

Chanakya,"He who is overly attached to his family members experiences fear and sorrow, for the root of all grief is attachment. Thus one should discard attachment to be happy."
Chanakya,The world's biggest power is the youth and beauty of a woman.

Mark Chandler,There?s an awful lot of knowledge we can gain from past climates.
Mark Chandler,"The most remarkable thing about Canadian growth is that it has been so stable given the degree of 'moving parts' like record currency strength, volatile energy prices, weather fluctuations, etcetera."
Mark Chandler,The simple fact that the trade sector has ceased to be a significant drag on growth will be enough to convince the Bank of Canada to move on September 7 (and beyond).
Mark Chandler,"This week was a bad one for energy prices, in particular natural gas prices, which were down 15 percent. There was no question of those eventually weighing on the currency."
Mark Chandler,Two-year bonds don't offer too much value as the central bank may continue to raise interest rates. The economy in general is doing very well.
Mark Chandler,It's not in the best interest financially for our community. It's in the best interest of the developers who want to come in and do this.
Mark Chandler,The Bank of Canada still has a constructive view on economic growth. They may be likely to raise interest rates more.
Mark Chandler,The economy is firmly in expansion mode so the Bank of Canada will take rates higher. Higher short-term rates will push up yields.
Mark Chandler,Usually Canadian data doesn't mean that much but we were so close to testing the previous (dollar/Canada) lows that when we got better productivity numbers it gave the market a push.
Mark Chandler,The Bank of Canada may raise the rate to 4 percent and pause. Initial reaction is a weaker Canadian dollar.
Mark Chandler,You have firm inflation. The Bank of Canada has to continue tightening to keep it in check. Clearly it makes 4.25 percent more likely than 4 percent.
Mark Chandler,"The (Bank of Canada is) priced for 4 percent and this is consistent with that right now, although they are in data-watching mode."

Peter Chandler,Nortel is benefiting from a general recovery in the technology stocks in the U.S. as well.

Peter Chandler,We're seeing relative strength in (metals and minerals). There are a lot of base commodities prices that are trading at higher levels right now. The fact that the (Canadian) dollar is as low as it is has made our metals sector more competitive than they would at higher levels.
Peter Chandler,"We've seen pockets of strength in the Canadian markets, so the Canadian market actually acted a lot better than the U.S. market did as a whole."
Peter Chandler,"There's a potential end in sight but as Yogi Berra said 'it ain't over till it's over,' so there's still uncertainty out there. When the market believes it's over, then we're going to get, if nothing else, one heck of a short-term rally."
Peter Chandler,"out from underneath Ma Bell's skirt, able to continue to expand and pursue their growth strategy without having a big mother looking over."
Peter Chandler,"We're in a bouncing environment and as soon as you get any kind of bounce they're selling into the bounce, and that's what we're seeing here."

Ravi Chandra,Now we'll see if we can harness some of the cells' power by incorporating them into a device.
Ravi Chandra,We figured out a way to get living cells to attach where and when we want them to.
Ravi Chandra,"Just as DNA chips revolutionized genome analysis, we hope to make cell chips (self-assembled arrays of cells on a thumbnail-sized chip) using our DNA-based cell adhesion strategy. Cell chips could be used as biosensors for detecting the presence of pathogens, or for drug screening, just to name of a few of the many possibilities."
Ravi Chandra,"For example, it should be possible to array multiple types of non-adherent cells on a chip to create a mini-immune system for evaluating potential therapies."

Coco Chanel,Why am I so determined to put the shoulder where it belongs? Women have very round shoulders that push forward slightly; this touches me and I say: 'One must not hide that!' Then someone tells you: 'The shoulder is on the back'. I have never seen women with shoulders on their backs.

Coco Chanel,There are people who have money and people who are rich.
Coco Chanel,There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony. There is time for work. And time for love. That leaves no other time!
John Chaney,"In all my years I've never had a team that's had this much talent in five players. But they seem to see a game out of a telescope instead of binoculars. They don't see the whole floor. They're penetrating when they should be passing. They're passing it when they should be penetrating. They're forgetting the role of every player, and that's to communicate with one another."
John Chaney,I think our talent is as good as anybody's in the league.
John Chaney,"It certainly is just outstanding that we get a home game after all of these years of playing in the NIT, and we are honored that we are invited to participate in one of the greatest all-time traditional tournaments."

John Chaney,"Not just athletes, but guys who have an acumen, an ability to play this game."
Jeff Chang,"That's what it's supposed to do--speak truth to power. I'm not surprised by this...hip-hop tells the micro history, but it also tells the counter-history to the official narrative."
Jeff Chang,"There is so much about hip-hop culture that is peculiar to New York, and I got to understand it from that point of view."
Jeff Chang,"I entered at an interesting time, after the L.A. riots, when the field was in crisis. A lot of the movement was down with solidarity with other races, but the riots were a shock. The focus became interracial relations, and they wanted to know what I thought. It gave me a weird credibility in the field. A lot of us got published in academic journals right away."
Jeff Chang,It was just one of those nights. It was an out-of-body experience.
Todd Chanko,"Overall, it's important to stress on the revenue side that sales are up. It's not about Amazon not being able to increase its top line growth."

William Henry Channing,"To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly; to listen to stars and birds, to babes and sages, with open heart; to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. In a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common. This is to be my symphony."
William Henry Channing,"Poetry reveals to us the loveliness of nature, brings back the freshness of youthful feelings, reviews the relish of simple pleasures, keeps unquenched the enthusiasm which warmed the springtime of our being, refines youthful love, strengthens our interest in human mature, by vivid delineations of its tenderest and softest feelings, and through the brightness of its prophetic visions, helps faith to lay hold on the future life."

Elaine Chao,"Workers in these temporary jobs will be involved in the provision of food, shelter and other services to fellow Mississippians,"
Elaine Chao,"Both surveys portend much greater job creation in the future,"
Elaine Chao,"We feel a pathway to citizenship would reward illegal activity, ... Amnesty encourages further illegal immigration."
Elaine Chao,Those who come forward will not be offered an automatic pass to citizenship and should be expected to pay a substantial fine or penalty to participate in the temporary program.
Elaine Chao,"We do not support an automatic pathway to citizenship,"
Elaine Chao,"It will level the playing field, ... It will give American workers choice, confidence and also control."

Charlie Chaplin,The most wasted day in life is the day in which one has not laughed....

Charlie Chaplin,The saddest thing I can imagine is to get used to luxury.
Gary Chapman,They have to have end of course testing just like at the traditional high school as well as pass the Georgia high school graduation test to get their diploma.
Gary Chapman,"Because of the way we run the school and the wavers we have through the charter school process, we can give them credit, they can catch up and graduate on time."
Gary Chapman,"They receive credit not necessarily because of the number of days they're here, but the mastery of their learning."

Graham Chapman,"I do not really look back with regret on any feelings or problems I have had in the past. I think I am more able to accept problems as being part of the rough and tumble of life. There are bound to be ups and downs. In retrospect, when you've gotten pasty a tough period, it makes the good things that much better."

John Chapman,We have been seeing this for years now. But we are trying to implement as many preventative measures as we can with special programs in Bridgeport and New Haven that identify girls at a very young age who may be on the path to violent and aggressive behaviors.
John Chapman,The purpose of this is to reduce our impact of having greenhouse gasses emitted to the atmosphere. ... We can be leaders in reducing our impact by going 100 percent green. It's our hope other businesses and organizations would do the same.
John Chapman,It is just as impossible to help reform by conciliating prejudice as it is by buying votes. Prejudice is the enemy. Whoever is not for you is against you.
John Chapman,Too much agreement kills the chat.
John Chapman,"Is there something in trade that desiccates and flattens out, that turns men into dried leaves at the age of forty? Certainly there is. It is not due to trade but to intensity of self-seeking, combined with narrowness of occupation. Business has destroyed the very knowledge in us of all other natural forces except business."
John Chapman,"Wherever you see a man who gives someone else's corruption, someone else's prejudice as a reason for not taking action himself, you see a cog in The Machine that governs us."

Tracy Chapman,I learn all these things about the record talking about it after it's finished.
Tracy Chapman,I end up writing about all kinds of things. I never make an attempt to write about anything in particular. I don't have a little list of topics to write about.
Tracy Chapman,I dressed up as a veterinarian for a Halloween costume party. I had the lab coat. I got a couple of stuffed animals for patients and put bandages on them.
Tracy Chapman,Everyone is looking for connections between the songs. I don't usually approach a record as a concept. There's no overriding theme I'm trying to represent. It's all about the individual songs.
Tracy Chapman,"After it's finished, sometimes I can trace a path that goes back to the possible source of inspiration."
Tracy Chapman,"I'm never sure if I'll ever write another song, what the song will be about and if what initially sparked the beginning of a song might complete it."
Tracy Chapman,You have to pay attention to the moment and make it the best it can be for you. I've been trying to do that. It's really made a major difference for me. I'm a happier person.

Tracy Chapman,"When you feel like you've had a good show, you go backstage and you talk to yourself about it, and if you have a bad show you talk to yourself about it."
Tracy Chapman,I'm a hopeful cynic.
Greg Chappell,"In what context he said it, nobody knows. You got to get the truth."
Greg Chappell,"There are some things which are non-negotiable. Fielding and fitness are two of them. Unfortunately, players would not find it any easier,"
Greg Chappell,We were happy with the basic plans that we had worked on. But I don't have a great desire to look back at what happened in Peshawar.
Greg Chappell,We need results in test cricket. Both teams are evenly matched and we are excited about this game. We got some good batting practice in Lahore.
Greg Chappell,"We won't have a long duration camp. We had lot of cricket over the last few months. So, we will probably get together only the day before we leave for Pakistan."
Greg Chappell,Differences are a fairly normal thing happening in cricket. But you can understand I am not in a position to speak about it to you at this stage.
Greg Chappell,"It was a frank discussion about Indian cricket, present and future, and much of what I said was aimed at motivating Saurav for the Bulawayo test. In that regard our exchange was beneficial."
Greg Chappell,It's got to be good for the future of the Indian cricket.
Greg Chappell,"It was nothing, we were just discussing cricket. Why do you people have to read more into everything?"
Greg Chappell,I have taken the view that I can do the job to the best of my ability and the rest will take care of itself.

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Evolution is gaining the psychic zones of the world... life, being and ascent of consciousness, could not continue to advance indefinitely along its line without transforming itself in depth. The being who is the object of his own reflection, in consequence, of that very doubling back upon himself becomes in a flash able to raise himself to a new sphere."
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,Love alone can unite living beings so as to complete and fulfill them... for it alone joins them by what is deepest in themselves. All we need is to imagine our ability to love developing until it embraces the totality of men and the earth.
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Someday, after mastering winds, waves, tides and gravity, we shall harness the energy of love; and for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."

Ralph Charell,"It is through cooperation, rather than conflict, that your greatest successes will be derived"
Lindsay Charlton,"What's pushing the BBC is they see this as an expansion of their public service remit. We see ITV Local, and broadband, as an opportunity to access new markets. My view of the BBC and its broadband plans are the same as newspapers'; that it is all very well, but there should be a proper market-interest test because they are a publicly funded broadcaster."
Lindsay Charlton,"ITV1 can no longer guarantee an income stream, especially with other people in the digital marketplace."
Lindsay Charlton,The heart of ITV Local is public participation.
Stacey Charter,Don't rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth. Only you can be responsible for that. If you can't love and respect yourself - no one else will be able to make that happen. Accept who you are - completely; the good and the bad - and make changes as YOU see fit - not because you think someone else wants you to be different.
Stacey Charter,"Life is all about timing... the unreachable becomes reachable, the unavailable become available, the unattainable... attainable. Have the patience, wait it out It's all about timing."
Stacey Charter,"What is life but a grand adventure, if you choose to LIVE it? Every chance meeting, every lover, every friend, every new opportunity- all forks in the road less traveled. Pathways that take you somewhere new. It's up to you to forge the way. Go or stay, take that chance or play it safe...simply exist or truly live! ~Stacey Charter"
David Chartrand,"Without a land base you're not a people, you're not a nation. That's been a struggle for our people for over a century now."
David Chartrand,"A constitutional obligation, a legal obligation, has been ignored and denied by Canada, and Canada, in my view and I'll use layman's language robbed us of our land."
David Chartrand,"A constitutional obligation, a legal obligation, has been ignored and denied by Canada, and Canada, in my view â€“ and I'll use layman's language â€“ robbed us of our land."
Chevy Chase,"What you're doing here is wrong. I bought a house in a country, in county and in a town that believes in freedom."
Chevy Chase,"had a negative and injurious impact on the Town's Special Character, and has also contributed to the loss of trees, green space, open space, dramatic increase in storm water run-off management problems."
Chevy Chase,"You may have read that I went to M.I.T. In 1982 I filled out a Who's Who survey with joking responses, and they never bothered to check the facts."
Chevy Chase,"With Clinton, there's no question that I would have made fun of his out-and-out lying. But he's also a good friend."

Chevy Chase,There are very few solid family films. A lot of the writing is awful.
Chevy Chase,"The worst thing about Saturday Night Live now is that, in the last 10 to 15 years, they've grown to some 40 writers. We had seven. And seven actors."
Chevy Chase,"The first thing that happens is that you're overwhelmed by so much attention. It's just so unnatural. Only people who've been in that position can realize what it's like. I mean, you have to be there."

Chevy Chase,The best comedy I ever did was when people didn't know who I was.
Chevy Chase,"Television doesn't make stars. It's the written media, the press, that makes stars."

Chevy Chase,I watched every single Charlie Chaplin film.
Chevy Chase,I was always the guy getting kicked out of my classes at school for having an attitude problem.
Chevy Chase,"I took a professional gamble leaving Hollywood, knowing I would be out of the loop. I'm not part of the movie world in-crowd right now."
Chevy Chase,"I think the Clintons are brilliant. I've never met a person as intelligent as Bill, and I think Hillary is right up there with him. They're too smart for Washington."
Chevy Chase,"I tell the person I won't take a picture or sign the autograph, but I will shake their hand. That kind of personal touch is all they're really seeking."
Chevy Chase,"I made about 28 movies, and I think about five of them were good."
Chevy Chase,I learned a lot about handling fans from established stars.
Chevy Chase,I just went into this business for laughs. I guess I don't mind being an actor so much now.
Chevy Chase,I have three daughters. I wanted them to be raised where there are real seasons and where everyone their age wasn't trying to get into movies.
Chevy Chase,"I don't know if my looks will ever get any better, but my pratfalls sure won't."
Chevy Chase,Every Vacation movie didn't just make the studio money. They each made the studio a lot of money.

Chevy Chase,Parrots make great pets. They have more personality than goldfish.
Chevy Chase,"Once I got married and had kids, I moved away from romantic roles, because it seemed wrong to have my 3-year-old wondering why Daddy was kissing someone else."
Stuart Chase,"For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible."
Stuart Chase,"Attitude is your acceptance of the natural laws, or your rejection of the natural laws."
Stuart Chase,Sanely applied advertising could remake the world.
Brandi Chastain,"You'll be dedicated and that's what you should want to be in anything in life - whether it's sports or academics or your relationship. It all stems from finding that fun, that thrill, that excitement."
Brandi Chastain,"You have to be willing to accept the information, you have to be willing to work hard. You have to be motivated to go to practice with an open mind. You have to be willing to be criticized. Only you can do those things."
Brandi Chastain,"When I was younger it was twice a day with a game on the weekend. Then when I got older, three times a day everyday in college and on the national team."
Brandi Chastain,"When I got injured, I was out and it was a big deal. I missed two and a half years of college soccer, which I thought was the end of the world."
Brandi Chastain,"Well there are two things: Number one is, make sure you always enjoy yourself, because when you enjoy yourself, you'll learn, you'll want more information, you'll push yourself."
Brandi Chastain,We are shaping young kids to be leaders in their communities and also to be healthier.
Brandi Chastain,"To be honest with you, I never looked at soccer as a sacrifice."
Brandi Chastain,The thing I can say about Japan is they were progressive for a country that is very male dominant.
Brandi Chastain,So I'm still doing my best to stay in shape and hope that opportunity will come back to me.
Brandi Chastain,"So along with that is spending a lot of time with the ball. For me it was, I loved to juggle the ball in my front yard, and I always challenged myself - how many juggles can I get today? I think for players to get better, it's just about spending the time."
Brandi Chastain,"Number one, it was a chance to thank my parents, because they passed away a couple of years ago. They gave me so much by giving me the opportunity to play soccer, and I wanted to share the story we had together."
Brandi Chastain,"Nobody ever told me that I'm in charge of what kind of player I can become, but there's no limit to what I can do if I really choose to push myself."
Brandi Chastain,"Like anything else, you have to pay your dues and create a positive environment for people to want to come out and be a part of it."
Brandi Chastain,"Julie, Mia and I just met for a couple days, doing some work but really under the guise of having fun. We do events like the Women's Sports Foundation Dinner, where we get to not only do a good thing for the community but we get to hang out with one another again."
Brandi Chastain,"I was the kid who always liked to take the ball down to the school even in my free time, kick it against the wall, juggle it in the front yard and so it was kind of a perpetual state of playing soccer for me."
Brandi Chastain,"I was a part of Backyard Soccer, and I hear that I score a lot of goals in it."
Brandi Chastain,I think there are a lot of things that soccer does in the communities that transcend the soccer field.

Brandi Chastain,"I think I'd like to be able to heal people's pain, whether it is hunger, loneliness or whatever."
Brandi Chastain,"I played mostly games like Asteroids and Pac-Man. Today, when I go into an arcade, the games are much more difficult and complex. I don't think I could even play some of the video games that are out there today."
Brandi Chastain,I love soccer; I want to be on the field.
Brandi Chastain,"I have a 16 year-old son, so I'm now a soccer mom. I stand on the sidelines and I hear the things parents are saying, so I want them to understand what it is their kids are feeling in any sports environment."
Brandi Chastain,"Even major league baseball has had times when fans weren't coming out to the games, and the leagues weren't as highly touted as they are today."
Brandi Chastain,"And to learn, you have to be willing to push yourself."
Brandi Chastain,"And then ultimately what I tell the kids is: coaches can give you information, they can give you guidelines, and they can put you in a position. But the only person who can truly make you better is you."
Brandi Chastain,"And I remember how proud I was to put on my training jersey and go out on the field. Making it back to that environment was for me my greatest moment, because somebody had told me I couldn't do it and I never gave up on myself, the game and my teammates."
Brandi Chastain,"After the '96 Olympics, we all started believing that this is bigger than we thought, and we were willing to do the work. We knew that it was up to us, the players, to make soccer successful."
Brandi Chastain,"I went to professional men's soccer games, the old North American soccer league at that time, and I used to be a ticket holder with my family and family friends. We would go every weekend and I thought it was great, but I just thought of it as recreation, as family fun."
Brandi Chastain,"My parents and my grandfather on my mom's side would travel the earth. They went to Australia and China, and they went to probably every soccer game I ever played."
Pokey Chatman,"The truth is, we really had no transition,'' Johnson said."
Pokey Chatman,"I wanted us to have a little more sense of urgency because we had an opportunity to play for a share of a championship. It's nice to see us understand that, process that and come out in the second half and establish some things that have been good for us all year."
Pokey Chatman,"[Rather, if the upcoming LSU season is to be dedicated to Gunter's memory at all, it'll be in a much quieter, yet stronger fashion.] She's embedded in the fabric of all of us, ... and the best thing we can do is be the best people we can be, and if that translates into victory, that is so enough for her."
Pokey Chatman,"It was such an honor to walk out behind her and watch her stand there and look at the arena filled to the rafters. That was enough for me. Win, lose or draw, that said everything about her â€” when she had to coach, tape ankles, teach, the whole nine yards. That moment right there was something I'll always remember."
Pokey Chatman,She had that gleam in her soft blue eyes and that smirk in the corner of her mouth. That said more to me than any words.
Pokey Chatman,"At certain times, you get a player of her caliber, and because of prior star players, you have this expectation. And she extinguished them immediately."
Pokey Chatman,The bottom line is going to be 40 minutes of execution.
Pokey Chatman,"The 20-0 sounds good, and I'm not complaining at all about it, but we wasted about seven and a half or eight minutes before got to the scouting report offense."
Pokey Chatman,I'm not complaining about it at all. But we wasted about 7 1/2 or 8 minutes before we got into the scouting report offensively.
Pokey Chatman,"She looked so much in a comfort zone shooting that jumper. Ever since the knee injury, she's fought back to come back really hard."
Pokey Chatman,"Watching that tape last night, it's amazing the mentality (of Washington) going after the basketball and not just the kids that are five, six, seven feet away from it. It boils down to your base defense, and being able to lock in on it. Being able to play people head up and contesting shots and getting the block-out scheme."

Jonathan Cheechoo,He was just trying to get the goalie to maybe bite a little on his move. He froze him enough to give me time to put it upstairs.
Jonathan Cheechoo,I've gotten used to it and embraced it. Now it's something that I kind of take pride in and I enjoy speaking to the kids.
Jonathan Cheechoo,It was one of our best efforts. We've struggled in the last four or five games so it was nice to come back like this.
Jonathan Cheechoo,"Joe does a great job drawing double-teams and fighting off guys, and I just pick up the garbage in front. I just always play hard, and if it happens, it happens. ... It's amazing to play with him, and we're making up points against teams ahead of us in the standings."
Jonathan Cheechoo,"The first couple of shifts we sustained pressure in their end, and had good control. When you spend that much time in their end, I think everybody gets a little more energized."
Maurice Cheeks,"We all think that Andre is this veteran player, because he has played so many games in his first two seasons. We take for granted that he should be at another level, but he has to grow a little more."
Maurice Cheeks,"We'll work out a way to make it work,"
Maurice Cheeks,Sometimes you have to work with what you have.
Maurice Cheeks,It's great for us to win a game like this. Understanding the game is not over when we were down really paid off for us.
Maurice Cheeks,"It's always easy when you get beat to beat ourselves up. We're going to keep trying, keep working."
Maurice Cheeks,"The second half they just lured us to sleep and made open shots. Once we turned the ball over, they were into the break, somebody gets a wide-open three, and somebody gets one to the basket. It was like they teased us a little bit and then they go up 16 or 17 points."
Maurice Cheeks,"We want him to get offensive opportunities - no question. I think that he can get more opportunities in running the floor, getting early post up which he did. Tonight was a little unusual where he had more than a number of attempts at dunking the basketball going to the rim so I think that's a little bit unusual."
Maurice Cheeks,"We didn't make the correct switch. Whoever didn't make the switch didn't do it on purpose. This isn't about placing blame, it's about figuring out how to do it right at the end."
Maurice Cheeks,"Yesterday was a great practice with guys who came back like Johnny (Salmons) who was very good yesterday, and Kyle (Korver) and Andre (Iguodala). They uplifted the practice with the guys who are here trying to make a team. Everybody played pretty well. It was a great practice yesterday,"
Maurice Cheeks,"He looked healthy. He moved around in practice, so he's ready to go."
Maurice Cheeks,I like the way Kevin has been playing in practice. He gives a lot of pressure and does a lot of things that I like.
Maurice Cheeks,"He's kind of an old-school power forward, down on the block, mainly, can step out and shoot the jump shot. He's an aggressive-type player with some ball skills."
Maurice Cheeks,I've been over there before. We have to move on. You can't always live in the past of what we did or what we were. The Blazers moved on and I moved on.
Maurice Cheeks,"Allen is one of the few guys that can tolerate a lot of pain. If Allen can't play, you know he's really, really hurt."
Maurice Cheeks,"Steven has taken advantage of the opportunity, and that's what this game is about."
Maurice Cheeks,He killed us all night.
Maurice Cheeks,I don't think Allen is coming. He's not playing tomorrow night and we're still waiting to see how he feels for Sunday. It doesn't look good.
Maurice Cheeks,"Not everyone can be a hitter, or shooter, or part of an offense every night. There are some guys that have to be different things at different times and sometimes Andre is that guy. Certainly, we'd like to put the ball in his hands a little more."
Maurice Cheeks,They knew we played an overtime game last night. They came out pushing the ball and running the floor to keep us on our heels. That game was embarrassing for me and it was embarrassing for the players. It was an embarrassing loss.
Maurice Cheeks,He had some flu-like symptoms last night. He just came to the game and felt OK to play. It got worse.
Maurice Cheeks,"We've got to work a little harder, do the things that we did last night in terms of working and putting the effort out there and we'll be fine."
Maurice Cheeks,"Now, the margin of error is not very high. Mistakes have to be corrected right away. We have to eliminate everything that happened in the first half and start like this is a new season right now. I think we have the ability to do that."
Maurice Cheeks,"Well, there was never a question in my mind about those guys playing (well) together."
Maurice Cheeks,"We're going to spread it around a little bit. We're not going to be a one-man, two-man team."
Maurice Cheeks,Kevin is a veteran who has been around for a while. It's no disrespect to John. He's still learning this game. I told him that I don't want him to accept it. I want him to go out and learn from it and work hard.
Maurice Cheeks,Players have a lot of knowledge. It would be silly of me to say if they suggest something that I wouldn't look at it.
Maurice Cheeks,It's kind of been the same story for a while.
Maurice Cheeks,It's been kind of tough for Sam because Steven has been playing well.
Maurice Cheeks,When he got hurt in Memphis he was playing at a high level in the first half. We need him. We need him out there. We need his energy and certainly we need the way he?s capable of putting points on the board.
Maurice Cheeks,The zone hurt us quite a bit. We couldn't get any shots; we couldn't get any dribble penetration. We didn't make any shots and certainly our defense was not up to par.
Maurice Cheeks,We can?t rely on going home. We have to start building ourselves a little momentum -- take it one step at a time and take it one game at a time.
Maurice Cheeks,"When you see Kyle shooting the ball the way he's capable of shooting the ball, and giving Andre more offensive opportunities, and even Sam, I think we're a more dangerous team that way."
Maurice Cheeks,"They shot almost 59 percent. We always talk about giving up jump shots and that's really what they beat us at; a jump shot game. That's their game, pushing the ball up the floor, taking advantage of mismatches, and doing the things they do."
Maurice Cheeks,"We've talked about it before, of when you get beat, not giving up on the things you're trying to do."
Maurice Cheeks,Not at all. We just need to play the way we have been playing the last couple of games.
Maurice Cheeks,It's something that we've talked about this season in terms of (Iverson) being a team leader. The past three games he's been phenomenal from taking over the game to his overall leadership.
Maurice Cheeks,That's how we got back in the game. We didn't let them get offensive rebounds and we got some turnovers.
Maurice Cheeks,We had a lot of guys step up when (Iverson) went out. This was not a game of stats. This was about our guys going out there and just trying to play. Everyone had a part in winning this game.
Maurice Cheeks,"The game was such a seesaw game. We were down 16 points and it didn't look like we had a chance of getting back in the game, and then things started transpiring. ... Hopefully we can build off that (today) and let the emotion from that game just carry us throughout."
Maurice Cheeks,It is a tough way to start the game when you put yourself in a hole against a team like the Mavericks. The pressure bothered us a little.
Maurice Cheeks,That was a game-saving steal.
Maurice Cheeks,They're just fighting to get a second seed. We're trying to get a seed so it means a lot more to us to go out there and play the way we've been playing the last few games.
Maurice Cheeks,We're working. Everything we do is not going to be perfect. We just have to keep fighting.
Maurice Cheeks,"He (Howard) is great, young and energetic and always fighting. On that last play where a lot of players just stay put after a shot, he continued to play and ended up getting the big play."
Maurice Cheeks,"That one hurts. It hurts because we fought our game. We were fighting up hill all game and we finally get it and we are up one, ball out on the side and we gave up a lay-up. I don't mind getting beat, shooting a jump shot, but we gave up a lay-up."
Maurice Cheeks,"When it got to a certain point I think the fatigue factor went out the window, because everyone was playing on adrenaline. I know that Chris was exhausted."
Maurice Cheeks,"When you play a team that has come back and beat you each time in some form or fashion, it can play little mind games on you."
Maurice Cheeks,"The zone hurt us quite a bit. It was poor, poor execution against the zone in the fourth quarter. We couldn't make a shot and they never went back to man-to-man. They stayed with the zone and packed it in."
Maurice Cheeks,Their execution down the stretch was the key. They advanced the ball quicker up the court than what we're normally used to.
Maurice Cheeks,This was a heck of a win. Everyone fought hard for us all game. This game was a prime example of a team effort to not lose a game.
Maurice Cheeks,"When a guy has to sit for whatever reason, another guys steps in. Michael Bradley's a prime example. He's been impressive. He has pretty much taken advantage of an opportunity with guys being out."
Maurice Cheeks,"The essence of this game is they played harder than we did. Our energy was great [Wednesday] night. Tonight, our energy was low. We can't use having back-to-back games as an excuse."
Maurice Cheeks,Our energy got us back in the game. But you've got to play perfect when you get down 28 points or so.
Maurice Cheeks,"They don't usually push that type of tempo for 48 minutes, but they did to have us expend some energy. We got back in the game a little bit, but never really threatened enough to have a chance."
Maurice Cheeks,"It was high energy. He hadn't touched a ball for a week, so it took him a minute to get his rhythm. Once he did, we kind of took off. Then, he was doing the things he always does."
Maurice Cheeks,All the emotion is gone now. This was not the way I wanted get the season started.
Maurice Cheeks,I don't think I had any doubt about them playing together. The reason you put the ball in their hands is because they make plays.
Maurice Cheeks,"That's not the best defense you can play. Our defense just has to get better in order for us to win games. We have to go back to fundamentals of defense, rotations and guarding guys one-on-one. You have to want to play defense."
Maurice Cheeks,"For three quarters, our defense was very good tonight."
Maurice Cheeks,"Our defense is a lot better with Sam in the game, because he can block shots and rebound the ball. They're a jump-shooting team, with the exception of Harrington. We just have to get better in all areas defensively."
Maurice Cheeks,"Our defense wasn't as good as it has been, but he was making some incredible shots. He kept them in the game."
Maurice Cheeks,"They're better at their game than we are at stopping it. Our defense was not great, but I thought our rotations were good. They continued to pass the ball, and [consequently] we had to guard them for 24 seconds [per possession], and that can beat you down."
Maurice Cheeks,"They just controlling the game and our defense was not that good. Everyone that we had out on the floor was not playing defense. I tried to insert some guys that were going to give us a little energy, give us a little defense and they turned the game around. Those guys that I put in there helped us get back in the game. Everyone that came in the game had a part in the victory."
Maurice Cheeks,"We've had that conversation quite a bit [about being more aggressive]. He's a willing passer, and a guy who can score. He's a young player finding his way in this league. As time goes on, he'll be that type of player [who scores]. Right now, he picks and chooses."
Maurice Cheeks,"We had a conversation and they were very apologetic. They were sorry that this all has taken place, as I am."
Maurice Cheeks,"It makes me look like I'm not in control, which I am, but it makes me look like that. It will be addressed and it will not happen again."
Maurice Cheeks,"He's got to control his ball handling a little bit more in being a complete player. He's not used to running screen and rolls. He's not used to rebounding the ball and pushing the ball up the floor, keeping the ball in his hands. He's not used to it."
Maurice Cheeks,"He's got to control his ball handling a little bit more in being a complete player, ... He's not used to running screen and rolls. He's not used to rebounding the ball and pushing the ball up the floor, keeping the ball in his hands. He's not used to it."
Maurice Cheeks,We're in that phase. It's been 50 games. We should have some consistency by now. But we're not there. We just haven't put it together. That's why we have the record we have.
Maurice Cheeks,"This was a delicate situation. My communication with Chris and Allen should have been better. I take responsibility, I'm the coach."
Maurice Cheeks,"Someone as respected as Coach K can lead them,"
Maurice Cheeks,"Larry is a defensive-minded coach. With the players he has, he'll try to get them to do what he wants. If they don't, he'll find a way to get the players he likes to play in his system."
Maurice Cheeks,We just don't do enough. We must turn it immediately and believe in ourselves to be in the playoffs. We must defend much better.
Maurice Cheeks,"a lot of things ... about energy, getting out and being ready to play from the beginning. From the start, our attention to detail was great."
Maurice Cheeks,"They tried to run us from the beginning knowing that we played last night. They did a good job. We did get back into it late, but were never really a threat."
Maurice Cheeks,"Coming into a building like this, playing a very good basketball team like this, you know if you get up 20 points they're going to make a run. They had a chance at the end. But our attention to detail was big, from the first minute of the game to the last minute."
Maurice Cheeks,I knew Randy would be on someone's bench because he's a very good basketball coach. That's not a secret.
Maurice Cheeks,We talked about how we've been playing good basketball since the [All-Star] break. But we haven't been playing the full 48 minutes. Playing good for 3 1/2 quarters isn't enough to win the game.
Maurice Cheeks,That game was a prime example of a team effort and a team really trying not to lose a basketball game.
Maurice Cheeks,Allen has been playing some great basketball for us and Chris is playing like he did a few seasons ago. We need to keep picking up wins if we're going to be a playoff team.
Maurice Cheeks,He can dunk the basketball. You have to be a little creative out there. I think he'll do fine.
Maurice Cheeks,"I was very impressed with Johnny Salmons, his ability to get to the basket, to penetrate, make baskets and find people."
Maurice Cheeks,"It's unfortunate when a guy who could play like that and have the ability that he had is not be able to play. He was one of the few guys who could shoot the three, break you down and post up."
Maurice Cheeks,"He can move and come off screens. He's a different type player because he has the ability to step back from three-point range and make shots and he has the ability to drive to the basket. He's a bigger Allen (Iverson) with his ability to shoot. He shoots deeper than Allen. His ability to get to the basket is in the same form of Allen because he looks to attack, attack, attack."

Cher,"You've probably noticed already that I'm dressed like a grown-up... I apologize to the Academy, and I promise that I will never do it again."
Cher,Words are like weapons; they wound sometimes.
Cher,The trouble with some women is that they get all excited about nothing - and then marry him.

Cher,Anyone who's a great kisser I'm always interested in.

Ben Cherington,"We made it clear at that time, as Larry said, that we hoped that it would leave the light on for Theo to return. The word 'momentum' has been used by Larry and Theo, and that's a good word. It continued after that [news conference] and the fact that he is returning is a successful outcome for all of us."
Ben Cherington,"That's up to Theo and Tito. It's hard for me to say after only seeing him in one outing. Obviously he has ability and there's a reason why he's here. There's a reason why he had the kind of success in college. There's a reason we made the level of commitment that we made to him. He's going to be a good major-league pitcher. When that happens, I honestly don't know."
Ben Cherington,David had a strong finish to 2005 and made a good impression in big-league camp. We simply believe that there are still things for him to accomplish at the Double-A level. . . . He's got a very bright future.
John Chernick,"She had to work a lot. I probably should have taken her out, given her a little break, but I knew she wanted to be on the floor and I needed her on the floor because she's like a coach out there."
John Chernick,"Coaching them is a pleasure. That's why when they come out and have a half like that, it's like you don't know what to do because you don't see it very often."
John Chernick,We challenged the girls at halftime to step up.
John Chernick,"We've been a streaky shooting team all year. When we're on, we're fun to watch and they're fun to coach because I don't have to do too much."
Lord Chesterfield,"There is a sort of veteran woman of condition, who, having lived always in the grand monde, and having possibly had some gallantries, together with the experience of five and twenty or thirty years, form a young fellow better than all the rules that can be given him. Wherever you go, make some of those women your friends; which a very little matter will do. Ask their advice, tell them your doubts or difficulties as to your behavior; but take great care not to drop one word of their experience; for experience implies age, and the suspicion of age, no woman, let her be ever so old, ever forgives."

Lord Chesterfield,"Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it forever. It implies a discovery of weakness, which we are more careful to conceal than a crime.

Lord Chesterfield,"A weak mind is like a microscope, which magnifies trifling things, but cannot receive great ones."

Lord Chesterfield,"Vice, in its true light, is so deformed, that it shocks us at first sight; and would hardly ever seduce us, if it did not at first wear the mask of some virtue."
Lord Chesterfield,"The less one has to do, the less time one finds to do it in."
Lord Chesterfield,"The difference between a man of sense and a fop is that the fop values himself upon his dress; and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time he knows he must not neglect it."

Lord Chesterfield,Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.
Lord Chesterfield,"Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable. However, they who aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable."
Lord Chesterfield,"Persist and persevere, and you will find most things that are attainable, possible."

Lord Chesterfield,"Honest error is to be pitied, not ridiculed."
Lord Chesterfield,"Wit is so shining a quality that everybody admires it; most people aim at it, all people fear it, and few love it unless in themselves. A man must have a good share of wit himself to endure a great share of it in another."

Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"The average man votes below himself; he votes with half a mind or a hundredth part of one. A man ought to vote with the whole of himself, as he worships or gets married. A man ought to vote with his head and heart, his soul and stomach, his eye for faces and his ear for music; also (when sufficiently provoked) with his hands and feet. If he has ever seen a fine sunset, the crimson color of it should creep into his vote. The question is not so much whether only a minority of the electorate votes. The point is that only a minority of the voter votes."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"If you do not understand a man you cannot crush him. And if you do understand him, very probably you will not."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"The traveler sees what he sees, the tourist see what he has come to see."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,Silence is the unbearable repartee.
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"The ordinary scientific man is strictly a sentimentalist. He is a sentimentalist in this essential sense, that he is soaked and swept away by mere associations."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"Science in the modern world has many uses; its chief use, however, is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"Among the very rich you will never find a really generous man, even by accident. They may give their money away, but they will never give themselves away; they are egoistic, secretive, dry as old bones. To be smart enough to get all that money you must be dull enough to want it."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,If I had only one sermon to preach it would be a sermon against pride.

Gilbert Keith Chesterton,We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next door neighbor.

Gilbert Keith Chesterton,You cannot love a thing without wanting to fight for it.
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"The timidity of the child or the savage is entirely reasonable; they are alarmed at this world, because this world is a very alarming place.

Gilbert Keith Chesterton,Compromise used to mean that half a loaf was better than no bread. Among modern statesmen it really seems to mean that half a loaf ;is better than a whole loaf.
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"Boyhood is a most complex and incomprehensible thing. Even when one has been through it, one does not understand what it was. A man can never quite understand a boy, even when he has been the boy."

Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"Soldiers have many faults, but they have one redeeming merit; they are never worshippers of force.

The right (or what is held to be right) is in the one man who commands them."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"A building is akin to dogma; it is insolent, like dogma. Whether or no it is permanent, it claims permanence, like a dogma. People ask why we have no typical architecture of the modern world, like impressionism in painting. Surely it is obviously because we have not enough dogmas; we cannot bear to see anything in the sky that is solid and enduring, anything in the sky that does not change like the clouds of the sky."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,Do not free the camel of the burden of his hump; you may be freeing him from being a camel.

Maurice Chevalier,"A comfortable old age is the reward of a well-spent youth. Instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay, it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world."
Judy Chicago,"With my early work I got eviscerated by my male professors, and so you learned to disguise your impulses, as many women have done. And that's definitely changed."
Judy Chicago,"There's no question that many more women artists are showing worldwide now than they were when I was a young woman, and that's really great."
Judy Chicago,That is the age-old question: Is it nature or culture? We can't actually see what the real differences are between men and women because we live in such a culture-bound world.
Judy Chicago,"People have accepted the media's idea of what feminism is, but that doesn't mean that it's right or true or real. Feminism is not monolithic. Within feminism, there is an array of opinions."
Judy Chicago,I think what's important is to give space to the range of human experience.
Judy Chicago,I set my sights upon becoming the kind of artist who would make a contribution to art history.
Judy Chicago,I go to make art as who I am as a person. The fact that I am a woman comes into play maybe in the kinds of things I'm interested in or in the way I structure a canvas.
Judy Chicago,"I feel like I have at least begun to make a contribution, but my most significant concern has to do with whether my actual art will be preserved for future generations or be erased."

Brad Childress,"You always worry about kids going home to their hometowns. You don't know how they'll react. But we try to make it easy for them, and create the atmosphere that it's a business trip."
Brad Childress,"Jim Mora has an idea of what he can and cannot do... He has a firsthand knowledge of that, regardless of what he has seen on tape... He's seen him day-to-day for years. I think it goes back to them and how they want to play him. We'll play him the same way we usually do within the system."
Brad Childress,It's a Monday night football game and a rematch of the NFC championship game that he didn't play in. He will be ready to go.
Brad Childress,I just think we got off to a rocky start. But that happens sometimes when emotions run high. But he's doing a great job with the rehab and I'm happy to hear that. Nothing else happens unless the knee gets rehabbed.
Brad Childress,"He's got a big body, a long reach and big hands. He shows flashes, then he'll take a step back. He'll do two or three good things, have two or three good days, but you just want that consistency."
Brad Childress,"He has that rare ability to call on other talents when one might not be available,"
Josh Childress,"Things just didn't go our way. I don't know how else to put it without getting in trouble. It was a home game for Philadelphia, that's all I can say."
Josh Childress,"You can't afford to make any mistakes against that team. We played solid, but we made a few mistakes. They feed off getting in the first punch, and we didn't stay aggressive."
Josh Childress,You could tell they weren't playing with any energy tonight. It almost looked like they didn't want to play today.
Richard Childress,"We have to build 21 of these cars just to service 2007. It's going to be an expensive deal. But if it puts on a better show and it's safer, I think we all have to support it."
Richard Childress,I think some of NASCAR's greatest inspectors are the other race teams.
Richard Childress,"I think he'll have a great season. He's good with people, and he's a great race car driver. When he sets his mind on something, he'll do well."

Richard Childress,"It is not a money issue, we both want to get it done. It should happen. It's just a matter of time."
Richard Childress,"Many years ago, when I was just an independent driver sleeping under the truck, man, when you got to stay in a Holiday Inn, that was a treat. I've cleaned quite a few parts in the bathtub of a Holiday Inn in my time. In the late '60s, we'd go on a three-month tour. You'd have to build your cars in the parking lot. If you had an engine problem or had to build a gear, you'd take it in the room, wash it in hot water and put it back together."
Richard Childress,"I don't worry about nothing. I have a lot of concerns. My life is full of concerns, but I try not to worry."
Richard Childress,He did a phenomenal job stepping into the position he was put into.
Richard Childress,He was just a natural [and] did so much for the track throughout the years. We had a good friendship for many years. It's sad to see he's passed.
Richard Childress,The cars have changed so much from the days of Janet Guthrie - they drive so much differently that I think a lady with the talent and with the drive could come in here today and not only participate but be competitive.
Richard Childress,"I think it would be good for the sport. Three cars is a good number. I told (former NASCAR president) Bill France many, many years ago that one of our biggest concerns is when a group of car owners has five teams, six teams, all of a sudden you only have five or six car owners."

Richard Church,"You've seen a general malaise in consumer enthusiasm to shopping at malls, so that's been a contributing factor (to lower department store sales) and there's also a bit of malaise in terms of interest in leading (department store) brands.

Richard Cizik,I don't think there is less enthusiasm in the evangelical community [after Iraq] for transforming the world. Our focus groups show evangelical leaders have a big picture.
Liam Clancy,articulated what the rest of us wanted to say â€” but couldn't.
Liam Clancy,It's a magic carpet that can take you anyplace.
Liam Clancy,"I hate to tell you this, folks, but you're missing a wonderful television show tonight,"
Cameron Clapp,I honestly can say that I would rather be the way that I am. And I'm totally happy - than to be that guy down on the beach. He's having a good time and so am I. Life is good.
Cameron Clapp,There's a lot to be happy about right now.
Cameron Clapp,I'm not in this for fame. I'm in it to give people hope.
Cameron Clapp,I reached out to these guys and showed them my appreciation (for serving). They got to hear my experiences and I got to hear their stories.
Todd Clapper,"I think that this is the place to be. It's got a lot of support, we've got great facilities, and we've got a great group to start with here."
Todd Clapper,"They've been a huge impact. The strength that they have, it gives us a lot more options, particularly on the offensive end."
Todd Clapper,It's just a matter of us being disciplined on offense and reducing the amount of mistakes.
Todd Clapper,"It's going to take a lot of hard work, but I think that we can be top 10 in the national rankings."
Todd Clapper,"We got back to organizing things a little bit better. Sometimes, when adversity comes in a game, we kind of get away from what we're trying to do."
Eric Clapton,"You know, that's it, there's no turning back because what it's made of is so fine. It's like crystal, you know, it's like the purest crystal."
Eric Clapton,"Yeah, it is, because it's a real discovery of your inner resources, you know. That's what my character is all about and what my playing is all about. But to get up there and just go inside and draw out something that makes you feel good first and foremost."
Eric Clapton,"Yeah, I wanted to know where they got it from, what it was all about, you know, and it seemed to strike something in me that was you know rearing it's head and I still don't know what that is."
Eric Clapton,"Yeah, and I went straight into a fantasy world. Just stepped straight into the abyss. You know, I was gone and kids used to walk past my front room, cause I lived on the green."
Eric Clapton,"When you came knocking on the door this morning I was quite happy playing the guitar, for fun, I mean and not practicing and I'll always be that way."
Eric Clapton,"Very much like that, and very much a loner, do you know and I didn't fit really into sport or all kind of group activities as a kid, I couldn't find a niche. And music was not really part of the kind of village curriculum it would, you know."
Eric Clapton,"This moment in time, on this tour, you know, I'm discovering a lot of new things. And to be 45 and doing that, it's a mixture of pleasure and pain, I can assure you."
Eric Clapton,"They looked great, you know the drawings of the guys playing looked great and bits of string around their necks. So it didn't seem to be that difficult a thing to do, or that inaccessible."
Eric Clapton,"The first one was quite cheap, but that was expensive for us. For my folks to buy on the Never Never. It was quite, you know, a rare object to have and I gained quite a lot of status by having this."
Eric Clapton,"One summer I remember, I got exposed to Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly and Buddy Holly was a very very big, made a very big impression on me. Because of a lot of things, you know, the way he looked and his charisma."
Eric Clapton,"Oh yeah, I mean, it wasn't a very good guitar, most good guitars have got thrust rods in the necks that you can adjust or that'll keep them in shape, you know keep them straight. This one just, well it turned into a bow and arrow after a couple of months."
Eric Clapton,"Leave bands, go back to obscurity if I choose to, without a great sense of loss of security because it's all been based on the fact that I did it on my own or was doing, enjoying doing it on my own in the first place."
Eric Clapton,"It's very dependent on your state of mind. And your emotional state as well. And a lot of it comes pouring out, you don't really have that much control with it."
Eric Clapton,"It was a mystery to me, how the tuning was, or the style seemed to come out of nowhere, it obviously had roots in America going way back, there was nothing like it for me I'd ever seen before."
Eric Clapton,"I've got the god given talent or the god given opportunity better put, to let that out in a harmless way you know, and I don't know what it does to you, I don't really know."
Eric Clapton,"I mean, the sound of an amplified guitar in a room full of people was so hypnotic and addictive to me, that I could cross any kind of border to get on there."
Eric Clapton,"I mean, it didn't matter to me that there were people, it didn't matter that I was shy Just the sound was so captivating that it helped me to get rid of those inhibitions."
Eric Clapton,"I just managed to convince my grandmother that it was a worth while that was something to do, you know, and when I did finally get the guitar, it didn't seem that difficult to me, to be able to make a good noise out of it."
Eric Clapton,I don't have half the nerves there that I have anywhere else.
Eric Clapton,"Although they can do it all the time, you know, they're far better than me, on a musically, on a theoretical music level. You know, they're out of my league."
Eric Clapton,"A British pressing with a compilation of the best stuff really, I mean actually not only that but, these were all kind of semi hits for the people on it in America."
Eric Clapton,You were at school and you were pimply and no one wanted to know you. You get into a group and you've got thousands of chicks there.
Andrew Clark,"If you're not a gambler and are truly risk-averse, the speculative portion of your personal investments should not be more than 10 percent."
Andrew Clark,It was in the back of my mind. I was trying to get near that time or break it.
Andrew Clark,I have friends on both teams. I wanted to see how they responded to that kind of pressure.
Andrew Clark,One of the things we've been puzzling over here in the U.S. is that people haven't been dancing in the streets as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit new four-year highs.
Brian Clark,"Coach Dixon is always on me, ... I haven't had a coach like that since high school. He's after you on every play, and it gets frustrating. Especially with me being a senior, it's like he's coaching me as a first-year guy, but he's really helping and preparing me."
Brian Clark,"Every single route -- even if it's a clear route -- we're running it to win. You never know when you'll get that one-on-one coverage, Jay sees it and he wants to throw the ball deep. If you're loafing, not running your route hard, and the ball comes your way, then you look pretty bad."
Brian Clark,The Oliver site has a lot of potential uses. We've been hired by the city to rediscover its potential.
Brian Clark,We're expecting a boom when people retire.
Brian Clark,Whose life is it anyway?
Brian Clark,"The location is very unique. It's got a lot of history, tradition."
Brian Clark,"Had it not been for God's glory and this man's goodness, ... I would not be here."
Brian Clark,"All of a sudden I hear this banging on the wall and this voice, strange voice crying in the darkness somewhere on the 81st floor,"
Brian Clark,He's very focused and very smart. He's got very good control of his emotions and is just a very good logical thinker.
Brian Clark,I don't think any of us have lost confidence in Jay. We're expecting ... that he's going to be fighting to get his starting position back. That's the kind of guy he is. This makes him more hungry now.
Brian Clark,"I jumped and reached over and somehow grabbed onto something under the armpit and pulled the body over the top, ... and we fell in a heap on the floor."
Dick Clark,"If you want to stay young-looking, pick your parents very carefully"
Dick Clark,"We are pleased to be at the forefront in producing what has become the fastest-growing leisure sport activity in the world, ... We look forward to taking the tiger by the tail and moving this marketing phenomenon to the next level -- television."
Dick Clark,"I'm eager to enter into the meeting. Anyone that we do select, I believe, will have credentials, and we'll be able to show folks numbers that they want. I feel we have to do the best job we can."
Dick Clark,"If you want to stay young-looking, pick your parents very carefully."
Dick Clark,It's real good to be back with you again this year.
Dick Clark,"Well, I'm using a cane, so what? So what if they shot me sitting in a wheelchair? That's life!"
Dick Clark,Music is the soundtrack of your life.
Dick Clark,I don't set trends. I just find out what they are and exploit them.
Dick Clark,Humor is always based on a modicum of truth. Have you ever heard a joke about a father-in-law?
Duncan Clark,"National benefited not only from lower labor costs, but also because it is now closer to where many of the world's mobile phones are made these days, and that is China. Roughly half of the world's research and development, and production of the world's handsets, are in China these days."
Duncan Clark,"National benefited not only from lower labor costs but also because it is now closer to where many of the world's mobile phones are made these days, and that is China. Roughly half of the world's research and development, and production of the world's handsets, are in China these days."
Duncan Clark,"There has been an expectation of a revaluation, and I'm not sure what the reaction will be to such a limited move,"
Duncan Clark,It's been a great education. These effects aren't going to go away.
Duncan Clark,They have raw talent and the ability to throw people at a problem. It's hard to match.
Ed Clark,"We'll be watching as the storm approaches. If we see a service area is about to be hit by high winds, we will literally have crews loaded and sitting in trucks, ready to go."
Ed Clark,"Back in high school, I really wanted to be a diesel mechanic. I was building pools and it was still working with my hands. I was installing the (reinforcement) bars, shaping the pools and then they'd bring the cement in. It was great. . . . Then I had my accident."
Ed Clark,"I predict at least one of the rookie drivers will win a race this year. With this strong of a group, two or three of them will likely win."
Ed Clark,"It's hard to say with 100 percent certainty that we're totally out of it (the dry pattern), and it's going to shift. But it's leaning in that direction."
Ed Clark,"Because there have been no settlements reached for the securities action with any of the less-involved banks, it is difficult to know what reserves are prudent."
Frank Clark,Most smiles are started by another smile.
Frank Clark,"A child, like your stomach, doesn't need all you can afford to give it."
Frank Clark,Kindness makes a fellow feel good whether it's being done to him or by him.
Frank Clark,The reason there's so much ignorance is that those who have it are so eager to share it.
Frank Clark,"If a fellow isn't thankful for what he's got, he isn't likely to be thankful for what he's going to get."
Frank Clark,"A father is a man who expects his son to be as good a man as he meant to be, A father is someone who carries pictures where his money used to be."
Frank Clark,Maybe a person's time would be as well spent raising food as raising money to buy food.
Frank Clark,"Why not upset the apple cart? If you don't, the apples will rot anyway."
Frank Clark,A habit is something you can do without thinking - which is why most of us have so many of them.
Frank Clark,Real generosity is doing something nice for someone who will never find out.
Frank Clark,It's hard to detect good luck - it looks so much like something you've earned.
Frank Clark,I'd rather see folks doubt what's true than accept what isn't.
Frank Clark,I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it.
Frank Clark,Gossip needn't be false to be evil - there's a lot of truth that shouldn't be passed around.
Frank Clark,"Criticism, like rain, should be gentle enough to nourish a man's growth without destroying his roots."
Frank Clark,"We're all generous, but with different things, like time, money, talent -- criticism."
Frank Clark,"A man's conscience, like a warning line on the highway, tells him what he shouldn't do / but it does not keep him from doing it."
Frank Clark,We find comfort among those who agree with us -- growth among those who don't.
Frank Clark,The most important thing that parents can teach their children is how to get along without them.
Frank Clark,We didn't actually overspend our budget. The health Commission allocation simply fell short of our expenditure.
Frank Clark,There's nothing that can help you understand your beliefs more than trying to explain them to an inquisitive child.
Frank Clark,"Moving between the legs of tables and of chairs, rising or falling, grasping at kisses and toys, advancing boldly, sudden to take alarm, retreating to the corner of arm and knee, eager to be reassured, taking pleasure in the fragrant brilliance of the Christmas tree."
Frank Clark,A baby is born with a need to be loved - and never outgrows it.
Frank Clark,We've put more effort into helping folks reach old age than into helping them enjoy it.
Frank Clark,"If you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere."
Frank Howard Clark,A baby is born with a need to be loved - and never outgrows it.
Frank Howard Clark,"Many folks think they aren't good at earning money, when what they don't know is how to use it."
Frank Howard Clark,Maybe a person's time would be as well spent raising food as raising money to buy food.
Frank Howard Clark,"A father is a man who expects his son to be as good a man as he meant to be, A father is someone who carries pictures where his money used to be."
Frank Howard Clark,We've put more effort into helping folks reach old age than into helping them enjoy it.
Guy Clark,"Well, I had a fiddle that I really can't play, so I loaned it to Darrell. But yeah, he's from another planet."
Guy Clark,"Well, Darrell is a stunning musician. I mean, he plays anything. The only thing I've never heard him play is a fiddle, and I bet he could."
Guy Clark,"Things change all the time, and they'll probably never be the same again. It's just the natural evolution of the human condition. Things change, and whatever it is is what it is. I mean, you try to start second guessing that, you either get rich or die broke."
Guy Clark,"There aren't any rules, as far as anything-and that applies especially to writing songs, whatever gets the point across. So you're just kind of brought up to feel-in any field, if you say you can do it, do it. There it is."
Guy Clark,"Mary Gauthier's great. Yeah, we've played a lot of gigs together. She's really wonderful."
Guy Clark,"It's just something I've always done. In South Texas, the first guitar you get is a Mexican guitar. And the first one I got, the first thing I did was take it apart."
Guy Clark,"It was really amazing. I mean, he'd never mentioned that he played in the symphony, like serious violin playing, not fiddle playing. And he just blew us away."
Guy Clark,"I've known Shawn for several years. And he's just an amazing talent. He's a great writer, a marvelous, marvelous guitar player, and plays really good fiddle."
Guy Clark,I'm not a big fan of layered productions.
Guy Clark,"I love playing and I love singing, and the writing. There's kind of a symbiotic relationship between the writing and the playing."
Guy Clark,I just was apologizing for maybe being a little goofy.
Guy Clark,I have no reason to sit home and write songs all day without going out and playing for the folks. And I have no reason to go play for the folks unless I'm writing new songs so they can sort of feed off one another. And I just try to do the best I can.
Guy Clark,"I don't know what the outcome will be. I put a couple away for my grandkids, like that. So I don't know, who knows? Maybe I'll start building guitars for a living."
Guy Clark,"Darrell is really good in the studio. I mean, he has a real working knowledge of how the process works, and what sounds good coming back over tape, and how the stuff works together."
Guy Clark,"Chris is the engineer down at the studio where we do these things. And he's just such an integral part and he has such a marvelous ear. Also it turns out, we didn't know, but he's a pretty good fiddle player."
Guy Clark,"And it's just something that's always come very naturally to me. And I built about, I don't know, six, seven, eight guitars in Texas in the late 60s."
Guy Clark,"All gut strings. That's just the first kind of guitar I played, it was a nylon string guitar. And to me, it's the purest form of guitar making, and I just enjoy doing it."
Guy Clark,Ain't no chance if you don't take it.
Guy Clark,"But by the time you get there and you get home, it winds up being a lot of time out. So I'm getting the itch to build, I know that. I keep looking at my stacks of wood and what I can do with it."
Guy Clark,I get pretty much all the exercise I need walking down airport concourses carrying bags.
Jack Clark,"I think the team really worked hard for the victory. We weren't all that polished or accurate, but I think we worked hard."
Jack Clark,"I think the team showed some pretty good patience. We applied a lot of pressure to their goal line. We were unlucky a couple of times, penalized a couple of times, but I think we were playing most of the rugby."
Jack Clark,"Sacramento State wasn't the caliber of UBC, but neither was the team we had on the field. We made mistakes of inexperience. We're not happy to give up tries, certainly."
Jack Clark,This is sacred ground today. The price of freedom is truly visible here today.
Jack Clark,They sacrificed. They paid the ultimate price. God bless their souls and God bless America.
Jeff Clark,Four men were going to lose their lives over some cheese.
Jeff Clark,It's a culmination of your life of surfing when you turn and paddle in at Mavericks.
Jeff Clark,I couldn't be more proud of the kids. They just kept gutting it out. They made plays when they needed to.
Jeff Clark,"I'd much rather keep summer. I hate the cold, and I hate winter."
Jeff Clark,"That's what Danny does. Danny is a phenomenal player. Big games, that's his style."
Jeff Clark,"It's a nice, free air show, ... You're not going to get the (Air Force) Thunderbirds, but we have a lot of fun stuff."
Jeff Clark,Special education supervisors and superintendents have been meeting to restructure the framework of required classes needed to continue to provide a quality education for our students at a reasonable and fair cost.
Jeff Clark,They're all so infatuated with their own dogs.
Jeff Clark,"As poorly as we played offensively, our defense held them to 44 points. I can't ask for more than that on defense."
Jeff Clark,That was by far the best defense we've played all year. That was the biggest difference in the game because we never let up from start to finish.
Kevin Clark,"We are in the process of transporting rough 60 generators to Ft. Worth, Texas to our staging area there. Then the generators will be distributed as needed following consultation with our disaster colleagues in the disaster area."
Kevin Clark,"Asset quality has been real strong. Residential real estate activity has been brisk, especially in the Bozeman and Billings markets."
Kevin Clark,"We're in schools at least three or four times a week trying to teach students and parents about the dangers on the Internet. We try to impress upon them that the odds are in their favor. They most likely won't be a victim, but if they are, there can be severe consequences."
Kevin Clark,"I tell kids to doubt anything you see online. If you're communicating with strangers, assume they are a 60-year-old man drooling. As savvy as kids are, they tend to be very trusting and naive."
Larry Clark,"They made the mistake of trying to strong-arm a South Georgia boy who has been doing this for 20 years,"
Larry Clark,It's not worth it for Ford to risk one lawsuit. Water can get in and corrode wiring or the terminals on an airbag.
Larry Clark,"It blows his mind, my mind, his wife's mind."
Larry Clark,We're ready to compete with anyone in the country who wants to bring the film industry to Connecticut.
Larry Clark,the consequences and contradictions of French colonization in Algeria.
Marcia Clark,"Of course, I have to tell you, judge, this is a book about men against women, that is the whole thing, so he tees off on women through the whole thing."
Marcia Clark,Let's hope they do the right thing.
Marcia Clark,defense motions prevent it.
Marcia Clark,"He wanted to control her and failed. And in failing, found the one way where he could keep her under control where she could never slip out of it again."
Marcia Clark,"[On Monday, Clark informed Ito that the comments against his wife] could well be a conflict for this court in handling this matter. ... on the '85 tapes I think it is, and also in '87, Mark Fuhrman discusses Lt. York...and their run-ins at West L.A. [station] and he makes derogatory comments."
Marcia Clark,"The mere fact that we find blood where there should be no blood in the defendant's car, in his house, in the driveway and even on the socks in his very bedroom at the foot of his bed, that trail of blood from (the crime scene) through his own Ford Bronco into his house at Rockingham is devastating proof of his guilt."
Maxine Clark,"We are pleased with our performance and progress in the first quarter, especially since the first quarter of last year included sales generated by the Easter holiday. This year, the Easter holiday fell in April and is in our second quarter."
Maxine Clark,These stores are part of our strategy to take Build-A-Bear Workshop to wherever families go to have fun. We look forward to being a part of more ballparks and of enhancing that family fun.
Maxine Clark,"It's very much about friendship, and that's what we wanted it to be, ... There didn't need to be another fashion doll."
Maxine Clark,"Our store is about an experience. We wanted our store to be like a theme park in the mall, and that's really what they've helped us create."
Maxine Clark,We've talked to other zoos. This will be a great example.
Maxine Clark,"We know what the (Friends2BMade) customers like: They like pink, pink and pink, and they like purple, purple and purple."
Maxine Clark,"Our plan is always to open in the premier mall across the country, and we will continue this approach as we open at The Shops at La Cantera, ... We have had many guests who have visited our other stores ask us when we will be opening at The Shops at La Cantera. Now we will be able to reach even more of our friends in San Antonio and we are thrilled to be here."
Maxine Clark,"This book gives readers an inside look at how to create an incredible company for customers of all ages. Specifically, I provide the essential elements required to launch, nurture, and run a viable global company in the 21st century and beyond, based on time-tested experience."
Maxine Clark,"Our performance in both the quarter and for the year demonstrates that our business model is solid and predictable, and perhaps of more importance, that we have momentum moving into fiscal 2006. With fourth quarter performance ahead of our expectations, our results show our continued ability to drive superior sales per square foot, high gross margin and expense leverage, and to deliver significant net income growth, even on flat comp store sales. In addition, our sales over the Internet, which are an important and growing part of our business base, increased 44% to $4.0 million in the quarter, and for the year contributed $8.7 million to our sales."
Maxine Clark,"And, everyday is someone's birthday,"
Maxine Clark,"Baseball is a significant part of the American landscape, as are stuffed animals, and that is why this partnership with the St. Louis Cardinals is such a fit. The Cardinals are our hometown team and we have been working with them for many years. Having a store in the new stadium was the logical next step in our relationship."
Peter Clark,I am the decision-maker on this project. I have had no attempt from the outside to influence my decision.
Peter Clark,"The key is to have a vision,"
Peter Clark,"In the case of drawback, the rules are clear, and no monies are paid until a claim is approved. In the case of the duties relief program, the terms are clearly set out in regulations. CBSA does not impose penalties against companies who act in good faith on CBSA advice."
Peter Clark,"It's become clear that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, much of which sits on land that's actually below sea level, is one of the most vulnerable in the world to these types of rapid breakdowns."
Peter Clark,I don't think there's a lot of future for the islands in that middle Pacific area like Nauru and Kiribati because there is just no way an operator will continue a service into there they are very low yield routes.
Peter Clark,"Our new analysis of the ancient Scandinavian Ice Sheet, like other studies, is showing how these events unfolded in the past, which will help us better understand what the future will hold."
Peter Clark,"Substantial improvement in access to foreign markets was a main promise of the Uruguay Round Agreements. Canada has been very assiduous about living up to its WTO obligations. It has reduced subsidies - indeed; Canada did so faster than required, in part to reduce budget deficits, and in part because Canada always respects its international obligations. However, in general, farmers were not able to export much more of their products after the last round."
Peter Clark,"There is a greater emphasis on advertising and a greater interest in media events over which the candidates have the most control of the message,"
Ramsey Clark,A fair trial in this case is absolutely imperative for historical truth.
Ramsey Clark,"There will be motions made in court to enlist its support for a thorough investigation. It was selective violence calculated to destroy the ability of the defense to present its defense,"
Ramsey Clark,There are many problems with the legality of the court. The United States created the court. The United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the court.
Ramsey Clark,"Today we had further evidence. The court was chaotic about the half the time (with) two people, three people speaking at the same time."
Ramsey Clark,"Nearly two months after the brutal execution of one of their members and the summary execution of a second lawyer, and all this time these men and their families have been left essentially unprotected."
Ramsey Clark,"He seemed at peace with himself. He realizes the danger. He may be fatalistic about the outcome, but he's certainly unbowed and maybe when he gets into court he gets ... more emotional than he does among his lawyers."
Ramsey Clark,"Most faults are not in our Constitution, but in ourselves"
Ramsey Clark,"We never thought we couldn't come back in. The fundamental right to counsel is the right to counsel of choice, not to somebody else's choice."
Ramsey Clark,What you have is pure chaos.
Ramsey Clark,I didn't volunteer; they asked me. I felt a duty to testify.
Randy Clark,I was scared. I didn't know what was going on. I just woke up out of a sleep and everybody was running out of the building and the hallways were full of smoke and I didn't know what to do.
Randy Clark,"In reality, we lost eight players, because when your team is this small most guys go both ways,"
Randy Clark,"Our kickoff team played terrible. We made some mistakes which will have to be corrected if we are going to be competitive in league play this season,"
Randy Clark,"We're going to feed people as long as we've got food, ... It's been like a miracle, we'll run out then here comes another truck."
Randy Clark,"We had a lot of structure failure to the second floor, ... There was a lot of reaching in, trying to get water into where the hot spots were."
Randy Clark,"The Children's Miracle Network staff is very small, and they rely on volunteers to help make their events successful."
Richard Clark,We believe they will improve our earnings-per-share and ultimately enhance our shareholder value.
Richard Clark,"I miss working in narcotics, but I like the stability of working for the police department."
Richard Clark,"Most people are good people. Usually, everybody does right."
Richard Clark,Even the bad people you have to treat with respect. You have to treat everyone with respect.
Richard Clark,"There are governments that are building units, military units and intelligence units, to engage in information warfare. They are developing capabilities, they are building the units, and in some cases they seem to be doing reconnaissance on our computer networks."
Richard Clark,The e-mails are not as implied. It's like guilt by association.
Richard Clark,"We continue to believe we can generate compound annualized revenue growth, including 50% of the revenues from the joint ventures from which the company derives equity income, of between 4 to 6% through 2010. We also believe we can deliver double-digit compound earnings growth, excluding restructuring charges, over the next three to five years."
Richard Clark,You need to continue to work on your cost element. But you're not going to save your way to growth. You need to develop products.
Richard Clark,"I can tell you that reducing the work force by 11 percent, removing $4 billion of ongoing costs from the system and coming up with a new business model to me seems pretty competitive."
Richard Clark,"They (computers) run our electric power grid, out telecommunications network, they run our railroads, our banking system, and all of them are vulnerable, at some level, to some degree to information warfare, or cyber-terrorism,"
Richard Clark,"The company also anticipates returning to bottom-line EPS growth, excluding restructuring charges, beginning in 2007."
Richard Clark,The best current evidence is that media are mere vehicles that deliver instruction but do not influence student achievement any more than the truck that delivers groceries causes change in our nutrition.
Ron Clark,"We represent the reputation of BYU, and there is little room for error."
Ron Clark,It is not our purpose to do missionary work and expound the gospel. Our purpose is to expound upon the environment and 'feeling' of BYU.
Ron Clark,"This is not meant to detract from their performance,"
Ron Clark,"[The committee agreed to delay the submittal by two weeks.] As long as Dave is comfortable, ... I'm OK with it."
Ron Clark,It's extremely hard to hear the conversation.
Ron Clark,This gives everybody the opportunity to decide what's important to us as a community.
Ryan Clark,"I really don't know, ... nor can I really worry about it. One thing we know from last year is there's no telling who's going to play. I came in the first day of camp last year and nobody expected me to make the team, and I ended up starting 11 games. No matter who we put out there, he's going to be ready to play."
Ryan Clark,He played very well. You can't deny his talent at all. He was getting used to playing in [assistant head coach-defense] Gregg Williams' system.
Ryan Clark,"It's the first game, but there's no excuses,"
Ryan Clark,"He helped our team morale just to have him out there with the kind of enthusiasm he has. Sometimes people look at players and say, 'Oh, he's big-headed,' and this and that. But he just wanted to play and it really showed and he enjoyed himself and had a great time and it rubbed off on us."
Ryan Clark,The beauty of it is that I'm coming to a team that's already great. I just want to fit in and be part of this great organization.
Adam Clarke,Prayer requires more of the heart than of the tongue.
Adam Clarke,"[With 5 fabrics to choose from, consumers have the ability to buy inexpensive and lightweight cover for daily use or heavy material for long term storage. Some car collectors purchase thick outdoor covers for indoor use, so the cover can also be used when cars are out of the garage.] Some collectors use a separate cover for protection during rainy outdoor car shows, ... but Wolf Noah and Evolution fabrics make it possible to use the garage cover for outdoor use as well, so car owners can spend their money on restoration and maintenance."
Adam Clarke,"He who is completely sanctified, or cleansed from all sin, and dies in this state, is fit for glory."
Arthur C. Clarke,"We have to abandon the idea that schooling is something restricted to youth. How can it be, in a world where half the things a man knows at 20 are no longer true at 40 - and half the things he knows at 40 hadn't been discovered when he was 20?"

Arthur C. Clarke,I don't pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about.
Arthur C. Clarke,I don't believe in astrology; I'm a Sagittarius and we're skeptical.
Arthur C. Clarke,The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible.
Arthur C. Clarke,"Perhaps, as some wit remarked, the best proof that there is Intelligent Life in Outer Space is the fact it hasn't come here. Well, it can't hide forever - one day we will overhear it."

Arthur C. Clarke,The best measure of a man's honesty isn't his income tax return. It's the zero adjust on his bathroom scale.
Jim Clarke,"WINK called me up with the potential to do some freelance work and I was excited about it. I was nervous, but once I got up in front of the camera, I was very comfortable. The difficult part is in the preparation of the product, learning all the machines and the way (WINK) works things."
Jim Clarke,This season has potential to be very bad because we just haven't had a lot of rain since the end of November. We'll have to wait and see how the rest of the season pans out.
Jim Clarke,We are at the point where we have succeeded in accomplishing what we wanted to do.

Robert Clarke,"We welcome competition, ... Then again, we understand that we may be the only manufacturer involved. We're OK with that."
Robert Clarke,"It has been another great year for Honda in the IRL. We've faced increased competition from both Toyota and Chevrolet this season, along with the challenges of opening of our new facility in Santa Clarita, California. This achievement is a tribute to the tremendous hard work and dedication of all our associates at HPD, our teams and drivers, and our technical partners."
Robert Clarke,"Honda has made it very clear that our preference is to have competition. We welcome competition, but we understand that we may be the only manufacturer involved in the near term. We are OK with that."

Vince Clarke,I started writing songs at age 15.

Les Claypool,"Theaters are great. They're designed to sound good, not for basketball."
Les Claypool,The scene itself in San Francisco is just bizarre and non-existent for young bands and places to play... it's just so scattered now.

Les Claypool,New Year's was insane! It was the best show I've ever played for New Year's.

Les Claypool,I think Phish will come back. I just think it's time for a breather.
Les Claypool,"I pretty much built a band out of the most incredible guys I could possibly find. I didn't really want a six-piece band, but it just ended up being a six-piece band because these guys are all awesome."

Beverly Cleary,"With twins, reading aloud to them was the only chance I could get to sit down. I read them picture books until they were reading on their own."
Beverly Cleary,What interests me is what children go through while growing up.
Beverly Cleary,"We didn't have television in those days, and many people didn't even have radios. My mother would read aloud to my father and me in the evening."
Beverly Cleary,The exterior circumstances have certainly changed for many children. The world is not the safe place it was when I was growing up.
Beverly Cleary,"Quite often somebody will say, What year do your books take place? and the only answer I can give is, In childhood."
Beverly Cleary,"People are usually surprised to hear this, but I don't really read children's books."
Beverly Cleary,"People are inclined to say that I am Ramona. I'm not sure that's true, but I did share some experiences with her."

John Cleese,"Still trying to run a hotel and getting it wrong,"

John Cleese,Come to me. I want to plow you like a Calgary driveway at Christmas.
John Cleese,"The one thing I remember about Christmas was that my father used to take me out in a boat about ten miles offshore on Christmas Day, and I used to have to swim back. Extraordinary. It was a ritual. Mind you, that wasn't the hard part. The difficult bit was getting out of the sack."

Roger Clemens,"She was my strength, ... She was my will."
Roger Clemens,"She was my strength. She's always my will. She gave me so much, ... I'm just very thankful that she's at peace now. She worked so hard, she was really my mother and my father. She played both roles. ... I've lost a little bit of my fire. I don't want to say I lost any of my passion, because I want to pass that on to the kids."
Roger Clemens,"My legs felt fine, ... I still need to get a little more strength in my lower half, but I think Jim Hickey, our pitching coach, and the skipper were happy with the way I was getting out over my front leg. So it makes a big difference; without the burning sensation in my leg, it was a lot nicer. My control was still off, and I think that was what was aggravating me a little early."
Roger Clemens,"The process was long and hard on me. When everybody was out having a good time, I'm running trying to get my body ready."
Roger Clemens,My thoughts going into it was to give the kid tomorrow a little leeway and not have it rest upon his shoulders. We're looking at that game squaring our eyes right now.
Roger Clemens,"Teams were playing us tough anyway, but maybe more so after we got back in the race. The guys persevered, and this makes that trip back home a whole lot easier."
Roger Clemens,"It was everything I expected it to be, a lot of pride. Finally, everything's come together."

Roger Clemens,"I listen to my sisters who are living in Georgetown with her. They said this is different. So I've been traveling back and forth and I thought at one point she would be able to battle back a little bit, but this one wasn't looking good. I went back up there (Tuesday), spent the evening with her and most of this morning. I feel very blessed that she's at peace now because the last 10 years was hard on her and the last two to three days were grueling. But she was very tough to the end."
Roger Clemens,"Two split-fingers hurt my elbow like you wouldn't believe, and I've got a heartbeat in the back of my shoulder right now."
Roger Clemens,I worry more about the man's health than I do about him hitting home runs or whatever this witch hunt we're on.
Roger Clemens,"I think steroids are great for my mother because she needs them. To keep her health. I think they hurt the athletes. They make us break down and do too many things. We've already gone through the proper channels to be tested and to clean it up and, so, we're on our way to do it."
Roger Clemens,"We came back from so much this year, even more than what we did last year. I'm truly happy for so many people here. I'm happy for the city of Houston."
Roger Clemens,"For me, right now, it's goodbye."
Roger Clemens,"It's a legendary name, a guy that I've met on several occasions at a couple of golf tournaments,"
Roger Clemens,"I've lost a little bit of my fire, ... I don't want to say I've lost my passion."
Roger Clemens,"I wanted to thank her properly at the Hall of Fame, ... But I keep playing this silly game."
Roger Clemens,"We're looking at that game square in our eyes right now. That's the most important thing we've got going. So, you know, you didn't want any extra added pressure on Brandon."
Roger Clemens,"I mean, I'm 43. I can use that as an excuse, can't I?"
Roger Clemens,"I get my determination from her, ... She told me to go to work."
Roger Clemens,How about it? We're going to go see it. We're going to dance and do a little something.
Roger Clemens,"Then when the conversation is over and you walk away and you get home that night or you had dinner after you had the chance to meet him and talked to him, it's something that you never forget."
Roger Clemens,"[You want unintentional comedy?] Just because you are getting whipped, ... you don't hit behind somebody's neck."
Roger Clemens,"Come on boys, they're running us off."
Roger Clemens,"You know in 1982, the year we came in tied for 3rd, we probably had a better team - I mean as far as talent. When we came back the following year and won it, our pitching staff was a little more experienced and it was such a thrill."
Roger Clemens,"When I look back at the tapes, your first everything, your first All-Star Game, your first playoff experience, it just seems like it went by really fast."
Roger Clemens,The tradition you have at the University of Texas is like no other. It helped me in the future where I got to play in 2 cities that were rich in tradition.
Roger Clemens,"The student body was huge at UT and you had to mature pretty quick, very quick actually. I enjoyed it and it helped me a lot in my life in general - not only in the classroom but on the baseball field as well."
Roger Clemens,That might be somebody's only chance to see me pitch. They might have driven four hours to get there. I'm going to be out there if I can help it.
Roger Clemens,"Some of my finest memories are from my time at the University of Texas. College baseball, I love it."
Roger Clemens,My only day off is the day I pitch.
Roger Clemens,"If I get two strikes, I'll go to a pitch maybe that will help induce that a little bit."
Roger Clemens,I've lost a little bit of my fire... I don't want to say I've lost my passion.
Roger Clemens,"I wish there was a bar I could send opposing teams to and get them hammered or something - I could tell my buddies in New York to leave their places open or something. Playing for the Yankees, guys come at you extremely hard. I have to be ready or I'll be embarrassed."
Roger Clemens,I still remember my team at UT jumping on me after getting that final out against Alabama to win the National Championship in '83.
Roger Clemens,"I love to work with the younger kids who are trying to live out their dreams, if in fact that's what they plan on doing after college to take the next step. A very select few have that opportunity so when you do have the opportunity you know, those guys take advantage of it."
Roger Clemens,Going to Omaha for the College World Series - the people there are tremendous - huge crowds and a lot of excitement. I still remember those days - you make a lot of friends that you never forget when you win a championship like that.
Roger Clemens,"Everybody kind of perceives me as being angry. It's not anger, it's motivation."
Roger Clemens,"Every time I toe the rubber, it's no different for me than it was in the World Series."
Roger Clemens,"Even though I play a professional sport now, I love college baseball."
Roger Clemens,But I'm not looking forward to trying to strike out a lot of guys.
Roger Clemens,"But I got a guy on third, I was in a jam the other day in a game, all those situations, when you need a strikeout there, in big spots. But we are very aware of that fact, that these guys put the ball in play."
Roger Clemens,"I love this, this is why you get off the couch to play this game. I've been fortunate to have played in a lot of big games, but it's still exciting."
Roger Clemens,"We were like two tired old men walking out of the tunnel, and then we were like two kids having a good time. We were holding each other up."
Roger Clemens,I've been very fortunate. I feel very thankful. I've been able to come home and do some fun things and make it exciting for people here at home.
Roger Clemens,"I'd be cheating everyone here, the staff and rest of my teammates, if I wasn't able to stay on top of my work. It was almost like therapy, to come back and get in an environment I'm comfortable with."
Roger Clemens,"My main concern is when it's 2-0, I've got to keep it at 2-0. It gives us a little more of a chance. To give up four more runs, that isn't going to get it done. I don't care who you're facing or who you're playing, it's not going to get it done."
Roger Clemens,"I don't bat an eye at stuff like that. I've had my share of wins. If I worried about the games I should have won, it would probably drive me crazy. It was a fun game to pitch in."
Roger Clemens,"It was an exciting time for me personally because the number of times I've been to the playoffs, that was the opportunity to obtain the first ring. That was special, that's for sure."
Roger Clemens,"[After 41-year-old Roger Clemens struck out 11 Marlins last week, Florida manager Jack McKeon said,] Age is just a number. The way he pitched last night he probably could pitch until he's 50. ... I hope I'm upright when I'm his age."
Roberto Clemente,"To the people here, we are outsiders. Foreigners."
Roberto Clemente,I want to be remembered as a ballplayer who gave all he had to give.
Roberto Clemente,"Any time you have an opportunity to make a difference in this world and you don't, then you are wasting your time on Earth."
Roberto Clemente,"I always try to lead the clean life,"
Roberto Clemente,I am more valuable to my team hitting .330 then swinging for home runs.
Roberto Clemente,"Jamie is one of the most accomplished pitchers in Mariners' history, leading the major leagues in winning percentage over the last eight years, ... But it is his commitment to making the difference in the life of those in need through the Moyer Foundation that has made people see you as a great baseball player and a great humanitarian."
Roberto Clemente,"My father was the 87th Latino to be in the major leagues, but he was the first one ... to be able to speak up and become an activist against prejudice, not only in baseball but also in society, and that took a lot to be able to do that."
Roberto Clemente,I am convinced that God wanted me to be a baseball player. I was born to play baseball.
Roberto Clemente,"I will hit .450 if you give me Ralph Garr's legs, Johnny Bench's age and cut the travel schedule."
Brian Clifford,"I mean, we're in kind of a void period here as far as economic information and, clearly, you can make an argument on either side. So we'll have to wait and see."
Brian Clifford,We're on the cusp of another two years of impressive growth (for IDEC).
Brian Clifford,"We're on the cusp of another two years of impressive growth (for IDEC),"
Brian Clifford,"This is an exciting company, ... This is a leader in an emerging sector within technology. These guys are in the space called applications hosting. These guys are sharing a consortium technology and have explosive top line (revenue)."
Brian Clifford,"It was an extremely successful IPO, ... And I think the company is going to be a great company to follow for the next few years."
Brian Clifford,It was an extremely successful IPO. And I think the company is going to be a great company to follow for the next few years.
Brian Clifford,"These guys (are in the business of creating) enterprise software, the focus is on systems management. They've got a couple of catalysts in front of them, one of which is that on Oct. 19, they're going to launch their e-business strategy. BMC has had a nice move and might be a good place to play in the fourth quarter as people are looking to go back into some of these software names that they've been avoiding all year."
Mark Clifford,They've got a lot of pride in their running game. We've got a lot of pride in our running game.
Mark Clifford,They are going to have to make us turn the ball over and capitalize on our mistakes.
Mark Clifford,"They're all kind of blue-collar guys, you know, hard-nosed kids. All of them are very strong, take pride in their strength."
Mark Clifford,"Battling heat, the long preseason, continuing to lift weights, I think the kids are ready. I think mentally, we're ready."
Mark Clifford,We've had a great week of practice. I was anxious to see how the kids would show up on Monday.
Mark Clifford,The kids just have to step it up.
Mark Clifford,"He'd obviously been there a long time and whatever he was surviving on wasn't giving him that much nutrition. (He is) a big tall man, six foot two, six foot three, and he was just a walking skeleton basically."
Mark Clifford,It's going to be a hard-nosed football game.
Mark Clifford,They are a much better football team this year. Their numbers are up.
Mark Clifford,"They don't show a whole lot on defense. They blitz a little bit. They line up in the same spot almost every time. When you face a football team that doesn't change a whole lot, who just comes at you with what they have, those are the teams that are usually the strongest. They do what they do well."
Mark Clifford,"They've got a defense that's kind of similar to Berkeley's, ... They try to get in and penetrate and disrupt."
Mark Clifford,They've got a defense that's kind of similar to Berkeley's. They try to get in and penetrate and disrupt.
Mark Clifford,"He was skeletal, he was really emaciated and when the boys found him he could only walk and fall and stumble."
Kim Clijsters,It's a compliment but I've got a tough match ahead of me and it takes a lot of work.
Kim Clijsters,It's always great to come back against players like this. And this victory means a lot. But it's not over.
Kim Clijsters,"I've lost to her some big matches already, ... It's great to win some, as well. Any victory means a lot. For some reason, since my injury, they mean twice as much now. I enjoy it a lot more. I'm playing well. I don't think I could have done much better with my preparation."
Kim Clijsters,"Especially for such a big event, with so many good players, yeah, it was a quick one."
Kim Clijsters,I have been good in practice but not like that.
Kim Clijsters,My injury's not gone. The pain is gone because of the tablets I'm taking. So that's a good sign that I can be out there and play without feeling the pain. But I know that once I get home there's going to be some work to do.
Kim Clijsters,My injury's not gone. The pain is gone because of the tablets I'm taking.
Kim Clijsters,"I want to give it a go and I want to try as hard as I can to get better,"
Kim Clijsters,I've been happy with how I've played all summer. It took a while to get my rhythm since I hadn't been on Armstrong Stadium court in quite some time.
Kim Clijsters,The injury is healing well. The chances of me playing at the Diamond Games have certainly risen.
Kim Clijsters,"I'm not really playing for the money, ... I just really want to go out there and have fun. Since my injury, playing tennis means so much more because I really missed it when I couldn't do it last year. I'm just happy to be back and playing as well as I am."
Kim Clijsters,"I'm not really playing for the money, ... I just want to go out there and have fun. I really missed it so much last year."
Kim Clijsters,"I'm really proud how I came back to win tonight. I kept fighting, kept staying in the points, and I got her tired, as well. It means a lot. As the years go on, every big win seems to mean a lot more."
Kim Clijsters,I don't want to make excuses because I haven't played so many matches and that this was my first match on clay this season. I had trained and I was ready.
Kim Clijsters,"When doctors say, 'It's going to be very tough for you, maybe not to quit, but to reach that same level again,' that's very frustrating to hear. In a way, you hear it, and it sort of goes in and out because you don't want to keep thinking about the negative thoughts."
Kim Clijsters,"Having this momentum coming in is good for my confidence, it's helped a lot,"
Kim Clijsters,I'm happy with how I'm playing. I'm definitely not complaining.
Kim Clijsters,"You know, it doesn't happen that often that you have the crowd support behind you straightaway from the beginning of the match."
Kim Clijsters,I have a cold which I hope doesn't affect my legs too much. I will get to bed early and get some sleep before some light training in the morning.

Kim Clijsters,"The attitude that I have now, is, no matter what I do, I'm going to go for it because, you know, it could be over,"
Kim Clijsters,You can wake me up now - these last four weeks in America have been incredible.
Kim Clijsters,"I was not aggressive enough in the first set and I did not take advantage, but after that I put her under pressure."
Francis Clines,"It is lifestyle journalism the way Chaucer first invented it, and the Times, onto a good thing, is uninhibitedly publishing articles on the passing of a cuckolded poet, a rock promoter strangely addicted to collecting orangutans and an Italian writer striving to avoid becoming a bore."
Francis Clines,Britain's gnawing hunger for retrospection is of Proustian proportions; historical confections of past glory are always being sugared up and nibbled at somewhere in the land.

Bill Clinton,that's still by far a bigger threat to our security.
Bill Clinton,"I am often troubled as I try hard here to create a new sense of common purpose. . . . And I have felt in the last several months during my presidency that we oftentimes get so caught up in the battle of the moment, the heat of the moment -- how are you going to answer this charge, and make that change, or deal with this difficulty -- that sometimes we forget that we are all in this because we are seeking a good that helps all Americans."
Bill Clinton,Supporters of capital punishment bear a special responsibility to ensure the fairness of this irreversible punishment.

Given the explosive growth in the use of the World Wide Web for publishing, electronic commerce, lifelong learning and the delivery of government services, it is vital that the Web be accessible to everyone."
Bill Clinton,"I worry about all these grand ideas we promote here benefiting ordinary people. If they don't perceive that these grand ideas work in their lives, they won't develop a higher consciousness of the issues at stake."
Bill Clinton,"My days in this office are nearly through, but my days of service, I hope, are not."
Bill Clinton,"The talks at Camp David were revolutionary in their detail, their directness and their honesty."
Bill Clinton,"Sometimes when people are under stress, they hate to think, and it's the time when they most need to think."
Bill Clinton,"In our shock and grief one thing must remain clear, hate and prejudice are not American values. The public outrage in Laramie and all across America today echoes what we heard at the White House Conference on Hate Crimes last year -- there is something we can do about this, Congress needs to pass our tough Hate Crimes Legislation. It can do so even before it adjourns and it should do so."
Bill Clinton,I have news for the forces of greed and the defenders of the status quo; your time has come and gone. It's time for change in America.

Bill Clinton,"When first graders shoot first graders, it's time for Congress to do what's right for America's families."
Bill Clinton,will give some guidance to our members of Congress.

Bill Clinton,"You can't have an emergency plan that works if it only affects middle class people up, and when you tell people to go do something they don't have the means to do, you're going to leave the poor out."
Bill Clinton,"If ever there was a doubt about the importance of exercising the most fundamental right of citizenship, it was clearly answered by the first presidential election of the 21st century."

Bill Clinton,"I've reached an age now where it doesn't matter whatever happens to me. I just don't want anyone to die before their time. I've asked you here because I think all of us have an unprecedented power to solve problems, save lives and help people see the future."
Bill Clinton,"You live in the age of interdependence. Borders don't count for much or stop much, good or bad, anymore."
Bill Clinton,"The first ruling was that (Canadian softwood producers had) an advantage, but that the 18 per cent tariff was too high. At that point, I think a deal should have been made."
Bill Clinton,"Pre-emptive action today may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future because -- and I have ordered this kind of action -- I don't care how precise your bombs and weapons are, when you set them off innocent people die."
Bill Clinton,I'm somewhat suspicious of anybody's ability to motivate anybody else except by just being who they are and telling their story. That's what I'm sure Lance did earlier. And yet I've always wished I could do more to help other people tell their stories.
Hilary Clinton,She was not telling the truth.
Hilary Clinton,We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society.
Hilary Clinton,"The candidates we have in this campaign are... the most accomplished, in terms of public service, that we've had since 1960. One of them will be successful."
Hilary Clinton,"The track record of this administration on homeland security, its inadequate funding, its bureaucratic dysfunction at the Department of Homeland Security, as evidenced most tragically in [hurricane] Katrina but in many other similar instÂ­ances over the past four and a half years, does not create an atmosphere of confidence."
Hilary Clinton,"Putting Mary Gall in charge of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is like hiring a lifeguard who doesn't like to swim, ...

Hilary Clinton,Probably my worst quality is that I get very passionate about what I think is right.

Hilary Clinton,"the Palestinians and Israelis stand at a crossroads, ready to make hard decisions to achieve a just and lasting peace."

Hilary Clinton,"Every nation has to either be with us, or against us. Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price."
Hilary Clinton,"To me it's a failure every time we keep a child in foster care for that child's entire life. You know, there should be a decision made to either re-unite a child by helping a family get back on its feet and take care of its children or we should remove the child and try to find a good loving home with the foster care system but much more importantly, trying to find a permanent home,"
Hilary Clinton,"out of sight, out of mind."
Hilary Clinton,"[The president promised to work to eliminate the special education funding provision.] The Senate ... passed an amendment that would allow local school districts to completely opt out of class size reduction, ... The Senate used this bill to undermine one of our most important educational achievements."

Hilary Clinton,We cannot cede sovereignty over critical infrastructure like our ports. This is a job that America has to do.
Hilary Clinton,"Many of you are well enough off that the tax cuts may have helped you. We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."
Chuck Close,I am going for a level of perfection that is only mine... most of the pleasure is in getting the last little piece perfect.
Chuck Close,It's always a pleasure to talk about someone else's work.
Chuck Close,"Most people are good at too many things. And when you say someone is focused, more often than not what you actually mean is they're very narrow."
Chuck Close,I think most paintings are a record of the decisions that the artist made. I just perhaps make them a little clearer than some people have.
Chuck Close,What difference does it make whether you're looking at a photograph or looking at a still life in front of you? You still have to look.
Chuck Close,Sculpture occupies real space like we do... you walk around it and relate to it almost as another person or another object.
Chuck Close,I'm plagued with indecision in my life. I can't figure out what to order in a restaurant.
Chuck Close,"It doesn't upset artists to find out that artists used lenses or mirrors or other aids, but it certainly does upset the art historians."
Chuck Close,"I did some pastels and I did other pieces in which there was just basically one color per square, and then they would get bigger and I could get 2 or 3 colors into the square, and ultimately I just started making oil paintings."
Chuck Close,Sometimes I really want to paint somebody and I don't get a photograph that I want to work from.
Chuck Close,All the fingerprint paintings are done without a grid.
Chuck Close,Painting is the most magical of mediums. The transcendence is truly amazing to me every time I go to a museum and I see how somebody figured another way to rub colored dirt on a flat surface and make space where there is no space or make you think of a life experience.
Chuck Close,I always thought that one of the reasons why a painter likes especially to have other painters look at his or her work is the shared experience of having pushed paint around.
Chuck Close,"I discovered about 150 dots is the minimum number of dots to make a specific recognizable person. You can make something that looks like a head, with fewer dots, but you won't be able to give much information about who it is."
Chuck Close,"I love sculpture, and minimal sculpture is really my favorite stuff, but I wasn't very good at it, and I don't think in a three-dimensional way."
Chuck Close,"You know, the way art history is taught, often there's nothing that tells you why the painting is great. The description of a lousy painting and the description of a great painting will very much sound the same."
Chuck Close,"I'm very learning-disabled, and I think it drove me to what I'm doing."
Chuck Close,"I wanted to translate from one flat surface to another. In fact, my learning disabilities controlled a lot of things. I don't recognize faces, so I'm sure it's what drove me to portraits in the first place."
Chuck Close,Part of the joy of looking at art is getting in sync in some ways with the decision-making process that the artist used and the record that's embedded in the work.
Chuck Close,"I wasn't athletic, I couldn't catch a ball, I couldn't throw a ball, I had all kinds of physical limitations as well. So this was it."
Chuck Close,"At the same time that I'm finding the color world I want, I'm also trying to make the imagery, you know, by the nature of the strokes themselves."
Arthur Clough,"Good are the Ethics, I wis; good absolute, not for me, though; / Good, too, Logic, of course; in itself, but not in fine weather."

Arthur Clough,"Action will furnish belief, - but will that belief be the true one? / This is the point, you know."

Brian Clough,Anybody who can do anything in Leicester but make a jumper has got to be a genius.
Brian Clough,"Football hooligans - well, there are 92 club chairmen for a start."
Brian Clough,"If God had wanted us to play football in the sky, He'd have put grass up there."
Brian Clough,We used to go to the pictures every Saturday night but we had to leave a little bit early and get home and watch Match of the Day - and my wife still complains she missed the last five minutes of every film we saw.
Brian Clough,That Seaman is a handsome young man but he spends too much time looking in his mirror rather than at the ball. You can't keep goal with hair like that.
Brian Clough,"I like my women to be feminine, not sliding into tackles and covered in mud."
Brian Clough,On occasions I have been big-headed. I think most people are when they get in the limelight. I call myself Big Head just to remind myself not to be.
Brian Clough,"I want no epitaphs of profound history and all that type of thing. I contributed. I would hope they would say that, and I would hope somebody liked me."
Brian Clough,I wouldn't say I was the best manager in the business. But I was in the top one.
Brian Clough,"If I had an argument with a player we would sit down for twenty minutes, talk about it and then decide I was right!"
Brian Clough,"When you get to a certain age, there is no coming back."
Brian Clough,"I have no idea what kind of advice my father would have given me, were he still around. More than anything, I wish he could have been present at our press day. Then, everyone would have wanted to talk to him and it might have taken some of the attention away from us."
Graham Cluley,"Fortunately, you don't need special antivirus or security software for MP3s. If your antivirus is current, there won't be any damage, because the scanner will catch it."
Graham Cluley,There's a responsibility on the part of regular computer users to make sure that they are not part of a DoS attack.
Graham Cluley,"Companies should educate their users to practice safe computing - that includes never opening unsolicited email attachments and discouraging the sending and receiving of joke files, pornography and screensavers. This worm feeds on people's willingness to receive salacious content on their desktop computer, but they could be putting their entire company's data at risk."
Graham Cluley,This one's not the smartest tool in the box. We've passed the details on and the police are looking into this one.
Graham Cluley,"In taking aim at the music pirates, Sony succeeded only in shooting itself in the foot. What they did was not intentionally malicious. If anything, it was slightly inept."
Graham Cluley,But there are still a lot escaping justice.
Graham Cluley,A vulnerability like this opens the door for hackers to spy on your sensitive information. Users running the affected software should upgrade as soon as possible.
Graham Cluley,The e-Gold accounts may have been set up using a false ID.
Graham Cluley,It's funny to us as we're so used to worms and viruses being bad news rather than making the world a better place.
Graham Cluley,This is certainly not a disaster.
Graham Cluley,"The hurricane is a dreadful natural disaster, and it's sickening to think that hackers are prepared to exploit the horrendous situation in an attempt to break into computers for the purposes of spamming, extortion and theft."
Graham Cluley,There are legitimate Web-filtering programs that let you control which sites your employees or your kids visit. The idea of putting controls into the hands of a Trojan is a bad one.
Graham Cluley,"This is clearly a growing problem with serious consequences. They are used to deliver spam, Trojan horses, and other malicious code very quickly."
Graham Cluley,"Worms and viruses are increasingly being written to steal confidential data from innocent people's computers, to hijack resources, or launch spam or denial-of-service attacks,"
Graham Cluley,"Chain letters like this are too easily forwarded to friends, family and colleagues without people using their common sense. Stories like this become urban legends, constantly being repeated without anyone bothering to check the facts. Hoaxes and chain letters like this are not harmless - they waste time and bandwidth, and can be a genuine headache for support departments. Users need to be more skeptical, and ask themselves whether everything they are told by email can be believed."
Graham Cluley,"All computer users should treat any unsolicited email attachments with extreme caution, or they run the risk of being ripped off. Anyone unfortunate enough to run malicious software could potentially be allowing hackers to gain access to their computer to spy, steal and cause havoc. Users need to savvy-up to reduce the risk of being taken in by greedy, money-grabbing internet criminals."
Graham Cluley,I won't be surprised if Europe overtakes North America next month.
Graham Cluley,"In North America, [Internet service providers] are sharing more knowledge on how to combat spammers and are educating users about the problem."
Graham Cluley,"In North America, [Internet service providers] are sharing more knowledge on how to combat spammers and are educating users about the problem,"
Graham Cluley,Firm action is required by the authorities to send a strong message to spammers that their activities are unacceptable. The U.S. computer crime forces should be congratulated for catching someone else who was contributing to the menace of spam email.
Graham Cluley,Firm action is required by the authorities to send a strong message to spammers that their activities are unacceptable. The US computer crime forces should be congratulated for catching someone else who was contributing to the menace of spam email.
Graham Cluley,"A combination of technology, legal action, user education and international co-operation is needed to truly make spam a thing of the past."
Graham Cluley,The German police should be applauded for arresting these men before the alleged criminal plot was put into action. Computer crime authorities around the world need to work closely with each other to break apart these criminal gangs and bring them to justice.
Graham Cluley,"The German police should be applauded for arresting these men before the alleged criminal plot was put into action. The potential rewards for internet crime are high, and we are seeing organized international gangs becoming more sophisticated in the ways in which they attempt to steal information from online banking users. Computer crime authorities around the world need to work closely with each other to break apart these criminal gangs and bring them to justice."
Martha Coakley,"Women always did all the work anyway, so we might as well get credit for it,"
Martha Coakley,"The company got notification from the IRS that Michael McDermott had been delinquent on his taxes and in a fairly routine procedure they asked the company to assist with garnishment of his wages, taking a percentage but obviously not all to pay off his back taxes,"
Martha Coakley,"The allegations involve situations where the young men are attending a weekly class. Father Shanley is the pastor at the time. He asked for one or more of the students to come to assist him and talk about an instance -- and that's when the victims allege the abuse would occur,"
Sherri Coale,"You have to be at least aware of, if not afraid of, all the pieces. All year, our strength has been the number of people who can get the job done."
Sherri Coale,"If you can survive all that heat, you can exploit on the back side. Gary knows that. It's a risk he takes."
Sherri Coale,"After 30 days of practice and three wins now, it was not something I expected. I was very surprised there was a lack of poise from particularly my point guards."
Sherri Coale,"You don't think you're going to win by that kind of margin going into the Sweet 16. More than sending a message to other teams, it sends a message to us."
Sherri Coale,"I think that Baylor is clearly â€” and you guys gave me all kinds of grief for saying this during Big 12 play â€” but clearly they are the second-best team in the league. They finished in second place and they separated themselves, is my point, from the guys that where behind them."
Sherri Coale,"The Big 12 Conference lost a lot of talented players to graduation, but there are a lot of new names. It's kind of a changing of the guard. It is a very talented freshman group."
Sherri Coale,"If we know we've got one graduating, we're looking for another one. It's like getting a point guard or a shooter. It's a kid with an edge. You have to have some of that."
Sherri Coale,"She guarded, she came up with rebounds, she managed the game â€” she did all the things a premier point guard can do. I tell you, she runs the show."
Sherri Coale,This atmosphere and this environment was the best possible preparation we could have for the NCAA tournament.
Sherri Coale,What a great preparatory environment for postseason play. We're going to get all the energy and passion and emotion from an Elite Eight game that sends you to the Final Four or the atmosphere of a Final Four. It will be absolutely alive in there.
Sherri Coale,"Without a doubt, she's changed the complexion of everything."
Sherri Coale,"[Reunion] was so loud you couldn't even speak. [Saturday], during free throws you didn't want to have a conversation or chew your popcorn because everybody next to you could hear it. This is a beautiful arena, but it's really big. ... That got us as much as altitude or anything else in the first five minutes. We were just waiting for some juice."
Sherri Coale,"The absence of Marsha on the Texas Tech sideline is a blow to the university, it's a blow to our conference, and it's a blow to women's basketball."
Sherri Coale,"The absence of Marsha on the Texas Tech sideline is a blow to the university, it's a blow to our conference and it's a blow to women's basketball. It has been an honor and a privilege to coach against Marsha for the past years."
Sherri Coale,I wouldn't say it left a bad taste in my mouth. But I felt like it negated our ability to send a really resounding message to anybody who might be in our path as we head to our ultimate goal.
Sherri Coale,"I think one of the things that make a player so special and so dominant is their ability to make everybody around them better. And, as you saw on several occasions today, Courtney did that."
Frances Bean Cobain,My look is a Modern Bohemian type thing.
Frances Bean Cobain,I'm a different person. I don't want to be titled as Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain's daughter. I want to be thought of as Frances Cobain.
Frances Bean Cobain,I have 137 pairs of shoes and 200 pairs of jeans.
Frances Bean Cobain,I don't like to look sloppy. I'm a girly-girl.
James Cobb,The state had a responsibility under the emergency operations plan to evacuate these folks.
James Cobb,We plan on bringing in a band that played during the South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin on Feb. 24.
James Cobb,"They're heroes, not criminals, ... Somebody ought to be giving them medals."
James Cobb,"What people have to understand is, you're presented with a horrible choice. You take people who are on feeder tubes, who are on oxygen, who are on medications and you put them on a bus to go 70 miles in 12 hours? People are going to die, people are going to die, we know that."

John Cobb,"But we think the risk of a similar market hiccup late this year or early next remains significant,"
John Cobb,"The improvement is we're going to have a much safer bridge. This bridge is made out of steel and concrete, where the other one was made out of wood. It's going to be a bridge that we're not going to have to worry about again for a long time."
John Cobb,"Montana has a very narrow line-item veto as defined by the constitution and presented by the Constitutional Convention, ... I don't believe the governor can strike a condition without striking an appropriation."
Ty Cobb,"When I played ball, I didn't play for fun. . . . It's no pink tea, and mollycoddles had better stay out. It's a contest and everything that implies, a struggle for supremacy, a survival of the fittest."
Ty Cobb,"To get along with me, don't increase my tension."
Ty Cobb,Don't come home a failure.
Ty Cobb,"The base paths belonged to me, the runner. The rules gave me the right. I always went into a bag full speed, feet first. I had sharp spikes on my shoes. If the baseman stood where he had no business to be and got hurt, that was his fault."
Ty Cobb,Baseball was one-hundred percent of my life.
Ty Cobb,Every great batter works on the theory that the pitcher is more afraid of him than he is of the pitcher.
Ty Cobb,I never could stand losing. Second place didn't interest me. I had a fire in my belly.
Ty Cobb,"Baseball is a red-blooded sport for red-blooded men. It's no pink tea, and mollycoddles had better stay out. It's a struggle for supremacy, a survival of the fittest."
Ty Cobb,Speed is a great asset; but it's greater when it's combined with quickness - and there's a big difference.
Ty Cobb,"When I began playing the game, baseball was about as gentlemanly as a kick in the crotch."
Ty Cobb,The crowd makes the ballgame.
Ty Cobb,"I may have been fierce, but never low or underhand."
Ty Cobb,"The great trouble with baseball today is that most of the players are in the game for the money and that's it, not for the love of it, the excitement of it, the thrill of it."
Ty Cobb,I regret to this day that I never went to college. I feel I should have been a doctor.
Victoria Cobb,We're very confident the voters of Virginia understand the value of marriage.
Victoria Cobb,Those who wish to redefine marriage are resorting to scare tactics and making claims that have no basis in reality. Defining marriage is as uncontroversial as it gets.
Victoria Cobb,It's unfortunate that those that oppose the marriage amendment are using issues like domestic violence as scare tactics.
Victoria Cobb,The budget overrides the law. We have to target the budget and have language in [it] that prohibits that expenditure.
Victoria Cobb,It is disappointing that a governor who has spoken so eloquently about his faith has chosen to break his campaign promise.
Victoria Cobb,Our public schools should not sponsor groups that are nothing more than taxpayer subsidized dating services.
Victoria Cobb,"When across the country the demand for states to defend marriage is overwhelming, it's not accurate to say that people don't want to discuss social issues."
Victoria Cobb,Just because it took place a few days before birth shouldn't matter.
Victoria Cobb,There is certainly a belief that the state can never get enough revenue. This is a source of revenue no matter how unfair or how difficult it is on families.
Tom Coburn,"Today's misleading recommendations by the F.D.A. are the latest example where the agency has put the public at risk by providing inaccurate information about condoms,"
Tom Coburn,I know the tribal issues. I was a congressman where most of the Indians are in this state. The problem is that most of them aren't Indians. The average Cherokee quantum is 1/512.
Tom Coburn,"It is inexcusable for the White House and Congress to not even make the effort to find at least some offsets to this new spending, ... No one in America believes the federal government is operating at peak efficiency and can't tighten its belt."
Tom Coburn,I'm disappointed . . . that the president has not done more to demand that Congress and other federal agencies make the same sacrifices millions of Americans are already making. There is no charity without sacrifice.
Tom Coburn,"Charity requires sacrifice, and members of Congress could set a good example of charity by giving up their pay increase,"
Tom Coburn,the first legislation to pass in this country that will rescue babies.
Tom Coburn,"Everybody in America is going to have to sacrifice to help us rebuild the Gulf Coast. Every government program, every individual, we are all going to have to sacrifice."
Johnnie Cochran,"When I first started practicing law in the 1960s, no person had ever won a case against the City of Los Angeles for violation of their civil rights. There came a time when I felt morally I just could not try these cases anymore. I then left the office and my time in private practice has been interesting to say the least."
Johnnie Cochran,"These were tragic deaths. I think that people don't understand that we, on the defense, felt that very strongly also."
Johnnie Cochran,"Nobody has had the courage to say this is wrong,"
Johnnie Cochran,Nobody has had the courage to say this is wrong. You are empowered to say this is wrong ... Stop this cover-up! Stop this cover-up!
Johnnie Cochran,"Judge, the tapes are sickening, and you know...I don't know so much about conflict, but there is certain parts about Lt. York that I tell you what the real problem may be, even more than this, and this is a very delicate issue and I don't want to talk about this out here. It is going to have to do with credibility, because, you know, her declaration... this guy, unless he is absolutely lying... and Marcia will back me up on this, the contacts he has with Lt. York are the kind that are very hard to forget him."
Johnnie Cochran,has bruises all over his body.
Johnnie Cochran,We've got to be judged by how we do in times of crisis.

Thad Cochran,This is going to be the most expensive natural disaster that's hit the United States in history. It's really quite phenomenal.
Thad Cochran,"This legislation provides Medicaid eligibility to evacuees and residents in (Federal Emergency Management Agency) designated disaster counties, ... It also helps pay private health insurance premiums for those at risk for losing their coverage."

Bruce Cockburn,"I think if I really put my mind to it I probably did think I would be, but under what conditions, ... I expect to be doing this until I drop or become incapacitated. I don't make any more defined plans than that."
Bruce Cockburn,"We had close to 30 pieces to choose from and it was more a desire to make an album that made a cohesive whole, ... Most of the time when we put on records it's because we want that mood whatever it is. So, if you have an album that is widely varied in mood it might get played less than one that fits somebody's particular mood... at least that's how my choices usually work."
Bruce Cockburn,There was a lot more music than the size of the place would indicate.
Bruce Cockburn,"The second half of the '60s really was a kind of learning period, in terms of writing, for me."

Bruce Cockburn,"I wanted to play rock and roll when I started playing. Nobody at that time ever thought about songwriting. You sang songs, that's all. You sang other people's songs. That's all there were."
Bruce Cockburn,"I did a lot of writing for a lot of different kinds of bands that I was in and out of during those five years and that left me with a little body of songs that I liked better when I played alone, so I ended up going out solo and very soon made my first album."
Bruce Cockburn,"All I ever thought was, 'I'm going to do this as long as I can, and if I can't get paid at it, I'll be a bum doing it.' And so, here I am."
Bruce Cockburn,The trouble with normal is it always gets worse.
Bruce Cockburn,"I wear my shadows where they're harder to see, but they follow me everywhere. I guess that should tell me I'm travelling toward light."
Joe Cocker,"Yeah, one of the main ways is for songs that make me want to move."
Joe Cocker,"When I used to put an album out, I knew everyone on the charts. There weren't that many bands, now I couldn't even name half the new groups."

Joe Cocker,"Once you get into entertaining a quarter of a million people, it's a very weird place to be."
Joe Cocker,It's nice to get a response from the artists that I cover.
Joe Cocker,"It's interesting, as I said on the last tour in America, the audience actually came out, they had to have been the kind of fans who listened to my music via their parents, you know what I mean?"
Joe Cocker,It's all a matter of hearing what I like and seeing if I can make it fit into my style.
Joe Cocker,I've been touring now since about '68.

Joe Cocker,I was in Germany when the wall came down.
Joe Cocker,"I thought it would be good to keep Europe alone for a bit, so it's coming up to almost three years since I have played over there."
Joe Cocker,I think the only thing I would've ever been any good at was probably being a pub landlord. I've thought of that a couple of times.
Joe Cocker,"I only look at things in a short term of a few years, but admittedly, I reevaluate what I'm doing, and whether I want to continue touring or not."
Joe Cocker,I love songs that have a rocking and grooving feeling.
Joe Cocker,"I have sung to large crowds since then, and there is a feeling that once you get over 100,000 people, you kind of lose the control element, you don't know if you are really getting through or not."
Joe Cocker,"I have always been a sucker for ballads, but you have to be careful these days, you can't overload people."

Joe Cocker,"Back then, I, most rockers loved Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis... you know in the '60s."
Andrei Codrescu,"[l Description of poetry:] It's better to let others describe it, ... The language of Saje's poems dares the world to be delightful and I'm delighted to see it rise to the challenge. Guillevic once hoped that poetry would 'do to things what light does to them,' and Saje's poems do just that, waking up the plants, pleating the landscape like an accordion, giving fruits their Zurbaran-like precision in bowls of perfect sunlight."
Andrei Codrescu,the city that dreams stories.
Andrei Codrescu,"Two-thirds of what we call New Orleans culture is really myth-making, ... People feed myths of the city back to the city. These myths are now in pieces."
Andrei Codrescu,Cookbooks bear the same relation to real books that microwave food bears to your grandmother's.
William Drew Cody,"All my life it has been a pleasure to show its beauties, its marvels and its possibilities to those who, under my guidance, saw it for the first time."
William Drew Cody,You who live your lives in cities or among peaceful ways cannot always tell whether your friends are the kind who would go through fire for you. But on the Plains one's friends have an opportunity to prove their mettle.
William Drew Cody,"With the help of a friend I got father into a wagon, when the crowd had gone. I held his head in my lap during the ride home. I believed he was mortally wounded. He had been stabbed down through the kidneys, leaving an ugly wound."

William Drew Cody,"The first presentation of my show was given in May, 1883, at Omaha, which I had then chosen as my home. From there we made our first summer tour, visiting practically every important city in the country."
William Drew Cody,"Stations were built at intervals averaging fifteen miles apart. A rider's route covered three stations, with an exchange of horses at each, so that he was expected at the beginning to cover close to forty-five miles - a good ride when one must average fifteen miles an hour."
William Drew Cody,"It was my effort, in depicting the West, to depict it as it was."
William Drew Cody,I could never resist the call of the trail.

William Drew Cody,But the love of adventure was in father's blood.
William Drew Cody,"It was because of my great interest in the West, and my belief that its development would be assisted by the interest I could awaken in others, that I decided to bring the West to the East through the medium of the Wild West Show."
William Drew Cody,"Incidentally I felt sure I could make money as a plainsman, and, now that I had a wife to support, money had become a very important consideration."
William Drew Cody,I was persuaded now that I was destined to lead a life on the Plains.
William Drew Cody,The first trip of the Pony Express was made in ten days - an average of two hundred miles a day. But we soon began stretching our riders and making better time.
William Drew Cody,Excitement was plentiful during my two years' service as a Pony Express rider.
Charlie Coe,"It was a struggle. There were some positives out here, but for the most part, we're still trying to get guys comfortable."
Charlie Coe,"With the transfers and JUCO kids and if all these guys who have made commitments end up signing, that'll do it for our numbers. I think we'll have just a little room to do some things after the spring, but not much."
Charlie Coe,"I think it was a high blood pressure thing. We took him over there and he was being checked out, but his blood pressure was way up."
Charlie Coe,"It's just a stinger, I believe. I don't think it's anything serious. We just didn't want to take any chances with him so we kept him out."
Charlie Coe,"I think he's really beginning to catch a lot of eyes out there. He's just a little raw right now, because he's never had an experienced quarterbacks coach work with him. But you don't get the kind of interest he is if teams aren't liking what they see and what they hear about him. He's obviously impressed the scouts, and the teams are sending coaches to check him out."
Sebastian Coe,The international people tell us that we are taken seriously and that there is a momentum.
Sebastian Coe,"It is to create the best Games the world has ever seen by unlocking the UK's unrivalled passion for sport, by delivering the best Games for athletes to compete in, by showcasing London's unmatched cultural wealth and diversity and by creating a real and lasting legacy."
Sebastian Coe,"This represents a significant saving of public funds and we will strive to bring the same discipline to the financing of the games,"
Sebastian Coe,We have worked through a comprehensive agenda in a spirit of partnership and cooperation. We could not have started on a better footing.
Sebastian Coe,"Don't expect to see an Olympic Stadium up after Christmas, but don't also be lulled into believing nothing is happening because right at this moment, construction is underway. Work has started and it's started very quickly."
Sebastian Coe,This city provides a wonderful global platform to promote the Olympic movement particularly to a young audience.
Sebastian Coe,"I am delighted that Jonathan will be the athlete member of the LOCOG board,"
Paulo Coelho,"â€œWhen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.â€"
Paulo Coelho,"I think it is a problem of our society that we don't enjoy (ourselves.) We have these values, like, you have to be rich, you have to get a diploma, you have to work hard, otherwise you are useless, you are nothing but a pariah. And the book asks, 'Is it true? This is what my mom told me, but is it true?"
Paulo Coelho,You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen.
Paulo Coelho,Life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act.
Paulo Coelho,"No one can lie, no one can hide anything, when he looks directly into someone's eyes."

Paulo Coelho,We have to stop and be humble enough to understand that there is something called mystery.
Paulo Coelho,"There's a lot of me in it. But the character is more egotistical. I'm also egotistical, but not the way the character is. This guy is successful, he has everything, but his wife has left him. The most important value - love - is missing. What is wrong with this institution called 'marriage'? What is wrong with this institution called 'the pursuit of happiness'?"
Paulo Coelho,The biggest mistake of the man is that he thinks he doesn't deserve the good and the bad things from his life.

Paulo Coelho,Tonight his eyes were shining-he looked wonderful.
Paulo Coelho,"The Soul of the World is nourished by people's happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation. All things are one. And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."
Paulo Coelho,"When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream."
Paulo Coelho,"You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it."
Paulo Coelho,"But there is suffering in life, and there are defeats. No one can avoid them. But it's better to lose some of the battles in the struggles for your dreams than to be defeated without ever knowing what you're fighting for."
Paulo Coelho,"You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. It's just a matter of paying attention to this miracle."

Alan Cohen,"We will provide more information as we get closer to the opening,"
Alan Cohen,"To love yourself right now, just as you are, is to give yourself heaven. Don't wait until you die. If you wait, you die now. If you love, you live now."
Alan Cohen,"As may be expected, we found that CDH (consumer-driven health care) is a dynamic, fast-growing innovation still in its infancy. While early adopters have proven the benefits of the concept, the vast majority of managers have little more than the awareness of the general concepts. We have no doubt that many companies will implement CDH in the coming year, despite the steep learning curve ahead of them."
Alan Cohen,"Joy is not the result of getting what you want; it is the way to get what you want. In the deepest sense, joy is what you want."
Alan Cohen,"If you want to find God, hang out in the space between your thoughts."

Alan Cohen,"With half of Broadway audiences coming from outside the New York area and Broadway being the No. 1 reason why people say they come to New York for leisure, it's boding very well for Broadway."
Alan Cohen,"Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts."
Alan Cohen,"Live entertainment is really prospering, and people are demonstrating their appetite for live theater. The theater has become the mass art form it was decades ago."
Alan Cohen,"It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power."
Andrew Cohen,"The problem for Cunningham at sentencing is that he can't really argue that his many years of public service warrant leniency since the charges against him, and what he pleaded guilty to, go to the very core of the quality and integrity of that service. He's in a no-win situation at sentencing and he probably knows it."
Andrew Cohen,"What would it be like to communicate from a part of your own self that is absolutely free from self-consciousness, that is fearless, uncorrupted, and passionately interested in the truth?"
Andrew Cohen,The unanimous ruling tells me that there wasn't a lot of patience or sympathy by the court for the argument by the law schools. And I would think that this finally ends the long-running legal debate on this issue.
Andrew Cohen,People should be excited about the music being played rather than who's playing it.
Andrew Cohen,The judge didn't order the feds to suddenly release all sorts of classified or secret information. All the judge did was to tell the Justice Department that it has to speed up its response to a request for information about the National Security Agency program. And the information that initially will be released will be very unspecific. The big battles are yet to come over how much of this stuff eventually is made public.
Andrew Cohen,Freedom has no history.
Andrew Cohen,None of this means necessarily that DeLay is going to be indicted. But a deal like this only strengthens the government's hand.
Andrew Cohen,"Great Things About Being...' is a provocative and often dead-on look at stereotypes created by popular culture, and provides a tongue-in-cheek and satirical perspective that most anyone can relate to."
Andrew Cohen,"This scenario ? sending the case back down for more consideration ? was discussed at length during the oral argument on the case so I'm not sure that the parties here are terribly surprised that the Court would punt on the merits and perhaps avoid the issue altogether. The Court frequently does this, in cases large and small."
Andrew Cohen,"When you come together with your other half, you immediately experience a sense of wholeness and completeness."
Andrew Cohen,"When a human being becomes so still that they begin to lose awareness of their gender, and they are simply looking into that abyss where there is no notion of self whatsoever, the world disappears. And that's really the only place to go. It's the only place to remain."
Andrew Cohen,"We're making far too big a deal out of our sexual preferences. It's just another form of narcissism, and I think it can be a big problem and a tremendous obstacle."
Andrew Cohen,"Hopefully, America will really get a sense of how justice can be served in this country. And hopefully, they'll forget the Simpson trial."
Andrew Cohen,"It is not enough to be well-intentioned; one must strive to put those intentions into action in a capable way. One must consider the effect his actions will have on others. Looked at like this, to persist in ignorance is itself dishonorable."
David Cohen,It's still a fluid situation. It's still going to be a while yet before the free trade area is actually implemented. By the time it's relevant I would think some of these other countries would want to participate and the bargaining will continue.
David Cohen,"I think Malaysia can hold its own. The natural resources remain a source of strength and the record in recent years has been reasonably encouraging, so I don't think they have to be paranoid."
David Cohen,Our unwillingness to do a deal is keeping the spotlight on this original sin.
David Cohen,"I think that it is an excellent school, but it ought also to be a model for how to conduct employee relations, between an employer and an employee, and I don't think that it does that,"
David Cohen,"It will be a solid performance, given the strong year-end export numbers and the general strength already seen in the regional economies."
David Cohen,A relationship between MSN and AOL does make good sense for advertisers. It is a marriage of technology prowess and content.
David Cohen,Consumer spending should be able to continue to contribute as it has in the past couple of quarters. The labor market is in better condition than it has been in a few years and that should be supportive of consumer spending.
David Cohen,"The improvement in exports has been shared by regional neighbors. The electronics sector has been picking up in the region and the rest of the world, and that's one more sign that is continuing."
David Cohen,It appears the grand jury believed that he had no idea how severely she was hurt. I don't believe that he intended to ignore his daughter and what happened here is an unfortunate accident.
David Cohen,Chile is one of the wealthier economies in Latin America and they would represent a market for the products coming out of Asia. This region is increasingly the manufacturing center of the world and certainly that would be part of any agreement.
Gerald Cohen,"It's consistent with the view that things are not good now, but there's the potential for a pickup. The only question is what the magnitude of the pickup is going to be, and we're not as sanguine as [Greenspan is] about that."
Gerald Cohen,We're seeing slow but steady improvement in the job market.
Gerald Cohen,"Unlike traditional application integration vendors and the pure-play BI players, Information Builders has a history of offering an integrated approach to business intelligence and is the only vendor to take an incremental approach to integration. As more and more enterprises are faced with linking critical business applications such as BI, CRM and ERP, the ability to leverage these existing investments will make for more effective application output fit for business use."
Gerald Cohen,"The claims have not been low enough to merit cheering, but the direction has been generally positive, and that's the first step."
Gerald Cohen,What group often combines a keen sense of humor with bad taste? ... College students.
Gerald Cohen,"No two periods are ever identical, and we don't expect cars to sprout fins, but we do think that there's a good chance that many of the favorable economic trends of the 1950s will re-emerge in the years immediately ahead."
John Cohen,"Craig is not going to overpower anybody, but he did what we needed and that is to work at least seven innings. He threw close to 120 pitches, and we felt like he was very comfortable in his delivery. Craig is the story of the game."
John Cohen,They have a great combination of speed and talent.
John Cohen,"When you beat teams that are quality programs, quality teams, it means something to you."
John Cohen,We just keep making hard contact but we're hitting it right at people and they are making remarkable plays defensively. It just keeps happening over and over again so we're hoping the luck starts going our way.
John Cohen,We fought our butt off there at the end. Our kids aren't going to quit and they're going to fight their hearts out. They are going to keep coming after you and keep pressuring you.
John Cohen,"[The breakdown of emergency communications will be a key topic at hearings planned on Capitol Hill. Disaster response experts hope the Katrina chaos will] serve as a wake-up call, ... in the first major test of our emergency response capabilities after September 11, we see once again our Achilles heel is the total meltdown of the infrastructure we rely on for communication."
John Cohen,The hurricane disaster tells us that each layer of government has a role in responding and recovering from ultracatastrophic events and that no one level can do it alone. But Arizona is ahead of the game.
John Cohen,"Arizona is looked at by the feds and other around the country as a model,"
John Cohen,"I just love being with those kids. They love baseball, and we just have a great time together."
John Cohen,"He has really found a way to throw breaking balls in the strike zone. Guys start sitting on the breaking ball, then he blows a 95-mile-per-hour fastball by them."
Martin Cohen,"A 20 percent increase in the delivery service revenue is huge. It's the biggest we've ever seen,"
Martin Cohen,"Utilities have a legal responsibility, not to mention a moral one, to ensure that their customers receive reliable service at the least possible cost, ... It's the commission's job to make sure that happens. It's a matter of having the proper incentives, both carrots and sticks, to make sure utilities do the best they can for their customers and have a fair opportunity to earn a profit."
Martin Cohen,Any opinions I have are based on the same evidence that commissioners looked at. I haven't pre-judged anything. I don't have any preconceived notions. I have well-informed ideas.
Martin Cohen,We'll start with an open mind.
Martin Cohen,He told me the reason was that his family came to the conclusion they didn't want to move (to Massachusetts).
Martin Cohen,"Energy markets have proven to be volatile, unpredictable and trending dramatically upwards. This auction would expose consumers to all of the risks of the market."
Martin Cohen,"Currently, there is little or no overbuilding in any commercial real estate sector, and as the economy continues to grow and produce jobs, excess space is being absorbed, making occupancy rates rise. To build a building today costs materially more than six months ago or two years ago in most major cities."
Martin Cohen,This is a real crisis heading our way that won't be felt until the bills start coming. Our best hope is to get lucky with a warmer than normal winter.
Martin Cohen,"In fact, the first week out, my little suitcase with my clothes in it was stolen."
Martin Cohen,"You have no choice if you're going to live through the winter than to turn your heat on,"
Martin Cohen,My sense is that we have a lot of (uninsured) folks out here who would take advantage of it.
Paul Cohen,Now the work really begins. Everybody's going to have to have leveler heads.
Paul Cohen,"They capitalized on some mistakes we made, ... It was an exciting game, but we fell short."
Paul Cohen,"This was a game that just went back and forth, ... There were a lot of mistakes, a lot of hard hitting, and it just came down to us being able to get the breaks when we needed to set up in field goal position."
Paul Cohen,"It might make sense for it to be part of Ayer, because with Devens you'd have another community with no access to it."
Richard Cohen,"I wanted to kiss this woman so bad, I wondered how I would stay alive without it"
Richard Cohen,"I'm not saying Meredith doesn't cry some days. But the fact is, we're just two people trying to raise three kids; we have a normal household, with all the good things and bad things that everyone else has. We do homework with the kids; we yell at the kids; we punish them; we go to movies with them.... Yes, there are some tough issues, but we go forward and we don't dwell."
Richard Cohen,"She's a mother, actress and a philanthropist."
Richard Cohen,"Angelina Jolie embodies so many qualities of what St. John represents. She is strong, independent and dynamic. She's a mother, actress and a philanthropist."
Richard Cohen,"Like PACE, we at Learning Care Group are committed to creating educational environments that inspire a lifelong love of learning. High quality early educational experiences can have a lasting positive impact on students, and it is up to everyone in the early education field to see we make the most of the important role that we play."
Richard Cohen,"I did not realize I should destroy personal records. I may have thrown out some personal information that the fraudster was able to use to apply for an account,"
Richard Cohen,I did not realize I should destroy personal records. I may have thrown out some personal information that the fraudster was able to use to apply for an account.
Richard Cohen,"The leaders of tomorrow are shaped by the teachers of today. I am honored to be giving the keynote speech for an organization that has 50 years of experience inspiring today's early education and care providers to be innovative, thoughtful and motivating."
Richard Cohen,George W. Bush is a simple-minded but honest man who put too much faith in duplicitous advisors.
Richard Cohen,"One day I received a bill from a mobile phone company for Â£2,000 ($3,660) for a telephone bill and then shortly after that I was refused a mortgage,"
Richard Cohen,I was 13 when Dr. King was slain. I didn't have the opportunity to know him. But reading Taylor's books make me feel that I do know Dr. King.
Richard Cohen,"I suspect the fraudster obviously had my name, my date of birth and maybe my mother's maiden name. People do not actually think about what they throw into the rubbish."
Sasha Cohen,It is a little empty without her here but I have my own things to worry about.
Sasha Cohen,"Watching the Chinese pairs, I said, 'Wow â€“ that's real strength."
Sasha Cohen,I was somehow able to block it out and pull myself together for the rest of the program. But it just wasn't my night.
Sasha Cohen,"When a skater gets older, they become more mature, and they can assume more responsibility for their skating, ... That's how I've evolved. I know what works and what doesn't, and Mr. Nicks is a great coach for me."
Sasha Cohen,It's our responsibility to be a good role model and to carry ourselves in a way that would make our country proud.
Sasha Cohen,"I've been training very hard and very well, ... I've been nailing 99 percent of what I do in practice. That gave me the confidence to do this. I expected to skate well."
Sasha Cohen,"It's bittersweet. I tried hard, I have no regrets. For that performance, silver is generous."
Sasha Cohen,"I think it was a gift. For that performance, silver is generous."
Sasha Cohen,"My mom and her parents had to leave because her brother had left a couple of years before and the government was really upset. They took away both my grandparents' jobs, so they couldn't make a living. They had to sell all their things. They weren't allowed to take more than $500 out of the country."
Sasha Cohen,I was able to believe when everything looked really dark and gray. I had a little break where the music carried me through. I love the music and performing this program. It's always so special to me no matter what happens. It goes beyond an athletic event and just becomes an emotional experience. I was able to attack the rest of the program.
Sasha Cohen,"I wasn't raised going to synagogue. My mother wasn't brought up with that, so I wasn't brought up with it."
Sasha Cohen,"My big weaknesses (in the past) have been a lack of preparation, a lack of knowledge and perhaps not enough confidence and afraid of mistakes. I need to stop trying to be perfect and just worry about becoming better."
Sasha Cohen,"John was sick of having little girls in pink dresses who were just trying their best. He would try to create controversy. It was not always good for me, but it was fun for him."
Sasha Cohen,I think it's hard for the girls here and everyone who's worked so hard to make the Olympic team.
Sasha Cohen,It's hard for the girls here and everybody has worked so hard to earn a spot on the team. But it's the U.S. Olympic Committee's job to pick the three skaters who have the best chance at the Olympics.
Sasha Cohen,"It is a little weird without her here. It's kind of like me and all these little girls. It's a little empty without her here, but I've got some of my own things to worry about right now."
Sasha Cohen,It feels a little weird without Michelle. Just me and all these little girls.
Sasha Cohen,I celebrate Hanukkah. Anything with gifts is good.
Sasha Cohen,"It's not like it would be a stretch, and hopefully I'll get to be funny. There are a lot of characters in skating."
Sasha Cohen,I'm going to take in tonight. It's a very strong competition. I'm going to take it one day at a time and do the same thing as I did tonight (in the free skate).
Sasha Cohen,"It's kind of interesting, because usually she's always there. She never withdraws. But you never know if your body is going to be there tomorrow."
Sasha Cohen,"I really enjoyed the performance tonight, and I've had a whole week of unknowns, being in bed with the flu. Ice is slippery, and anything can happen to anybody. I have seen that at numerous events. I am going to have fun out there and trust my training and not worry. I have figured out that worry doesn't help."
Sasha Cohen,I would never let myself believe that. I'm a strong athlete and I definitely believe I'm getting stronger.
Sasha Cohen,"The night before I compete, I like to have steak. Meat is especially important for female athletes because it provides them with the nutrients they need to perform at their best."
Sasha Cohen,Skating has always been a major area of interest to me.
Sasha Cohen,My training has been going really well these past few days and my goal is to keep it up for the next few weeks and hopefully earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.
Sasha Cohen,"My family has always been there to support me along the way. My coach, John Nicks, is a great influence."
Sasha Cohen,My academic schedule is lighter this year because it's an Olympic year.
Sasha Cohen,"I'm used to a very busy schedule. Right now it revolves around training and preparing for Nationals in January. I'm usually at the rink from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m. and then I attend public school for two hours, three times per week."
Sasha Cohen,I worked with my coach to develop some new spiral variations to make my program more interesting. Each one is different and you'll have to wait until January to see them.
Sasha Cohen,"I want to be the first lady to land a quadruple jump in competition. As I grow older, I know that my skating style will develop and mature."
Sasha Cohen,I skate about 15 to 20 hours a week and also incorporate a lot of off-ice training. I take ballet and Pilates classes and lift weights with my physical therapist when I'm not on the ice.
Sasha Cohen,"I hope to show girls that eating smart, without giving up their favorite foods, can help them be their best in all areas of their lives."
Sasha Cohen,"Ice is maintenance. When you get to be my age, with six or seven years competing at the senior level, you have to take care of your body. It's not brand new."
Sasha Cohen,I'm a competitive person and I love the challenge of mastering new things.
Sasha Cohen,"Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle."
Sasha Cohen,"I eat a variety of foods like vegetables, fruit and beef for protein and iron."
Sasha Cohen,A year ago I had a back injury and followed a good nutrition program to help speed up my recovery. I focused on exercise and staying healthy in order to get back out on the ice.
Seth Cohen,I kind of like him this way. He's a better listener.
Seth Cohen,"We're waiting for the direction from Microsoft. Without it, it's hard to know how to build your next products."
Seth Cohen,Michael usually draws in a crowd variety with a lot of college students.
Stanley Cohen,We've seen a good response in 40 percent of patients studied. Patients reported they have less pain and feel better overall. They significantly improved in measures of physical disability.
Stanley Cohen,"In 1976 I was appointed an American Cancer Society Research Professor and in 1986, Distinguished Professor. The works recognized by this Nobel Prize are clearly a group effort of achievement as may be seen from the names associated with our publications on EGF. They share in this honor."
Stanley Cohen,"My initial interest, just prior to my work on cytokines, was on cell-mediated immunity and delayed hypersensitivity, mostly with respect to the cells that populated these reactions."
Stanley Cohen,My scientific interests throughout my undergraduate days were directed to cell biology and especially the mysteries of embryonic development.
Stanley Cohen,"I was born in Brooklyn in 1922. Both my mother and father were Russian Jewish emigrants who came to America in the early 1900's. My father was a tailor and my mother, a housewife. Though of limited education themselves, they instilled in me the values of intellectual achievement and the use of whatever talents I possessed."
Larry Coker,"Definitely some things have been improved. But without question, we've got a lot we can work on and we've got to get a lot better to be the team that we want to be."
Larry Coker,"When you're under the radar a bit, ... you just go about your work."
Larry Coker,"From my understanding, they were knocked unconscious with a helmet."
Larry Coker,I don't think talent is an issue.
Larry Coker,"There's always been talent in South Florida, it just didn't stay here."
Larry Coker,"When I've been a great coach, we've had a great running back,"
Larry Coker,"I'm not gonna go through another season with an overweight, sluggish running back. I did that last year, and I'm not gonna do it again,"
Larry Coker,"It's not so much numbers, it's the quality you get. I think we definitely got quality."
Larry Coker,"These players have a lot of pride. They come here to win championships. And again, there's some very, very nice things that happened last year. ... But these players come here and they expect to do better."
Larry Coker,"Our players have checked in, and we start practice tomorrow. We're very excited about it, but more important, the players are excited. ... Now it's time for practice. It's time for football."
Larry Coker,We pushed through (practice) pretty well today. Obviously it's hot and humid. It's going to be hot and humid in South Carolina as well. We have to be prepared and ready to give a great effort. That's what it's going to take to win the football game.
Larry Coker,We're planning on playing Saturday. We're still days out.
Larry Coker,We're disappointed. Guys wanted to play. Obviously we're in a pretty good rhythm now and want to have an opportunity to get better. We'll just make the best of it.
Larry Coker,That could definitely happen. It could be this Monday night.
Larry Coker,The older guys â€” they talk to me. The pressure with those guys lies on me.
Larry Coker,"He's going to be as good as advertised. He's still young. He's still learning, but he's really going to be a good player, a difference-maker type player. I'm not concerned about him."
Larry Coker,"We're not a finished product yet by any stretch of the imagination at quarterback. But I think again, if we handle it properly, we can build on it with the players we have."
Larry Coker,"It's great to end the season with a win. But again, we've got new resolve. We hate to end the season with three losses, that taste in our mouth. It's an opportunity to come back and really get back on track and again be one of the elite football teams in the country. That's what we expect."
Larry Coker,"I hate it because it is the call that really stood out. We?re on the field; we think we have won the game. There is all the emotion. And all of a sudden, we lose the game."
Larry Coker,"Obviously, I think it was an aberration, but it is a reality. We're still a team that won nine games, but this one was a real shock."
Larry Coker,"It is sort of funny, isn't it? One coach goes 9-3 and everything's great. Another coach goes 9-3 and everything's not so great. It's all a matter of perspective."
Larry Coker,"I think (Tella) can help us, just from his experience. He definitely can help us out. I expect Andrew to be in the rotation also. Andrew is smart, he can play both guard positions."
Larry Coker,But our coaches and players were not satisfied with the season by any means. That's the expectation we have.
Larry Coker,"When the law of averages goes against us, I don't like the law. I think it was just poor execution on our parts. Maybe it was just Florida State's time."
Larry Coker,"Guys really stepped up and carried the load. This is a no-excuses program. We lost one commitment. You'd like to have a full contingent of coaches, but no complaints. Just go get the job done and that's what we did."
Larry Coker,His track record as a college football coach speaks for itself. He will do a tremendous job.
Larry Coker,"[If there are any worries about new Miami QB Kyle Wright, Hurricanes coach Larry Coke isn't showing it.] Since I named him starter, he's taken the ball and run with it, ... He knows what to expect."
Larry Coker,"Again, it's poise and character. We made some plays. When we stopped doing that, that's how Clemson got in the game. When we got back to doing that, it permeates throughout."
Larry Coker,I don't want to blame this on Rochford. The fact is it's not all his fault. But the snaps have to be better. And we also have to hold it and put it down and make the kick.
Larry Coker,I think he's back. I believe it was the Duke game ... when it was the first game he really didn't think about his knee and that's a good sign. And I think he's going to continue to get better as the year progresses.
Larry Coker,Having these players come back is a tremendous advantage because they know what it's all about. They know how painful it is to lose. They know how great it is to win at the University of Miami.
Jerry Colangelo,"The fact remains that the cost of admission -- that is the value of these franchises -- has risen to such a degree that in most situations, the leagues have outgrown the family ownership situations. My opinion is ... you are going to see a lot of large conglomerates participating in professional sports."
Jerry Colangelo,"I think Kobe Bryant is a player with enough moxie to go along with his talent that he'll adjust to whatever his role is. In fact, that's exactly what he said today."
Jerry Colangelo,"The league has accomplished so much in the last 30 years, but the potential over the next decade is incredible, just with technology alone. And you really need to have that stability, and the stability that David has offered the league in terms of his leadership and building a strong organization of people is very important to that future."
Jerry Colangelo,"The stability is very important to this league, and the potential over the next decade is huge."
Jerry Colangelo,He's almost unstoppable in terms of his performance. There's a competitiveness about him that kind of wills his teams to wins.
Jerry Colangelo,He looked me right in the eye and said it would be an honor for him. It was a very positive experience.
Jerry Colangelo,"He wants to win a gold medal. He said that very clearly. He said if asked, he would be honored."
Jerry Colangelo,"He was looking though the glass at the photos that were up on the wall in their hall of fame. He said, 'Dad, I want to come here and do what you did to follow you.' I said, 'No, Bryan. That was my life. You're going to have to live your own life."
Jerry Colangelo,"The building has undergone a complete transformation over the past few years, providing for an enhanced entertainment experience for our guests."
Jerry Colangelo,I had a previous conversation with him and we said we would meet again when he came to Phoenix. He's really excited about it. He's really kind of juiced about representing the United States. He had some great things to say about the opportunity.
Jerry Colangelo,Just as we sought to have continuity and commitment from coaches and players ... so was our commitment to having a home.
Jerry Colangelo,The commitment is a 30-year commitment.
Stephen Colbert,We're going to deal with truth on my show.
Stephen Colbert,an attractive vessel through which the river of truth can flow.
Stephen Colbert,I don't trust books. They're all fact and no heart.
Stephen Colbert,"He's definitely the king, ... I have trouble watching his show. It's exhausting."
Stephen Colbert,Stephen Debates 21-Year-Old Self.
Stephen Colbert,"And I wrote things for the school's newspaper, and - like all teenagers - I dabbled in poetry."
Stephen Colbert,"The show is about me in that when you give opinions, you're saying something about yourself,"
Stephen Colbert,"Bush has a real problem on his hands here, John: What honor should he bestow on Karl Rove?"
Stephen Colbert,"Like O'Reilly, we'll grab the most important word out of every sentence, ... `The,' for example. Also, I'll say, `I'm angry,' and the graphic will read, `Colbert angry.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Jon would never talk about Britney's baby, ... But I see it as an example of our Hollywood limousine liberals dropping the ball on family values. Coming from South Carolina ... we don't knock up our pop stars."
Stephen Colbert,"When emotion or glitz is pumped into something that doesn't need it, it's just funny to me, ... Oh, it's not dramatic enough?"
Stephen Colbert,"Doctors orders, Doctor love that is."
Stephen Colbert,"Scarborough's got `the real deal,' meaning `here's how it really is,' ... It's always, `It's just common sense, folks.'"
Stephen Colbert,"Jon's his own guy, but it's a gig that says a lot about who you are in the comedy community."
Stephen Colbert,"I want to thank Comedy Central for picking up the show, but more importantly I want to congratulate Comedy Central for picking up the show,"
Stephen Colbert,"I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32% approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in reality. And reality has a well-known liberal bias."
Stephen Colbert,"In order to maintain an untenable position, you have to be actively ignorant. One motto on the show is, 'Keep your facts, I'm going with the truth.'"
Stephen Colbert,"I can't prove it, but I can say it."
Stephen Colbert,"Lemme just talk to you for a second about something that I think is good for America: caramel apples, ... I had one last night. Delicious. Not talking about candy apples. I think candy apples are a danger! You crack 'em, they're very sharp. You candy apple crowd need to wake up!"
Andy Cole,"There is good depth to the squad and everyone can see what a quality player Wayne Rooney is,"
Andy Cole,"It would be a lie if I said I didn't have any reservations about returning to Manchester,"
Andy Cole,We wanted to make it funny. We've had success because we have a good time with it.
Andy Cole,"When I have a conversation with anybody, I do look deep into them,"
Andy Cole,"My little boy said to me it would be nice if I got a hat-trick to celebrate my birthday, so I dedicate my two goals to him."
George Cole,"I wouldn't have any problem with that, if it would stop the thievery. My customers wouldn't mind doing it, I don't think. They're honest people."
George Cole,"Mountain men traveled in very large parties and trapped beavers in the Rocky Mountains, and every year they gathered in a rendezvous. That's where they would sell the hides to traders."
George Cole,"You can't do something for 15 years on and off, making 107 episodes, without absolutely loving it. It was heaven."
George Cole,I was always in plays at school and in school concerts - you could say I liked to show off.
George Cole,I received quite a lot of ribbing whenever I went into the bank and people were always offering me Havana cigars - it was very nice.
George Cole,I was paid to be cheeky and people clapped me for it.
Kenneth Cole,"Every season I take the opportunity to convey a much larger message than just hemlines and trends,"
Kenneth Cole,Every season I take the opportunity to convey a much larger message than just hemlines and trends.
Kenneth Cole,Last year we took a step back and tightened things up in the hope of becoming more lean and resilient to the changing climate. But we also realize that in difficult times you have the greatest opportunities. Customers now want creative alternatives.
Kenneth Cole,"We just rounded out the world of men's. ... At a certain point, we're going to look at women's and home,"
Steve Cole,"It probably looked good in your yard, but still, this isn't food, this wasn't something you needed,"
Steve Cole,"The goal is to make the issue less intimidating, and point them in the right direction. We have broken down complex and cumbersome concepts into manageable action steps."
Steve Cole,"Very sensitive diplomatic negotiations are ongoing. Believe me, we want to resolve this more than anybody. But again, it's very sensitive. I can't get into exactly what's going on."
Steve Cole,"We did get that approval, and we filed for dismissal."
Chris Coleman,He is a solid midfield player and is experienced. He'll add strength and depth to the squad.
Chris Coleman,"He has all the tools in his locker and it is up to him to fulfil his potential. Obviously, there is another road he can take and hopefully he won't do that."
Chris Coleman,When I signed Heider I had no intention of playing him and Brian together because they are very alike. It was going to be one or the other.
Chris Coleman,I can see in the players that they have come back and got a little hunger for the ball because they have not seen it.
Chris Coleman,"We're not in the habit of selling our best players, we also want to plan for the future and he's a big part of that."
Chris Coleman,"Racism is part of society, not just football. There's only one way to stamp down on it and that's hard, and that's obviously what FIFA have done."
Chris Coleman,"We've got a tremendous opportunity here to do not only what is right for the environment, but what is right, economically, for the city of St. Paul, ... It's important that we have true leadership to do what we have to do to keep this plant open."
Chris Coleman,He's got courage. Most people would use a disability as a reason to not do what they love. But not Wade. He's one of a kind. And his courage gives me courage.
Chris Coleman,"We all have busy lives, and our kids are in 14 sports and some people have two jobs, so it's just hard to engage people of any race in this kind of work. So you have to create processes that are meaningful and respectful of people's times and commitments."
Chris Coleman,"I think the one obvious choice at the moment is John Terry,"
Chris Coleman,"Certainly in the second half, you could see we were nowhere near as fit as the MLS boys. They're a good team, and I think they got stronger and stronger as the game went on, and we got weaker and weaker."
Chris Coleman,"Certainly in the second half, you could see we were nowhere near as fit as the MLS boys, ... They're a good team, and I think they got stronger and stronger as the game went on, and we got weaker and weaker."
Chris Coleman,"He didn't start because he has just had a long flight back from America, and couldn't have played the full 90 minutes. But when I play with two strikers Brian is always at the front of my mind, because he works well with Andy Cole."
Chris Coleman,"I know that he will add a great deal to the squad in terms of his passing ability and his dead ball prowess, and I look forward to him becoming an important part of next season's campaign'."
James Coleman,There has to be a mechanism so coaches are aware of the disciplinary problems their players are having. They should have dealt more severely with the problem.
James Coleman,A truly great hug comes when you squeeze just hard enough to share a heartbeat.
James Coleman,"We're all pretty good friends. We've all played other sports together and we've been together for two or three years now, so we're a pretty good chemistry team."
James Coleman,"That's the environment that they were living in that night. The question is, was there a pattern?"
James Coleman,"Sometimes they're bad. Sometimes they good. It's what kids our age like, but sometimes they get carried away."
Michael Coleman,maintenance out-shadowed safety by a large margin.
Michael Coleman,"They [the leaders] were doing literally nothing to that point, we'd been absolutely cantering,"
Michael Coleman,It's like the Cuban missile crisis; we are just waiting for someone to blink.
Michael Coleman,"I know it looked a bad ride, but to a certain extent we were a victim of circumstances."
Michael Coleman,"We need a partnership with the Government of Canada and we need long-term planning. The proposed sector tables are a practical, realistic mechanism for making this happen."
Steve Coleman,All students can benefit. They enjoy the socialization. I think they are learning in spite of themselves.
Steve Coleman,"We are coordinating with the other airlines. Unfortunately we don't believe there's enough capacity, on the Delta Shuttle for example, to serve everybody. But we're doing our best to serve as many people as possible. What we're doing is we're going to have extra customer service folks at the US Airways terminal at LaGuardia, and additional customer service representatives to help find alternate travel arrangements."
Steve Coleman,"We are coordinating with the other airlines. Unfortunately we don't believe there's enough capacity, on the Delta Shuttle for example, to serve everybody.

What we're doing is we're going to have extra customer service folks at the US Airways terminal at LaGuardia, and additional customer service representatives to help find alternate travel arrangements."
Charlie Coles,"They threw the wild card at us, Muhammad. He was definitely the MVP for this game; there's only one vote and I have it."
Charlie Coles,"I think it hurt us on the offensive end a lot. He not only scores for us, he's one of those guys that's always active. He's always doing something. He's a decent passer; he really moves and gets things going."
Charlie Coles,"I would have liked to play Tuesday night; it won't be an excuse. When you're playing well, you want to play more and practice less."
Charlie Coles,"You could say the post defense isn't doing very well, but maybe his teammate isn't dropping down for a double-team, or maybe the person guarding the ball isn't pressuring the ball. It's tough to pass into the post if you're pressuring the ball. There could be three or four things wrong, and usually are. You need to be accountable and help each other be accountable."
Charlie Coles,They've been the class of the league the last several years with those 20-win seasons and the success that they've had.
Charlie Coles,"This was a great accomplishment for the seniors, to go out with a win. They're second to Kent, and it's a close second."
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette,Girls usually have a paper mGchT face on their wedding day.
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette,"Is suffering so very serious? I have come to doubt it. It may be quite childish, a sort of undignified pastime -- I'm referring to the kind of suffering a man inflicts on a woman or a woman on a man. It's extremely painful. I agree that it's hardly bearable. But I very much fear that this sort of pain deserves no consideration at all. It's no more worthy of respect than old age or illness."
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette,"On this narrow planet, we have only the choice between two unknown worlds. One of them tempts us - ah! what a dream, to live in that! - the other stifles us at the first breath."
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette,What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner.
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette,Be happy. It's one way of being wise.
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette,A woman who thinks she is intelligent demands the same rights as man. An intelligent woman gives up.
Anthony Coley,"It seems like every rock he turns over, excessive spending and fiscal mismanagement is staring him in the face."
Anthony Coley,"Without this aid, the city of Paterson would go bankrupt, leaving tens of thousands of hardworking residents without adequate police and fire services and other basic necessities."
Anthony Coley,Unguarded chemical plants are a clear and present danger that must be addressed.
Anthony Coley,"We have crossed an important threshold. Folks understand that our budget problem is very serious or somewhat serious, and that is a threshold that should not be taken lightly."
Toni Collette,It's about loving and letting go. I think it's about family and those relationships that are incredibly joyous and incredibly intense and confronting. It's about people learning to be comfortable in their own skin.
Toni Collette,"Both of the girls learn about how the other lives, learning about how the other person is in their shoes. Also the journey they're both going on, even though it appears to be different, is very similar in that they're coming to learn how to be in their own shoes."
Toni Collette,"I was over the moon. I know it's just a job, but it's become one of a handful of filming experiences which has become somehow bigger and more important in my life."
David Collier,The schedule is too condensed. We want to free up time so that players can rest.
David Collier,What we have done is made sure that we've safeguarded the future of English cricket.
David Collier,He's highly respected among the players. We're delighted he has made that commitment.
David Collier,"It seems to me that when the specific plan was approved, there was a certain absence of information as to impacts to Hecker Pass. (That) does not inspire faith in the process."
Robert Collier,"As fast as each opportunity presents itself, use it! No matter how tiny an opportunity it may be, use it!"
Robert Collier,The mere fact that you have obstacles to overcome is in your favor...
Robert Collier,"It is only through your conscious mind that you can reach the subconscious. Your conscious mind is the porter at the door, the watchman at the gate. It is to the conscious mind that the subconscious looks for all its impressions."
Robert Collier,All of us have bad luck and good luck. The man who persists through the bad luck -- who keeps right on going -- is the man who is there when the good luck comes -- and is ready to receive it.
Robert Collier,All of us have bad luck and good luck. The man who persists through the bad luck - who keeps right on going - is the man who is there when the good luck comes - and is ready to receive it.
Robert Collier,It sometimes seems that we have only to love a thing greatly to get it.
Robert Collier,"The great successful men of the world have used their imaginations... they think ahead and create their mental picture, and the go to work materializing that picture in all its details, filling in here, adding a little there, altering this a bit and that a bit, but steadily building -- steadily building."
Robert Collier,"Our subconscious minds have no sense of humor, play no jokes and cannot tell the difference between reality and an imagined thought or image. What we continually think about eventually will manifest in our lives."
Robert Collier,"One might as well try to ride two horses moving in different directions, as to try to maintain in equal force two opposing or contradictory sets of desires."
Robert Collier,"Very few persons, comparatively, know how to Desire with sufficient intensity. They do not know what it is to feel and manifest that intense, eager, longing, craving, insistent, demanding, ravenous Desire which is akin to the persistent, insistent, ardent, overwhelming desire of the drowning man for a breath of air; of the shipwrecked or desert-lost man for a drink of water; of the famished man for bread and meat…"
Robert Collier,First the stalk -- then the roots. First the need -- then the means to satisfy that need. First the nucleus -- then the elements needed for its growth.
Robert Collier,"Something must be done when you find an opposing set of desires of this kind well to the fore in your category of strong desires. You must set in operation a process of competition, from which one must emerge a victor and the other set be defeated."
Robert Collier,"All through nature, you will find the same law. First the need, then the means."
Robert Collier,Desire is proof of the availability...
Robert Collier,"Very few persons, comparatively, know how to Desire with sufficient intensity. They do not know what it is to feel and manifest that intense, eager, longing, craving, insistent, demanding, ravenous Desire which is akin to the persistent, insistent, ardent, overwhelming desire of the drowning man for a breath of air; of the shipwrecked or desert-lost man for a drink of water; of the famished man for bread and meatÃ"
Robert Collier,"You can have anything you want -- if you want it badly enough. You can be anything you want to be, have anything you desire, accomplish anything you set out to accomplish -- if you will hold to that desire with singleness of purpose."
Robert Collier,"Sooner or later comes a crisis in our affairs, and how we meet it determines our future happiness and success. Since the beginning of time, every form of life has been called upon to meet such crisis."
Robert Collier,Constant repetition carries conviction.
Robert Collier,"It is only when you despair of all ordinary means, it is only when you convince it that it must help you or you perish, that the seed of life in you bestirs itself to provide a new resource."
Robert Collier,People blame their environment. There is only one person to blame -- and only one -- themselves.
Robert Collier,"One comes to believe whatever one repeats to oneself sufficiently often, whether the statement be true of false. It comes to be dominating thought in one's mind."
Robert Collier,Your chances of success in any undertaking can always be measured by your belief in yourself.
Robert Collier,"There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. That little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative."
Robert Collier,In every adversity there lies the seed of an equivalent advantage. In every defeat is a lesson showing you how to win the victory next time.
Robert Collier,All riches have their origin in mind. Wealth is in ideas - not money.
Robert Collier,People blame their environment. There is only one person to blame - and only one - themselves.
Robert Collier,"Every contrivance of man, every tool, every instrument, every utensil, every article designed for use, of each and every kind, evolved from a very simple beginnings."
Bootsy Collins,WWBC (What Would Bootsy Do) on Christmas.
Bootsy Collins,"You have to get up and plant the seed and see if it grows, but you can't just wait around, you have to water it and take care of it."
Bootsy Collins,"Yeah, because what it all boils down to is at the end of the day, we are all riding on the same boat and we have to learn how to deal with each other. I think that the music and what we do in our actions is what can kind of bring us together, hopefully."
Bootsy Collins,"When you're used to playing with people, when you're in a band, then you're used to playing with each other. People nowadays aren't used to playing with each other because they don't have to."
Bootsy Collins,"When we got with George, he didn't care what was happening. He liked how crazy we were looking and dressing. I kinda liked being with George more so at the time, because George let us do what we wanted to do. But I needed both lessons."
Bootsy Collins,"When I was coming up, we weren't trying to get a hit or get paid, we were just trying to do our thing. The only thing we were really trying to do was to be recognized for our originality."
Bootsy Collins,"Well actually, we are working on the live album from the shows in Japan. I'm trying to get that finished."
Bootsy Collins,"We were just so happy to be playing with James Brown. We wouldn't have dared asked for any writer's credits, we didn't know anything about that."
Bootsy Collins,"We were brash young fellows'. I was always hanging with the older crowd anyway. The musicians were the Hip Cats, and I was hanging with them anyway. I Just started out real early."
Bootsy Collins,We are all human and I want to relate that message to all people.
Bootsy Collins,"Usually when I'm out doing stuff, I'm just out in the wild, doing the wild thing. I don't really get a chance to just chill out until I come here, in my creative space."
Bootsy Collins,"To me, you go through things like that and you learn from it. You add it on to your life, to try to make your life better. Instead of dogging people, learn something from it. And keep stepping."
Bootsy Collins,"That's pretty much what we try to do. Stay with that one instead of following the Jones, I just like to come up with my own stuff."
Bootsy Collins,"Since Warner Brothers, back in the day, I hadn't never really had nobody that I think that was there, that I kinda felt was working like my right arm."
Bootsy Collins,"Nowadays, it's like two different arenas, recording and touring. When I started way back in the day, doing both was nothing, you didn't have to think about it, the road and recording."
Bootsy Collins,"It's a whole other ball game and I am glad that I fit into that space where, whatever it is that you want to do and you are doing as long as you are happy with it, then you know What the Heck!"
Bootsy Collins,"I've thought maybe of getting younger artists out doing stuff, like I used to do a lot of. I don't wanna do it day in and day out like I used to, but I still wanna do it."
Bootsy Collins,"I'd like to have younger people around me and that I'll be involved with them a lot more now, as opposed to me being the main focal point."
Bootsy Collins,"I wanted to get my recording and become a musician again, work; with other people, do that kind of thing because I kind of got away from that for a while once we started happening, you know, selling records, sold out concerts."
Bootsy Collins,"I wanna keep creating those situations for myself so I don't have to be out front all the time. Then when I do have to be out front, I can do it to the max."
Bootsy Collins,"I try to bring it across on my record, in my dress, in what I do and what I say because to me humor is important. You should have a dose of that and I guess giving it is what I'm here for."
Bootsy Collins,"I like being out front, doing what I do, but then I also like playing in a band too. I'd like to do stuff like I did with Deee-lite. I went out and played with them and they were the stars, that was cool."
Bootsy Collins,"I guess some of today's programming has rubbed off on me because I find myself having to set time around for touring, putting that together and then setting time around for recording."
Bootsy Collins,"Everyone in the band pretty much knows that whatever they want to do I am there for them, if they need my help or not, I am there for them."
Bootsy Collins,"Coming from the James Brown school, I had learned a lot of stuff before I got with George. It was from one extreme to the other."
Bootsy Collins,"Catfish is not playing guitar no more, he's doing like a home-front thing. He had been in the business around ten years before I got in it, so I guess he's had enough of it."
Bootsy Collins,"But I'm always trying to plan ahead too and in doing so, and in working on this album, I've met a lot people that I hope to be involved with, on their records and in their situations."
Bootsy Collins,"But by us doing a lot on the road, we were able to afford things like videos on the tours, cartoons that we'd open up the shows with. We were doing that way back when and now it's the hippest thing to do. We're just coming back around, I guess trying to play catch-up."
Bootsy Collins,"A roast is like a get-together where people come down and talk about you and dog you out, the way you came up, the knucklehead things that you did, stuff like that."
Chris Collins,Traditions [aren't what] I'm worried about right now. My number one worry is trying to win the next game. Of course it is a big game and I think we'll see a little more heart and a little more emotion out of our team.
Chris Collins,"Nine minutes is not a long time, if you're going to take a nap. But it's an eternity if you're going to hide a shotgun."
Chris Collins,"I am extremely proud of these kids for all of their hard work, enthusiasm and achievements. Every year it amazes me how much money Oak Hill contributes to the American Heart Association, all while having a blast and getting a great work out at the same time."
Chris Collins,"I think J.J. would be the first to tell you he's done more than he dreamed he could do. That's what's amazing about commitment, about belief."
Chris Collins,It's tragic. My client is very sad that Mr. Bronson left the earth. But I'm disappointed that Colorado authorities didn't look into it further before they decided to drag my client out here.
Eileen collins,I don't think of myself as being a woman and having anything to prove.
Eileen collins,I've been in your shoes many times so I understand.
Eileen collins,"In some ways I feel sad about leaving NASA, but the reality is, I won't fly again."
Eileen collins,Getting the shuttle back up there is just going to bring the space station back to its full potential.
Eileen collins,"It will be expensive, it will be risky and we will make mistakes as we go. But we will do it because we are explorers by nature."
Eileen collins,"I have no nerves , no emotion , no pressure"
Eileen collins,We brought Discovery back in great shape. The crew was very anxious to walk around and see what the outside looks like and it looks fantastic.
Jackie Collins,If you want to be a writer-stop talking about it and sit down and write!
Jackie Collins,"We've had a lot of blood and sweat put into the school by parents and volunteers,"
Jackie Collins,"What do you have in at least an acre or more, because I'm tired of living cramped next to my neighbor."
Jackie Collins,"I have this theory that people in Hollywood don't read, ... They read 'Vanity Fair' and then consider themselves terribly well read. I think I can basically write about anybody without getting caught."
Jackie Collins,"It was so funny to realize that all the cliches about Hollywood were true, ... There was the casting couch. There were these dirty old men who would say, 'Can you lift your skirt up a little higher, darling? We'd like to see your legs. How about dinner tonight?' That's what I started to write about."
Jackie Collins,These are not big corporations buying these parcels. It's working-class people trying to put their money somewhere it will make them a return.
Jackie Collins,You've got your hands full if you have three children under 2 years old.
Jackie Collins,Who is ready to settle for five minutes when three hours does nicely?
Jackie Collins,Where was Paris Hilton a year ago? She's a fabulous character to write about.
Jackie Collins,"Whatever you have a passion for, then you must do. If you want to write, write about something you know about."
Jackie Collins,"If you want to achieve your dreams, you must follow them, and the best way to follow them is not to think about wanting to be very rich, but to think about doing something that you really want to do."
Jackie Collins,"Ideas are all around me. If I wasn't interested in them myself, I don't think anyone else would be either."
Jackie Collins,"I write synopses after the book is completed. I can't write it beforehand, because I don't know what the book's about. I invent something for my publisher because he asks for one, but the final book ends up very differently."
Jackie Collins,"I write about the American dream: if you set your mind to do something, you can do it. My fans know they're getting the real thing."
Jackie Collins,"I write about real people in disguise. If anything, my characters are toned down-the truth is much more bizarre."
Jackie Collins,"I was never confident about finishing a book, but friends encouraged me. When I finished my first book, it was accepted by a publisher right away and became an instant bestseller. One male critic called it the most shocking book he ever read."
Jackie Collins,I think I'm a born storyteller. Inspiration is all around me. I can read a newspaper article and come up with an idea for a book.
Jackie Collins,"I really fall in love with my characters, even the bad ones. I love getting together with them. They tell me what to do; they take me on a wild and wonderful trip."
Jackie Collins,I managed to take a family trip to the Bahamas and it was quite lovely.
Jackie Collins,"I know that I am very popular in Holland, in fact I have visited Amsterdam several times to publicize my books. I have a great publisher in Holland and they have published all of my books in Dutch."
Jackie Collins,"I have written 20 books, and each one is like having a baby. Writing is not easy; some people want to write books but just can't put a story together. I can put together a story that interests both me and my readers."
Jackie Collins,"I have visited Australia several times, and I always try to make a point of going to Melbourne because it's almost my favorite city there, Melbourne and Sydney. But I shouldn't say that because I haven't been everywhere-and I'm very fond of Perth too!"
Jackie Collins,I have this theory that people in Hollywood don't read. They read 'Vanity Fair' and then consider themselves terribly well read. I think I can basically write about anybody without getting caught.
Jackie Collins,"I have considered rap music stars, and there is one in my new book, Lovers and Players, and there is also a hip-hop music mogul who I think you will like a lot."
Jackie Collins,"I don't believe in writing anything that I don't know about or haven't researched about personally. I like to transport the reader to places, and in order to do that I have to do the research."
Jackie Collins,"I consider everywhere I go research, so you will be reading about the Bahamas in a future novel! That's because I like to take my readers with me!"
Jackie Collins,I am currently talking to one of the studios about making American Star as a TV series.
Jackie Collins,"Do not copy my style! The first rule of writing is write about what you know, not what you think you know. So, think about what you've done in your life and write about that."
Jackie Collins,"Brittany Murphy... who knows if she's going to be around. Kirsten Dunst, I think she's really boring. Reese Witherspoon? She can open a movie."
Jackie Collins,"Authors change publishers because it's like being married for a long time and suddenly you want to go out and have a wild affair! No, not seriously, sometimes the deal is more interesting with a new publisher, and other times they have more enthusiasm for your books."
Jackie Collins,"All of my books have the potential to become movies, it's just a question of finding a studio who wants to get behind me and put up the money to make the movie."
Jackie Collins,"Agents are essential, because publishers will not read unsolicited manuscripts."
Jackie Collins,"The husbands, who sometimes have another family who's grown, are going, Now I can spend time with my baby. Oh yeah, I bet your other family is really thrilled."
Jackie Collins,The biggest critics of my books are people who never read them.
Jackie Collins,"People are intrigued by fame, power and wealth and I think Hollywood is the only place where you get all three together."
Jackie Collins,"My philosophy is, unless you're sick and need help, why bother?"
Jackie Collins,My weakness is wearing too much leopard print.
James Collins,"I dislocated my other shoulder last year so I knew what the pain was going to be like, ... It was pretty sore so I had to go off."
James Collins,I dislocated my other shoulder last year so I knew what the pain was going to be like. It was pretty sore so I had to go off.
James Collins,"She is a wonderful, wonderful mother."
James Collins,"It seemed like a calm after a heavy storm had passed over, and for a short time, every man could visit his home or his neighbor without being afraid."
James Collins,I'll say it will hurt minimum wage workers the most.
James Collins,"She's up there now, and God will take care of them and she's going to be back."
James Collins,"heroic levels of customer service, dependability, reliability, and giving people a lot of freedom to try different things that might work."
James Collins,"There's no reason for Gillette to be world class on the web, but there's every reason for Gillette to be world class in producing billions of high powered razor blades at low cost."
James Collins,"The way you want to respond is to ask a question: Is this technology directly relevant to our hedgehog concept? If the answer is YES, then we want to become pioneers, not in the technology, but in the application of that technology specifically linked to our hedgehog concept."
James Collins,"The point of that is, if you look at Walgreen's history, they've always been pioneers in the application of technology. They're the only drugstore chain that I know to have their own satellite."
James Collins,"The first is that instead of writing a sequel, which is what most people do, this is in fact a prequel. Although we didn't know that when we began the process."
James Collins,"The answer I have is, you know, there a lot of things you can try to build to last. And what we try to do in our work is to come up with ideas that will last. Ideas that will stand the test of time."
James Collins,That the potential to become Level 5 exists in you and me and the people we work with and that it is then a process or a journey to nurture that seed... in a culture by and large that doesn't reinforce it.
James Collins,"So, that single idea of always first who, then what, has had a huge influence on me and I hope to continue to be able to make progress on it."
James Collins,"So my answer is, YES, everyone can find a hedgehog concept. If these companies can do it, anyone can do it. And anybody who says they can't is simply whining."
James Collins,"If you can help other people understand those truths - and in my mind, the only way I know to do that is with large scale, multi-year research projects, where you start with a question and then very rigorously and comprehensively answer that question."
James Collins,"If I had a personal wish for the new ideas in this new book it would be that every parent, every counselor, every teacher, every professor, every sports coach that deals with young people would understand the three circle concept."
James Collins,"Ha, well you see... this notion of a balanced life, I don't think I'm ever going to be able to have that... but I can have what I call an integrated life."
James Collins,"Be like Curious George, start with a question and look under the yellow hat to find what's there."
James Collins,And an integrated life is one where you're able to fit the different pieces of your life together in seamless fashion.
James Collins,A magazine is simply a device to induce people to read advertising.
Jason Collins,"He might be getting a little frustrated. I think any player that gets in foul trouble consistently might be a little frustrated. There's a number of reasons, but probably number one, he's not on the court as much as he wants to be. That all goes back to playing him tough on the offensive end and attacking."
Jason Collins,Guarding Shaq is not a one-man job. It's going to be by committee.
Jason Collins,"They've lost a lot of games this season. When things start going downhill, it seems like it's going downhill quickly. We just had to take advantage of that in the fourth quarter."
Jim Collins,Background screening should be an important part of a company's overall talent management strategy. Industry reports consistently show that having the right person in the right job increases a company's bottom line.
Jim Collins,"It's a new concept in design. That's a tremendous idea. I like that everyone shares a back yard, everyone shares a front yard."
Jim Collins,"It's more or less to tell the public we're getting ready to start the design. If you have an interest in a specific area, we'll see if we can work that into the design."
Jim Collins,"I decided to go through a midlife crisis and instead of buying a Corvette, I signed up for pilot lessons."
Jim Collins,In rapid-growth times it's hard to get the right people -- you're more likely to compromise on who you get.
Jim Collins,"Coach has a way of having a relationship with quarterbacks, whether it's good or stormy. The ones who do the best do things the way he wants. The more they do that, the better the relationship."
Jim Collins,They do see us as a threat and actively try to take action and publicity to try and negate our positive effect on the market.
Joan Collins,Life is not life unless you make mistakes
Joan Collins,It's like the Roman Empire. Wasn't everybody running around just covered with syphilis? And then it was destroyed by the volcano.
Joan Collins,I've never yet met a man who could look after me. I don't need a husband. What I need is a wife.
Joan Collins,If life throws you a lemon - make lemonade.
Joan Collins,"My husband and I started off as friends, which has been very important for our relationship,"
Joan Collins,one of the best and cheapest beauty treatments there is.
Joan Collins,"I ruefully realized I should have listened to my own common sense rather than the advice of others who have the less-than-altruistic motive of making money,"
Joan Collins,I don't believe in dieting.
Joan Collins,The problem with beauty is that it's like being born rich and getting poorer.
Kim Collins,I was cramping and I just wanted to finish the race.
Kim Collins,"Every time he takes a dollar away from schools it's a dollar taken away from kids,"
Kim Collins,"She's just really a nice lady, ... You just hate it for her."
Kim Collins,Whenever the competition is sleeping is when I shine.
Kitty Collins,"Imagination, industry, and intelligence - the three I s - are all indispensable to the actress, but of these three the greatest is, without doubt, imagination."
Kitty Collins,Still people are dangerous.
Kitty Collins,Aging seems to be the only available way to live a long life.
Kitty Collins,"We may give advice, but not the sense to use it."
Kitty Collins,I bring to my life a certain amount of mess.
Kitty Collins,"Nothing is as difficult as to achieve results in this world if one is filled full of great tolerance and the milk of human kindness. The person who achieves must generally be a one-idea individual, concentrated entirely on that one idea, and ruthless in his aspect toward other men and other ideas."
Marva Collins,Success doesn't come to youâ€¦ you go to it.
Marva Collins,Success doesn't come to you… you go to it.
Marva Collins,"Don't try to fix the students, fix ourselves first. The good teacher makes the poor student good and the good student superior. When our students fail, we, as teachers, too, have failed."
Marva Collins,Determination and perseverance move the world; thinking that others will do it for you is a sure way to fail.
Marva Collins,"Character is what you know you are, not what others think you have."
Michael Collins,"The addition of the Latin Banking Group is a major step for our Central Florida bank and recognizes the value and significance of the Hispanic community in our market, ... Cesar E. Calvet is a dynamic leader with deep ties to the Latin Community and extensive involvement in many Central Florida civic organizations. I am thrilled to have him lead this new division."
Michael Collins,I knew I was alone in a way that no earthling has ever been before.
Michael Collins,There's still a tremendous demand for high-yield and fixed-income assets and that's not going to abate anytime soon.
Patrick Collins,I don't believe this case is in trouble.
Patrick Collins,We've been really and truly planning and looking at the whole gamut of medical issues. Every bit of that has strengthened this region to be able to respond to whatever calamity that may occur.
Patrick Collins,I probably have as many meetings about pandemic influenza as I've ever had on anything else in emergency management.
Patrick Collins,"We see it in everything from health care customer service to consultants who build projects together. They can work out of their homes. That happens more and more. In our market, your office might be in L.A., but you might be there once a week because you don't have to be. It's all Internet and phone."
Patrick Collins,"It's not going to feel like quite the same glory days, but that's because it's been such an incredible pace, ... We're still going to experience a fairly strong economy."
Patrick Collins,You still have strong personal feelings for Mr. Ryan?
Patrick Collins,"The reason they want Mrs. McFadden on, Judge, is they think that she's ... going in (their) direction. They want Mr. Rein off this jury."
Patrick Collins,"Unless and until the state, city and county learn there are victims of corruption ... (and) unless and until people who vote understand that there are important consequences in their public officials' acts of dishonesty, this system will not change."
Patrick Collins,there are tangible consequences to corruption.
Phil Collins,They're rude and not as talented as they think they are. I won't mince words here but they've had a go at me personally.
Phil Collins,"I wish it wasn't like this. I sit and watch stuff on the television, I think, 'Why, why, why."
Phil Collins,You'll Be in My Heart
Phil Collins,"It's been fun for me too,"
Phil Collins,"We're all still good friends. We spent like 30 or 25 years of our life in the same office, ... Just because we don't play in the same band anymore doesn't mean we don't see each other and enjoy each other's company."
Phil Collins,"You know, a song is like a kid. You bring it up. And sometimes something you thought was going to be fantastic, by the time it's finished, is a bit of a disappointment."
Phil Collins,"When we're touring America or Europe, we use our own plane and a great advantage of that is it cuts out an awful lot of time checking in. You literally drive up to the plane, get on and then drive off at the other end."
Phil Collins,We stayed in some pretty shabby places in Europe.
Phil Collins,"The day Tarzan opened in London, I sat in a hotel room and discussed the project in detail."
Phil Collins,"On the day of the show, I sit down with someone that speaks very good English and someone who speaks the local language very well and work out what I'm going to say."
Phil Collins,"Often there's a BA crew, because half the time we stay at the same hotels, especially in Australia. I can remember spending quite a lot of time with crews around the pool there. They always make themselves known to us."
Phil Collins,"No seriously... when there's families, you tend to go back to your room after the gig rather than go for a drink with the other guys. But there's always someone who's got something going, like the tour manager."
Phil Collins,"Like last night I had a sequence with a gun and, to be honest, for me to be threatening with a gun and not be comical is quite hard."
Phil Collins,"It's always been easy with Mark, he's a rock fan and we speak the same language. He's a big Beatles fan too. We worked a lot via CLI calls, though only meeting up once every couple of months."
Phil Collins,"If Miles Davis hadn't died it would have been interesting to do an album with him, but there wasn't much else that would have got me into the studio... although Herbie Hancock has just been in touch about doing something and that would be an interesting combination."
Phil Collins,"I've spent the last year and a half going through a very public separation, hiding in hotel lobbies."
Phil Collins,"I'm writing new songs for a Broadway version of Tarzan, which is very interesting. I think what I learned from the Brother Bear score side of things, I've brought into the new Tarzan songs. Thinking outside just guitar, bass, drums and keyboards."
Phil Collins,"I'm usually going to make a record, finish a record, start a record or start a tour or between tours."
Phil Collins,I'm not trying necessarily to become a movie star; that wouldn't be bad but that's not the aim. I'm just trying to do interesting things and go into areas where I've not been before.
Phil Collins,I'm just trying to do things that are interesting for me.
Phil Collins,"I'll have the music, and then I'll just turn the microphone on, press Play and Record and sing. And whatever comes out ends up being the melody."
Phil Collins,"I usually hang around the room listening to a bit of last night's show. If there's one available, I go to the steam room every day for my voice. I spend half an hour there and then I eat, because I can't eat later than four o'clock. Then I go for a soundcheck. That's my day."
Phil Collins,"I remember flying with Air India to New York quite a few years ago now and I love Indian food, so the fact that I had a curry on board was fantastic."
Phil Collins,"I know it shouldn't make a difference, but crossing the dateline, we weren't sure what day it was - it was very strange. Now, I seem to cope with it better."
Phil Collins,"I do that in whatever language of the country I'm in, because the audience appreciate it."
Phil Collins,"I can't remember much about the early flights, except that it was ages before we got into First Class."
Phil Collins,"Each thing leapfrogs. I do a Genesis project - like now, we're just finishing off an album - and then by the time the album is doing its thing, I could do nothing or I could do a film."
Phil Collins,"Catering on planes, like on British Rail, is a standing joke, but I don't really have a problem with it. I don't quite know what people expect."
Phil Collins,"Beyond a certain point, the music isn't mine anymore. It's yours."
Phil Collins,"Another time, we had three days off in Australia, so we went out of our way to fly to Ayres Rock."
Phil Collins,And I would like to marry and have more children. I would like to try and do it right.
Phil Collins,"To be honest, producing records interests me less at the moment and I really don't want to get involved in album projects that are going to take up a lot of time."
Phil Collins,"The world is in your hands, now use it."
Phil Collins,"When I go on Japanese Airlines, I really love it because I like Japanese food."
Ruth Collins,"Canada's health-care professionals remain frozen out of the upcoming meeting of federal, provincial leaders in 10 days because our leaders want to change the channel and move on from health."
Ruth Collins,"Canadians have been left wondering whatever happened to the promise shown by the health plan,"
Ruth Collins,What they're arguing about right now is whether there's enough evidence. There's never enough evidence. There's never certainty in medicine.
Ruth Collins,"[Should such change take place,] patients would no longer have to appeal to their province for approval to leave the province for specialized health care, ... It would automatically be arranged by the health care system."
William Collins,"I would rather see words out on their own, awayfrom their families and the warehouse of Rogetwandering the world where they sometimes fallin love with a completely different word."
William Collins,By fairy hands their knell is rung; / By forms unseen their dirge is sung.
William Collins,"How sleep the brave, who sink to rest, / By all their country's wishes blest!"
William Collins,"I'm not dismayed that poetry's appeal is limited in scope. That's why we have National Poetry Month. It's a sign of its neglect, which isn't necessarily a negative thing. It's not like we have National TV Month."
William Collins,"Poetry is my cheap means of transportation. By the end of the poem the reader should be in a different place from where he started. I would like him to be slightly disoriented at the end, like I drove him outside of town at night and dropped him off in a cornfield."
William Collins,"When Music, heavenly maid, was young,While yet in early Greece she sung."
William Collins,"O Music! sphere-descended maid, / Friend of Pleasure, Wisdom's aid!"

William Collins,"I want to remove my hat, close my eyes,and feel the sun, warm and intermittent, on my face."
William Collins,"With eyes up-rais'd, as one inspir'd, Pale Melancholy sate retir'd, And from her wild sequester'd seat, In notes by distance made more sweet, Pour'd thro' the mellow horn her pensive soul."
William Collins,"When a writer becomes a reader of his or her own work, a lot can go wrong. It's like do-it-yourself dentistry."
William Collins,"Prior to Wordsworth, humor was an essential part of poetry. I mean, they don't call them Shakespeare comedies for nothing."
William Collins,In numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong.
William Collins,I think humor is a very serious thing. I use it as a way of weakening the reader's defenses so that I can more easily take him to something more.
William Collins,Always mistrust a subordinate who never finds fault with his superior.

Confucius,"With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and my bent arm for a pillow -- I have still joy in the midst of all these things."
Jeff Conine,"The whole state of the team is sad. The whole stadium situation, the financial reality of what they had to do, it is sad."
Jeff Conine,He doesn't give you many mistakes to hit. It was just command. He was not throwing 95 mph at you. It was just pinpoint control.
Jeff Conine,"He made some mistakes. And, fortunately for us, we didn't miss them."
Jeff Conine,He doesn't give you many mistakes to hit and when he does it almost surprises you that he makes a mistake.
Jeff Conine,"I take that very seriously. I think management, that's one of the reasons that they brought me back. They know I am going to play hard and lead by example. If there is something that needs to be addressed, I don't mind addressing it."
Jeff Conine,"Something probably should be said at some point by someone. You hope that's all it has to be said, is once."
Jeff Conine,"Every time someone goes out the door and someone comes in, you hope there's improvement, ... because we didn't make the playoffs."
Jeff Conine,"We're in the dugout hitting instead of maybe giving up another run,"
Jeff Conine,We're playing terrible. It's disheartening. You're close to being in a race and playing terrible. It's not very fun.
Jeff Conine,We're definitely lacking experience on the field right now.
Jeff Conine,"He threw a lot of fastballs and just put them right where he wanted them. It's a perfect example of when a pitcher hits his spots, he's going to be successful."
Jeff Conine,"It's not our destiny anymore,"
Jeff Conine,"I think someone young with fresh ideas and a different style of baseball will be good for the team. Hopefully, it will be a good fit."

Dennis Conner,Design has taken the place of what sailing used to be.
Dennis Conner,"My goal in sailing isn't to be brilliant or flashy in individual races, just to be consistent over the long run."
Mike Conner,"Life is like a hand of cards. You have to play the hand you're dealt, you can't win by folding, and sometimes you must take chances in order to win."
Mike Conner,We're very fortunate to get a good draw against a team we can possibly beat. We're looking to get past the first round and go deep into the tournament.
Mike Conner,"He was in serious pain during halftime. He couldn't even sit down during timeouts because he was in so much pain. I couldn't take him out because it would've stiffened up on him. He had almost no lateral movement, but he's a winner. He stayed in no matter what."
Mike Conner,"My dad was just tired of the arguing. He loved Nina with all his heart, but he didn't like the fighting and arguing."
Michelle Connor,I thought they played great. They really made those girls work for it.
Michelle Connor,I'm thrilled with the way the girls played. They really went out and gave it their best.
Michelle Connor,I was concerned because the girls hadn't played an 18-hole match this season. But these girls work hard and never quit and have done just an outstanding job.
Michelle Connor,"I have all the faith in the world in the girls, and I know they will do the best that they can do. I think they'll be just fine."
Jimmy Connors,"It's a youth-driven sport. There's no doubt about it, like all sports. But tennis is exceptional in throwing away the old and shuffling in the new, sometimes even before their time on both sides."
Jimmy Connors,"You have to remember that I played longer than anybody else on the main tour; I played until I was 40, and then played another six years or so on the seniors tour."
Jimmy Connors,"No, like I said, my dad was never really part of the tennis. His involvement around what I did with the tennis and with my mom and my grandparents was really not a part of my life."
Jimmy Connors,"From where we lived, to practise in St Louis was an hour-and-a-half drive each way, so that took a lot of the time. So really, our lives just took different paths."
Jimmy Connors,"Experience is a great advantage. The problem is that when you get the experience, you're too damned old to do anything about it."
Jimmy Connors,Every time I went out there I performed the best that I could and it was time to step back and clear my mind.
Jimmy Connors,But why should I read what somebody else thinks of my life when I know the real story?
Jimmy Connors,"Bjorn was a different breed, I threw my best material at him, but he would never smile, but that added to the charm when he played me and Mac. We were going nuts and losing our mind and he was sitting back like he was on a Sunday stroll."
Jimmy Connors,I was never part of the crowd.
Jimmy Connors,"Tennis was never work for me, tennis was fun. And the tougher the battle and the longer the match, the more fun I had."

Jimmy Connors,For the last five or six years the most important thing in my life has been my family.
Jimmy Connors,I hate to lose more than I love to win.
Jimmy Connors,I would watch Gonzalez play and he mesmerized you. It would be like looking into the flame of a fire. You know you couldn't take your eyes off him because you never knew what he would do next.
Jimmy Connors,"People say I'm around because I have a lot of heart, but I know all the heart in the world couldn't have helped me if I wasn't physically fit."
Jimmy Connors,"Rather than viewing a brief relapse back to inactivity as a failure, treat it as a challenge and try to get back on track as soon as possible."
Jimmy Connors,New Yorkers love it when you spill your guts out there. Spill your guts at Wimbledon and they make you stop and clean it up.
Joseph Conrad,"The sea - this truth must be confessed - has no generosity. No display of manly qualities - courage, hardihood, endurance, faithfulness - has ever been known to touch its irresponsible consciousness of power."
Joseph Conrad,"I remember my youth and the feeling that will never come back any more --the feeling that I could last for ever, outlast the sea, the earth, and all men; the deceitful feeling that lures us on to joys, to perils, to love, to vain effort --to death; the triumphant conviction of strength, the heat of life in the handful of dust, the glow in the heart that with every year grows dim, grows cold, grows small, and expires --and expires, too soon, too soon --before life itself."
Joseph Conrad,"The revolutionary spirit is mighty convenient in this, that it frees one from all scruples as regards ideas. Its hard absolute optimism is repulsive to my mind by the menace of fanaticism and intolerance it contains. No doubt one should smile at these things; but, imperfect Esthete, I am no better Philosopher. All claim to special righteousness awakens in me that scorn and anger from which a philosophical mind should be free."
Joseph Conrad,"Words, as is well known, are great foes of reality"
Joseph Conrad,"I would not unduly praise the virtue of restraint. It is often merely temperamental. But it is not always a sign of coldness. It may be pride. There can be nothing more humiliating than to see the shaft of one's emotion miss the mark of either laughter or tears. Nothing more humiliating! And this for the reason that should the mark be missed, should the open display of emotion fail to move, then it must perish unavoidably in disgust or contempt."
Joseph Conrad,"It is respectable to have no illusions, and safe, and profitable and dull."
Joseph Conrad,"A word carries far, very far, deals destruction through time as the bullets go flying through space."
Joseph Conrad,In order to move others deeply we must deliberately allow ourselves to be carried away beyond the bounds of our normal sensibility.
Joseph Conrad,"Words, as is well known, are the great foes of reality."
Joseph Conrad,A modern fleet of ships does not so much make use of the sea as exploit a highway.
Joseph Conrad,The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.
Joseph Conrad,To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence.
Joseph Conrad,"A man that is born falls into a dream like a man who falls into the sea. If he tries to climb out into the air as inexperienced people endeavour to do, he drowns."
Joseph Conrad,Don't you forget what's divine in the Russian soul and that's resignation.
Joseph Conrad,As to honour you know it's a very fine mediaeval inheritance which women never got hold of. It wasn't theirs.
Joseph Conrad,This magnificent butterfly finds a little heap of dirt and sits still on it; but man will never on his heap of mud keep still.
Joseph Conrad,"Any work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line."
Joseph Conrad,I take it that what all men are really after is some form or perhaps only some formula of peace.
Joseph Conrad,"An artist is a man of action, whether he creates a personality, invents an expedient, or finds the issue of a complicated situation."
Joseph Conrad,"The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much."
Joseph Conrad,A man's real life is that accorded to him in the thoughts of other men by reason of respect or natural love.
Joseph Conrad,Some great men owe most of their greatness to the ability of detecting in those they destine for their tools the exact quality of strength that matters for their work.
Joseph Conrad,"It is not the clear-sighted who rule the world. Great achievements are accomplished in a blessed, warm fog."
Joseph Conrad,"They talk of a man betraying his country, his friends, his sweetheart. There must be a moral bond first. All a man can betray is his conscience."
Joseph Conrad,You shall judge of a man by his foes as well as by his friends.
Joseph Conrad,Going home must be like going to render an account.
Joseph Conrad,"History repeats itself, but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced. It is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird."
Joseph Conrad,"Only in men's imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life."
Joseph Conrad,To a teacher of languages there comes a time when the world is but a place of many words and man appears a mere talking animal not much more wonderful than a parrot.
Joseph Conrad,The sea has never been friendly to man. At most it has been the accomplice of human restlessness.
Joseph Conrad,"The last thing a woman will consent to discover in a man whom she loves, or on whom she simply depends, is want of courage."
Joseph Conrad,"Resignation, not mystic, not detached, but resignation open-eyed, conscious, and informed by love, is the only one of our feelings for which it is impossible to become a sham."
Joseph Conrad,Action is consolatory. It is the enemy of thought and the friend of flattering illusions.
Joseph Conrad,"Truth of a modest sort I can promise you, and also sincerity. That complete, praiseworthy sincerity which, while it delivers one into the hands of one's enemies, is as likely as not to embroil one with one's friends."
Joseph Conrad,"Criticism, that fine flower of personal expression in the garden of letters."
Joseph Conrad,"The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane, and devoted natures; the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement - but it passes away from them. They are not the leaders of a revolution. They are its victims."
Joseph Conrad,It is a maudlin and indecent verity that comes out through the strength of wine.
Joseph Conrad,"I don't like work... but I like what is in work - the chance to find yourself. Your own reality - for yourself, not for others - which no other man can ever know."
Joseph Conrad,"Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it consists principally in dealing with men."
Joseph Conrad,"Facing it, always facing it, that's the way to get through. Face it."
Joseph Conrad,"He who wants to persuade should put his trust not in the right argument, but in the right word. The power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense."
Joseph Conrad,"There are men here and there to whom the whole of life is like an after-dinner hour with a cigar; easy, pleasant, empty, perhaps enlivened by some fable of strife to be forgotten - before the end is told - even if there happens to be any end to it."
Joseph Conrad,"For all that has been said of the love that certain natures (on shore) have professed for it, for all the celebrations it has been the object of in prose and song, the sea has never been friendly to man. At most it has been the accomplice of human restlessness."
Joseph Conrad,You shall judge a man by his foes as well as by his friends.
Joseph Conrad,A man's most open actions have a secret side to them.
Joseph Conrad,"I had ambition not only to go farther than any man had ever been before, but as far as it was possible for a man to go."
Joseph Conrad,A caricature is putting the face of a joke on the body of a truth.
Joseph Conrad,"What all men are really after is some form, or perhaps only some formula, of peace."
Joseph Conrad,"I dare say I am compelled, unconsciously compelled, now to write volume after volume, as in past years I was compelled to go to sea, voyage after voyage. Leaves must follow upon each other as leagues used to follow in the days gone by, on and on to the appointed end, which, being truth itself, is one -- one for all men and for all occupations."
Joseph Conrad,"Nations it may be have fashioned their Governments, but the Governments have paid them back in the same coin."
Joseph Conrad,"It's only those who do nothing that make no mistakes, I suppose"

Joseph Conrad,All a man can betray is his conscience
Joseph Conrad,"We live, as we dream alone"
Joseph Conrad,"There is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea."
Joseph Conrad,"You can t, in sound morals, condemn a man for taking care of his own integrity. It is his clear duty. And least of all can you condemn an artist pursuing, however humbly and imperfectly, a creative aim. In that interior world where his thought and his emotions go seeking for the experience of imagined adventures, there are no policemen, no law, no pressure of circumstance or dread of opinion to keep him within bounds. Who then is going to say Nay to his temptations if not his conscience?"
Joseph Conrad,"Don't talk to me of your Archimedes' lever. He was an absentminded person with a mathematical imagination. Mathematics commands all my respect, but I have no use for engines. Give me the right word and the right accent and I will move the world."
Joseph Conrad,"It is respectable to have illusions - and safe - and profitable, and dull"
Joseph Conrad,"Hang ideas! They are tramps, vagabonds, knocking at the back-door of your mind, each taking a little of your substance, each carrying away some crumb of that belief in a few simple notions you must cling to if you want to live decently and would like to die easy!"
Joseph Conrad,As to honor - you know - it's a very fine mediaeval inheritance which women never got hold of. It wasn't theirs.
Joseph Conrad,"Gossip is what no one claims to like, but everybody enjoys."
Joseph Conrad,"It is not Justice the servant of men, but accident, hazard, Fortune--the ally of patient Time--that holds an even and scrupulous balance."
Joseph Conrad,Between the conception and the creation between the emotion and the response Falls the shadow
Joseph Conrad,"It is very difficult to be wholly joyous or wholly sad on this earth. The comic, when it is human, soon takes upon itself a face of pain; and some of our grieves... have their source in weaknesses which must be recognized with smiling compassion as the common inheritance of us all."
Joseph Conrad,It is to be remarked that a good many people are born curiously unfitted for the fate waiting them on this earth.
Joseph Conrad,"Danger lies in the writer becoming the victim of his own exaggeration, losing the exact notion of sincerity, and in the end coming to despise truth itself as something too cold, too blunt for his purpose -- as, in fact, not good enough for his insistent emotion. From laughter and tears the descent is easy to sniveling and giggles."
Joseph Conrad,What is a novel if not a conviction of our fellow-men's existence strong enough to take upon itself a form of imagined life clearer than reality and whose accumulated verisimilitude of selected episodes puts to shame the pride of documentary history?
Joseph Conrad,The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary: men alone are quite capable of every wickedness
Joseph Conrad,The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary:  men alone are quite capable of every wickedness
Joseph Conrad,"His eyes were naturally heavy; he had an air of having wallowed, fully dressed, all day on an unmade bed."
Joseph Conrad,"For every age is fed on illusions, lest men should renounce life early, and the human race come to an end"
Joseph Conrad,"Each blade of grass has its spot on earth whence it draws its life, its strength; and so is man rooted to the land from which he draws his faith together with his life."
Joseph Conrad,"Woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope, to love - and to put its trust in life."
Joseph Conrad,All ambitions are lawful except those which climb upward on the miseries or credulities of mankind.
Joseph Conrad,Perhaps life is just that... a dream and a fear.
Tony Conrad,What kind of conversation are we having here? I think anybody reading this expects us to be having a very informal kind of exchange.
Tony Conrad,"The message here was not about indeterminacy, nor about immediacy, but about the control of sounds right there in your environment, and the process of composition as long-term growth of interests within that sound complex."
Tony Conrad,"That kind of piece, perhaps most recognizable because of Yoko Ono's similar work, built a bridge between performance art and music - and without raising any awkward social issues."
Tony Conrad,People aren't used to thinking of cultural forms spreading out across the full range of formal interactions - or what is called the text in literary terms.
Tony Conrad,"I've talked with John Cale for two decades about what to do about La Monte, and how to get copies of our work."
Tony Conrad,"But picketing - picketing for or against something, and handing out literature - these are conspicuously formal actions. They have to be understood as indirect communication."
Tony Conrad,"As soon as Young read my statements and saw clearly what I was saying, he stopped communicating with me."
Jody Conradt,"It happened to work out that way. But it was competitive, and there were any number of teams that could have won. It's very much the same situation this season."
Jody Conradt,"The scoring hasn't been what we thought it would be. But if you look at the rest of her line, it's incredible."
Jody Conradt,"Truly, I appreciate everyone recognizing it, but that's not been on my mind. We need to be as sharp as we can be. We need every win possible. That's been my focus."
Jody Conradt,"Truly, I appreciate everyone recognizing it, but that's not been on my mind. What's been on my mind is that our team has to be able to bounce back after games like our disappointing loss to Oklahoma [on Wednesday]. This team is really working hard, and we know what the Texas standard is."
Jody Conradt,Tiffany's competitive and she's relentless. Sometimes she'll try to force some things in double team when we'd be better off kicking it out and finding the open person.
Jody Conradt,Consistency is a big priority for us right now. We're not on the roller coaster we were a few weeks ago.
Jody Conradt,"I don't think there's another team in America that is as hard to guard as they are. They wait until you make a mistake, then they knock down shots better than any team I've played."
Jody Conradt,"We've had a lot of adversity, and I think losing Tiffany was pretty much the final straw tonight. The one intangible that we've been missing with this team is they haven't understood how to stay connected with adversity."
Jody Conradt,I would think extending the court could be one of our biggest changes and something we'll try to take advantage of.
Kevin Conroy,The space is really heating up.

Pat Conroy,"Those wishing to be successful in the market can't ignore the boomer numbers, the wealth and spending power they have. The boomers have redefined every age they've moved through, so there's no reason to believe they will not redefine the stereotypes of what it means to be retired."
Pat Conroy,"My mother saw in 'Gone With the Wind' the text of liberating herself, ... She took 'Gone With the Wind' as the central book in her life, and made it the central book in her family."

Pat Conroy,"Without music, life is a journey through a desert."
Pat Conroy,"Due to strong consumer acceptance of new products, growth for TV and appliance retailers in 2005 was the healthiest of any home furnishings sector. Now that the tax refund cycle is in full swing, retailers in this segment might be well served to monitor inventory levels more efficiently to be sure that the supply is keeping up with demand."

Sean Conway,Senator Allard wants them to look at the Air Force Academy from leadership through process.
Sean Conway,"These women, out of fear of reprisal, contacted Senator Allard for help."
Sean Conway,"They have indicated they are going about the appropriate due diligence, background checks, and I understand they have interviewed him. Senator Allard is pleased that they are looking at an individual on the original list and that the process seems to be moving forward."
Sean Conway,"He                                                                                                                         has said for a long time that it's a national security issue, our reliance on foreign oil, ... We haven't built a new refinery in this country in two decades. I think what's happening here is things are coming home to roost."

John Cook,They were cut down for a better view of the river and for more yard space.
John Cook,We're taking a risk here to see if this works. On paper it's awesome. It's going to give teams fits.
John Cook,"Everyone had the opportunity to give it their best shot, and it sends the wrong message if we reject the bids at this time, ... I would hope the council would support awarding the bids."
John Cook,"It doesn't matter what you're ranked or how good you are, you have to prove it every night."
John Cook,"It's a national championship, so it should be tough. It's got length, it's not a short golf course by any means. It's got all you want. There's a premium on every phase of the game. You have to drive the ball in the fairway, you have to control your irons well and you have to putt well. If you miss the greens around here you will have such a difficult shot that you will have at best five- to 10-footers for par."
John Cook,"I had a good weekend of practice and felt good coming in here because it's a golf course where you don't have to be super long, ... It's playing fast enough that I can reach some of the par 5s in two and on the long par 4s I'm not hitting long irons in. I think I can compete that way."
John Cook,"There's some golf courses that fit my style of play, ... Thank God there's a couple of them left that we play. I can count on one hand how many like those are left."
John Cook,"There's no doubt, when Tiger's playing his best, there's only a Big One. There's him and there's four other guys. When (Tiger) is kind of just OK, that's when you bring Vijay into the mix. He's clearly the world's No. 2."
John Cook,We're just erring on the side of caution. It's a very remote possibility that it is contaminated.
John Cook,"She's gone from not being able to lift the bar, a skinny body that wasn't very strong, ... to now starting to look like a big time college volleyball player - an international level athlete. Hopefully she's going to see great results on the court."
Mark Cook,I'll be running a very grassroots campaign.
Mark Cook,Claire always works hard. She works hard in practice everyday and has done a good job for us so far.
Mark Cook,"The mistakes we made in the past, we want to correct now. When we're in a tight game, we need to be able to talk through them to give our team a chance to win."
Mark Cook,"We did well. I had a lot of kids pull out because we have a meet tomorrow. We took kids out, so I knew we would probably lose the meet. We're just getting ready for tomorrow, so we can run well."
Mark Cook,"I think we did really well tonight, we had to move some kids around and put them in some different events. We got some kids taking on a couple more events than they usually do. We're using this for conditioning and they responded really well."
Mark Cook,"From a coach's perspective, the glass is always half full. We're pleased with the improvement, but we need to correct the mistakes we're still making."
Mark Cook,"Everybody knows now that when you come into our gym, we're not giving up an easy win. If you beat us here, you're going to earn it."
Mark Cook,"We're familiar with the two teams, and it's a comfortable environment to have the two teams that we know really well. Neither one is going to fold under pressure and we are going to have to step up and take our best shot."
Mark Cook,He really threw well. He threw a lot of pitches there. He just hung in there. Our defense is still struggling a little bit. We had those errors and acted like we wanted to give it to them. We tried everything we could to give it to them.
Mark Cook,"According to some polls, we have the sixth-hardest schedule in the country. Our philosophy is to be the best, you have to compete against the best."
Mark Cook,"This is a culmination of a lot of teams' seasons, and we're excited for our community, our university, our team and our fans."
Mark Cook,"Williamson A.M. will celebrate its 10th anniversary this fall, and the community weeklies serving Brentwood-Nolensville, Franklin and the rural county and Spring Hill-Thompson's Station will be two years old. All are evolving and we hope to continue to get better at serving our audience groups and the greater community interest through them."
Mark Cook,"The idea that the digital camera is mature is, I believe, a naive view. We are just in the early days of what a processor behind a lens can do."
Robin Cook,"We want to ensure there is an end to drug trafficking and an end to the violence, ... Britain is keen to support Colombia."
Robin Cook,It is clear from weekend reports that the violence in Kosovo has continued. We do not accept that this is merely an internal matter.
Robin Cook,"We don't trust him. Of course we don't trust him. That's precisely why the critical element for us in any deal that can stick would be mechanisms to make sure he can't go back on it,"
Robin Cook,"It's a clear signs of the weakness of the regime ... that it's afraid to let her travel,"
Robin Cook,"I think it would probably be fair to say that there was a selection of evidence to support the conclusion rather than a conclusion that arose from a full consideration of the evidence,"
Robin Cook,"Saddam alone is to blame for his people's suffering. It is a myth that UN policy prevents the delivery of food and medicines.

Robin Cook,"I have to say that I will not accept the criticism that has been emanating from Belgrade from the very people who organize the mass ethnic cleansing of Kosovo, who have caused thousands of civilian deaths in Kosovo, and who have displaced from their homes hundreds of thousands of people in Kosovo, ... How dare they produce crocodile tears for people killed in the conflict for which they themselves are responsible."

Robin Cook,"We are trying to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, ... We do not want to use force. But we will not let Saddam Hussein continue to obstruct the U.N. inspection teams."

Alistair Cooke,"It has been an unchallengeable American doctrine that cranberry sauce, a pink goo with overtones of sugared tomatoes, is a delectable necessity of the Thanksgiving board and that turkey is uneatable without it.

Anderson Cooper,"Excuse me, Senator, I'm sorry for interrupting,"
Anderson Cooper,"I questioned some of the things I saw, such things as leaving inmates in their cell with no clothes or in female underpants, handcuffing them to the door of their cell. And the answer I got was, this is how the military intelligence wants it done."

Anderson Cooper,Do you get the anger that is out here?
Anderson Cooper,"The thing I love about reporting is being able to blend in with any group, whether that's neo-Nazis or pedophiles."

Anderson Cooper,"I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it."

Don Cooper,The level of competition in Cuba isn't the same as it is in the major leagues. It's about Triple-A. Contreras went (to New York) and was expected to win right away and that wasn't realistic.
Don Cooper,"We just kept making quality pitches against a quality lineup,"
Don Cooper,"He's a good, quality guy, and we have to get him back to when he was at his best, which looks like when he was with Montreal. It's nice to have that sort of quality you can count on.

Don Cooper,"They went through the last two years something I wouldn't wish on anybody because of all their physical problems, ... That's an amazing job Mel did. Maybe the only job in baseball as complicated as managing the Yankees is being pitching coach for the Yankees."
Don Cooper,"I don't [care] what he uses, as long as at the end of the night we've got six, seven, eight innings out of his [butt] with a chance to win the game. We've been picking it up as a staff.

Don Cooper,"He's got toughness, heart and he's pretty calm. He's been in some pretty big moments for a 24-year-old guy coming up from Double-A. And he's really handled it."
Don Cooper,"Any time a pitching staff does well, I think the first thing you've got to look at is the defense and right along with that you've got to look at the catching. The catcher holds the brain. He's the guy that everybody is looking at to be the leader and take control of the game and keep that pace going. With A.J. and Widger, I haven't felt as comfortable with two catchers in the four years I've been here as I do with these guys. They remember the game plan and they carry it out. That's one of the reasons why we've had the kind of pitching staff we've had this year."
Don Cooper,"Let's face it, there was a lot of criticism when he started in New York. I've been saying, if that would have ruined his career, then he's not the guy we thought he was anyway. And we've all seen first-hand that's not the case."
Don Cooper,His confidence is where it needs to be.
Don Cooper,"We're just like 'Boys Town,'  ... We believe there's no such thing as a bad boy."

John Cooper,I married a monster from outer space
John Cooper,"Having this service to Salt Lake City will open a new world of visitor and meeting markets for us, not only in Utah but for all the connecting cities Delta serves. In the past we focused largely north and south for visitors. Now we can look to the east."

Kyle Cooper,Mother Nature has been an incredible bull. It's hard to imagine a scenario more bullish than we've had.
Kyle Cooper,"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks. Long term I think we're headed to $30 to $35, but I don't think we're doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left."
Kyle Cooper,It's all about Mother Nature.
Kyle Cooper,The recovery continues to be slow. Government reserves will more than make up for reduced production but they will eventually have to be replaced. This will probably end up being the most damaging storm to the industry by far.
Kyle Cooper,"Uncertainty and fear abound in this market, and thus outright short positions remain highly at risk."
Kyle Cooper,Wilma weakened a little bit and the path has it heading in a direction that won't impact oil production.
Kyle Cooper,"[Meanwhile Chavez is picking fights with foreign oil companies  including Shell, ExxonMobil, Repsol YPF, Chevron, BP, and Total that have been working in Venezuela for years. Thirty-two publicly traded oil companies are accused of owing Venezuela $4 billion in back taxes for overproduction  something they deny. This follows Venezuela's hikes in production royalties from 1% to 16.7% in October, hikes in taxes on operating agreements from 32% to 50% in April, and a declared end to contracted dollar payments to foreign oil field operators in May.] The desire to operate in Venezuela, ... is fading fast."

Roy Cooper,"We must not permit anyone in the gasoline supply chain to profit from a natural disaster by taking advantage of consumers,"
Roy Cooper,"Trying to profit from a natural disaster or other crisis is wrong, and I hope that North Carolina businesses won't stoop to that level, ...

Roy Cooper,"Trying to profit from a natural disaster or other crisis is wrong, and I hope that North Carolina businesses won't stoop to that level,"
Sherry Cooper,"Clearly the new paradigm is alive and well, ... While (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan downplayed the policy significance of CPI in his remarks last night, it is still a major positive for investors that core inflation remains benign."
Sherry Cooper,"The repercussions on global trade would be devastating, ... Given that virtually all major economies have a surplus with the (United States), trade disruptions would shutter manufacturing plants and curtail global demand for most commodities."

Sherry Cooper,"This is still a very strong retail sales report,"
Sherry Cooper,"We wouldn't want everyone to go running out and dump all their investments and bury cash in their mattresses, because it would only accelerate the crisis - at least the financial crisis. But I don't believe people would do that anyway."
Sherry Cooper,"The Canadian poultry industry is, in general, little dependent on exports or imports, but new provincial rules forcing the confinement of birds make the practice of free-range raising more difficult."
Sherry Cooper,"There has obviously been quite a bit of dissension as to the governmental policies, the slashing in fiscal expenditure, potential tax increases, as well as the astronomical increases in interest rates."
Sherry Cooper,"All in all, the year-over-year trend in income jumped to 6.1 percent from 5.4 percent, suggesting that consumer fundamentals remain very strong, ... Consumer spending remains on a tear."
Sherry Cooper,"Worry not, the longest expansion in American history still has legs."
Sherry Cooper,"The Fed and the markets will see few signs of slowing in these figures, but little reason to fear an impending inflation acceleration either ,"
Sherry Cooper,"I do not want to generate fear unnecessarily,"
Sherry Cooper,"There is no longer a shadow of doubt that the U.S. economy is downshifting rapidly; the only question is how deep the slowdown goes. We do not expect to see recession in 2001, but we certainly expect to see significantly slower growth with continued moderating inflation."
Sherry Cooper,"There is no longer a shadow of doubt that the U.S. economy is downshifting rapidly; the only question is how deep the slowdown goes, ... We do not expect to see recession in 2001, but we certainly expect to see significantly slower growth with continued moderating inflation."
Sherry Cooper,"Wages are still running a bit hot for comfort, the jobless rate is still quite low and the underlying trend in employment (especially full-time) remains strong."
Sherry Cooper,"The Christmas season this year might well bring cheer, but consumption growth next year is bound to slow, ... From an annual pace of nearly 4.0 percent in 2004, consumer spending will likely grow at a 3.5 percent rate this year, decelerating to a 2.25 percent pace in 2006."
Sherry Cooper,"(Today's data) will likely keep the Bank of Canada on track for a rate hike at next week's decision,"
Sherry Cooper,"[Even so,] While sales are slightly below their peak levels of late 1998, this sector has hardly suffered a body blow from the run-up in long-term mortgage rates, ... Until the housing sector slows significantly, it is far too premature to look for a broad-based slowing in the economy."
Sherry Cooper,Birth rates would plunge and the average age of the population would increase significantly.
Sherry Cooper,"What little data I've seen suggests that only about 25 percent of businesses have taken deliberate, serious action. And certainly the larger corporations would be the ones that would begin the process. Let's face it, a small company probably would not have the capability of taking very dramatic action."
Tommy Cooper,"I had a dream last night, I was eating a ten pound marshmallow. I woke up this morning and the pillow was gone."
Tommy Cooper,"It's strange, isn't it. You stand in the middle of a library and go aaaaagghhhh' and everyone just stares at you. But you do the same thing on an aeroplane, and everyone joins in."
Tommy Cooper,Wild Turkey is my friend. Old friends can meet any time. They're easy together like that. I poured myself a large one and lit a Benny. Brunch.
Tommy Cooper,"A woman tells her doctor, 'I've got a bad back.' The doctor says, 'It's old age.' The woman says, 'I want a second opinion.' The doctor says: 'Okay - you're ugly as well.'"
Tommy Cooper,"Well, my wife and I were married in a toilet - it was a marriage of convenience!"
Tommy Cooper,"Police arrested two kids yesterday, one was drinking battery acid, the other was eating fireworks. They charged one and let the other one off."
Tommy Cooper,"So I rang up a local building firm, I said 'I want a skip outside my house.' He said 'I'm not stopping you.'"
Tommy Cooper,"So I was getting into my car, and this bloke says to me Can you give me a lift? I said Sure, you look great, the world's your oyster, go for it."
Tommy Cooper,So he said 'I'm going to chop off the bottom of one of your trouser legs and put it in a library.' I thought 'That's a turn-up for the books.'
Tommy Cooper,I went window shopping today! I bought four windows.
Tommy Cooper,Last night I dreamt I ate a ten pound marshmallow. When I woke up the pillow was gone.
Tommy Cooper,"I went into a French restaraunt and asked the waiter, 'Have you got frog's legs?' He said, 'Yes,' so I said, 'Well hop into the kitchen and get me a cheese sandwich.'"
Tommy Cooper,I used to be indecisive but now I am not quite sure.
Tommy Cooper,"A blind bloke walks into a shop with a guide dog. He picks the Dog up and starts swinging it around his head. Alarmed, a shop assistant calls out: 'Can I help, sir?' 'No thanks,' says the blind bloke. 'Just looking.'"
Tommy Cooper,"You know, somebody actually complimented me on my driving today. They left a little note on the windscreen, it said 'Parking Fine.'"
David Cope,That's something we talked about. Can our final pass be a quality one that creates another pass for somebody else.
David Cope,"We were talking about doing the Deion Sanders thing, trying to get a police escort to bring them back from the track meet."
David Cope,Both were great goals. I don't think our keeper was at fault on either one.
David Cope,"It was three long trips, and we came out of it with 20 goals for and three against. You can't argue with that. It was a great team bonding experience. I think we're a better team coming out of it than we were going into it."
David Cope,We thought it was not too bad. Steamboat allowed three goals to Delta. We gave up two. Steamboat let in one against Glenwood. We shut them out.
David Cope,"Six goals this week, you'd think we'd have lost a game,"
David Cope,"We created a lot of chances to score some goals, but we may have to be more efficient against Steamboat. It could be that we create five chances and get one goal."
David Cope,"I thought they showed a lot of class. Julia's chasing the record (of 24 goals in a year previously held by Christina Aiello), and gives up the ball to Erika Ghent on the first goal. In the situation she was in, she could have just easily turned and scored, but she gave up a decent scoring opportunity to give Erika a great one."
David Cope,"Looming on the horizon is Rifle. I think it's unlikely that any of the boys are going to get Andy Banner's (single-season scoring) record this year. But, they have a chance to do something that last year's team didn't do by beating Rifle on the road."
David Cope,I think there's a lot of motivation on the part of our boys. They know the importance of it seeding-wise and it's a chance to go down on a nice field and play a quality opponent. The boys are really excited for it.
David Cope,"Their game against Aspen was snowed out. We've had a lot of training sessions, so that's been an advantage. I certainly expect it to be closer against Eagle the second time."
Alvin Copeland,I'm pleased with our performance. Especially after not knowing what to expect going in.
Alvin Copeland,What hurt us the most was missed key rebounds and easy baskets.
Alvin Copeland,It hurt us to lose by one point to Perry. I told the it would come down to that.
Alvin Copeland,"The last time they beat us in the Christmas tournament, they said we played tired. We wanted to make sure that didn't happen again."
Aaron Copland,"Here were the tart herbs of plain American speech, the pasture, without the flowers of elocution... the clean rhythms... the irony and the homespun tenderness that, in a fine perforation, reached a sustained exaltation."
Aaron Copland,"There is something about music that keeps its distance even at the moment that it engulfs us. It is at the same time outside and away from us and inside and part of us. In one sense it dwarfs us, and in another we master it. We are led on and on, and yet in some strange way we never lose control."
Aaron Copland,Listening to the Fifth Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams is like staring at a cow for forty-five minutes
Aaron Copland,"When I speak of the gifted listener, I am thinking of the nonmusician primarily, of the listener who intends to retain his amateur status. It is the thought of just such a listener that excites the composer in me."
Aaron Copland,"You compose because you want to somehow summarize in some permanent form your most basic feelings about being alive, to set down ... some sort of permanent statement about the way it feels to live now, today."
Aaron Copland,"Inspiration may be a form of super-consciousness, or perhaps of subconsciousness - I wouldn't know. But I am sure it is the antithesis of self-consciousness."
Aaron Copland,"So long as the human spirit thrives on this planet, music in some living form will accompany and sustain it and give it expressive meaning."
Aaron Copland,"To stop the flow of music would be like the stopping of time itself, incredible and inconceivable."
Steve Coppell,Our goalkeeper was the biggest factor. He made four top-quality saves and they also hit the woodwork. Marcus has been terrific for us. He is a terrific kicker and superb shot-stopper. He has the World Cup in his sights [with the USA] and his performances need to reflect that.
Steve Coppell,The second-half performance reflected what we've been about all season. It was in stark contrast to the attempted exhibition stuff of the first half.
Steve Coppell,They are a unique blend of players who have been able to achieve a high level of performance over a long period of time.
Steve Coppell,You can count on the fingers of one hand the number of mistakes he's made that have cost us goals. Over two and a half seasons for any manager to say that about his goalkeeper is exceptional. He's been top quality.
Steve Coppell,He's been injured most of the season. You saw an awful lot of pent-up emotion when he scored. He's spent a lot of time in the treatment room and gym.
Steve Coppell,"Complacency is not on our agenda. It is certainly not our biggest danger. My players have worked very hard for what they have achieved so far. They will not allow that to creep in. Neither myself, nor the coaching staff have to do anything to prevent that. They do it themselves."
David Copperfield,"It's a program that uses magic as a form of therapy for people with disabilities, where magic is taught to patients in hospitals to help them regain their dexterity and their coordination by learning sleight of hand, in addition to boosting the patient's self-esteem by giving them a skill that an able-bodied person doesn't even have."
David Copperfield,"This whole show is about people's dreams, making them come true. The whole basis of it is, nobody dreams of pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Nobody dreams of vanishing the Statue of Liberty unless they're me, but . . . I'll do a whole piece about having your perfect dream car, making cars appear and motorcycles appear ? people dream about that. People dream about traveling, so I'll vanish somebody in the audience and make them appear on the beach in Hawaii during the show, with proof, with signatures, with Polaroid pictures, so they know it's happening in real time."
David Copperfield,He encouraged me to make every illusion about my personal dreams and my personal nightmares. So I took that idea and made it about everyone else's dreams . . . It's very moving and very emotional.
David Copperfield,"Magic came very easy for me when I was a kid. When I was 8 years old I started doing it, and by the time I was 12, I was already published in magic books."
David Copperfield,I'm just waiting for people to start asking me to make the rain disappear.
David Copperfield,The real secret of magic lies in the performance.

Francis Ford Coppola,"Roger Corman exploited all of the young people who worked for him, but he really gave you responsibility and opportunity. So it was kind of a fair deal."

Francis Ford Coppola,"Listen, if there's one sure-fire rule that I have learned in this business, it's that I don't know anything about human nature."
Francis Ford Coppola,"It's ironic that at age 32, at probably the greatest moment of my career, with The Godfather having such an enormous success, I wasn't even aware of it, because I was somewhere else under the deadline again."
Francis Ford Coppola,"I wrote the script of Patton. I had this very bizarre opening where he stands up in front of an American flag and gives this speech. Ultimately, I was fired. When the script was done, they hired another writer and that script was forgotten."

Francis Ford Coppola,"I made this movie for $40,000, which was this little black-and-white horror film called Dementia 13, which we made in about nine days."
Francis Ford Coppola,I landed a job with Roger Corman. The job was to write the English dialogue for a Russian science fiction picture. I didn't speak any Russian. He didn't care whether I could understand what they were saying; he wanted me to make up dialogue.
Francis Ford Coppola,"I had been a kid that moved so much, I didn't have a lot of friends. Theater really represented camaraderie."
Francis Ford Coppola,"I had an older brother who was very interested in literature, so I had an early exposure to literature, and and theater. My father sometimes would work in musical comedies."
Francis Ford Coppola,"I had a number of very strong personalities in my family. My father was a concert flutist, the solo flute for Toscanini."
Francis Ford Coppola,I had a number of teachers who hated me. I didn't do well in school.
Francis Ford Coppola,"I had a heartbreaking experience when I was 9. I always wanted to be a guard. The most wonderful girl in the world was a guard. When I got polio and then went back to school, they made me a guard. A teacher took away my guard button."
Francis Ford Coppola,"I became quite successful very young, and it was mainly because I was so enthusiastic and I just worked so hard at it."
Francis Ford Coppola,"I always found the film world unpleasant. It's all about the schedule, and never really flew for me."
Francis Ford Coppola,George Lucas doesn't have the most physical stamina. He was so unhappy making Star Wars that he just vowed he'd never do it again.
Francis Ford Coppola,"Frank Capra was a prop man, I think. John Ford was a prop man. It was a little bit of a father and son thing, and you kind of worked your way up."
Francis Ford Coppola,Anything you build on a large scale or with intense passion invites chaos.
Francis Ford Coppola,A number of images put together a certain way become something quite above and beyond what any of them are individually.
Francis Ford Coppola,"The stuff that I got in trouble for, the casting for The Godfather or the flag scene in Patton, was the stuff that was remembered, and was considered the good work."
Francis Ford Coppola,"The essence of cinema is editing. It's the combination of what can be extraordinary images of people during emotional moments, or images in a general sense, put together in a kind of alchemy."
Francis Ford Coppola,"You have to really be courageous about your instincts and your ideas. Otherwise you'll just knuckle under, and things that might have been memorable will be lost."

Francis Ford Coppola,"Usually, the stuff that's your best idea or work is going to be attacked the most."

Francis Ford Coppola,I liked to work in a shop down in the basement and invent things and build gadgets.
Francis Ford Coppola,"I associate my motion picture career more with being unhappy and scared, or being under the gun, than with anything pleasant."
Francis Ford Coppola,"I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated. The very earliest people who made film were magicians."

Francis Ford Coppola,I don't think there's any artist of any value who doesn't doubt what they're doing.
Sofia Coppola,"Tokyo is so hectic, but inside the hotel it's very silent. And the design of it is interesting. It's weird to have this New York bar... the jazz singer... the French restaurant, all in Tokyo. It's this weird combination of different cultures."
Sofia Coppola,A lot of young filmmakers bring their movies to my dad because he always gives lots of good editing ideas and notes. He'd be a good film professor.
Sofia Coppola,Everyone in my family is in the film business; I knew I wanted to be creative and it was important in my family to be artistic.
Sofia Coppola,I wanted to make a love story without being nerdy.
Jeff Corbett,"The Amgen Tour of California provides a great stage to show the strength of our team. And with the team and our title sponsor - as well as a number of our industry sponsors - based in California, we intend to make a good showing during the race."
Jeff Corbett,"We always put a lot of pressure on ourselves; I mean we never go into a race looking to [do] anything other than win and this is no exception. We've been in the area, checking all the different climbs and hazards that may surprise some of the teams in the middle of the race. We'll be ready for this race."
Jeff Corbett,Every one of the (16) teams is stacked with talent. The teams that take the race seriously -- those who take the time and effort to check out each stage ahead of time -- will have the best success.
Jeff Corbett,"There are 10-20 names that have the fitness to win the race, and Chris would have to be one of them. Chris is just a big engine, a locomotive, a diesel ... with long femurs and huge quadriceps who has the horsepower."
Tim Corbin,"I hope it gives us a little bit of confidence, but it's only the fourth game of the season. The situation today was really miserable for both teams, but we scored nine runs early which carried us through. I wish we could have hit a little better after the fourth inning, but we didn't. We just have to keep working and practicing hard."
Tim Corbin,We're very happy with Ryan Flaherty and his performance today. He had a big triple and also added a single and double in his three at-bats. Ryan did a great job at the plate today.
Tim Corbin,"Baseball is one of those games where if you do the right things, it will come back to you."

Roger Corman,"Motion pictures are the art form of the 20th century, and one of the reasons is the fact that films are a slightly corrupted artform. They fit this century - they combine Art and business!"
Roger Corman,"When I started in the late 1950s, every film I made - no matter how low the budget - got a theatrical release. Today, less that 20-percent of our films get a theatrical release."
Roger Corman,"Other writers, producers, and directors of low-budget films would often put down the film they were making, saying it was just something to make money with. I never felt that. If I took the assignment, I'd give it my best shot."
Roger Corman,"Jim Cameron is proof that if you are good, you'll get promoted."
Roger Corman,"As a producer, I probably am a little stronger than most, since I was a director originally."
Roger Corman,One of the worst things you can do is have a limited budget and try to do some big looking film. That's when you end up with very bad work.

Chris Cornell,"[You see, if the guys in Audioslave are going to take the time to make a video, they're not going to just settle for the same tired concept that's been recycled a hundred times over, but with a different cast of brooding and sordid characters. There needs to be something unique  and whenever possible, something germane.] Most of the time, reading through treatments, it's like it could be any band, any song  it doesn't matter that it's you or your song, ... The ideas are completely disconnected from the music and the image of the band."
Chris Cornell,irreconcilable conflict of interest.
Chris Cornell,"And if you dont believe the sun will rise, stand alone and greet the coming night in the last remaining light."

Ezra Cornell,Idleness is to the human mind like rust to iron.

Marius Corpus,There was a request for police assistance but it was only that. That was the problem.

Lee Corso,"Tyrone Willingham will do a tremendous job, ... He will represent the school the way it should be represented. Washington is not a good job right now, it's a lousy job. He wouldn't be there if it was a good job. He could build that into a good program. He can do it, and he'll do it the right way."
Lee Corso,They smacked that Oklahoma team (for the national title) in what was the single most impressive one-game performance I've ever seen.
Lee Corso,I said it three or four times during the season. They were the most complete football team in the nation. They were better all-around than Southern Cal. I didn't care how many points Southern Cal averaged.
Lee Corso,"When you look at naming the father of Florida State football, it should be Tom Nugent, and I say that without any disrespect for Coach (Bobby) Bowden. In his thinking as a coach, Tom Nugent was ahead of his time, and I mean light years ahead of everybody."

Bill Cosby,You can turn painful situations through laughter.

Bill Cosby,"Is the glass half full, or half empty?It depends on whether you're pouring, or drinking."
Bill Cosby,And to those people with no children but who think they'd like to have them some day to fulfill their lives. Remember: With fulfillment comes responsibility.
Bill Cosby,"A father . . . knows exactly what those boys at the mall have in their depraved little minds because he once owned such a depraved little mind himself. In fact, if he thinks enough about the plans that he used to have for young girls, the father not only will support his wife in keeping their daughter home but he might even run over to the mall and have a few of those boys arrested."
Bill Cosby,You can never give complete authority and overall power to anyone until trust can be proven.
Bill Cosby,"As I have discovered by examining my past, I started out as a child. Coincidentally, so did my brother. My mother did not put all her eggs in one basket, so to speak: she gave me a younger brother named Russell, who taught me what was meant by survival of the fittest."

Bill Cosby,"Parents are not interested in justice, they're interested in peace and quiet."
Bill Cosby,"Nothing separates the generations more than music. By the time a child is eight or nine, he has developed a passion for his own music that is even stronger than his passions for procrastination and weird clothes."
Bill Cosby,"Every closed eye is not sleeping, and every open eye is not seeing."

Bill Cosby,The main goal of the future is to stop violence. The world is addicted to it.
Bill Cosby,"A new father quickly learns that his child invariably comes to the bathroom at precisely the times when he's in there, as if he needed company. The only way for this father to be certain of bathroom privacy is to shave at the gas station."

Bill Cosby,"Even though your kids will consistently do the exact opposite of what you're telling them to do, you have to keep loving them just as much."
Bill Cosby,Nothing I've ever done has given me more joys and rewards than being a father to my children.
Bill Cosby,The truth is that parents are not really interested in justice. They just want quiet.
Bill Cosby,"The essence of childhood, of course, is play, which my friends and I did endlessly on streets that we reluctantly shared with traffic."
Bill Cosby,"Through humor, you can soften some of the worst blows that life delivers. And once you find laughter, no matter how painful your situation might be, you can survive it."
Bill Cosby,"The past is a ghost, the future a dream, and all we ever have is now."
Bill Cosby,"No matter how calmly you try to referee, parenting will eventually produce bizarre behavior, and I'm not talking about the kids. Their behavior is always normal."
Bill Cosby,The very first law in advertising is to avoid the concrete promise and cultivate the delightfully vague.
Bill Cosby,Advertising is the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
Bill Cosby,Women don't want to hear what you think. Women want to hear what they think - in a deeper voice.
Bill Cosby,Men and women belong to different species and communications between them is still in its infancy.
Bill Cosby,"In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure."
Bill Cosby,"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody."
Bill Cosby,"You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it."
Bill Cosby,There is hope for the future because God has a sense of humor and we are funny to God.
Bill Cosby,Human beings are the only creatures on earth that allow their children to come back home.
Bill Cosby,Fatherhood is pretending the present you love most is soap-on-a-rope.
Bill Cosby,People can be more forgiving than you can imagine. But you have to forgive yourself. Let go of what's bitter and move on.
Bill Cosby,"When you become senile, you won't know it."
Bill Cosby,"Like everyone else who makes the mistake of getting older, I begin each day with coffee and obituaries."
Peter Cosgrove,"I'm very relieved about the low cost in human terms with violence virtually stopping after our arrival, low cost in lives to INTERFET and our adversaries,"
Peter Cosgrove,"He's not a 40-minute a night guy, no one is at that level. But he has done that on occasion."
Peter Cosgrove,"When there is an adequate Iraqi security force, foreign troops leave ... Iraq,"
Sean Coste,"Even when we were running and trying to get the ball up the court a little bit, we were still struggling and converting shots."
Sean Coste,"As a team, everybody did a real nice job."
Sean Coste,We had a good season. The girls worked hard. They came back and fought all season. It's good that they never gave up all season long. They fought right to the last second. It's a good way to go through and finish a game.
Sean Coste,The girls have been playing well. I know they were hungry to finish that and finish with four wins in a row. They played hard. The difference was Dallas ran a 2-3 zone and plugged up the middle and pushed on us in the middle and kind of pushed us out. We couldn't shoot it.
Sean Coste,"I think in the second half of the season, the girls have played aggressive and strong. They've executed better. We haven't come away with wins in all of them. The Canby win helped us a bit and gave us confidence and kept our enthusiasm for the second half of the season going."
Sean Coste,I think the girls go into every game believing they can beat the team and play them tough. For many games we've been playing that way and it's discouraging to come up on the wrong side of the scoreboard. Then at the same time at practice these guys are working on things and staying committed.
Sean Coste,I think our girls played smart tonight. We played a decent game.
Sean Coste,The girls fought back hard but they just ran out of time.
Sean Coste,"It was a matter of converting some plays at the end. Too bad, because the girls really fought hard in the second half. It gives us a look at where we can be if we play that aggressively offensively and with a lot of passion defensively like we did in the second half."
Sean Coste,"In the second half, the girls came out with a lot of intensity and really turned it up. They were aggressive. We got to the basket a lot more. Danielle hit some outside shots and really shot well in the second half. We had some good defensive stops on the other end. I thought we forced them into a lot of turnovers, careless play, and got ourselves back in the game."
Peter Costello,The progress is gradual and I think it will be some time before China has a floating currency as we know it.
Peter Costello,"In the Year 2525, if man is still alive..."
Peter Costello,There is one law we are all expected to abide by.
Peter Costello,"I think it could be done in a clean, safe way to deliver cheap energy and we in Australia have the energy they need."
Irwin Cotler,We are making a clear statement today about the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender.
Irwin Cotler,"Judges look at the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender in determining sentences,"
Irwin Cotler,"Research shows mandatory minimums don't serve as a deterrent and actually have the opposite effect,"
Irwin Cotler,"I would characterize you as a brilliant jurist, as having a remarkable intelligence, a prolific writer and a man of the highest integrity."
Tom Coughlin,"Steve Smith had a great year, no question. Even more so when you think that every team has it on their checklist to do something about Steve Smith. The other day we gave up a lot of passing yardage to some outstanding receivers. But our No. 1 thing will still be to stop the run. That's where we start."
Tom Coughlin,"It was a very poor performance by our team. We fumbled the opening kickoff, had a punt returned against us for a touchdown, a kickoff returned, an interception when we were knocking on the goal line. It's beyond belief that we would play that poorly."
Tom Coughlin,"It was a very poor performance by our team, ... We fumbled the opening kickoff, had a punt returned against us for a touchdown, a kickoff returned, an interception when we were knocking on the goal line. It's beyond belief that we would play that poorly."
Tom Coughlin,We're gathering information [on Peterson]. There are a lot of options available to us at this time. There's a possibility that it's something that may need to be watched over the next four to six weeks. We'll just have to look at the facts and make those decisions.
Tom Coughlin,"We earned the right to play this game at home, and that is very important. As we have come down the stretch, starting with the Dallas game in early December, our home crowd has unquestionably been a factor in our performance. Our team feeds off the crowd, and we have been able to energize the crowd with our performance."
Tom Coughlin,His last couple of weeks have been generally positive. He was good under fire against the Patriots last week.
Tom Coughlin,"Any time there's a player of that caliber out there, you have to give it due diligence. Beyond that, we haven't done a whole lot of discussing it."
Tom Coughlin,"They're using them very well. Both compliment each other and they both seem to have outstanding yardage, yet neither one of them has an overly amount of carries."
Tom Coughlin,"Kevin's a great coach and the hands-on guy that's taken Eli through all the mental processes. Being his position coach, it's Kevin's responsibility to teach him how to conduct his business and how to accept his role as a team leader."
Tom Coughlin,It was a choice that Kerry made that was best for him and his family and his future. And so we tried to do the best we could with it.
Tom Coughlin,"He's come in every day after throwing 70, 75 balls and not had any problem. I don't expect it to be any different. We'll advance along accordingly. There's no limitations [on Manning]."
Tom Coughlin,He's an incredible athlete and a guy whose conditioning really has been a measuring stick for everybody in this league. It is so easy for us to point to Jerry Rice when we are trying to make a strong message with a player who we may not feel is as serious about his game as he should be.
Tom Coughlin,"First and foremost, he's an outstanding athlete. He has to be or else he wouldn't be in this position. He takes great care of himself. He's a competitor by nature. He has a great sense of humor, which I think keeps everything in perspective for him, good or bad. But, to play as long as he has played and to be on the verge of breaking these records is a tremendous accomplishment. For someone to be in a position that he's in and having done this for so many years and continue to be excited about coming to work every day and the opportunities he has is really a remarkable thing."
Tom Coughlin,"You're at home, you are in a comfortable surrounding, you have your fans, and you have the ability to control the noise much better, ... Noise is a factor."
Fred Couples,I was mediocre and I put Tiger in some tough spots. Certainly I enjoyed playing with Tiger and Retief and Adam but I just didn't play well. Your shortcomings show in the alternate shot format and playing with the best player in the world it showed today. I couldn't help Tiger at all.
Fred Couples,Your shortcomings show in the alternate shot (format) and playing with the best player in the world it showed today. I couldn't help Tiger at all.
Fred Couples,I don't see him slowing down. He's got more talent than almost anyone in the game.
Fred Couples,"He's an incredible player. He's got more talent than maybe anyone out here in his hands and his game. Phil can overpower a golf course like Tiger can. He drove it really, really well today."
Fred Couples,"I feel great. I haven't played 31 holes in a long time, but I'll go home and rest and start again like it's a new day."
Fred Couples,"It's hard. It's very, very hard. If we went and played Pinehurst next week, it would be a piece of cake after this."
Fred Couples,"In my opinion, for Phil it was reckless abandon. I don't think he played crazy golf. But when your eye sees a shot and you hit it, it's a lot of fun. When you don't hit it, you've made a mistake. He may have lost a few tournaments by doing that, but he has won a few by doing it, too. It's just when you try to do it in a major, it can backfire pretty quickly."
Fred Couples,He's a much better player. He hits the ball much better. He gets it around the golf course. He works hard and he's got a great short game.
Fred Couples,"But No. 4, I just felt like under the wrong circumstances, it's just going to be awfully hard. But everyone's got to do it. Stronger players can maybe hit a 3-iron up high and stop it. But with the utility clubs, those go just as high and soft. There will be a bit of club changing."
Fred Couples,"I saw a doctor and got some stuff, and today I didn't really hit many balls on the range. I kind of just screwed around. I love the course, and I figured no matter how bad I felt I could get around and have a decent score."
Fred Couples,Age is a factor. I just feel like I can save a shot or two on the course if everything is going OK and you're into the round. It seems like I've had really good finishes here and my length has been a key to that. But I still have to go out and hit the ball. It doesn't help me if I'm playing it from the shrubs.
Fred Couples,"Here, age is a huge factor. I've played a bunch. I feel like I can save a shot or two on the course if everything is going OK and you are into the round."
Fred Couples,"In a tournament like this, I don't know if there are that many young guys here. Here, the age is a huge factor. I just feel like I can save a shot or two on the course if everything's going well."
Fred Couples,"This is my favorite course. If you hit the ball a long way, you have a bit of an advantage."
Jim Courier,We are excited to launch the Champions Cup Series and unveil another high quality tennis property in the United States.
Jim Courier,They are two similar players. They're both power baseliners. Neither overpowers you with their serve but they try to place it well.

Jim Courier,"His day is done, and now we're doing it. And we're doing it pretty well and not with fingers in the air and our hands on our crotches."
Jim Courier,"I really try not to read the tennis articles, because a lot of times they're guessing at how a player is feeling, and I like to keep myself kind of open minded about how I'm feeling, rather than have someone else explain to me what's going on."
Jim Courier,"Unbelievable, yet, what else could it be?"
Jim Courier,It is very dangerous to have your self-worth riding on your results as an athlete.

Victor Cousin,"All truly historical peoples have an idea they must realize, and when they have sufficiently exploited it at home, they export it, in a certain way, by war; they make it tour the world."
Norman Cousins,The sense of paralysis proceeds not so much out of the mammoth size of the problem but out of the puniness of the purpose.
Norman Cousins,Ten minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep
Norman Cousins,Laughter is a form of internal jogging. It moves your internal organs around. It enhances respiration. It is an igniter of great expectations.
Norman Cousins,People who develop the habit of thinking of themselves as world citizens are fulfilling the first requirement of sanity in our time
Norman Cousins,All things are possible once enough human beings realize that the whole of the human future is at stake
Norman Cousins,Laughter is a powerful way to tap positive emotions
Norman Cousins,The purpose of education is to enable us to develop to the fullest that which is inside us
Norman Cousins,"In a democracy, the individual enjoys not only the ultimate power but carries the ultimate responsibility"
Norman Cousins,Man is not imprisoned by habit. Great changes in him can be wrought by crisis -- once that crisis can be recognized and understood.

Norman Cousins,"All this sensory input, which begins in the brain, has its effect throughout the body."
Norman Cousins,A book is like a piece of rope; it takes on meaning only in connection with the things it holds together.
Norman Cousins,The human body experiences a powerful gravitational pull in the direction of hope. That is why the patient's hopes are the physician's secret weapon. They are the hidden ingredients in any prescription.
Norman Cousins,Cynicism is intellectual treason.
Norman Cousins,The main failure of education is that it has not prepared people to comprehend matters concerning human destiny.
Norman Cousins,The individual is capable of both great compassion and great indifference. He has it within his means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter.
Norman Cousins,"The way a book is read - which is to say, the qualities a reader brings to a book - can have as much to do with its worth as anything the author puts in it. Anyone who can read, can learn to read deeply and thus live more fully."
Norman Cousins,"If the United Nations is to survive, those who represent it must bolster it; those who advocate it must submit to it; and those who believe in it must fight for it."
Norman Cousins,People are never more insecure than when they become obsessed with their fears at the expense of their dreams.

Norman Cousins,Laughter is inner jogging.
Norman Cousins,Respect for the fragility and importance of an individual life is still the mark of an educated man.
Norman Cousins,"A library, to modify the famous metaphor of Socrates, should be the delivery room for the birth of ideas - a place where history comes to life."
Norman Cousins,The capacity for hope is the most significant fact of life. It provides human beings with a sense of destination and the energy to get started.
Norman Cousins,We in America have everything we need except the most important thing of all-time to think and the habit of thought.
Norman Cousins,"The growth of the human mind is still high adventure, in many ways the highest adventure on earth."

Jacques Cousteau,"Man, of all the animals, is probably the only one to regard himself as a great delicacy."
Jacques Cousteau,We must plant the sea and herd its animals using the sea as farmers instead of hunters. That is what civilization is all about - farming replacing hunting.
Stephen Covey,"Effective leadership is putting first things first. Effective management is discipline, carrying it out."
Stephen Covey,"Live out of your imagination, not your history."
Stephen Covey,"A cardinal principle of Total Quality escapes too many managers: you cannot continuously improve interdependent systems and processes until you progressively perfect interdependent, interpersonal relationships."
Stephen R. Covey,"Happiness can be defined, in part at least, as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually"
Stephen R. Covey,Accountability breeds response-ability.
Stephen R. Covey,"Wisdom is your perspective on life, your sense of balance, your understanding of how the various parts and principles apply and relate to each other. It embraces judgment, discernment, comprehension. It is a gestalt or oneness, and integrated wholeness."
Stephen R. Covey,It's easy to say ''no!'' when there's a deeper ''yes!'' burning inside.
Stephen R. Covey,Private victories precede public victories. You can't invert that process any more than you can harvest a crop before you plant it.
Stephen R. Covey,Seek first to understand and then to be understood.
Stephen R. Covey,We simply assume that the way we see things is the way they really are or the way they should be. And our attitudes and behaviors grow out of these assumptions.
Stephen R. Covey,"The ''Inside-Out'' approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self / with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. The inside-out approach says that private victories precede public victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves recedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves."
Stephen R. Covey,"The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but what we are. And if our words and our actions come from superficial human relations techniques (the Personality Ethic) rather than from our own inner core (the Character Ethic), others will sense that duplicity. We simply won't be able to create and sustain the foundation necessary for effective interdependence."
Stephen R. Covey,"The ''Inside-Out'' approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. The inside-out approach says that private victories precede public victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves."
Stephen R. Covey,You can't live principals you can't understand.
Stephen R. Covey,"Power is the faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something. It is the vital energy to make choices and decisions. It also includes the capacity to overcome deeply embedded habits and to cultivate higher, more effective ones."
Stephen R. Covey,"Ineffective people live day after day with unused potential. They experience synergy only in small, peripheral ways in their lives. But creative experiences can be produced regularly, consistently, almost daily in people's lives. It requires enormous personal security and openness and a spirit of adventure."
Stephen R. Covey,"Between stimulus and response, one has the freedom to choose."
Stephen R. Covey,"Until we take how we see ourselves (and how we see others) into account, we will be unable to understand how others see and feel about themselves and their world. Unaware, we will project our intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective."

Stephen R. Covey,Management works in the system; Leadership works on the system.
Stephen R. Covey,Most people think of leadership as a position and therefore don't see themselves as leaders.
Stephen R. Covey,"I am personally convinced that one person can be a change catalyst, a transformer in any situation, any organization. Such an individual is yeast that can leaven an entire loaf. It requires vision, initiative, patience, respect, persistence, courage, and faith to be a transforming leader."
Stephen R. Covey,To judge individuals before understanding them is a form of human rejection andfeeds upon itself.
Stephen R. Covey,"Win win agreements are tremendously liberating. But as the product of isolatedtechniques, they won't hold up. Even if you set them up in the beginning, there isno way to maintain them without personal integrity and a relationship of trust."

Stephen R. Covey,Only after we can learn to forgive ourselves can we accept others as they are because we don't feel threatened by anything about them which is better than us.
Stephen R. Covey,"How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most."
Stephen R. Covey,You can't talk your way out of what you've behaved yourself into.
Stephen R. Covey,"Until a person can say deeply and honestly, I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday, that person cannot say, I choose otherwise."
Stephen R. Covey,"You have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage--pleasantly, smilingly, nonapologetically--to say 'no' to other things. And the way you do that is by having a bigger 'yes' burning inside. The enemy of the 'best' is often the 'good.'"
Stephen R. Covey,It doesn't matter where you're coming from? all that matters is where you aregoing. You can't talk your way out of problems you behave yourself into.
Stephen R. Covey,"Seek first to understand, then to be understood."

Stephen R. Covey,Our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us.
Stephen R. Covey,"Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly."
Stephen R. Covey,"Lose/Win people bury a lot of feelings. And unexpressed feelings come forth later in uglier ways. Psychosomatic illnesses often are the reincarnation of cumulative resentment, deep disappointment and disillusionment repressed by the Lose/Win mentality. Disproportionate rage or anger, overreaction to minor provocation, and cynicism are other embodiments of suppressed emotion. People who are constantly repressing, not transcending feelings toward a higher meaning find that it affects the quality of their relationships with others."
Stephen R. Covey,"As a principle-centered person you try to stand apart from the emotion of the situation and from other factors that would act on you, and evaluate the options. Looking at the balanced whole--the work needs, the family needs, the other needs that may be involved, and the possible implications of the various alternatives -- you'll try to come up with the best solution taking all factors into consideration. We are limited but we can push back the borders of our limitations."

Stephen R. Covey,"In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do."
Stephen R. Covey,"If you're proactive, you don't have to wait for circumstances or other people to create perspective expanding experiences. You can consciously create your own."
Stephen R. Covey,It takes a great deal of character strength to apologize quickly out of one's heart rather than out of pity. A person must possess himself and have a deep sense of security in fundamental principles and values in order to genuinely apologize.
Stephen R. Covey,You canâ€™t talk your way out of what youâ€™ve behaved yourself into.
Stephen R. Covey,"The character ethic, which I believe to be the foundation of success, teaches that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character."
Stephen R. Covey,"Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We cansubordinate feelings to values."
Stephen R. Covey,"In addition to self-awareness, imagination and conscience, it is the fourth human endowment-independent will-that really makes effective self-management possible. It is the ability to make decisions and choices and to act in accordance with them. It is the ability to act rather than to be acted upon, to proactively carry out the program we have developed through the other three endowments. Empowerment comes from learning how to use this great endowment in the decisions we make every day."
Stephen R. Covey,"We are the creative force of our life, and through our own decisions rather than our conditions, if we carefully learn to do certain things, we can accomplish those goals."
Stephen R. Covey,We are not human beings on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a human journey.
Stephen R. Covey,It's a fact that more people watch television and get their information that way than read books. I find new technology and new ways of communication very exciting and would like to do more in this field.
Stephen R. Covey,Public behavior is merely private character writ large.
Stephen R. Covey,We are not animals. We are not a product of what has happened to us in our past. We have the power of choice.
Stephen R. Covey,"Our character is basically a composite of our habits. Because they are consistent, often unconcious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character."
Stephen R. Covey,The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.

Stephen R. Covey,"Effective leadership is putting first things first. Effective management is discipline, carrying it out."
Stephen R. Covey,"Every human has four endowments- self awareness, conscience, independent will and creative imagination. These give us the ultimate human freedom... The power to choose, to respond, to change."
Stephen R. Covey,Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.
Stephen R. Covey,"The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities."
Stephen R. Covey,"While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of our actions."
Stephen R. Covey,The ability to manage well doesn't make much difference if you're not even in the right jungle.
Stephen R. Covey,Basing our happiness on our ability to control everything is futile
Stephen R. Covey,"People can't live with change if there's not a changeless core inside them. The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value."
Stephen R. Covey,"Until a person can say deeply and honestly, I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday, that person cannot say, I choose otherwise"
Bucky Covington,I'd rather leave out on a note like that rather than a bad song selection and performance.
Bucky Covington,"When he gives me advice -- well it seems like he used to give advice, but now he doesn't so much give advice as just try to put you down. [He tries to make memorable] 'I can't believe he said that' [type comments], which make people talk the next day."

Noel Coward,"If you must have motivation, think of your paycheck on Friday."
Noel Coward,"There are bad times just around the corner,/ We can all look forward to despair, / It's as clear as crystal / From Bridlington to Bristol / That we can't save democracy / And we don't much care."
Noel Coward,It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.
Noel Coward,I love criticism just so long as it's unqualified praise.
Noel Coward,The child was a keen bed-wetter.
Noel Coward,I refuse to endure months of expensive humiliation only to be told that at the age of four I was in love with my rocking horse
Noel Coward,The higher the building the lower the morals.
Simon Cowell,"Thank God for Chris. This, for me, was the only real-world performance. I can actually imagine you having a hit with this record. . . . Best tonight by a mile."
Simon Cowell,I find Paula patronizing. It's as simple as that. Paula is more damaging than I am to these contestants because a lot of people just shouldn't be singing for a living.
Simon Cowell,"In my opinion, this was your best performance so far."
Simon Cowell,This was the only performance which stands up in the real world -- tonight you were the standard.
Simon Cowell,"The truth is, Lisa, is that the song was too big for your voice. There were parts during the performance where it was actually painful."
Simon Cowell,"It started and I thought, 'lame cabaret,' and then, magic."
Simon Cowell,"Ryan, with respect, I do this for a living. I don't play at it like you."
Simon Cowell,"They all hate each other deep down, but they're not gonna say it on camera. Ask Kelly how many congratulation e-mails she got from the other contestants. Probably zero. But that's the music business. In a positive way, I like that. I like the fact that people enter the show because they might win."
Simon Cowell,"We're proud, we're happy, and it's nice that she remembers the show as well."
Simon Cowell,He was one of those hah-hah funny sort of auditions. The guy had people rolling around in hysterics all day and I'm like what's the point? This is a joke. So I just said no.
Simon Cowell,"Just as well, we couldn't afford the food bill."
Simon Cowell,You are cute. You're likeable.
Simon Cowell,Why are you having a normal conversation with him? This is a dairy farmer dressed as a woman.
Simon Cowell,"I think we've got better talent than last year, There are two or three contestants, even without the competition, we would take seriously as a record label. If I don't find an international artist this year, then I will have failed. That is the one thing that interests me,"
Simon Cowell,I think that by ignoring the show you're ignoring the audience who put you there.
Simon Cowell,"My attitude is, if someone's going to criticize me, tell me to my face."
Simon Cowell,This is the show I've always wanted to make. We are looking for the best entertainer or entertainers in America.
Simon Cowell,"We felt the time was right to open up the boundaries, and say to all of America, regardless of your age, whether you're 2, whether you're 100, regardless of what you believe your talent is -- juggling, magic, singing -- this is the show you can enter. It's as simple as that."
Simon Cowell,It is a personal thrill for me to play a role in giving the best young singers in America a shot at realizing their dreams. I'm also happy to be working with my good friend Simon Fuller for the foreseeable future and I look forward to continuing to be a part of the Fox network and the phenomenal success that is American Idol .
Simon Cowell,I like the fact that they're cocky now from the age of four.
Scott Cowen,"Speed is the most important thing to keep in mind, because we have a city that was decimated,"
Scott Cowen,"Until a commission is sanctioned to sift through all these ideas and coalesce it into a single vision, I don't think people will pay much attention."
Scott Cowen,There's nothing in common about this model and what was in existence pre-Katrina.
Scott Cowen,"We have to have a whole new mind-set about how we approach public education. If we can get our heads around true transformation, we can turn it around."
Scott Cowen,"This is unprecedented in the history of the US, to have had a national disaster of this magnitude with a diaspora of this magnitude."
Scott Cowen,"[The BCS presidents] realized there was a public desire that we resolve this ourselves rather than decide it in courts or in Congress, ... We all put aside our egos and said, 'Let's come up with something.'"
Scott Cowen,"The level of criticism is fairly warranted. So you either do it the right way, which involves a playoff, or you go back to where there was no pretense that there was somebody [matched together] playing for the national championship. You just played the bowls, and the pollsters ranked 'em however they wanted and we lived with the controversy."
Scott Cowen,"We were talking at a very high level of conversation about principles and values. It's another thing to come up with real solutions. I'm only speaking personally, but if the solution they come up with is only to add a fifth bowl and a little more access, that is not a successful resolution of the issues."
Scott Cowen,"This is a model that is starting to emerge in America, and we could be the first to bless it."
Bill Cowher,"Their defense is a lot like ours, from the standpoint of scheme-wise. They have good players down there that run it."
Bill Cowher,The biggest concern I have is making sure we understand that we aren't going to pick up where we left off.
Bill Cowher,It's just Joey being Joey. I was pretty proud he lasted this long.
Bill Cowher,I think the pass to Hines was just a great call by Whiz.
Bill Cowher,The two words are 'easy' and 'ready. They both have 'e' in them.

Bill Cowher,Sports Town: A Look at the Famous Sports Pages of the Post-Gazette.
Bill Cowher,We only have three guys under contract at the safety position.
Bill Cowher,"That's probably the one position given our status there, we only have three guys under contract at the safety position, we'll have to address the numbers issue there."
Bill Cowher,"Where our record is, we recognize there's a responsibility that comes along with it. We have to bring our A game every week. We're not in a reflecting mode right now. We have to still look ahead and keep the blinders on a little bit. We beat a couple good football teams, but in terms of the big picture, [we haven't accomplished anything yet]."
Bill Cowher,He's a quality receiver and he can do a lot of things for you - certainly with what he can do for you after the catch. He's got excellent hands and obviously his ability to throw the football is something that is very unique to that position.
Bill Cowher,"Mr. Rooney was very supportive through three non-playoff years (1998-2000), and I'm very appreciative of his patience."
Bill Cowher,He tests your patience. But I go with him because he's a gamer.
Bill Cowher,Patience is a virtue. If you have the right people.
Bill Cowher,Ben is an unbelievable athlete. It would take someone of his nature (to make the tackle).
Bill Cowher,"This team understands it's a journey. This is the first step. It was almost a battle of wills out there today, like who was going to flinch first. We just came up with a couple more big plays than they did, and that was the difference in the game."
Bill Cowher,"He's coached in a lot of different places and tinkered with a lot of different ideas, but I've kept the same practice format that I learned from him for 14 years here, ... I guess he's gone the full cycle. He's always been very open-minded. He's receptive to change."

Bill Cowher,"That's one thing Tony knows, the Steelers of the '70s, they were a tough football team, ... There's a degree of style that goes with this football team, and I think we've been able to sustain a little bit of that persona."
Bill Cowher,I told him he revealed another gear. I saw something where now I can set another level of expectation that's a little bit higher.
Bill Cowher,He really had a super game. It's a tough situation for him. I am just encouraged by the fact that he has gotten it taken care of and we'll probably have the opportunity to get him back this year.
Bill Cowher,We have a very healthy organization. It starts at the top. There's no ego involved. We try to get things done as a team.
Bill Cowher,"It's to be determined,"
Bill Cowher,"I think you'll find in any second-year player, his comfort level is much greater. There's no question he's more comfortable with our offense and understanding the plays and the design of the plays and where they're intended to go. Consequently, he's much more in control of the huddle than he was a year ago."
Bill Cowher,"I think the comfort level he's at, to me, is the most important thing, and that's very evident."
Bill Cowher,"I'll probably spend a lot of time watching college football on Saturday and pro football on Sunday,"
Bill Cowher,We are just going to look at all the circumstances and go from there.
Bill Cowher,"It's not the circumstances that effect you, it's how you deal with them."
Bill Cowher,We will be tested with this set of circumstances. It's going to be a defining moment of this football team.
Bill Cowher,"The circumstances are such that we don't have a choice. We were put in that situation by losing three games in a row. We know the path that is ahead of us. It's a tough journey, but the guys are looking forward to it."
Bill Cowher,"Fourth-and-one with a Jerome Bettis , it's just an easy call to make. I feel so much appreciation for him."
Bill Cowher,He's certainly playing a lot older than his age.
Bill Cowher,It is an unexcused absence. I'm very disappointed in his decision and we are ready to move on with or without him.
Bill Cowher,"It is an unexcused absence, ... I'm very disappointed in his decision and we are ready to move on with or without him."
Bill Cowher,"You can only talk to so many guys. Athletic ability is certainly a part of it, but it's not everything. These kids are still maturing as people. You can never lose sight of that."

William Cowper,"When this poor, lisping, stammering tongue/ Lies silent in the grave."
William Cowper,"And diff'ring judgments serve but to declare that truth lies somewhere, if we knew but where"
William Cowper,"I was bred to the law, a profession to which I was never much inclined, and in which I engaged, rather because I was desirous to gratify a most indulgent father, than because I had any hope of success in it myself."

William Cowper,"Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass, the mere materials with which wisdom builds, till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place, does but encumber whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much; wisdom is humble that he knows no more."

William Cowper,They that fight for freedom undertakeThe noblest cause mankind can have at stake.
William Cowper,"A fool with judges, amongst fools a judge: / He says but little, and that little said / Owes all its weight, like loaded dice, to lead. / His wit invites you by his looks to come, / But when you knock, it never is at home."
William Cowper,"Tis hard if all is false that I advance, A fool must now and then be right, by chance"
William Cowper,"The solemn fop; significant and budge;  A fool with judges, amongst fools a judge"

Bobby Cox,"They know how to battle, ... They have talent. They're not just up here to fill in. They're up here to help us win."
Bobby Cox,It was a struggle on both sides. The long ball always helps. We didn't hit particularly great and we pitched super all spring. It was the other way around today.
Bobby Cox,"[It's] a little bit of a violation of the rules. I think he just got caught up in the moment,"
Bobby Cox,"We're not pitching anybody on short rest, so it works out perfectly."
Bobby Cox,"Somebody's done a terrific job with that kid. He had a lot of pitches tonight, but they were quality. He had a purpose for every one of them. Looks like he knows what he's doing out there pretty well."
Bobby Cox,"You got to have some patience with them. No sense in bringing them up here, playing four or five games, sending them right back out. If they're good enough to put on this uniform, to me, they're good enough to play."
Bobby Cox,"I'm still energetic with the game. I've still got the passion for it. When I don't, I'll probably just walk away."
Bobby Cox,Edgar has been swinging the bat great. He's just like [Brian] McCann. Neither of them have been getting any luck.
Bobby Cox,"Reitsma can do the job, we know that."
Bobby Cox,We wasted a real super job by Ramirez.
Bobby Cox,It was a rough night for Ramirez. The grand slam hurt us.
Bobby Cox,"It's an honor getting an award from your peers, it really is."
Bobby Cox,"That's a great honor, I'm really appreciative of this again. It really means a lot to me."
Bobby Cox,"It's an honor, again, ... It's something we don't set out to win, that's for sure."
Bobby Cox,I'm in shock. I will say a prayer for him. He hit the home run against us in the World Series. He's a Hall of Fame player. Too bad this happened to him.
Bobby Cox,He's working hard enough now to surpass everything that he did last year.
Bobby Cox,His totals seem to go up one or two every game. He's totally a star now. Andruw is putting a lot of guys in his shadow right now.
Bobby Cox,"He could hit a little and throw a little. He was always funny, a guy you wanted to have on your team."
Bobby Cox,He's awful tough. He can make you look awfully funny.
Bobby Cox,I think John sort of adopting him really made his year. Had a lot of faith in him.
Bobby Cox,"I doubt he'll play tomorrow. I thought it was his thumb at first. A lot of times, when an infielder dives like that, it [bends] his thumb back."
Bobby Cox,We're not complaining. We're not going to say anything. But Sosa has got to understand too that he's got to be ready to open [the season].
Bobby Cox,"He's got to feel pretty good about himself coming right out of college, pitching in the playoffs and under pressure and everything else. That's a huge step."
Bobby Cox,"Break it up boys, leave the rookie alone."
Bobby Cox,"I know Rem gave up some balls hit hard. But he's free and easy and, as far as I know, he has no pain. He's got some life. As long as he keeps building his arm up, we'll see how it goes."
Bobby Cox,He just gave up a ton of ground balls tonight that were infield hits and ones that got through. He just threw so many pitches.
Bobby Cox,"Davies is a good athlete. He can bunt, he can run and he can hit."
Bobby Cox,"[Thomson] pitched a nice game tonight, and we got the long ball back in action, which really helps."
Brian Cox,"I was very inspired by people like Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. I just thought, if they could do it, I could do it."
Brian Cox,"I was living in London and I thought, 'there's nothing here for me anymore'. I don't want to become this actor who's going to be doing this occasional good work in the theater and then ever diminishing bad television. I thought I'd rather do bad movies than bad television because you get more money for it."
Brian Cox,In a sense I feel very much a part of the cinema now in a way where when I come back to the theater now I feel like a visitor. The cinema is really what I enjoy. I want to do more independent movies.
Christopher Cox,"If we find that instead of a legitimate sales seminar and a free meal, seniors are being exposed to pitches for unsuitable products, with high-pressure sales tactics and wild claims about projected returns, and no disclosure of the actual risks of the investment, we'll move in hard and fast."
Christopher Cox,Our disclosure rules haven't kept pace with changes in the marketplace.
Christopher Cox,"A significant investor benefit of using the Internet as the delivery platform is that investors will cast more informed votes, ... The tragic fact is that today, few ordinary investors read the proxy statements, which are written more like insurance policies against lawsuits than shareholder-friendly guidance."
Christopher Cox,"In the absence of presidential leadership, Congress must act now to strengthen communications between U.S. and Taiwan military forces, rebuild deterrence and head off a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait,"

Coleman Cox,I am a great believer in luck. The harder I work the more of it I seem to have.
David Cox,There is absolutely no safety issue here and the unions know this.
David Cox,People want to work and it is very hard to live here. It is hard to find jobs here that provide enough money to live on. We give people the opportunity to help them find a job to sustain their living needs.
David Cox,That's a tremendous amount of work. That's a good example of what can be done.
David Cox,That puts tremendous pressure on principals to do exactly what the Secretary of Education tells them to do instead of letting the local boards and the state be in control of education and curriculum. We're using the resolution to oppose further encroachment into local control of education.
David Cox,Eighty-five percent of our current operating budget is dedicated to personnel expenditures.
David Cox,I don't think it is a good thing to sign an agreement that is vague when we still have issues to deal with.
David Cox,It's hard to see how the action they've taken today will be helpful in building a constructive dialogue.

James Cox,I think Liberty Corner will get to know the enforcement staff at the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) real well.
James Cox,"I think it's a good idea. The Bangor School System is the gold standard as far as education goes, at least in this part of the state."
James Cox,"You know, once you are done with college, you don't have a free week every semester to just go out and help people. Doing this now is a great opportunity."
William Cox,"Closing the achievement gap is one of the most persistent challenges in American education today. Given the complex nature and extreme difficulty in closing these gaps, Standard & Poor's believes it is important to pay tribute to those schools that have made progress in this area."

Jody Craddock,"I did sketches with pencils because they didn't cost much. I didn't have the money to buy paint. Materials aren't cheap, and I was on extremely low money."
Jody Craddock,"I have also been doing pictures which are far from it, but I am in football and I do enjoy it, and some of the images are so good and so striking that I like to put that in a painting."
Jody Craddock,"What I like is that I don't have to get pigeonholed into one thing. I don't have to do football pictures, I do landscapes as well, and other stuff."
Daniel Craig,"I'm kind of speechless at the moment,"
Daniel Craig,"I think there's a complexity to it, but I think audiences are completely up for that."
Daniel Craig,"The important thing about Bond is that we have action sequences that excite the audience. It takes a lot of work. It's got to be of a very high standard. The best, in fact. The energy of it is about making it as exciting to watch as possible."
Daniel Craig,He knows that you have ability and what he does is he manipulates it and sort of empowers you.
Jim Craig,"We could not see value at any levels we could do (the deal). We win about 50 per cent of the ones we go after, so we are pretty disciplined."
Jim Craig,It doesn't make sense for us to pay a price that's inconsistent with our model and with our responsibility to our shareholders.
Jim Craig,It doesn't make sense for us to pay a price that's inconsistent with our model and with our responsibility to our shareholders. We have not been able to agree a price and so we are moving on. There is a lot of activity in Europe at this moment and we are focusing on that.
Jim Craig,"In evaluating any potential transaction, Macquarie takes a disciplined approach to valuation, while considering the views of all relevant stakeholders."
Jim Craig,"My views may have had some influence ... But their views have influenced me as well,"

David Crane,"There's no zero-emissions coal. There is a technology called clean coal, which is getting very, very close."

David Crane,"[Nigerian officials have] a responsibility to turn him over to us. International law requires them to, ... West Africa and West African leaders need to understand it's the rule of law."
David Crane,It was a very constructive exercise. The final product is a better measure.
David Crane,"When we put them (Monica and Chandler) in bed together initially, I don't think we realized that this would be the loves of their lives. We went into it going 'Well, we'll see how many weeks this works,'"
David Crane,"We were advised that nobody could stop us from pursuing our craft simply because we had honed, or even developed that craft while working at a company."
David Crane,"We wanted to create an environment where if a game player enjoyed the writing style of a particular game designer, he or she could look for the next game by that same author and not be disappointed."
David Crane,The terms of that settlement were never disclosed - not even to me. I was asked if I wanted to know and having had enough of lawsuits I declined.
David Crane,"The letters were universally complimentary, and we designers loved hearing that our games were being enjoyed, but if they weren't sending us a picture of their screens most of those writers would have spent their time playing the game rather than writing letters."
David Crane,"That's right, fall in one pit and start over from the beginning! Well, thankfully my buddies practically tied me to my chair until I put in extra lives and I'm glad they did."
David Crane,"Plus, I was a math and science whiz from my first introduction to the subjects."
David Crane,"Our co-founder and company president, Jim Levy, came from a record industry background and understood the marketing and promotion of artists as well as products. So the video game business went from absolutely zero designer credit to something approaching rock star promotion."
David Crane,"One week before Pitfall! was to be released, I only gave you one life to play the whole game. I was experimenting with that concept as sort of the ultimate challenge."
David Crane,"Looking back, video game design seems a natural fit, although there was no such thing when I was growing up. I built a Tic-Tac-Toe playing machine in my teens which went up in smoke on the night it was scheduled to go to a science fair."
David Crane,I was a little hesitant at taking the job at Atari. I had never programmed for a living and I worried it might get boring (building circuits seemed more fun). But I would probably still be in the video game business.
David Crane,Garry Kitchen and I played hugely competitive matches of Amazing Tennis. There is a great thing about that game from a tennis player's perspective.
David Crane,"Another little known fact about Amazing Tennis - the computer opponents are modeled after real people. In an odd turn of events, I joined a division 3 college tennis team at age 38."
David Crane,My background is in hardware design. I found hardware work to be a welcome change from thousands of hours of programming and that led to the designs you mentioned.
Peter Crane,"They're getting into a range where, with no risk, their returns are competitive with long-term returns of bonds and equities that are higher, but are much more volatile."
Peter Crane,"Normally money market rates just sit there. But because we're in a rare period where the Fed is moving constantly, the rates bear watching. Nobody has to move tomorrow, but you want to monitor the rates and make sure your cash investment is going up. If your cash investment hasn't moved in the last few months, you're in the wrong place."
Peter Crane,"You really need to know what federal income tax bracket you're in to determine whether tax-free funds offer more of a benefit. As a rule of thumb, anyone who falls in the 36 or 39 percent tax bracket should consider tax-free funds."
Peter Crane,"Why shouldn't America, and American children, have the same level of protection that kids do in France and Germany and Poland and Russia and Armenia and Ireland and Norway and a host of other countries?"
Wes Craven,"The audience that would see that movie, by and large, doesn't go to see horror films, ... It was a great pleasure to make, and to see Meryl (Streep) nominated (for a best actress Oscar) for it. But most of the people I run into who loved it are surprised that I made it. When you have a name that means scares, you have to live with that."
Wes Craven,"I learned to take the first job that you have in the business that you want to get into. It doesn't matter what that job is, you get your foot in the door."
Wes Craven,"All of us have our individual curses, something that we are uncomfortable with and something that we have to deal with, like me making horror films, perhaps."
Wes Craven,"A lot of life is dealing with your curse, dealing with the cards you were given that aren't so nice. Does it make you into a monster, or can you temper it in some way, or accept it and go in some other direction?"
Wes Craven,"I have a lot of fans who are people of color. I think, if nothing else, I kind of understand that sense of being on the outside looking in, culturally."
Wes Craven,The first monster you have to scare the audience with is yourself.
Cindy Crawford,"Certainly Vogue was the total seal of approval, but Cosmo was up there. You had those and your cosmetics contract, and you were all set."
Cindy Crawford,I don't think makeup is rocket science or a cure for cancer.
Cindy Crawford,"It's a huge change for your body. You don't even want to look in the mirror after you've had a baby, because your stomach is just hanging there like a Shar-Pei."
Jamal Crawford,"We just had to slow down. As a guard, I'll take responsibility for that."
Jamal Crawford,"I've seen him play so well against people like Shaq and Yao Ming, ... a dominant low-post presence - someone that can get you 20 points and 10 rebounds and block shots."
Jamal Crawford,"He's excited, man, ... I'm excited. I can't wait to get started tomorrow."
Jamal Crawford,"I love that moment. I honestly do. I've always been like that as a kid, I always wanted the ball late."
Jamal Crawford,"I love being in that position. Ever since I was a kid, I've always liked the big shot. I'm just glad it's going in now. More importantly, we're winning."
Jamal Crawford,It's been there. At times we've had it and at times we haven't. But now we're learning how to finish close games. I think that's going to make us better in the long run.
Jamal Crawford,"More importantly than that, his health is the No. 1 issue. If he can, if there's any way he can be back, I'm sure he will. But we need him to get healthy."
Jamal Crawford,It feels good. You hate to be in that position because we were up.
Jamal Crawford,"Not at all. This year didn't go the way we wanted as far as reaching our goals, but we believe it's short-term."
Jamal Crawford,"If he is (worried), he's not really showing it. He's real relaxed and having fun. He's happy to be here."
Jamal Crawford,The young guys just have so much energy. This is a great opportunity for them.
Jamal Crawford,"I think when he yelled at Nate (Robinson), that's when I knew he was back to being coach."
James Crawford,It's sad when you do everything you can possibly do to try to maintain the quality and try to maintain your ability to . . . and nothing you do works.
James Crawford,"would be sensitive about the abuses people might try to do with the law. Military personnel could only be charged for what they had done, not what some people might think they represent."
James Crawford,"One thing that we're working on is team defense. They work hard, communicate and get everybody involved. It kind of looks like a storm out there sometimes."
James Crawford,"The new version truly brought back the roots of the first movie, and portrayed the original 'beauty killed the beast' storyline well. It brought movie animation to a whole new level."
James Crawford,Babies can be very stressful to take care of. The crying and the pooping are extremely hard for some people to tolerate.
Joan Crawford,It has been said that on screen I personified the American woman.
Joan Crawford,"Hollywood is like life, you face it with the sum total of your equipment."
Joan Crawford,"During Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?, I knitted a scarf from Hollywood to Malibu."
Joan Crawford,"Recently I heard a 'wise guy' story that I had a party at my home for twenty-five men. It's an interesting story, but I don't know twenty-five men I'd want to invite ta a party."
Joan Crawford,If you have an ounce of common sense and one good friend you don't need an analyst.
Joan Crawford,"I have always known what I wanted, and that was beauty... in every form."
Joe Crawford,"We felt it was important to make that move from a position of strength, when we could pick our partners, ... We feel the companies' cultures mesh well."
Joe Crawford,"I'm a better, tougher player now than I was in high school. I wanted to make sure I showed that."
Joe Crawford,"While this increase improved total sales revenue for the quarter, margins on these products are lower than margins on the company's finished products."
Joe Crawford,"He told me at the timeout to take off running and he was going to get the ball to me. He did, too."
Joe Crawford,especially gratifying since they follow on the heels of three of the most difficult and challenging years in our history.
Joe Crawford,"I'm excited; it's a good accomplishment, but I can't get too high off it. I'm surprised, because I just want to keep winning. I don't want to focus on that (the award)."
John Crawford,"I was off spinning these raunchy fiction stories with dialogue, and that's not really what my professor wanted. About halfway through the semester, I caught on to what she wanted. I had to play catch-up just to get a C. I was happy to get that C."
John Crawford,It was a unique experience. It was cool hanging out with them and getting to know them better.
John Crawford,"We were all sitting in the most oil-rich country in the world, and even when people could get gas, it was overpriced fuel trucked in by Halliburton from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,"
John Crawford,"These are five wonderful boys, and what they did was an awesome, awesome thing. I hope they can do it again next year, and that will be enough for me."
John Crawford,"The laws are in place, the men understand all the laws, but freak accidents happen."
Robert Cray,"Yes, I sing songs about relationships on the edge, relationships of all kinds, but remember I did not write them all, ... They are not all based on my experiences. Years ago, I wrote with Dennis Walker and Bruce Bromberg, who were 10 years older and divorced two or three times. They had great senses of humor, which is where lines like 'a boatload of lawyers just sank' came from. It is their stories on Strong Persuader, my breakthrough album from 1986. Sneaking out the window, 'Porch Light,' they are not my songs or lines. So, my life is not as miserable as some of the music makes it out to be. My wife Sue and I have been married for 15 years. She's an actor, but Sue gets the credit she deserves on some of my songs."
Robert Cray,"My idea when I sat down to write it was to put myself in the position of a young man wanting to do the right thing,"
Robert Cray,"The idea behind that was trying to get that spontaneity that comes with learning the song for the first time, ... Over-rehearsing kind of takes the fun out of recording â€” it makes it 'perfect,' but lifeless."
Robert Cray,"We're obviously doing some of the newer things, but we go all the way back to the Bad Influence' album that was released in 1983, ... We like to mix it up."
Robert Cray,"Curtis wore prescription Ray-Ban sunglasses, and he had a little growth of hair under his bottom lip. Right then, Belushi got the idea to start the Blues Brothers, basing his character on Curtis."
Robert Cray,"I pulled the Johnny character from the Jamaican Johnny Too Bad thing,"
Robert Cray,"We were coming back into the States from Canada when that all went down. I didn't come up with the idea. The idea came from the promoters. I said, Yeah, let's do it. Seattle was the right place for that. That was the original home base for me, so we had a great turnout."
Robert Cray,I liked the Beatles because there was so much melody. Jimi Hendrix is still one of my heroes.
Robert Cray,"Normally when we go in and write the songs we write, we think about doing a cover, but never a covers record. That would be, for us, a concept. We don't want to have a concept!"
Robert Cray,A lot of bands would be aching to be in the position we are.
Paula Creamer,"The thing that I find with Annika is that she does her work and then she leaves. She doesn't hang around, ... She just gets it done and stays focused and that's what I'm trying to do, learn from that. The best player out here obviously is Annika and she has the best time management"
Paula Creamer,"Obviously, the first win is very important, but just the strength of the field here, the Evian Masters, I think the whole ensemble of everything is huge, ... This is one of the biggest purses tournaments and purses that we have. I think that means an awful lot and is very exciting."
Paula Creamer,I don't think my feet ever touched the ground for the rest of the year. When I went back to celebrate with everybody it was a lot of fun. It went by so fast. I wish I could go back and re-live that moment.
Paula Creamer,"I put the most pressure on myself. I'm very hard on myself. I expect perfection when I'm out there, ... I'm going to go out and play good golf and be, hopefully, a team player, and just wish on the USA, I'll be behind everybody 100 percent."
Paula Creamer,"I want to see what she does. She's long off the tee, her course management is unbelievable, she rarely makes bogeys -- things like that that I've been aware of."
Paula Creamer,nothing to write home about?
Paula Creamer,"No gossip yet, sorry,"
Paula Creamer,"I have definitely gotten longer. I have new muscles and my golf swing has changed, so once in a while I can hit one pretty far out there. But it's learning how to use those muscles on a consistent basis."
Paula Creamer,"I don't know about overshadowing. She just has raised the bar for women's golf and she's made it a better sport right now, ... She's brought the more physical aspects into the game, being longer and stronger. The main thing is she is just stronger and can hit it further than anybody out here right now and that is a huge advantage. She has just raised it for so many players."
Paula Creamer,"I don't know about overshadowing. She just has raised the bar for women's golf and she's made it a better sport right now. She's brought the more physical aspects into the game, being longer and stronger. The main thing is she is just stronger and can hit it further than anybody out here right now and that is a huge advantage. She has just raised it for so many players."
Paula Creamer,"I like this golf course a lot. Last year I took third, so I'm feeling very confident with it."
Paula Creamer,I always wanted to win on a traditional style golf course. It's like the courses I grew up playing in Northern California.
Paula Creamer,"That's the hardest thing after a year like I had last year. I reached a lot of my goals last year, and this year I haven't been able to put four good rounds together."
Paula Creamer,"This is a huge feat for me. It was one of my goals to get here, and when I got here, I wanted to win. This is an unbelievable experience."
Paula Creamer,I wouldn't set goals that I didn't think I could achieve. ... I wanted to win a major this year. That didn't happen. I don't feel satisfied unless all my goals are reached.
Paula Creamer,"This is a huge feat for me. It was one of my goals to get here, and when I got here, I wanted to win."
Paula Creamer,"This year has been so good, ... All my goals are being checked off. So I have to go back and rethink what I want to do for the rest of the year, because I am very goal driven and it seems like everything is done now."
Paula Creamer,We've got similar games and get along. I'm going over with someone I feel comfortable with.
Paula Creamer,I don't know how she does it. I couldn't even imagine what that whole family is going through.
Paula Creamer,"After [the bogey at 10] I kind of got excited and got a little energy into me. Even though it was negative energy, I still had some more momentum. I played solid on the back nine."
Paula Creamer,"I really wanted to go to school, it was a big goal of mine to play college, but I didn't want to be the No. 1 collegiate player in the world, I wanted to be the No. 1 LPGA player in the world, ... I'm on a pretty good streak so far and this course sets up really well for me."
Paula Creamer,I never really got a rhythm going from the beginning. I gave myself chances to make birdie and it never really happened. It was just one of those days where the hole wasn't four inches - it felt like two inches.
Paula Creamer,"I never really got a rhythm going from the beginning, ... I gave myself chances to make birdie and it never really happened. It was just one of those days where the hole wasn't four inches -- it felt like two inches."
Paula Creamer,I never really got a rhythm going from the beginning.
Joe Crede,"Words cannot describe how good this feels, ... To be a part of this, it's so special."
Joe Crede,Rules are rules and you got to follow them.
Joe Crede,"Those are the rules. I'm not going to cause friction, go out and get all [ticked] off about it. The people that made that rule are the ones that sign my checks."
Joe Crede,I'm not going to risk that situation if it's a close game in the bottom of the ninth inning and I can't do what I need to do. That's hurting the team.
Joe Crede,"I think that the biggest part is actually getting the opportunity to be in that situation, ... You have to tip your hat to A.J. It was a heads-up play on his part and he was able to get to first and get there safely."
Joe Crede,"We weren't able to execute when the opportunities came about. You have to capitalize on other peoples' mistakes. That's what the playoffs ask of you, and you've got to keep at it."
Joe Crede,"I just missed the first pitch and in the back of my mind I said if he throws it here, i want to get all over it,"
Joe Crede,"To be able to perform on this stage and be compared to all those great players, it's definitely an honor,"
Joe Crede,It just had eyes. That makes up for all those balls I hit hard that went right at people.
Joe Crede,"It just had eyes, ... and I was fortunate enough to get enough wood on it to get it up the middle."
Joe Crede,It was a catch. It was a courtesy to show the ump behind me. I was laying there with the ball in my glove.
Romeo Crennel,It would be great to just get a victory. I really don't care who it's against.
Romeo Crennel,I'm sure he's disappointed because I know he wanted to be part of a victory. But he's still part of the team and we're looking forward to a speedy recovery.
Romeo Crennel,"Some of that was by circumstance. We wanted to move a guy and they wanted two guys in a trade. That position, looking at it, wasn't as productive as it needed to be. I felt we had other people who fit better, so some of them had to leave. As football coaches, you like to think you can coach everybody and anybody, but sometimes you have to recognize that you can't."
Romeo Crennel,Everyone wants to push Braylon up. The guy has talent and we knew that when we drafted him. He missed some time and it wouldn't be fair to him and the rest of the guys on the team to throw him in there when he's not in the condition he needs to be in.
Romeo Crennel,He has some quickness. He has excellent quickness. ... His strength is his quickness.
Romeo Crennel,"Everyone wants to push Braylon up. But it wouldn't be fair to him or the rest of the guys to just throw him in there not being in the kind of condition he needs to be in, not totally knowing the offense yet."
Romeo Crennel,"If you look at what happens in the NFL with new coaches, if they don't make progress in the first couple of years, usually they're gone."
Romeo Crennel,"The team is making slow progress. We did some things better in Texas. Not good enough grant you, but better."
Romeo Crennel,"I had no illusions about where we would be. As long as we make progress, then I feel that we're headed in the right direction. I think that's one of the things that we have to do with this team - we have to get it going in the right direction."
Romeo Crennel,"If I feel like we're making progress - however slow that progress is - then I think you can stay the course (in strategy and all positions),"
Romeo Crennel,"When that happens I think the tempo of practice is better because guys are running plays that they know. Hopefully, we can improve some of the things we are doing."
Romeo Crennel,"Not much has changed. If they're not good enough to practice today or tomorrow, then it will be tough for them (to play) on Sunday."
Romeo Crennel,"They have their system and their philosophy, and they're willing to stick by it,"
Romeo Crennel,"I could sit up here and say it was to try to justify the performance, but I don't think that was the case. We just weren't very good for awhile."
Romeo Crennel,"We're still in the hole and we've got to battle to get even again. When you have a performance like we had, everything needs work. We have to get good at the basics and try to give ourselves a chance."
Romeo Crennel,"We made too many mistakes. We're still getting penalties, even though it has improved, they're coming at critical times."
Romeo Crennel,That's correct. Therein lies more of a problem.
Romeo Crennel,(Frye) had some bad plays and then he came back and made some good plays. This is a good learning experience for him.
Romeo Crennel,"(Wright) has been working hard ever since he has been with us, learning the system. It is a credit to him that he was able to come in here, get the game plan and run the ball into the end zone."
Romeo Crennel,"To my knowledge, no contract has been signed. Maybe they're still working that out."
Romeo Crennel,The offensive line didn't give up any sacks. The line did a nice job and Reuben did a nice job.
Romeo Crennel,We felt like he was going in (to the 2005 season) until he got hurt. Now he has to come back and prove that he is. That's the thing about this game.
Romeo Crennel,"If he's attempting 55-yard field goals, that's a different thing because the percentages are not on your side there. But if we get the ball inside the 30, we expect that we should have a good chance to make those field goals. Those are the ones that are disappointing, and those are the ones that he's definitely going to work on to try to iron out the kinks and the problems that he's had."
Romeo Crennel,"His injury was a head injury and the doctors will know when he is allowed to come back on the field. Until they say it's okay, we are not going to put him back out there. I think it's the normal medical process. Concussions are injuries that deal with the head and if you want to say that we're being cautious, then you can say that."
Romeo Crennel,"The first week, he goes down and does his dance. This Sunday, he went down and he looked back first and saw the flag, so he didn't dance. The thing that we'll all be excited about is when Dennis can get into the end zone and he can dance freely."
Romeo Crennel,He developed some of that consistency that I was looking for.
Romeo Crennel,"The blood supply and blood flow into the wrist is somewhat minimal. He has a piece of a bone in there that was taking a long time (to heal). It's gotten better because of the fact that he's had a cast on. After the season, they're going to take a real good look at it and determine if they need to go in and do something or if it's healed enough to maybe he can do enough without the cast."
Romeo Crennel,"They had some ability here. Every NFL team has ability. We came in and changed some systems. We decided to do something a little bit different. Maybe all of the pieces here don't exactly fit, but we added some guys to the team who we feel will help us build this team to where we want it to be."
Romeo Crennel,"What I have to try to do is get guys to do their job to the best of their ability and make good choices while they're doing that. You have to make good choices while you're out there. Then, if you find out a guy cannot make good choices, you need to try to replace him."
Romeo Crennel,"Discipline and technique, I mean that's what it was. They just hung in there. The fact that our offense was able to put some points on the board and give us that cushion made a big difference in the game."
Duke Crews,"That's big. With the type of talent that has come through this school, it's an honor to be a part of it."
Duke Crews,"Nah, we don't talk about that. We just want to be successful with our execution. If we happen to win games as a result, that's fine."
Duke Crews,"It's an honor to be named to any All America team, but this one is even better."
Michael Crichton,"Scientific power is like inherited wealth; attained without discipline. You read about what others have done, and you take the next step. You can do it very young. You can make progress very fast."
Michael Crichton,I am certain there is too much certainty in the world.
Michael Crichton,"The belief that there are other life forms in the universe is a matter of faith. There is not a single shred of evidence for any other life forms, and in forty years of searching, none has been discovered. There is absolutely no evidentiary reason to maintain this belief."
Michael Crichton,"Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled."
Michael Crichton,"Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it."
Michael Crichton,"Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had."
Michael Crichton,"We all live every day in virtual environments, defined by our ideas."
Michael Crichton,It's not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw.
Michael Crichton,"Readers probably haven't heard much about it yet, but they will. Quantum technology turns ordinary reality upside down."
Michael Crichton,"In the information society, nobody thinks. We expect to banish paper, but we actually banish thought."
Michael Crichton,They are focused on whether they can do something. They never think whether they should do something.
Jonathan Crisp,"The entire case, what this has always been about, is authority, ... Pfc. England's blind compliance toward authority and her lack of authority in any context."
Jonathan Crisp,"By turning to and leaning on authority figures around her,"
Jonathan Crisp,take her social cues from those in authority around her.
Jonathan Crisp,"She does have to look to the authority figures around her and glean what to do,"
Jonathan Crisp,"Based on her cognitive deficits, yes, she lacked the mental capacity, the cognitive ability to form the specific intent,"
Charlie Crist,"If we're willing to grade 5- or 6-year-old children, we ought to be willing to grade the schools that they propose to perform for those children."
Charlie Crist,"I don't want a lot of bureaucracy... I want to run state government the same way we run a campaign - efficient, effective and victorious."
Charlie Crist,"You know, as attorney general, there's no issue more important than making sure you are safe, that your families are safe."
Charlie Crist,"As Realtors, you live and breathe the American dream."
Charlie Crist,"It's hard to imagine that in this day and age this kind of thing could still occur, but regrettably it does, ... People should be treated appropriately and there should never be discrimination. And if you operate in that fashion, you will not operate in Florida."
Charlie Crist,"We're just trying to make sure people don't get ripped off and taken advantage of,"
Charlie Crist,I'll continue to fight for school choice and home schooling. Do I believe in accountability? You bet I do.
Davy Crockett,"I am at liberty to vote as my conscience and judgement dictates to be right, without the yoke of any party on me."
Davy Crockett,"Fame is like a shaved pig with a greased tail, and it is only after it has slipped through the hands of some thousands, that some fellow, by mere chance, holds on to it!"
Davy Crockett,We have the right as individuals to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to appropriate a dollar of the public money.
Davy Crockett,I have always supported measures and principles and not men.
Hansie Cronje,We didn't sleep last week - we literally didn't sleep - because we've been so busy with the book.
Hansie Cronje,We didn't sleep last week -- we literally didn't sleep -- because we've been so busy with the book.
Hansie Cronje,"The very quick and high sales of the book caught us off guard, but fortunately we got the second edition from the printers at the end of last week and the shops should now be stocked again,"
Hansie Cronje,It's much bigger than a cricket story.
Hansie Cronje,"We really tried hard not to make it a cricket book, it appeals to a much wider community,"
Hansie Cronje,"I missed him the most this birthday but maybe I'm just tired,"
Walter Cronkite,"I think somebody ought to do a survey as to how many great, important men have quit to spend time with their families who spent any more time with their family. Probably less."
Walter Cronkite,"They're going to have to eat their words. Some of the things I've seen her do on Today when there's breaking news, I thought she's done a fine job. ... Her own journalistic instincts come to the fore."
Walter Cronkite,I asked [my doctors] if I'd be able to play singles tennis and they said I could. That made me very happy since I haven't played in five years.
Walter Cronkite,"We are keeping company, as the old phrase used to be. I'm not making any moves immediately. I don't think it's proper. My wife has only been gone less than a year. I'll wait until that year has passed, at least."
Walter Cronkite,"Well thank you very much, I didn't expect birthday greetings from outer space."
Walter Cronkite,"To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion....It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy and did the best they could."
Walter Cronkite,The perils of duck hunting are great - especially for the duck.
Walter Cronkite,"I think somebody ought to do a survey as to how many great, important men have quit to spend time with their families who spent any more time with their family."
Walter Cronkite,Dan Rather and I just aren't especially chummy.
Walter Cronkite,And that's the way it is.
Walter Cronkite,There's a little more ego involved in these jobs than people might realize.
Walter Cronkite,"The great sadness of my life is that I never achieved the hour newscast, which would not have been twice as good as the half-hour newscast, but many times as good."
Walter Cronkite,Our job is only to hold up the mirror - to tell and show the public what has happened.
Walter Cronkite,"There is no such thing as a little freedom. Either you are all free, or you are not free."
Walter Cronkite,"I think it is absolutely essential in a democracy to have competition in the media, a lot of competition, and we seem to be moving away from that."
Walter Cronkite,Everything is being compressed into tiny tablets. You take a little pill of news every day - 23 minutes - and that's supposed to be enough.
Walter Cronkite,We are not educated well enough to perform the necessary act of intelligently selecting our leaders.
Walter Cronkite,I can't imagine a person becoming a success who doesn't give this game of life everything he's got.
Walter Cronkite,"When you're bringing in a fairly unknown candidate challenging a sitting president, the population needs a lot more information than reduced coverage provides."
Walter Cronkite,"I want to say that probably 24 hours after I told CBS that I was stepping down at my 65th birthday, I was already regretting it. And I regretted it every day since."
Walter Cronkite,"America's health care system is neither healthy, caring, nor a system."
Walter Cronkite,In seeking truth you have to get both sides of a story.
Walter Cronkite,I've gone from the most trusted man in America to one of the most debated.
Walter Cronkite,I think he's terrific. I've always had a great appreciation of his ability. And I would rather like to see him stay on the job there.
Sylvester Croom,"He is an intense competitor and he has a knack for making plays, even turning his mistakes into positives. I think he'll get even better as time goes on."
Sylvester Croom,We're still making mistakes and still not finishing in protections. We need to give Mike some time and he'll make plays.
Sylvester Croom,"I want to hear what they think and what feelings they had through this process. They shared some things with the counselors, and I want them to share those with the rest of the team. I want the team to understand this reality that they are now in the spotlight more than ever. One bad choice can affect the rest of their lives."
Sylvester Croom,"I want him to make people afraid. I want to put fear into them. If he's hungry and plays with some attitude, ain't too many people who are going to deal with him. ..."
Sylvester Croom,"[Last February, one of the first major decisions he had to make as coach was determining the fate of leading returning rusher Nick Turner , whoÂ hadÂ struggled academically and had plead guilty to passing counterfeit money. Croom ultimately dismissed Turner from the team but allowed him to keep his scholarship for the spring semester so he could leave the school in good academic standing.Â ] If a kid doesn't get that degree, it's going to affect him, his family, the kids he's going to have, ... That's a heavy burden to have. I agonized over that decision for a week."
Sylvester Croom,"We had curfew duty together in Green Bay. He's not going to play tricks. He knows my philosophy, and I know his."
Sylvester Croom,The penalties are always on the same people. It's a lack of discipline. At some point you have to play with pride and play for yourself. I can't put faith in their hearts or courage in their minds.
Sylvester Croom,"It is my intent to discipline our players as if they were my own sons, my own flesh and blood. I believe this is the appropriate disciplinary action for the facts as we know them to be."
Sylvester Croom,"We were sloppy today. We got another great effort out of our defense. They're making plays and getting turnovers. Loose balls, tipped balls, they're making plays."
Sylvester Croom,This weekend is absolutely huge for us. This recruiting class will have a huge impact on Mississippi State football.
Sylvester Croom,The guy's a student-athlete. He was being a student.
Sylvester Croom,"(His ability) is no secret, ... (Georgia) figured that out the other night, holding him, grabbing him by the face-guard, making sure he didn't get off the line of scrimmage. They figured out real fast we're trying to get him the ball. We're always trying to get him the ball in a lot of different ways."
David Crosby,We got glimpses into their value systems and their reasons they do things that nobody else has gotten. It was pay dirt. It was seriously good stuff.
David Crosby,"I started singing in coffeehouses when I was still in high school, in Santa Barbara. I took a job washing dishes and busing tables in the coffeehouse, so I could be there, and would beg permission to sing harmony with the guy who was singing onstage."
David Crosby,"His parents that raised him, who are two very sweet people, wrote us a letter, and also James met our keyboard player in Crosby, Stills, Nash, who's a dear friend of mine. And that was the way that actually got him on the phone to me."
David Crosby,"When it all started, record companies - and there were many of them, and this was a good thing - were run by people who loved records, people like Ahmet Ertegun, who ran Atlantic Records, who were record collectors. They got in it because they loved music."
David Crosby,"Describing Woodstock as the big bang, I think that's a great way to describe it, because the important thing about it wasn't how many people were there or that it was a lot of truly wonderful music that got played."
David Crosby,"The people who run record companies now wouldn't know a song if it flew up their nose and died. They haven't a clue, and they don't care. You tell them that, and they go, Yeah? So, your point is?"
David Crosby,Now record companies are run by lawyers and accountants. The shift from the one to the other was definitely related to when the takes started to get big.
David Crosby,"My father being in the movie business, I thought being an actor would be great. But when I started singing to people in coffeehouses, you know, singing folk music and then, later, singing songs that I started to write myself, I felt more than an affinity for it."
David Crosby,"I am having so much fun performing, I feel almost guilty. I think, my God, I hope no one comes and busts me for this."
Fanny Crosby,"The angel of mercy, the child of love, together had flown to the realms above."
Fanny Crosby,Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.
Fanny Crosby,"Can ye fathom the ocean, dark and deep, where the mighty waves and the grandeur sweep?"
Kim Crosby,"Our home was spared,"
Kim Crosby,My heart goes out to all of those people who are still stuck in New Orleans.
Kim Crosby,"Cell phones are not working, land lines are not working, so communication is almost by word of mouth, ... It's a blessing in disguise because people have started communicating with each other in a way that we used to a long time ago. 'Have you seen so and so?' 'Yes, I saw so and so yesterday at this place. They were at the Home Depot trying to get ice and water.' So you know that family is OK."
Kim Crosby,"Of course, my thoughts immediately go out to the children that are in the area. In the New Orleans area, there are families that couldn't get out. The children are now on survival mode. In Slidell, students that I taught don't have a house anymore. There are students who are lost, families we can't locate. The situation is pretty stressful."
Norm Crosby,"When you go into court, you are putting your fate into the hands of twelve people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty"
Norm Crosby,When you go into court you are putting your fate into the hands of twelve people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty.
Norm Crosby,"I was the first spokesperson for the Better Hearing Institute in Washington. And that's the message we tried to send out - there is hearing help out there, and the technology and options are amazing."
Norm Crosby,I met Elvis first in Las Vegas. I think I was appearing with Tom Jones and he came backstage to say hello to Tom or we went to his dressing room to say hello.
Sidney Crosby,It's nice but I would trade that for a lot more wins.
Sidney Crosby,"We are playing with pride. We have a lot of young guys in here trying to make an impression. We had some momentum going there. I thought we carried the whole third period. It was good to get the momentum, but tough to get it taken away like that."
Sidney Crosby,"It's getting used to the speed, and in a practice atmosphere like that the passes are harder, the guys are stronger, so getting used to it is going to take a little bit of time. I definitely see a bit of improvement as I go on out there, It's going to help me, definitely, when I come here."
Sidney Crosby,It's just tough to see him leave. He's had such an impact on the game. He's really got a passion for the game. I don't think anyone ever should have to deal with so much.
Sidney Crosby,"I've always had a passion for hockey, ... That's the key. You can't be putting in time. You have to enjoy doing what you do."
Sidney Crosby,That's just the nature of the game. There was a lot made out of this game and I think things just escalated a little bit.
Sidney Crosby,"At the start, when we made some mistakes, [Caron] was there."
Sidney Crosby,"We're just playing pretty solid hockey right now and not making too many big mistakes. Five on five, we're making it really tough for teams to play us. We're skating, and we're not giving them a lot of opportunities in our end, for the most part. We have to continue to play like that."
Sidney Crosby,"I just saw a little hole between the two D-men and I tried to hit it hard and break through and always try to make a move there,"
Sidney Crosby,"A good first memory,"
Sidney Crosby,"I think we just realized that was bad luck. I think we knew we were carrying the play in the first, so we weren't too worried."
Sidney Crosby,He went hard to the net and that's what you have to do to score. It's nice to see a guy like that get a goal when he has a chance to play on the top line.
Sidney Crosby,You don't want to get in the habit of seeing those. But I guess we're a little more prepared for stuff like that now.
Sidney Crosby,You can't give up. You've got to keep battling to the end. Winning is a habit. You can't accept losing. Losing is a bad habit to accept.
Sidney Crosby,"If we're down five goals, obviously guys are a little more edgy. It just seemed like both teams weren't really worried about scoring anymore. They just wanted to make sure they were sticking together as a team out there."
Sidney Crosby,"We're playing solid hockey and not making too many very big mistakes. We're not giving up a lot of opportunities, and we have to continue to play like that."
Sidney Crosby,Nicknames come in funny ways like that.
Sidney Crosby,It's probably mixed feelings (going into the break) because we have a little momentum and it would have been nice to try to carry it on. But I think we're all happy to finish it off like this. We can all go into the break feeling good about ourselves and know if we keep playing like this we have a lot to look forward to the rest of the season.
Sidney Crosby,I'm going to try to lead by example. I'm going to do my best for these guys.
Sidney Crosby,"It's something you dream about, scoring in the NHL. There's a lot of emotion that comes out of that. But it would have been nice if we had finished it off."
Sidney Crosby,"I'm still trying to develop consistency, ... You have to think faster up here. The reaction time is fast. You have to think quick, or else you're not going to make a lot happen."
Sidney Crosby,It's probably pretty funny that it could be a little competition we have there.
Sidney Crosby,The defensemen went down and got out of position. So then the goalie had no choice but to play the shot so I knew Mark had an open shot. I gave him a quick look and got him the puck.
Sidney Crosby,"was amazing. You don't have a choice but to play your best. They force you do do that because they're smart and that's the fun part for me, I'm being challenged to think faster and be creative."
Sidney Crosby,"They try to keep a close eye on me, they just wanted to play the body and get their hands up a little bit when they're hitting. I expect every game to be physical."
Sidney Crosby,It was good just to see him out there with us. Hopefully he will see how his body feels and get back out there.
Sidney Crosby,"Going through this is a lot of adversity -- let's be honest, there is a little bit of pressure because we haven't been winning -- and if we can get through this, we'll be better for it, ... It's not an ideal situation but now we realize it's tough to win and we have to be ready every night. We have to dig deep and play determined and play desperate."
Sidney Crosby,It was just the matter of taking advantage of our chances and making things happen. When we move the puck good things happen. It's not like we haven't been doing that in the past. It's just that they haven't been going in. It was nice to see them go in tonight.
Sidney Crosby,He's got a great shot. We just have to get him the puck and he's going to take advantage. He's just hot right now. It seems like every chance he gets he's finding a way to put it in. we want to keep getting him the puck. If he keeps playing like that he's going to be successful.
Sidney Crosby,"That's something he would say. No, he's playing well. He's finding the spots and taking advantage of the chances when he gets them. It's not a fluke that he's in the spots he's in. He knows where to go. He works hard. He's not a guy who's a perimeter guy. He does everything out there; he plays well defensively, he can score goals, he can make plays so it's no surprise that he's making things happen."
Bob Crow,No doubt we will once more be accused of disruption but ... the blame once again lies squarely with management trying to impose rather than negotiate.
Bob Crow,"Without these enforceable minimum standards, operators will be invited to cut corners and compromise fire safety."
Bob Crow,Once again Tube management have jumped the gun and are trying to impose policies without agreement.
Bob Crow,London Underground's point-blank refusal to accept our compromise offer means that strike action remains on for 24 hours over New Year's Eve and over Jan. 8-9.
Cameron Crowe,I wonder if I had gone for laughter and tears from the start how sad (the movie) would've been.
Cameron Crowe,is longer and has more soul.
Cameron Crowe,"Time, ... puts things in proper perspective."
Cameron Crowe,"I love telling stories about people that don't normally get written about. It's a different kind of life here. This is a movie from the heart, and it's a little different from the normal movies you'll see."
Cameron Crowe,"It's hard to do,"
Cameron Crowe,"I think that fate has a really good sense of humor, ... We had come from Toronto where people had given us a standing ovation, and the public screening had gone really well, but then afterward you hear, well, the press -- there was a less adoring reaction."
Cameron Crowe,I turned around and she kind of had some tears in her eyes.
Cameron Crowe,We used music in the film to create an environment. It made it feel like we were telling our story with a little extra -- a little extra soul.
Cameron Crowe,"I always thought I'd write about my dad, at some point, ... I didn't think it would be like this, but it arrived like this. I'd been listening to a lot of Garrison Keillor at the time. I love that simple story that ends on a grace note and you go, 'Wow, I'm just happy to be alive right now.' That was the feeling I was chasing."
Cameron Crowe,The whimsical side of my dad really comes through in this movie.
Cameron Crowe,"She loves Susan Sarandon and I know my dad (would have loved) being married to Susan Sarandon, ... Susan said she learned more about how to play the part from talking to my mom than to me."
Cameron Crowe,"Music is like the other person in this film and it's really important for Orlando's character. It leads him on his journey and is with him on his road trip,"
Cameron Crowe,"Well it kind of is project to project because as a writer I think you always write to some degree about things that you know or things that happened - but my favourite filmmakers, my favourite movies of theirs tend to be the personal movies."
Cameron Crowe,"Well all kinds of movies that you wouldn't expect that I'd want to do, both bigger scale and smaller scale than the ones I've done."
Cameron Crowe,Time puts things in proper perspective.
Cameron Crowe,Probably having fallen in love with music and movies at a young age and then first learning about writing by kind of following the path of writers like Dave Marsh and Lester Bangs and being a rock journalist.
Cameron Crowe,People dance and we have a lot of music and... this might be the closet I get for a while.
Cameron Crowe,It's more like can I build a group of characters and can I tell some universal truths that feel real and aren't formulaic in the spirit of filmmakers gone by who've told American stories that were personal and universal as well.
Cameron Crowe,"I have a desire to work with some actors I really like, so I hope to get out there soon and be back at it - maybe a little less music in the next one."
Cameron Crowe,And I liked that whole idea that energy comes from not disseminating your ideas and talking about them.
Cameron Crowe,"In the future, everybody is going to be a director. Somebody's got to live a real life so we have something to make a movie about."
Cameron Crowe,"Great music is its own movie, already. And the challenge, as a music fan, is to keep the song as powerful as it wants to be, to not tamper with it and to somehow give it a home."
Cameron Crowe,I wanted to make a comment on the obsession with success and failure that we see a lot in America.
Aleister Crowley,"There are hardly half a dozen writers in England today who have not sold out to the enemy. Even when their good work has been a success, Mammon grips them and whispers: ''More money for more work.''"
Aleister Crowley,"It sometimes strikes me that the whole of science is a piece of impudence; that nature can afford to ignore our impertinent interference. If our monkey mischief should ever reach the point of blowing up the earth by decomposing an atom, and even annihilated the sun himself, I cannot really suppose that the universe would turn a hair."
Aleister Crowley,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law
Aleister Crowley,Love stories are only fit for the solace of people in the insanity of puberty. No healthy adult human being can really care whether so-and-so does or does not succeed in satisfying his physiological uneasiness by the aid of some particular person or not.
Aleister Crowley,Falsehood is invariably the child of fear in one form or another
Aleister Crowley,"To the eyes of a god, mankind must appear as a species of bacteria which multiply and become progressively virulent whenever they find themselves in a congenial culture, and whose activity diminishes until they disappear completely as soon as proper measures are taken to sterilize them."
Aleister Crowley,Chinese civilisation is so systematic that wild animals have been abolished on principle.
Aleister Crowley,Falsehood is invariably the child of fear in one form or another.
Aleister Crowley,The ordinary man looking at a mountain is like an illiterate person confronted with a Greek manuscript.
Aleister Crowley,Ordinary morality is only for ordinary people.
Aleister Crowley,"I was asked to memorise what I did not understand; and, my memory being so good, it refused to be insulted in that manner."
Aleister Crowley,I slept with faith and found a corpse in my arms on awakening; I drank and danced all night with doubt and found her a virgin in the morning.
Aleister Crowley,"The joy of life consists in the exercise of one's energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal."
Aleister Crowley,Paganism is wholesome because it faces the facts of life.
Aleister Crowley,"Modern morality and manners suppress all natural instincts, keep people ignorant of the facts of nature and make them fighting drunk on bogey tales."
Aleister Crowley,In the absence of willpower the most complete collection of virtues and talents is wholly worthless.
Aleister Crowley,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
Aleister Crowley,The people who have really made history are the martyrs.
Aleister Crowley,"The pious pretense that evil does not exist only makes it vague, enormous and menacing."
Aleister Crowley,"Indubitably, Magic is one of the subtlest and most difficult of the sciences and arts. There is more opportunity for errors of comprehension, judgment and practice than in any other branch of physics."
Aleister Crowley,Intolerance is evidence of impotence.
Aleister Crowley,Part of the public horror of sexual irregularity so-called is due to the fact that everyone knows himself essentially guilty.
Aleister Crowley,To read a newspaper is to refrain from reading something worth while. The first discipline of education must therefore be to refuse resolutely to feed the mind with canned chatter.
Aleister Crowley,"I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff."
Aleister Crowley,"The conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that people who investigate heresies must be heretics; just as if a doctor who studies leprosy must be a leper. Indeed, it is only recently that science has been allowed to study anything without reproach."
Aleister Crowley,Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.
Aleister Crowley,I have never grown out of the infantile belief that the universe was made for me to suck.
Aleister Crowley,"I can imagine myself on my death-bed, spent utterly with lust to touch the next world, like a boy asking for his first kiss from a woman."
Aleister Crowley,In the absence of will-power the most complete collection of virtues and talents is wholly worthless.
Aleister Crowley,Destiny is an absolutely definite and inexorable ruler. Physical ability and moral determination count for nothing. It is impossible to perform the simplest act when the gods say ''no.'' I have no idea how they bring pressure to bear on such occasions; I only know that it is irresistible.
Robert Crowther,"Ohioans want Darwin's theory of evolution fully and completely presented, including the theory's strengths and weaknesses. The public is solidly behind the approach to teaching evolution that the Ohio state board of education has already adopted. Those attacking the school board for supporting teaching both the evidence for and against evolution don't represent the views of the majority of Ohioans."
Robert Crowther,"Surprisingly, Ohioans want to go further than their leaders with 75% favoring teaching intelligent design alongside of Darwinian evolution. Even after all the attacks on intelligent design by the dogmatic Darwin-only lobby, the public clearly wants to know more about the theory and make up their own minds."
Robert Crowther,"From our point of view, Intelligent Design is not a legal strategy, it's a scientific theory. It's a robust theory and we're getting more and more interest in it all the time."
Tom Cruise,"You don't know anything about the history of journalism, psychology, or my life! ... You can't handle the truth!"
Tom Cruise,On film Vanilla Sky: You're going to get the full experience of what love is.
Tom Cruise,"When I work, I work very hard. So I look to work with people who have that level of dedication. And I depend on that from everyone. From the director to my crews that I work with."
Tom Cruise,"I've never done work for money ever. If your choices are based on grosses and the film doesn't do well, what does that mean? It leaves you with nothing."
Tom Cruise,"It's indescribable. You hold this newborn, and you realize you've got responsibilities like you've never had before."
Robert Crumb,"If I didn't draw comics I was a worthless human being. It was tedious labor, so I worked fast to get it over with."
Robert Crumb,I guess I didn't enjoy drawing very much. It was like homework.
Robert Crumb,Everything that is strong in me has gone into my art work.
Robert Crumb,I have always had an abiding interest in that type of female anatomy.
Robert Crumb,I felt so painfully isolated that I vowed I would get revenge on the world by becoming a famous cartoonist.
Robert Crumb,"When I come up against the real world, I just vacillate."
Robert Crumb,"Oh, yes. I knew I was weird by the time I was four. I knew I wasn't like other boys. I knew I was more fearful. I didn't like the rough and tumble most boys were into. I knew I was a sissy."
Robert Crumb,When people say 'What are underground comics?' I think the best way you can define them is just the absolute freedom involved... we didn't have anyone standing over us.
Robert Crumb,Most of my adult life I had this towering contempt for America.
Penelope Cruz,you cant trust somebody who thinks you're crazy
Penelope Cruz,"I had a horrible, horrible breakdown. It was just huge, like the worst period of my life, and it lasted for a couple of months."
Penelope Cruz,"He's completely different from the others, and he has a special dedication to his actors."
Penelope Cruz,"The most important lesson I've learned in this business is how to say no. I have said no to a lot of temptations, and I am glad I did."
Penelope Cruz,"he can have my body, but he will never have my soul. never!"
Penelope Cruz,"I don't know if I believe in marriage. I believe in family, love and children."
Mark Cuban,"There is no question he has accepted the role and is trying to have as big an impact on every game as he possibly can. As he gets more and more comfortable with it, I think his -- and the team's -- play on offense will continue to improve."
Mark Cuban,"Somebody said that he was trying to break up a fight. There was no fight. He just pushed him. He put his hands to his chest and pushed him. By the way everybody reacted, everybody knew there was a problem, except for the official that got pushed."
Mark Cuban,"I trust Avery. Everybody trusts him. He's been there before. And it's not just about words. He'll discuss it with you and make you understand. He's a great communicator, and he's a great coach."
Mark Cuban,"[It's inevitable that the Mavericks get linked to trade rumors regarding Kidd and other major players who are on the block.] We're not going to make any major trades, ... Everybody fills a role on this team right now and for the future."
Mark Cuban,"We want to learn as the technology evolves, ... We felt that by going out and getting content, building the infrastructure, we could start exposing people to the technology, start building our audience and our revenue streams."
Mark Cuban,I trust A.J. to figure out how to deal with any problems he sees.
Mark Cuban,"He is creating a situation that doesn't exist. Maybe he should request that the league release results of officials' performance evaluations so fans, players and owners can see how wonderful a job they actually do. The officials do a good job overall. This would be his opportunity to confirm it to all."
Mark Cuban,I have always been interested in innovative and cutting edge-technologies coupled with a large market opportunity.
Mark Cuban,"I do not see how this transaction could benefit anyone other than the current management who must be expecting to feather their own nests, ... The $200 million offering price does not come close to fairly valuing the business of this company."
Mark Cuban,"I'm the type that thinks if you don't learn from history, you're doomed to repeat it."
Mark Cuban,"Last year, we put our hands over our heart [for the anthem],"
Mark Cuban,"Jeff is your typical eccentric genius. He locks himself away for months at a time with no human contact just to come up with great formulas for evaluating sports. It's fun to work with him, and his stuff is amazing."
Mark Cuban,"I wish Mike all the best off the court, ... As always, I hope the Spurs lose 82 games."
Mark Cuban,I saw him at the All-Star game. He said he's ready to go.
Mark Cuban,"Sports, music, movies - basically, fans of any form of entertainment don't do a resume analysis before picking their favorite."
Mark Cuban,"I wonder if he dreams about me the nights he spends here in Dallas. OK, I don't wonder. I'm curious about it. Of course, I don't truly believe that I own Phil. But that won't prevent me from walking up to him and say 'Boo' to see if he jumps, just to find out for sure."
Mark Cuban,"I caught Mark doing college games on The Ticket and thought he was great. I made room for him to do radio and he has done so well, T.V. was a natural."
Mark Cuban,"In a world of so many choices, people are going to take the path of least resistance and do the things that are easy and enjoyable for them."
Mark Cuban,"The idea is to give the consumer three choices: go to the movies, get the movie on pay TV or buy the DVD."
Mark Cuban,"By utilizing digital projection and the best independent theaters in the country, we've created a business model that allows filmmakers to control the distribution of their films."
Mark Cuban,"All I can tell you is that the standard answer in this situation is that it isn't personal, it's business,"
Mark Cuban,"Bad boys usually tend to mellow over time. At some point, particularly if they haven't won a title and if they are at the top of their game, they realize they can retain their personalities and have fun and avoid some of the drama and hassles they created in the past."
Mark Cuban,"We both went to school at Indiana University and we were big basketball fans. Living in Dallas, there was no way to listen to our favorite Hoosiers."
Mark Cuban,"It's one of the gutsiest things I've ever heard an athlete say. He wasn't politically correct, but he hit the nail right on the head. He deserves incredible kudos for doing what he thinks is right and what he believes in."
Mark Cuban,Fan Appreciation Night. We wanted to do something outrageous for our fans.
Mark Cuban,"A couple corporate customers of the league . . . were uncomfortable with the appearance of some players. Since the teams couldn't deal with it, they had asked the league to step in and deal with it."
Mark Cuban,The league handles officiating in a far more professional manner than prior to my arrival. They approach it like a real business unit now.
Mark Cuban,Make sure you are the boss. I don't think I would encourage executives that work for me to blog. There can be only 1 public vision for an organization.
Mark Cuban,I think that any reporter or columnist will be a little more careful when doing interviews with me.
Mark Cuban,"This is a chance for these servicemen and women to feel the admiration and respect of 20,000 people, reinforcing for them that we as a nation feel grateful for what they have done for us."
Mark Cuban,The Mercury sponsorship gives us the ability to support our independent film community and the films themselves to the best of our ability.
Ice Cube,"What I wanted people to recognize is that racism is in all of us, in layers. Some in more layers than others. It's not just the Klan guy and the black-fist guy, and it's about peeling away those layers."
Ice Cube,"Everybody is worried about the guy with the black power, leather jacket on, Afro ... worried about those kind of people and not really knowing that racism is not just the obvious."
Ice Cube,I thought it was a good opportunity to perform on TV and get the message out there.
Ice Cube,"When you are cold, surrenderand die to the Heat of the Heart"
Ice Cube,"To see it as a game is dope. You know they've got all these other games, and they finally gave a little respect to one of the classic movies in American history."
Ice Cube,Snoop is the Phil Jackson of youth football coaches. He ain't going to accept nothing but a winner.
Ice Cube,"It was just funny to me that some of our leaders would take that much time and energy to dismiss something that was loved by so many of our people,"
Ice Cube,Snoop Dog is the Phil Jackson of youth football coaches. He ain't going to accept nothing but a winner.
Ice Cube,I think the worst thing you can do about a situation is nothing.
Ice Cube,I'm really excited to be a part of a show that explores race in America. Black. White. will force people to challenge themselves and really examine where we stand in terms of race in this country.
Eddy Cue,We're thrilled to be the first digital music store to offer the songs from Dave Matthews Band for individual purchase.
Eddy Cue,"Our view is that our biggest competitor is illegal music and P2P services. We always thought that if we offered a better alternative, then those customers would be happy to pay,"
Eddy Cue,We've had the No. 1 digital music player in Japan. And now we can say we have the No. 1 online music store in Japan.
Eddy Cue,"We've known that about (400,000 to 500,000 songs) per month is what all the other online music stores in Japan have been doing. The majority of that being Mora,"
Eddy Cue,"We are about 5 per cent of the music market in the US but there is no doubt in my mind that digital music is the future,"
Eddy Cue,"It is certainly our belief that digital music buying is the future of music purchasing. Certainly our customers love it, and you can see it in the younger generation. They buy a lot of music now, and they buy it all online. That is what they know music as. They certainly do not know music as a record or as a CD--they know it as digital bandwidth,"
George Cukor,"Unless the story line carries the scenes, the scenes don't really mean anything."
George Cukor,"It is reassuring for people to feel they have a boss, someone who knows the answers and has charted the course."
George Cukor,"If she was a victim of any kind, she was a victim of her friends."
George Cukor,You can't have any successes unless you can accept failure.
Matt Cullen,"They capitalize on opportunities as good as anyone in the league. You can't give them any space, and if you do, you're going to pay."
Matt Cullen,"I don't think it's anything we'll store away in our memory banks for any reason. I think that when you start a playoff series, it's like starting fresh. It's seven games for everything."
Matt Cullen,They're a great team that can play some really good hockey. These are going to be two very big games for us.
Matt Cullen,"We feel like we belong at this point. It's nice to here, but we have to win games to stay."
Matt Cullen,It's difficult to overstate the impact this has had on the community. We've taken on tons of projects in downtown that might not have been done otherwise. It's created a big spin-off of retail activities.
Matt Cullen,"If you would have told us at the beginning of the season that if we win our last two games, we'd have the conference championship, a lot of people would have laughed. We're happy, we're in a good position."
Daunte Culpepper,I'm thinking I'm still trying to score on every possession. It would make it a lot easier if we got the ball down in their territory.
Daunte Culpepper,[Brooks] is a great competitor. That's what I see in him when he plays.
Daunte Culpepper,"I don't have any rings on my finger, except my wedding band â€“ and that doesn't count as far as a championship goes, ... I want to be a champion in this league and be the best I can be."
Daunte Culpepper,"This was a huge win, a huge win, ... This win means nothing though if we go down to Carolina and don't get a victory there."
Daunte Culpepper,I was confident when the legal process began that the truth would come out.
Daunte Culpepper,"Now that I have confirmed that the Vikings have been seeking to trade me, I have asked for permission to speak to the interested teams. The Vikings have denied my request. If a trade does not happen, then I am asking the Vikings to terminate my contract as soon as possible."
Daunte Culpepper,If a trade does not happen then I am asking the Vikings to terminate my contract as soon as possible.
Daunte Culpepper,We feel we've got a lot of talent on this team and we want to do it now. We took care of business in the offseason.
Daunte Culpepper,"Things are looking good. I'm not going to predict, or rush myself ... I'm just glad to be making the progress that I'm making and hopefully it continues."
Daunte Culpepper,"We have a veteran group with a lot of pride, and we're embarrassed with the way we're playing. I'm determined to fix it. One thing we've got to do is stay together."
Daunte Culpepper,"It felt like a bad episode of the `Twilight Zone,` ... The first thing that sticks out in my mind is the crucial mistakes, the stuff in the red zone. We can`t have turnovers down there."
Daunte Culpepper,"We didn't lay down. A lot of teams would have just folded up in situations like that. We kept fighting through the whole game, and the one thing that is encouraging is it is early in the season."
Daunte Culpepper,"I have made a good faith gesture toward the organization by offering to move my roster bonus around if it will help clear more cap space to sign free agents. If I am not traded, I want to help coach (Brad) Childress make a serious run for the championship this year."
Daunte Culpepper,He told me that the Vikings have not yet spoken to other teams about trading me. I shared my disappointment with the lack of communication and the false reports about me demanding more money coming out of Minnesota. I have requested further talks so that we can explore options for the future.

Daunte Culpepper,Nobody who was shooting dice wanted to get a dance.
Daunte Culpepper,"We tried a couple of things throughout the week. It ended up with Coach Tice doing it. Coach Loney was up in the booth, calling plays down. He is always bringing up good ideas and he is the (offensive coordinator). But the best way for us today was Coach Tice calling them in. It worked for us and got us in rhythm."
Daunte Culpepper,"Koren Robinson is a guy who has such great ability,"
Daunte Culpepper,"Koren Robinson is a guy who has such great ability. His off-the-field things, everybody goes through something to get where they want. We have to welcome him and embrace him and hope that he understands the importance of him being successful and doing the right thing."
Daunte Culpepper,"Nate is primed for a great year. He's worked very hard, and he has a lot of ability, so he's the type of player who makes plays."

e. e. cummings,"We do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable, worth listening to, worthy of our trust, sacred to our touch. Once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight or any experience that reveals the human spirit."
e. e. cummings,It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.
e. e. cummings,The world is mud-luscious and puddle-wonderful.
e. e. cummings,"I thank you God for this most amazing day, for the leaping greenly spirits of trees, and for the blue dream of sky and for everything which is natural, which is infinite, which is yes."

e. e. cummings,I imagine that yes is the only living thing.
John Cummings,I believe Westwood is teetering on the edge of going from a top 10 school system to a top 100.
John Cummings,The 2 percent would allow growth to pay for growth.
John Cummings,We need growth to pay for growth. We need other solutions.
John Cummings,"He didn't have cuts or bruises or any blood on him, ... Then I looked at the car seat. The force that was in this crash had destroyed the car seat."
John Cummings,"With a combination of last week's rains and (yesterday's rain), we could end up with a sizable disaster situation. It might not be a lot of major damage, but if it is spread out over the entire island, it could be significant."
John Cummings,"You want the harness to face the opposite direction we face,"
Bill Cunningham,"Ever since the incident, sheriff?s police have been conducting an investigation. We have identified the individual who is believed to have stabbed Iniguez, but he has not been charged as of yet."
Bill Cunningham,He was taken off life support by his family early this morning.
Bill Cunningham,"From what I can see, they're trying to create a new debate debate and it's pretty well established we have agreed to two debates,"
Bill Cunningham,There is a lot of uncertainty. It's a real searching out process right now. This crisis may prove to create a buying opportunity.
John Cunningham,"Courtney is a standout freshman. She's making adjustments to the longer high school courses and once she learns the course layouts, she'll handle it just fine."
John Cunningham,Not bad for a first two miles of the season. She ran a great race.
John Cunningham,"If you can't solve in your own head the pain, you're not going to be successful at all. And Jamie has the kind of focus and the mind set that 'I don't want anybody to catch me,'"
John Cunningham,"This is an outstanding opportunity for me. Not only am I excited to have joined such a vibrant organization, but I also get to work in PGE Park, one of the finest facilities anywhere. I'm also looking forward to working closely with Jim Taylor (Timbers' general manager) and his talented staff to continue building on the success of soccer in Portland."
John Cunningham,"Certainly, Bobby is most deserving of this honor. Bobby is a true role model, and we as an organization are very appreciative of his efforts this season and in the past."
John Cunningham,"Daisy can make about five miles with fully charged batteries, then her cute little rear end must be turned to the sun for 'refueling,'  ... She does have a standby generator to run her many decorative 110-volt lights and keep her batteries charged at night when her bottom goes cold."
John Cunningham,"As Portland's team, the Timbers organization prides itself on its extensive community involvement, ... Brian Winters has been there front-and-center leading those efforts for five years, so this honor is well-deserved."
John Cunningham,"Jamie came in over the summer and she said 'Coach, tell me what I need to do to lead this team,' ... I told her to go out and get in front and they'll all follow. I was thinking about a top five finish but you can't argue with first place."
Mario Cuomo,"The mugger who is arrested is back on the street before the police officer, but the person mugged may not be back on the street for a long time, if ever."
Mario Cuomo,"People expect Byzantine, Machiavellian logic from politicians. But the truth is simple. Trial lawyers learn a good rule: 'Don't decide what you don't have to decide.' That's not evasion, it's wisdom."
Mario Cuomo,"If you can manipulate news, a judge can manipulate the law."
Mario Cuomo,"If you can manipulate news, a judge can manipulate the law. A smart lawyer can keep a killer out of jail, a smart accountant can keep a thief from paying taxes, a smart reporter could ruin your reputation- unfairly."
Mario Cuomo,"You will not be able to tell that they are capable of greatness until you provide them with a packed house, a 3-and-2 count and the game is on the line."
Mario Cuomo,"You have these people who don't like the government they're supposed to be running,"
Mario Cuomo,"I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work fifteen and sixteen hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example."
Mario Cuomo,"I talk and talk and talk, and I haven't taught people in fifty years what my father taught me by example in one week."
Mario Cuomo,You want calamities? What about the Ice Age?
Bryan Cupito,He kind of told some people that he was having second thoughts. But I still figured he would go.
Bryan Cupito,He made it sound to us like he'll be back. I'm hoping he comes back. I'd really hate to have a senior year with different coaches.
Bryan Cupito,Maybe this is payback for all those close games in the past few years. It feels great to win this game. We finally beat Purdue! I hope people start to realize that we're a legit team.
Alan Curbishley,"We are quite pleased with his progress. He is seeing a specialist today and we are hopeful he is not going to be too far away. I think talk that he's going to be out for four or five weeks or even for the World Cup is really premature. We think he's got a really good chance of coming back before the end of the season, hopefully around about Bolton [on April 22] or semi-final day."
Alan Curbishley,"We're pleased with his progress. He's seeing a specialist and we're hopeful he won't be too far away. Talk that he'll be out for four or five weeks, for the rest of the season or even for the World Cup is very premature - we think he's got a good chance of coming back before the end of the season."
Alan Curbishley,"Not only have we got the result but we've played ever so well, that was a great performance,"
Alan Curbishley,Darren made one and scored one but it is a learning curve. He has got to think about how to get into games when things are not going so well.
Alan Curbishley,It's a big blow for us but a bigger blow for him. I just hope it isn't that serious.
Alan Curbishley,"We've lost our way in recent weeks, the hard work wasn't there but we're getting back to that now. Hopefully we're on our way to turning it round."
Alan Curbishley,"Then we got the bonus of the goals, which gave us something to hold on to and in the second half we were not under that much pressure."
Alan Curbishley,"If you look at the amount of games we have drawn then it's about average, but they've just all come at the same time. The clean sheets have helped us back on track. Now that we've tightened up I want us to get back to being more fruitful in front of goal and start scoring some more."
Alan Curbishley,"If we get a result on Saturday and pick something up from our game in hand against Newcastle, it can still change our season."
Alan Curbishley,"Timing is everything, and we will have to wait and see what happens in the future. You look at it, but you have got to be offered it."
Alan Curbishley,"I'd love to have Luke back before the end of the season so he can force his way into that squad, but he's looking at three to four weeks out."
Alan Curbishley,"We've allowed him to go out on loan because he needs to play some first-team football,"
Alan Curbishley,Danny didn't always do that well last season but he needed someone to believe in him. We kept faith and he's now really fit and determined.
Alan Curbishley,We played ever so well but Danny has been the best midfielder in the country by a mile since the season began; he should not be discounted by England.
Alan Curbishley,"I have been here 15 years and we have never had a decent run in this competition,"
Alan Curbishley,"I left some of the boys out completely to have a rest,"
Alan Curbishley,"It was a great night for us and a great achievement. Who knows what will happen in the next round. It was a night for the fans, but I would swap it for a home win in the league."
Monique Currie,"I think we're kind of on a mission now. We don't want to lose another game from here on out, so we're going after every game like it's our last game. It should show when we play."
Monique Currie,I knew I needed to come out and be prepared for this game. I knew I needed to be more aggressive and make better decisions and try to be under control. I was really focused on doing that.
Monique Currie,"It's good for women's basketball to have that many people come check out a game. We're excited, especially winning when the crowd is against you. It's even nicer that way. We look forward to hearing stunned silence."
Shannon Currier,Mike will be a very good cover corner(back). He has good speed and comes from an outstanding high school program.
Shannon Currier,"If they didn't have the grades to get in here out of high school, then no matter what they do in junior college, they're still not going to be accepted into Truman. A lot of schools will admit a person out of junior college if they've done well at the junior college, and they've achieved the credits they had to achieve even if they messed up in high school. That's the difference."
Shannon Currier,"You can't have practice on the field when there's bricks and boards on the sidelines. ... It was a yard, two yards off the actual sideline, so anybody that runs out of bounds, you're going to run into a brick."
Shannon Currier,"A lot of people will have that mentality of: Why Truman?, but I'll tell you what - we have a lot of good things at Truman. The people who go to school here are pretty fortunate. I'm fortunate to be here. We have the best academics in the conference. Our kids are getting jobs. We've just been named the No. 1 school in the conference for graduation rate. That's what you talk about."
Shannon Currier,"We are always looking for defensive players. A great defense will keep the team in every game, just like the Chicago Bears."
Shannon Currier,"We're so much deeper, and there's so much more competition. Not only do coaches see it, but players see it as well. Any time you have some competition at a position, it really makes everyone a lot better."
Eddy Curry,"I definitely see that out here in his coaching, ... He really stresses perfection out there for the bigs and for his point guards. Totally different style from what coach Skiles did. It's two different coaches, so I'm just trying to get used to everything and just take it all in."
Eddy Curry,"Sometimes it's hard to tell, but I feel like I'm definitely getting better. I'm learning more than I've ever learned. Now it's just a matter of time before I can incorporate that into what I'm doing on the court."
Eddy Curry,"When we finished regulation, the emotions were high. But then we came unglued. It was a lot of buildup to this point. I wanted to get this first game over with and now I'm looking forward to playing my first in the [Madison Square] Garden."
Eddy Curry,"When we finished regulation, the emotions were high. But then we came unglued, ... It was a lot of buildup to this point. I wanted to get this first game over with and now I'm looking forward to playing my first in the [Madison Square] Garden."
Eddy Curry,I certainly didn't tell nobody anything about what the doctors were doing and what they were finding. I didn't even know what they were finding. All I knew is that I was healthy and I was waiting and hoping that the truth would eventually come out like it's finally doing.
Eddy Curry,"There's one guy who isn't sure, ... I can live with that because of what the other doctors say."
John Curry,"To win a championship in March is something you work for all year. It puts a finishing touch on a great year we've had so far, and more to come hopefully."
John Curry,"There appears to have been a number of discussions held between Telstra and the Government which really should have been made public,"
John Curry,That is not their job at all. Their job is to keep all shareholders fully informed and the Government is just one shareholder out of 1.6 million and no shareholder should get any information before any other shareholder.
John Curry,"If you ask any goalie around, especially at this level, you need the confidence of both your team and your coaches. It felt good to hear that, and obviously I read it. He does that from time to time, he's very good at throwing little subtle hints in there."
John Curry,"Here (college) that's not going to cut it. You have to anticipate whether the guy's going to pass or shoot, things like that."
Charles Curtis,"The system should not have failed in this way, it should have held together. And there's either design problems or as we are saying, voltage support weaknesses in this system that have to be addressed,"
Charles Curtis,Fraud is the homage that force pays to reason.
Charles Curtis,"Bias and prejudice are attitudes to be kept in hand, not attitudes to be avoided."
John Curtis,What we've found is there is a continuing disruption for women.
John Curtis,We're trying to do some things with his delivery that are a little uncomfortable for him. We're trying to get his arm a little higher so he can go through the ball a little better.
John Curtis,"We are the ecological choice. These trees are biodegradable, grown as a crop. We're not going into the forest and taking down trees. They are grown specifically for this purpose, as you would grow corn to eat."
Richard Curtis,"It would be nice to get to the point where I don't have to think about it any more. People slip up all the time and refer to me as 'she'. I've even done it once in a bar when a friend introduced me to someone and I said, 'Hi, I'm Vanda. Oh no I'm not. I'm Richard'."
Richard Curtis,"The idea is to get people in with the romance, ... so I kept one foot in the old camp."
Richard Curtis,Laboratories can reduce risk by implementing a proven and internationally accepted quality assurance technology that is applicable across the globe.
Richard Curtis,"I want to be open about it because I think I've got to the point where I have no choice,"
George Armstrong Custer,"I would be willing, yes glad, to see a battle every day during my life."
George Armstrong Custer,"Benteen, come on, big village, be quick. Bring packs."
George Armstrong Custer,I appeal to you as a soldier to spare me the humiliation of seeing my regiment march to meet the enemy and I not share its dangers.
Bruce Cutler,She stole this money and her final lie is now that it's hush money. It's all a lie.
Bruce Cutler,The ice is thin for the government. Considering it's the summer time it might just get thinner.
Bruce Cutler,That's a lot of criminals.
Bruce Cutler,"They changed the title of the book, but it is the same book. They still haven't rectified any of the legal problems of the statute of limitations, of the staleness of the charges."
Bruce Cutler,"They're reprobates, low lives, not worthy of belief, and they have no morale conscience. They're paid government witnesses."
Bruce Cutler,"It's an appearance of justice, but it's not justice."
Bruce Cutler,"It's an appearance of justice, but it's not justice. It's just the beginning of the struggle, and I won't abandon it."
Jay Cutler,"Two years ago, I was just running around and throwing it,"
Jay Cutler,"We were confident all night. We moved the ball well, and our offensive line did a tremendous job."
Jay Cutler,But this year has just been a joy so far.
Jay Cutler,It's an honor to be linked to someone at that level. He's one of the best quarterbacks ever. But I've got a long way to go before that comparison is going to be a reality.
Jay Cutler,"We have some tough games [LSU, Georgia, at Florida and at Tennessee] left, but we are competitive with anybody, and that's a good feeling."
Jay Cutler,"This team has stuck together. We're a close-knit family. The coaches have been great, and things are going our way right now."
Alex Czajkowski,"Good question. The stock market is living proof that everybody loves to bet, and we think a wager on this prediction will appeal to all who follow the markets, whether they are big or small players."
Alex Czajkowski,"The Department of Justice has scared media owners into submission. That was a few years ago, and every now and then (the DOJ) will send a letter around or make a few calls. Everyone is still pretty jittery about it."
Alex Czajkowski,"There's always a risk with these shows that information will leak and certain people will try to take advantage of it,"
Alex Czajkowski,"The Masters truly is a tradition unlike any other. It will also be, by far, the most bet on golf event ever. Like last year, we expect to see a lot of people taking advantage of the real-time betting option, meaning that you can adjust your bets as the action progresses."
Alex Czajkowski,"We are very disappointed that the Hall of Fame has turned down our offer, though we are not completely surprised. We understand and respect the Hall of Fame's position."
Alex Czajkowski,"Everybody bets on March Madness. It's one of the biggest betting events of the year, but more and more people are starting to bet on the conference tournaments. There is just so much on the line in these tournaments and the passion runs deep - it's a great lead-in to March Madness."
Alex Czajkowski,"We are able to make this commitment because we have confidence in our betting lines - we're not waiting to see how lines open, we're setting the markets. Everybody bets, but the more time we can give our players to consider their positions the better. Posting our betting lines the afternoon before next day's game provides our customers with a real edge. And our in-game betting takes the action to a whole other level, although it can be tough to type while jumping up and down screaming for your team!"
Alex Czajkowski,New Books! French!
Alex Czajkowski,"Everyone bets on baseball and there is no bigger player than the Rocket. He is apt to have a real impact on whatever team he signs with, so fans will be watching closely. Only a few teams have pockets deep enough to sign him though, which could signal his return to New York or Houston ."
Alex Czajkowski,"Everybody loves to bet on baseball and to weigh in on the big issues and stories of the day, and there's no bigger story right now than Bonds' assault on the home run record. There's no sitting on the fence when it comes to Bonds. People either think he's a great player and deserves to break the record or they think he's a cheater and want him suspended from the sport, there's no middle ground."
Alex Czajkowski,"Being voted into the Hall of Fame is the biggest individual honor in baseball. Being voted in on the first ballot is what cements your place in history as one of the greatest to ever play the game. There are likely to be many voters that will think twice about placing Bonds in that elite company, especially when you consider he's never been the most popular individual with the media."
Alex Czajkowski,Our baseball fans are tremendously excited about this event. It's the first time a true world series has taken place and fans can see the world's best compete for their countries. When it comes to national pride everybody likes to bet on the outcome. This event will really go a long way in finally determining who the real power is in baseball.
Alex Czajkowski,"We see this exclusive agreement with Hooters Magazine as the beginning of a long and rewarding partnership. Sportsbook.com is the largest online gaming site on the planet and Hooters Restaurants are the best places to watch sports in North America. We both work with some of the same talent, like model and entertainer Brooke Burke."

Sportsbook.com is the largest online gaming site on the planet and Hooters Restaurants are the best places to watch sports in North America. We both work with some of the same talent, like model and entertainer Brooke Burke."
Alex Czajkowski,If this were a presidential race we'd be up until the early hours of the morning waiting to declare a winner. What the trends show is that everybody has an opinion and everybody bets on March Madness.
