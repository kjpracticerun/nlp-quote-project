Michael Pachter,"The worst effects of the transition lie ahead. Although we expect a brief respite from double-digit sales declines in April, when Microsoft is likely to double the supply of Xbox 360 hardware units, we expect a return to software sales declines over the next several months."
Michael Pachter,"We believe that industry sales have been quite weak since Take-Two's late October negative preannouncement, primarily due to consumer malaise and a shortage of Xbox 360 hardware... Given weak November NPD sales and Electronic Arts' and Activision's recent earnings warnings, we believe that Take-Two likely experienced weak sales during the holiday period, as consumers continue to shun current generation games while waiting for next generation consoles."
Michael Pachter,"After April, we expect monthly next generation software sales to remain fairly stable at around $100 - 150 million through October (representing year-over-year growth of $80 - 130 million), with declines of current generation software sales expected to remain at around $130 - 150 million monthly. We expect relatively flat sales through the summer months, with potentially robust sales in November and December, once next generation consoles from Sony and Nintendo are launched."
Michael Pachter,"We note that NPD U.S. retail video-game software sales data for the January quarter implies that Take-Two's sales are down 40 percent compared with the prior-year quarter, so we believe that the company is likely on track to meet our revenue and earnings per share estimates for the period."
Michael Pachter,NPD US retail video game software sales data for the January quarter implies that Take-Two's sales are down 40 percent compared with the prior year quarter.
Michael Pachter,"It's like a shifting of loan repayment responsibility, collateralized by Midway shares."
Michael Pachter,"Although Midway continues [to] generate large losses, we continue to believe that Midway is a potential turnaround story. The company's cost structure suggests that it can achieve profitability at revenue levels of $300 million annually, and we remain confident that Midway will be able to generate revenues at the $300 - 800 million level over the next several years. However, to achieve this level of revenues, the company must continue to expend resources on growing its development capability."
Michael Pachter,"We believe that speculation about a potential leveraged buyout is unfounded. If anything, Take-Two's disclosure that it may require additional capital to fund next generation game development suggests to us that it is not an LBO candidate."
Michael Pachter,"We do not expect a current generation Xbox price cut from Microsoft this year, notwithstanding the company's stated intention to 'support' the current generation console. We believe that Microsoft's production cost of the Xbox is higher than the current retail price, precluding further price cuts, and we also think that the company prefers that consumers buy its next generation console when that box is introduced."
Michael Pachter,"[Sony's people have] bet the entire future on this, ... It's too important for them to lose, so they will do everything they can to win."
Michael Pachter,You're going to see the Revolution as the second console of choice in the household.
Michael Pachter,"Microsoft's first-mover advantage is eroding if it takes them very long to get the first 5 million boxes out. If 4 million show up in the month of June and Sony launches in the month of June, there's not much of an advantage (for Microsoft)."
Al Pacino,Vanity is my favourite sin.

Al Pacino,My first language was shy. It's only by having been thrust into the limelight that I have learned to cope with my shyness.
Al Pacino,"I was a kid when Dean came out. Dean was the inspiration. Even the red jacket he wore in 'Rebel Without a Cause,' you saw that red jacket popping up all over the place. He really reached people in a way; it was kind of a phenomenon when you think of it. I wonder what it would be like today, that kind of a person ... he made that connection with his audience. And I remember at that time my mother loved him. He reached everybody."
Al Pacino,It's easy to fool the eye but it's hard to fool the heart.
Manny Pacquiao,This was very important. I don't get to Morales without a victory.
Manny Pacquiao,I could see he was having problems taking my punches. I had no problem taking his.
Manny Pacquiao,"Last fight there were a lot of distractions in my mind, ... (Now) there are no distractions. I'm just worried about my opponent. I'm very focused on my training right now."

Manny Pacquiao,I saw I hurt him every time I hit him in the body.
Manny Pacquiao,"In the sixth round I knew he was getting tired when I hit him with one punch to the body. But I had to take my time with him because he's a great boxer, too. In the 10th, I tried to knock him out."
Manny Pacquiao,"I would only spend a week or two in the Philippines, most probably the week during my birthday because I am planning to give away Christmas gifts to the poor people of General Santos just like what I did last year,"

David Page,We fully anticipate that rates will remain on hold for the rest of this year.
David Page,It looks like 2006 saw the housing market in the rude health it ended last year and the market could continue to accelerate in the coming months. That's something the Bank of England will keep its eye on.
David Page,The MPC is keen to assess pay deals after the New Year and consumer spending over the Christmas period. Only then will it be willing to think about further rate cuts.
Jimmy Page,"We went in and recorded exactly where we were at that point in time. I think because of the quality of musicianship of the band has given it the longevity. I thought the music would endure, I didn't think I would.. I always thought I'd be dead by 30 then dead by 40 and on and on. Now I'm 55 so I didn't even die at 50."
Jimmy Page,"I think when you're faced with a plight that's inescapable, and there's something you can do about it, you hope you can make a difference."

Jimmy Page,"Almost the moment he died, they put him in Playboy as one of the greatest drummers, which he was - there's no doubt about it. There's never been anybody since. He's one of the greatest drummers that ever lived."
Jimmy Page,"I always felt if we were going in to do an album, there should already be a lot of structure already made up so we could get on with that and see what else happened."

Jimmy Page,"But to put out a greatest hits on one CD was totally impossible, I just couldn't do it. The best compromise was to put out two CDs - Early Days - which is what it is - and Latter Days."

Larry Page,We are targeting innovation. We believe mobile applications are essential.
Larry Page,"Many companies have suffered from unreasonable speculation, small initial share float, and boom-bust cycles that hurt them and their investors in the long run. We believe that an auction-based IPO will minimize these problems."
Larry Page,"We have a mantra: don't be evil, which is to do the best things we know how for our users, for our customers, for everyone. So I think if we were known for that, it would be a wonderful thing."
Larry Page,You don't need to have a 100-person company to develop that idea.
Larry Page,"Our company relies on having the trust of our users and using that information for that benefit. That's a very strong motivation for us. We're committed to that. If you start to mandate how products are designed, I think that's a really bad path to follow. I think instead we should have laws that protect the privacy of data, for example, from government requests and other kinds of requests."
Larry Page,This amendment would actually grant one company an unregulated monopoly.

Patti Page,Every woman wanted him to be either her son or her lover. But it was that mischievous little look on his face that I loved.
Patti Page,"I think that one of Elvis' charms was that he could sing almost any kind of music. I am sure that in his heart, which I don't know what was there, but just from his singing I could feel that he was very partial to gospel music."

Camille Paglia,"I don't remember the fat women. Can we leave the fat women out of this? Excuse me, I have to go to the toilet."
Camille Paglia,"A woman simply is, but a man must become. Masculinity is risky and elusive. It is achieved by a revolt from woman, and it is confirmed only by other men. Manhood coerced into sensitivity is no manhood at all."

Camille Paglia,"The trauma of the Sixties persuaded me that my generation's egalitarianism was a sentimental error. I now see the hierarchical as both beautiful and necessary. Efficiency liberates; egalitarianism tangles, delays, blocks, deadens."
Camille Paglia,"The greatest honor that can be paid to the work of art, on its pedestal of ritual display, is to describe it with sensory completeness. We need a science of description. Criticism is ceremonial revivification."
Camille Paglia,Minerva save us from the cloying syrup of coercive compassion!
Camille Paglia,American universities are organized on the principle of the nuclear rather than the extended family. Graduate students are grimly trained to be technicians rather than connoisseurs. The old German style of universal scholarship has gone.
Camille Paglia,"Teenage boys, goaded by their surging hormones run in packs like the primal horde. They have only a brief season of exhilarating liberty between control by their mothers and control by their wives."
Camille Paglia,"Our major universities are now stuck with an army of pedestrian, toadying careerists, Fifties types who wave around Sixties banners to conceal their record of ruthless, beaver-like tunneling to the top."
Camille Paglia,The only thing that will be remembered about my enemies after they're dead is the nasty things I've said about them.
Camille Paglia,"I believe that history has shape, order, and meaning; that exceptional men, as much as economic forces, produce change; and that passe abstractions like beauty, nobility, and greatness have a shifting but continuing validity."
Camille Paglia,"All objects, all phases of culture are alive. They have voices. They speak of their history and interrelatedness. And they are all talking at once!"
Camille Paglia,If civilization had been left in female hands we would still be living in grass huts.
Camille Paglia,"A serious problem in America is the gap between academe and the mass media, which is our culture. Professors of humanities, with all their leftist fantasies, have little direct knowledge of American life and no impact whatever on public policy."
Camille Paglia,"Men know they are sexual exiles. They wander the earth seeking satisfaction, craving and despising, never content. There is nothing in that anguished motion for women to envy."
Camille Paglia,"The 1990s, after the reign of terror of academic vandalism, will be a decade of restoration: restoration of meaning, value, beauty, pleasure, and emotion to art and restoration of art to its audience."

Camille Paglia,Pursuit and seduction are the essence of sexuality. It's part of the sizzle.
Camille Paglia,Television is actually closer to reality than anything in books. The madness of TV is the madness of human life.

Camille Paglia,"When anything goes, it's women who lose."
Camille Paglia,"Every man must define his identity against his mother. If he does not, he just falls back into her and is swallowed up."
Camille Paglia,"Beauty is our weapon against nature; by it we make objects, giving them limit, symmetry, proportion. Beauty halts and freezes the melting flux of nature."

Rod Paige,"We don't need fear, we need to make sure the boys and girls who (Dr. King) wanted to be good citizens have the opportunity to be judged by their character and not the color of their skin."
Rod Paige,"It was a source of a good deal of bitterness, anger, frustration that we were not quite as worthy as others,"
Rod Paige,"All across America,"

Chuck Palahniuk,Did you ever think about life as a metaphor for television?

Chuck Palahniuk,"The muffled thunder of dialogue comes through the walls, then a chorus of laughter. Then more thunder. Most of the laugh tracks on television were recorded in the early 1950s. These days, most of the people you hear laughing are dead."

Chuck Palahniuk,"When we don't know who to hate, we hate ourselves."
Chuck Palahniuk,"Language was just our way to explain away the wonder and the glory of the world. To deconstruct. To dismiss. People can't deal with how beautiful the world really is. How it can't be explained and understood. We don't live in the real world anymore, we live in a world of symbols."
Chuck Palahniuk,When did the future switch from being a promise to being a threat?
Chuck Palahniuk,Itâ€™s funny how the beauty of art has so much more to do with the frame than with the artwork itself.

Chuck Palahniuk,Losing all hope is freedom
Chuck Palahniuk,"In most hospitals, paging Nurse Flamingo means a fire. Dr. Blaze means a fire. Dr. Green means a suicide. Dr. Blue means somebody stopped breathing. Nothing is straight forward anymore. In a grocery store, paging Mr. Cash is a call for an armed security guard. Paging Freight check to Women's Clothing means somebody is shoplifting in that department. Other stores page a fake woman named Sheila. Sheila to the front means somebody is shoplifting in the front of the store. Mr. Cash and Sheila and Nurse Flamingo are always bad news. It's what people say when they don't want you to hear the truth."
Chuck Palahniuk,"You can buy about four hundred tiny fashion separates that mix and match to create three tasteful outfits. In that way, the doll is incredibly lifelike. Chilling, even."
Chuck Palahniuk,"You take the population of vehicles in the field (A) and multiply it by the probable rate of failure (B), then multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement (C).A times B times C equals X. This is what it will cost if we don't initiate a recall.If X is greater than the cost of a recall, we recall all the cars and no one gets hurt.If X is less than the cost of a recall, then we don't recall."
Chuck Palahniuk,A tiger can smileA snake will say it loves youLies make us evil
Chuck Palahniuk,"The first step - especially for young people with energy and drive and talent, but not money - the first step to controlling your world is to control your culture. To model and demonstrate the kind of world you demand to live in. To write the books. Make the music. Shoot the films. Paint the art."

Chuck Palahniuk,Big Brother isnâ€™t watching. Heâ€™s singing and dancing. Heâ€™s pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brotherâ€™s busy holding your attention every moment youâ€™re awake. Heâ€™s making sure youâ€™re always distracted. Heâ€™s making sure youâ€™re fully absorbed.
Chuck Palahniuk,"Our culture has made us all the same. No one is truly white or black or rich, anymore. We all want the same. Individually, we are nothing."
Chuck Palahniuk,Every generation wants to be the last. Every generation hates the next trend in music they can't understand. We hate to give up those reins of our culture.
Chuck Palahniuk,"â€œExperts in ancient Greek culture say that people back then didnâ€™t see their thoughts as belonging to them. When ancient Greeks had a thought, it occurred to them as a god or goddess giving an order. Apollo was telling them to be brave. Athena was telling them to fall in love. Now people hear a commercial for sour cream potato chips and rush out to buy, but now they call this free will. At least the ancient Greeks were being honest.â€"
Chuck Palahniuk,"We have to show these men and women freedom by enslaving them, and show them courage by frightening them."
Chuck Palahniuk,"Here in the bathroom with me are razor blades. Here is iodine to drink. Here are sleeping pills to swallow. You have a choice. Live or die. Every breath is a choice. Every minute is a choice. To be or not to be. Every time you donâ€™t throw yourself down the stairs, thatâ€™s a choice. Every time you donâ€™t crash your car, you reenlist."
Chuck Palahniuk,"That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both ways"
Chuck Palahniuk,"To preserve yourself as the center of the world, to stay your own best authority on everything, your own expert on all topics, infallible, omniscient. Always, every time of the month, forever: Use birth control."
Chuck Palahniuk,Imagine books and music and movies being filtered and homogenized. Certified. Approved for consumption. People will be happy to give up most of their culture for the assurance that the tiny bit that comes through is safe and clean. White noise.
Chuck Palahniuk,"You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake... This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."

Chuck Palahniuk,People don't want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas. Their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messed cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown.
Chuck Palahniuk,"More and more, it feels like I'm doing a really bad impersonation of myself."
Chuck Palahniuk,Every woman is just a different kind of problem.

Chuck Palahniuk,The answer is there is no answer.

Chuck Palahniuk,"Why is it you feel like a dope if you laugh alone, but that's usually how you end up crying?"
Chuck Palahniuk,You have a choice. Live or die. Every breath is a choice. Every minute is a choice. To be or not to be.
Chuck Palahniuk,"I used to work in a funeral home to feel good about myself, just the fact that I was breathing."
Chuck Palahniuk,I just don't want to die without a few scars.

Grace Paley,Let us go forth with fear and courage and rage to save the world.
Grace Paley,"I was a fantastic student until ten, and then my mind began to wander."
William Paley,God has been pleased to prescribe limits to his power and to work out his ends within these limits.
William Paley,What we are doing is satisfying the American public. That's our job. I always say we have to give most of the people what they want most of the time. That's what they expect from us.
William Paley,In what way can a revelation be made but by miracles? In none which we are able to conceive.
Brian De Palma,You really are as hot as your last movie. And it goes away really quickly.
Brian De Palma,"You know, when people want to get any information, research information, it will all exist on these Web sites."
Brian De Palma,"You know, I listen to contemporary music all the time."
Brian De Palma,You know it's always amazed me - I think the most startling thing that's happened in the last couple of decades is that there is no sort of objective reporting anymore.
Brian De Palma,"When you make a movie outside the system and it's successful critically or a moderate financial success, you usually have to go back into the system and make a big hit."
Brian De Palma,"Well, like any time you're shooting documentary stuff, you've got to be in the moment, and you've got to be able to be in control enough to capture what's happening."
Brian De Palma,"Well, I just think through your career you go through different phases, and I just got sort of uninspired by the whole studio process of making and releasing films."
Brian De Palma,The real trouble with film school is that the people teaching are so far out of the industry that they don't give the students an idea of what's happening.
Brian De Palma,"The biggest mistake in student films is that they are usually cast so badly, with friends and people the directors know. Actually you can cover a lot of bad direction with good acting."
Brian De Palma,"That's what noir feels like to me. It feels like some kind of recurring dream, with very strong archetypes operating. You know, the guilty girl being pursued, falling, all kinds of stuff that we see in our dreams all the time."
Brian De Palma,"So I like to try to go back and develop pure visual storytelling. Because to me, it's one of the most exciting aspects of making movies and almost a lost art at this point."
Brian De Palma,It's always great when you discover someone.
Brian De Palma,It's always great to discover a new star of tomorrow.
Brian De Palma,I've dropped myself into straightforward character pieces in order to explore that form and reap its values. But you are sort of restricted visually when your first requirement is to tell a fairly straightforward story.
Brian De Palma,I've been sort of traveling around the country for ten years talking about independent features.
Brian De Palma,"I've been obsessed with this kind of visual storytelling for quite a while, and I try to create material that allows me to explore it."
Brian De Palma,I'm always looking for a kind of new musical entity to sort of move into a motion picture venue.
Brian De Palma,"I was thinking of doing something - I'm always sort of fascinated, you know, I have a fascination with watching these kids on MTV videos."
Brian De Palma,"I mean, I don't mind promoting a movie, or talking to the press if it's going to be used in some way."
Brian De Palma,"I hadn't done just a straight-out comedy in a long time, just letting an ensemble do really good character acting, having them carry the movie as in my earlier pictures."
Brian De Palma,"I guess what's most surprised me in most of the reviews is that they don't seem to get the noir story in the dream sequence, so they analyze it like a straight noir movie."
Brian De Palma,I don't see scarey films. I certainly wouldn't go see my films.
Brian De Palma,I do like directing other people's material.
Brian De Palma,"However, ironically, I was baptized Presbyterian, and went to a Quaker school for twelve years."
Brian De Palma,"However, I spent most of my time in a Quaker school."
Brian De Palma,"Godard is incredibly brilliant, the things he says. Apparently here in France, the most interesting thing when a new film of his is going to come out are his press conferences, because he's so brilliant."
Brian De Palma,"But, number one, I think traditional noir doesn't work in contemporary storytelling because we don't live in that world anymore."
Brian De Palma,"And we've become very doubtful of our information sources, because they're all controlled by these huge multilateral corporations."
Brian De Palma,And that's what's so inspirational about something like DIONYSUS. It actually records the moment that it happened. Kind of like a document of the period.
Brian De Palma,"Yeah, I had an idea to make a very scary movie, based on a kind of serial murderer that preys on tourists."
Andy Palmer,"I thought that last one of his looked good. He had the responsibility on top of that zone and that's a lot of work, but I'm glad to see him play well."
Andy Palmer,"They gave us open threes which are good shots and shots we don't mind them taking, but they just didn't go in today. We couldn't get in a flow, but you have to credit their defense. We had some decent looks that we just couldn't knock down."
Andy Palmer,"He's by far the quickest guard we've faced this year, without a doubt. That was one of our weak spots defensively was guarding off the dribble. We had trouble with it early in the year. We thought we done a better job the second half."
Andy Palmer,"I think that one thing that will help us is our schedule and our season. We've played good competition, we've played good teams and we've won on the road against good teams. That experience has prepared us for this run. Even though we have some losses, it's helped us."
Arnold Palmer,"It has been a matter of great pride for me when my name was placed on an entity of one sort or another over the years, but I can't think of anything that brings me more pleasure and satisfaction than having it on the tournament that has meant so much to me for so long."
Arnold Palmer,"It is not a dreamlike state, but the somehow insulated state, that a great musician achieves in a great performance. He's aware of where he is and what he's doing, but his mind is on the playing of the instrument with an internal sense of rightness -- it is not merely mechanical, it is not only spiritual; it is something of both, on a different plane and a more remote one."
Arnold Palmer,"This is great for golf, the Tri-State PGA and amateur golfers,"
Arnold Palmer,"It's a funny thing, the more I practice the luckier I get"
Arnold Palmer,"I'm not objectionable to it. In the beginning, we tried to do some extra stuff to make it attractive to the players, but now the indication is the guys want to come in on Tuesday night and play Wednesday in the pro-am as their practice round."
Arnold Palmer,"Winning isn't everything, but wanting it is."
Arnold Palmer,I never quit trying. I never felt that I didn't have a chance to win.
Arnold Palmer,I have a tip that can take 5 strokes off anyone's golf game. It's called an eraser.
Arnold Palmer,Golf is deceptively simple and endlessly complicated.
Arnold Palmer,Putting is like wisdom - partly a natural gift and partly the accumulation of experience.
Arnold Palmer,"Concentration, Confidence, Competitive urge, Capacity for enjoyment."
Arnold Palmer,What do I mean by concentration? I mean focusing totally on the business at hand and commanding your body to do exactly what you want it to do.
Arnold Palmer,You must play boldly to win.
Arnold Palmer,Success in golf depends less on strength of body than upon strength of mind and character.
Arnold Palmer,"I never rooted against an opponent, but I never rooted for him either."
Arnold Palmer,"Always make a total effort, even when the odds are against you."
Arnold Palmer,The most rewarding things you do in life are often the ones that look like they cannot be done.
Arnold Palmer,Golf is deceptively simple and endlessly complicated; it satisfies the soul and frustrates the intellect. It is at the same time rewarding and maddening - and it is without a doubt the greatest game mankind has ever invented.
Arnold Palmer,"What other people may find in poetry, I find in the flight of a good drive."
Arnold Palmer,"I've always made a total effort, even when the odds seemed entirely against me. I never quit trying; I never felt that I didn't have a chance to win."
Arnold Palmer,"What other people may find in poetry or art museums, I find in the flight of a good drive."
Carson Palmer,"I think Coach just wanted to let some starters rest. Going into a game like (next week's), you don't need momentum."
Carson Palmer,"There's progress in a lot of areas but a lot of things we have to execute better. Our main thing is you want to get better week to week and be ready for opening day, and we got better last week."
Carson Palmer,"You interchange those guys in and out, and you've got power and speed and so forth. We do a really good job offensively with our scheme and keeping those guys on their toes."
Carson Palmer,"This team's really, really been grinding. And that's Marvin's philosophy. For us to get a week off and have an opportunity to really rest our bodies and get ready for the playoffs would be huge."
Carson Palmer,I'm more excited about getting past the Chiefs and moving on forward from that.
Carson Palmer,"I thought a lot about it. It seems like everything happened so fast. Parts of last night that seemed like minutes were hours. Looking back, some of last night flew by. But I don't think this thing is going to hit me until I get going on the rehab session, start battling the road back."
Carson Palmer,It's not just the quarterback going out there and playing out of his mind. You've got to have a good team around you.
Carson Palmer,"He's going to say some random things and speak what's on his mind. To say that what he said puts more pressure on us or is bulletin-board material, none of that is needed. This is a big enough game in itself."
Carson Palmer,He was a phenomenal player. He just kind of had a bad streak of luck.
Carson Palmer,"The truth is that if I wasn't hurt I'd be here for 2 1/2 hours â€“ but now I've got to work out for 2 1/2 hours and I've got 2 1/2 to 3 hours more of rehab to do, so I'm not cheating anybody."
Carson Palmer,That's my fault. I need to just throw it away early and cut our losses. I hurt the team on that one.
Carson Palmer,"He's a very passionate person, and you could tell Cincinnati had a very big place in his heart."
Carson Palmer,"Chad really is harmless. He's a little kid at heart and does a lot of things that make you laugh. He just loosens the mood and makes you realize, we're still playing a game."
Carson Palmer,It's going to be a lot of fun to have them in our place.
Carson Palmer,Football is a very physical game; things happen. I don't hold a grudge at all. I don't think he meant to do it. It's part of the game. ... It's a freak accident.
Carson Palmer,"Oh, no question, ... He's one of those guys that got thrown into the fire early. It's tough. They're trying to build a team around him and going through growing pains."
Carson Palmer,[This is] a great moment for me both professionally and personally. Working with the coaches here and the Brown family has been a tremendous experience. I love our prospects for being a great team into the future and we love living in Cincinnati.
Carson Palmer,"I have a lot more experience, so I feel like I'm a different quarterback since that game."
Carson Palmer,"A lot of it is just experience,"
Carson Palmer,"It's great to sit and learn, and it's great to get in there and get experience, ... I don't think there's a right or wrong way to do it. It depends on what the team needs. Dave's situation: They didn't have a quarterback, so he had to play."
Carson Palmer,"He wears his emotions on his sleeve sometimes. He's an emotional player. He's very competitive, and he wants the ball."
Carson Palmer,He wears the emotions on his sleeve sometimes. That's not a good or a bad thing. It's just that he's an emotional player and a competitive player. He wants the ball.
Carson Palmer,"The defense has given us every advantage, ... With the tempo we've had on offense, that's been a good combination."
Carson Palmer,"That doesn't happen to that defense, ... They're the No. 2 defense in the league and they're a very good, aggressive, physical defense."
Carson Palmer,"We weren't perfect today, but we did a lot of really good things. Offensively it was easy. When the defense gets you the ball that many times in a row, that many times on their side of the 50 and a couple of times in the red zone it really makes it easier for you offensively."
Carson Palmer,The defense is making it easy on us.
Carson Palmer,My groin felt great. I could have ended up playing the whole game. But I think Coach (Marvin Lewis) wanted to let some of the starters rest.
Carson Palmer,"We've come a long way at reading each other's body language at the line of scrimmage when we're watching what the defense is doing to us, ... He's come a long way on that and he's brought me along with him."
Carson Palmer,He used his body today to block the defender off. He used a basketball move where he posted him up a little bit.
Carson Palmer,"Before we're a championship team, we need to get better offensively and really take advantage of every turnover, ... We punted a lot today."
Corky Palmer,"I'm really proud of our freshmen. They played really well today. This was a good win today, but we still have two more games to go this weekend."
Corky Palmer,"Pretty much the same song, different verse from last night for us. It's just really a poor excuse for college baseball on our part."
Corky Palmer,"Marc likes challenges whether it's schoolwork or baseball. If they were all as self-motivated as Marc Maddox, on and off the field, it'd be really easy to coach."
Corky Palmer,"It's kind of one of those deals where you're trying to stay up with the other college baseball programs. The interest is there, and that's obviously good for the program."
Corky Palmer,"It was a frustrating weekend because after Friday night (a 12-3 loss), we played pretty good baseball. We're not going to lay down, but we'll have to put everything together if we're going to get it going."
Corky Palmer,"It's really a poor excuse for college baseball on our part. It's things we work on every day. It's pretty evident to me that the lack of experience is hurting us. If you look out on the field, it's all happening with guys that have not played in big conference series. It's all happening to them. We're really struggling."
David Palmer,That is the best part of the plan. Youth services are what we've always done best here.
David Palmer,Recent sales trends likely caused the end.
David Palmer,This is a great representation of the breadth and diversity of investment opportunities here in the Greater Pittsburgh area.
Jesse Palmer,"I want the team to be better, ... So it is kind of unfair to be selfish and not try and help my teammates out. I am very competitive, though, and I do want that backup job and I'm playing as hard as I can to get that. I'm not going to not talk to somebody, especially Tim who I've known now since our rookie year together. We came out the same year, so we met at the (scouting) combine."
Jesse Palmer,"It's funny - there have been a lot of changes, obviously, since I've been here, and it hasn't really been that long, ... It was great playing with Kerry and Jason and guys like Kurt, and getting a chance to take different things from all those guys."
Jesse Palmer,"[Lorenzen] had good poise. He ran his team well, ... had a real nice (throw) off of play action."
John Palmer,"If fuel prices persist at current levels then the potential exists for the current year's performance to be around 40% below 2005,"
John Palmer,"If they did it, it would represent a very serious crisis,"
John Palmer,"I really don't understand it. His footwork and coach-ability make him a major asset. He's a great student, a great young man. Here's a player who I know can help a team somewhere if given the opportunity."
Mark Palmer,The educational value of sharks in captivity is overrated.
Mark Palmer,"We didn't even have enough space to keep the trailers, so we put them on property that someone let us use. But then, security becomes a concern."
Mark Palmer,"We have no knowledge about the documents in possession of ABC News, nor the significance of those documents, but we do know what we have repeatedly told our employees since October 25 -- and that is in no uncertain terms that they are to preserve all documents and materials,"
Mark Palmer,"It just made no sense to train people to fire a gun and use a baton, then sit them in dispatch."
Mark Palmer,"Taiwanese should not feel depressed at the tumultuous situation in the pursuit of democracy, for Taiwan has actually achieved the highest level of freedom."
Mark Palmer,We 're pleased to have reached a tentative agreement so we may be able to pay additional severance benefits to our former employees.
LeeAnn Palo,We didn't want to go home without a trophy.
LeeAnn Palo,"We had a lot of girls returning from last year, and Amanda transferred in, so I knew we could be much stronger. It's my last year and I just want to take us as far as we can go."
LeeAnn Palo,We would never believe from our sophomore year that we could put together a team like this our senior year.
Rob Palombi,The underlying trend is one of strong consumption growth and strong spending -- not something the Fed is going to consider particularly positive. The Fed's series of interest rate increases have not yet been enough to significantly deter the consumer from spending.
Rob Palombi,Greenspan's objective is to keep the U.S. economy expanding for as long a stretch as possible. That's why he's being so prudent in his speeches and that's why he'll adjust monetary policy to allow for that.
Rob Palombi,Gridlock leads to more debt reduction than either tax cuts or new spending. Because what we will be left with at the end of the day are larger surpluses.
Gwyneth Paltrow,"He's chosen wonderful women to be with, and he doesn't hold a grudge."
Gwyneth Paltrow,"When I presented at the Oscars last year, everyone would say to me, 'Where's your husband? Is there trouble in the marriage?' ... And I was like, Why on earth would I bring my husband?"
Gwyneth Paltrow,"I would still travel for a shoot, but it involves a lot more logistics. The hours are so hard and long. That's why I think one movie a year would be plenty, and I could be at home the rest of the time. Gone are the days of doing back-to-back movies. That will never happen again. At least not until they're all in college."
Gwyneth Paltrow,"It's given me a kind of centeredness and roundedness and a feeling of perspective,"
Gwyneth Paltrow,"I made the mistake of working too much and it turned out to be really the wrong thing. I just had a lot of life in 10 years. I worked so much for so long. I achieved a lot early, but I wasn't very happy. At this point in my life, I have a real life."
Gwyneth Paltrow,I never go into anything with intentions other than doing justice to the material. I just feel fortunate for the part.
Gwyneth Paltrow,"She's so clever and very, very funny,"
Gwyneth Paltrow,"(Last year), I just had a baby and thought, 'I don't want to live there.' Bush's anti-environment, pro-war policies are a (disgrace)."
Gwyneth Paltrow,Love is the Devil.
Gwyneth Paltrow,"There's a group I've been close to, since childhood. We spend a lot of time together.'"
Gwyneth Paltrow,"Beauty, to me, is about being comfortable in your own skin. That, or a kick-ass red lipstick."
Gwyneth Paltrow,"My father, he was like the rock, the guy you went to with every problem."
Orhan Pamuk,"Well, on the one hand the Turks have the legitimate need to defend their national dignity - and this includes being recognized as a part of the west and Europe."
Orhan Pamuk,"There's been quite a clear upswing in nationalist sentiments. Everyone is talking about it, in Turkey as well."
Orhan Pamuk,The opponents of this process have always tried to vilify westernization as a poor imitation.
Orhan Pamuk,The hero of the book does long to experience God. But his conception of God is very western.
Orhan Pamuk,"The first edition was 100,000 copies, a huge economic risk for the publisher. I was quite proud of the fact that the book was not banned or censored."
Orhan Pamuk,"My hero wants to belong too, but he doesn't want to give up all the things he came to value in the west."
Orhan Pamuk,I want to describe the psychological state of the people in a certain city.
Orhan Pamuk,"I really don't want to portray the Islamists as simply evil, the way it's often done in the west."
Orhan Pamuk,At some point they figured out that you can win elections with a pro-European policy because the voters hope this will improve their lives.
Orhan Pamuk,At first my publisher had reservations about publishing it in the form you are familiar with.
Mal Pancoast,Telling someone the truth is a loving act.
Mal Pancoast,Thinking is heavily endorsed.
Mal Pancoast,It takes only one other person to say it's so-one other point of reality to make something real.
Mal Pancoast,My wife isn't married to me forever; she's married to me for good. That keeps me on my toes.
Mal Pancoast,"A new lens to look through. Hear the pain in people's speaking. People who have an ear to hear can hear. You will no longer tolerate what you used to tolerate. A second point of reality. Declare a new future. There are no right answers. There is no is. Give people breakdowns. It's the loving thing to do. What's being revealed here? Dogs don't have things wrong. Wrong disempowers people. Upsets indicate a ''right'' that's been violated. Notice when you are angry that you are the only one around. The only constant thing is you. Business is made up. It's invented. We invent our world through language. If it really turns you on, you may want to inform your face. There is no ''right'' way. A chair is only a chair because we say it's a chair."
Mal Pancoast,Set up the listening. Prepare who you are talking to for what you want them to hear. Get people to listen as a possibility rather than a problem.
Mal Pancoast,We invent the world through language. The world occurs through language.
Mal Pancoast,The opposite of love is not hate. It is indifference.
Mal Pancoast,The odds of hitting your target go up dramatically when you aim at it.
Leon Panetta,"It is tough enough for the Secret Service to do its job without this. If I were still chief of staff, I would order the damned site (to) pull it down."
Leon Panetta,Both sides of the spectrum are really going to use the opportunity provided by Katrina to really begin to test some ideas that they otherwise couldn't test.
Leon Panetta,"You really ought to think twice before you appoint a staff member to a position like Supreme Court justice,"
Leon Panetta,"They feel confident that we will be able to bring the person responsible for this outrage to justice,"
Leon Panetta,"You really ought to think twice before you appoint a staff member to a position like Supreme Court justice. You have to ask whether that person really has the experience you need to be a justice. Usually, it will make more sense to go outside the White House."
Leon Panetta,"I think the bottom line is, this is one of the few BRAC rounds in history where California comes out doing very well."
Leon Panetta,"If he continues to behave in a way that is aggressive and continues to use force in that part of the country, we will continue to extract prices, ... Late Edition."
Leon Panetta,I don't think there is any question but that the indictment of Tom Delay gives another boost to the Democrats in terms of their argument that the GOP leadership doesn't pay attention to ethics requirements.
Leon Panetta,He obviously has to go through Congress to get things done. But he can't be seen as tied to its failings. He has to use the bully pulpit effectively and confront Congress effectively.
Leon Panetta,"disciples of balanced budgets. ... And at some point, they'll be proven right."
Leon Panetta,"I've spent the last several hours in an appearance before the grand jury largely detailing the operations of the White House and the physical setting of the White House during the time in which I was chief of staff. I believe I've answered all of the questions that were asked of me. And I will not comment any further on my testimony,"
Frederic Panizzutti,"There are good reasons to expect gold to keep its momentum on the way higher. If you look at the fundamental reasons that helped gold to move higher last year and this year, I think most of them are still in place."
Frederic Panizzutti,"The market took on some new positions ahead of the Fed. After they raised, as expected, gold came off, but there is support now around $565/566."
Frederic Panizzutti,You have many different small factors in this market which have created an environment of insecurity and gold has shown to be the perfect insurance against any type of disruptive event.
Bill Parcells,You just have a feeling when you don't want to do it anymore. That it's not worth it to you.
Bill Parcells,"I would say no, ... But he's got to work through it."
Bill Parcells,"I think he's a lot more familiar with what we're trying to do, what we want to do philosophically,"
Bill Parcells,"He's a good player, that kid. I'm sure he was trying to put a little pressure on his team to respond positively."
Bill Parcells,"The entire offensive line is reliant on the center to make the proper calls, ... So I'm going to keep trying to work him in there. But if his time does diminish, that will be the reason. Physically, he's doing fine. But we can't afford to have an early snap and couple of mental errors in a short period of play time when everyone else in not making any."
Bill Parcells,"I don't really know what the player can do yet, ... We're trying to find that out. Also we're trying to integrate him into the system. ... We'll see how that plays out."
Bill Parcells,"I'm not too worried about Anthony Henry, ... I think he'll be fine. I'm just trying to make sure he's got enough gas in his tank."
Bill Parcells,"We've been trying to get our hands on Fujita all summer,"
Bill Parcells,I'm not trying to toot his horn. He can toot that enough himself.
Bill Parcells,"That's the way the deal is. I'm not trying to make it theatrical, but that's the way it really is. The ears are up."
Bill Parcells,"When they hit that fourth-and-15, I knew we were in trouble. We have to learn to close the show."
Bill Parcells,"Trying to get his diapers off, ... Having a little trouble, but we'll get them off."
Bill Parcells,That's the way it is ... It's not an exact science.
Bill Parcells,"When you get a guy out of high school, you never know what you're going to get. I thought he was a bright guy and he learned quickly. I gave him a lot of different jobs when he was with me and I think that really helped him move ahead. He coached the backs, the tight ends, the receivers -- he did a lot of different jobs and he did them well."
Bill Parcells,running around like he's lost.
Bill Parcells,"He trains hard. I think he's a good running back,"
Bill Parcells,"[Parcells said he challenged the players before the game, saying it was their responsibility to take what they have learned from the coaches in meetings and apply it onto the field.] I told them, ... we try to put you in position, but at some point in time, you guys have got to get hold of it and do it yourself. I told them that if you are ever going to be any good, a coach has to be able to turn the game over to you... today is the day when you guys need to do that."
Bill Parcells,"Julius is making some progress, though he's not where we want him to be right now. If I thought he could function I would play him. If there was a question about that, then I might wait."
Bill Parcells,I think first of all he's in better condition. He hasn't had any weight problems.
Bill Parcells,We've had some problems around here with our snapping. We signed a new snapper today. Hopefully that is going to resolve itself.
Bill Parcells,"Mentally, he doesn't have any problems at all, ... Very rarely will he make a mental error. Sometimes it may be something he hasn't seen that happens and he's not quite certain about that. But anything he's seen, he pretty well knows."
Bill Parcells,"He just physically couldn't withstand some of the things. That's really what the problems were. You're the first one to know and then it kind of gets you a little depressed, which I think happened to him a little bit too."
Bill Parcells,"I am not too lavish with praise on players, as you know. Terry is a good player. He can catch the ball. He has a combination of hands, quickness and speed, all three of the critical factors for a receiver."
Bill Parcells,I just had to do something. He couldn't make them in practice either. It's one of those things. I think it's a little mental now.
Bill Parcells,We just had to do something. He just couldn't make them in practice either. We just couldn't live with the way it was.
Bill Parcells,"We did like his potential while we had him here. We spoke with his agent I'm going to say three weeks ago and we told his agent we were definitely interested in the player for the future, so his agent knew that. He was coming back anyway."
Bill Parcells,I do think he has a highly intelligent perspective.
Bill Parcells,"It's not just an opinion, ... We visually have the performance."
Bill Parcells,"I still want to use (Glover) and Ellis the way I told you this past spring and this summer, ... They're going to start the game, but we're going to get those young guys in there pretty quick, and they're going to play as well."
Bill Parcells,"This is the time of the year when optimism runs high, and I'm looking forward to it,"
Bill Parcells,We're hoping he plays well. You know he's got to play. He hasn't had the opportunity to do that. We've got to get him in a game now.
Bill Parcells,"The other night we got two punts back pretty good, ... If we could do that on a weekly basis, then our punt returns is going to be improved significantly."
Bill Parcells,"We were just going to try to be a little bit more aggressive. I decided that [Saturday] night. . . . That gave us the best chance to start well, and we wanted to start well."
Bill Parcells,"We're happy to win on the road. Any time you come some place on a Monday night, especially a rivalry like this, and you're able to win, you have to be very happy."
Bill Parcells,"I'll know when it's time. I'm sure there are other people thinking it's time already, but that's the nature of the business. But I'll know."
Bill Parcells,"I think Jeff's a little bit better snapper than Condo right now, but Condo demonstrated enough, ... There's a big-money difference there."
Bill Parcells,"We weren't going to offer them big money to stay so I keep the young guys and hopefully develop one of them,"
Bill Parcells,"I'm proud of the way they came back, and hopefully we'll continue to improve. When you can make mistakes and still learn, it's a good thing. We have a lot of work to do. This is still a work in progress."
Bill Parcells,"We had plenty of vets make mistakes yesterday, too,"
Bill Parcells,"Disappointing, ... This one is tough to take. We had some mistakes there at the end of the game."
Bill Parcells,"Now listen, you can't write those code words I was using out there, understand? That's strategy. I don't mind you writing about practice, but don't give away anything. I saw you out there."
Bill Parcells,"With the NFL Network, you can scout the Senior Bowl pretty good right now from your living room. But I am sorry I'm not there this year. You can tell a lot more when you see players up close."
Bill Parcells,"When you get into this situation, a kind of last-minute thing, you're looking for someone who can replace a majority of the plays of the person you lost. Obviously some new guy that didn't know the system couldn't do that, ... Can he do everything? Probably not everything, but I thought and I think the organization felt the same way, that he could do enough."
Bill Parcells,"I think we're going to play the young kids,"
Bill Parcells,He just kind of came in as one of those underdog kind of kids. He just hung in there. He had a little ankle hurt for a while and fought through it.
Bill Parcells,"That's a very unnoticed, unheralded job that is not simple,"
Bill Parcells,"WeÂ´re just collecting information,"
Bill Parcells,"We're just collecting information,"
Bill Parcells,"He's a threat to anybody. If you leave him one-on-one long enough, he's going to hurt you."
Bill Parcells,You need to go home.
Bill Parcells,"We have a lot of history together and it's all been good, ... I have a high regard for Tom, everyone knows that. He's a great competitor. We're on opposite sides of the fence right now, but that doesn't have anything to do with how I feel about him personally or how I think he feels about me."
Bill Parcells,"The only thing I didn't know was where his heart is, ... You don't know when you haven't been around a guy for a while."
Bill Parcells,"I just hate sloppy play, and we were fortunate to win. I don't know whether they deserved to win any more than us, but we certainly did a lot to hurt our chances."
Bill Parcells,I'm happy to get that one.
Bill Parcells,"It's just like the sense of urgency, ... Some are happy to be here, you know?"
Bill Parcells,"This is a little bit like the yips in golf, ... He can do it. It's the pressure of the situation, I think, is starting to get to him. And then the more problems he has, the worse the situation got."
Bill Parcells,"This is a little bit like the yips in golf. He can do it. It's the pressure of the situation, I think, is starting to get to him. And then the more problems he has, the worse the situation got."
Bill Parcells,"Actually, our percentage of field goals isn't terrible. It's not the worst, but recently it's been poor. I couldn't live with what's going on. That last weekend was enough to send everybody over the edge, including the players."
Bill Parcells,"Everyone needs to have a reliable kicker in the NFL, ... The games are too close. You just have to have one."
Bill Parcells,"Both of those games [with Washington] could have gone either way last year, ... and I'm expecting the same this year."
Bill Parcells,"if we made any one of them, we would have won the game."
Bill Parcells,"Yeah, we've done it before, ... But you just have to come to the game (to find out)."
Bill Parcells,"Just to see him after the game, I was kind of going up the tunnel with him and put my arm around him and kind of squeezed his head a little bit, you know, just so he knows that I knew, hey, you did a good job. I said, 'Hey, that's my guy right there.' That makes him feel good."
Bill Parcells,"I think we had our team in position to win the game on any one of seven plays, ... If we made any one of them, we would've won the game . . . I could list seven or eight plays."
Bill Parcells,It is good news for the future. It is bad news for right now. Maybe six weeks from now it won't be bad news.
Bill Parcells,"I'm not trying to be funny, but I was just telling him he's a lot crankier than when I first had him, ... He's starting to sound like me. He just gets more upset with himself quicker."
Bill Parcells,"But I do think he's having fun and enjoying himself, ... Hopefully, we can put him in position where he can be successful. ... I'm confident he can handle what we're doing."
Bill Parcells,"All I know is that he was well thought of there, ... Coach Vermeil and I have been friends a long time. Coach Vermeil would not tell me anything that wasn't true, even in a competitive situation. He likes the player very much."
Bill Parcells,"Yeah, he's a football-playing dude, that guy. He really is. He's just one of those guys that after awhile, you just have to get them in the game because something is going to happen."
Bill Parcells,"There's a month of football to go. To be judgmental now with just the one-game separation would be premature. If you look at this like it's a disaster, then that's what it will turn out to be. If we look at it like we can bounce back, then that's probably what will happen."
Bill Parcells,"We knew you were an ex-football player, but now you can take on cars and still come back!"
Bill Parcells,"We played 56 minutes and 51 seconds worth of pretty bad football, ... Hey, I feel fortunate. That's all I can tell you. I think we're lucky to win."
Bill Parcells,"... He's a football guy. He enjoys that, and I enjoy the wealth of knowledge that he has. It's been transmitted from him to me to many of my assistant coaches and players over the years."
Bill Parcells,"When your team isn't playing smart football and disciplined football, I take that as a reflection on me, ... And I, quite apparently, am not getting the point across. ... I blame me. I'm really the one who's responsible for it."
Bill Parcells,"It doesn't mean anything, ... Each game is different. History means nothing in pro football."
Bill Parcells,"I don't think this week is related to next week in any manner of speaking, ... It's football season and football players usually play football. If I thought he could function I would play him. If there was a question about that, then I might wait."
Bill Parcells,"We did a pretty good job today - fighting. This team has fought hard all year. You can say what you want about them. We're not the best team in the league, but we fight pretty hard. That took a lot of guts. I'm proud of them."
Bill Parcells,"I thought he did a good job fighting and competing. I never got a sense he wanted out of the game. I really was pleased with him about that. [He] wasn't perfect; missed some reads and has to work on blocking. Like I said, for not having a lot of help [up front], he did all right."
Bill Parcells,"Hey, I'm an East Coast guy, ... I've always been, I always will be. Most of my family - in fact, all of my family - is in that area, so from that point of view, you're paying a price to be here. At my age, I'm not getting any younger, you don't get to see and do a lot of things, but that's my choice. That's what I decided to do, and I'm quite happy I did it."
Bill Parcells,"I don't think Drew comes in here eyes shut having to learn this whole situation, ... He's got a pretty good idea of what's going on before he even sees it."
Bill Parcells,"I am trying to play mistake free, ... Like for example, this year in 22 games where a team was plus-1 in turnovers, they won 18 of them. If we keep doing what we are doing we are going to win our share. I know that. If we keep getting turnovers and minus plays, and we don't have them, we are going to win our share."
Bill Parcells,"Coming into training camp, I had my doubts about him. He was a classic example of somebody who didn't have a clue. Now he has a much better idea."
Bill Parcells,He was a classic example of somebody who didn't have a clue.
Bill Parcells,"There was a lot of emotion for me today. I don't mean to dwell on that. I got a message today that said, 'Don't have a troubled heart.' And I don't. I've got those guys in there."
Bill Parcells,"So it's time to roll the dice for two reasons, economics and for the future,"
Bill Parcells,Anybody that would play the Raiders would be concerned about Moss. There's no doubt about that. Moss has been a highly productive player in the league and he's probably the singular most dangerous threat as there is in the NFL.
Bill Parcells,"Anybody that would play the Raiders would be concerned about Moss. There's no doubt about that, ... Moss has been a highly productive player in the league and he's probably the singular most dangerous threat as there is in the NFL."
Bill Parcells,"I think this it's frustrating for everybody -- him, me, the trainers, the doctors. Everybody. The tests we have done recently here, it's hard to figure exactly where it is. But you have to talk to the player. You have to ask him. I don't think he doesn't want to contribute."
Bill Parcells,"I feel pretty fortunate to win that. Our defense played well for pretty much the whole game. We had a little mental error in the last 20 seconds. But offensively, we were just sloppy. You don't get to win many of those, with those kind of mistakes. So I would consider ourselves fortunate today."
Bill Parcells,Just get to the dance and see what happens
Bill Parcells,"I think Drew has a lot of courage. He will hold onto the ball. The things I mention to him are to try to get rid of it on time if we can and that sacks, fumbles and interceptions are bad plays. Throwing the ball away is a good play."
Bill Parcells,"So I know the insignificance of that conversation,"
Bill Parcells,You've got to have a good guy there. He needs to take control of that situation because he's a definite leadership capacity there.
Bill Parcells,"I do have much more confidence in Andre than I've had at any time then I've been here, ... His performance this summer was certainly has been superior than it was at any time."
Bill Parcells,"I'm going to play both of those guys, ... I don't think there's any question about that. I have confidence in both players. So I'm not so sure about that, but I think I'm going to play both in the games. And I think it might help both of them."
Bill Parcells,He's maturing. This is a tough transition this kid is making from a down defensive linemen in college to an outside linebacker in this type of defense in the pros. It's a physical transition and it's a mental transition.
Bill Parcells,I thought (Henson) did all right under the circumstances. He just had a little trouble recognizing some things. There was a tough situation for him. Hopefully he'll grow from there. He needs a lot of work.
Bill Parcells,"If youâ€™re keeping them on the team, you have to use them, ... You donâ€™t have much choice. We have a lot of them active, and you have to put them in there. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to do."
Bill Parcells,He's a grown man. He's much different than being a 20-year-old out of college. He has four children now and his maturity has come a long way. I'm able to communicate with him on a much different level.
Bill Parcells,"Everyone is going to blame everything on you because you're off to a slow start, ... Just keep doing what you're doing and things will turn around. You don't have to worry about nothing."
Bill Parcells,"When I first got him, he was a 20-year-old with bed hair every morning, looking kind of like a teenage guy you'd like to grab by the shirt. Now, he's a grown man with a wife and four children and responsibilities of his own. He's a lot more mature. He's a lot smarter. He's a lot more aware of the program. He's done a good job for us. It's not perfect, but he's done a good job."
Bill Parcells,"We had too many balls on the ground. [We'll] look at this guy for a couple of days, see what happens."
Bill Parcells,"He has to increase his awareness a little bit, but he's pretty much an all-purpose guy, ... He'll block. He'll catch. Hopefully he'll get a little better feel for the running as we go."
Bill Parcells,"They have qualities you gain a respect and appreciation for once you've been around the player. Plus I like him because he's a high-class kid. He's got it going on pretty good â€” and he's also in my apartment building, so I have to be nice."
Bill Parcells,"[In the second quarter Spears lined up next to nose tackle Jason Ferguson, who played sparingly during his first appearance of the preseason.] I don't know where he (Ferguson) is physically, ... He didn't get hurt tonight so he should pretty much be 100 percent on Monday."
Bill Parcells,You are what you are.
Bill Parcells,"When you don't know that you don't know, it's a lot different than when you do know that you don't know."
Bill Parcells,There is winning and there is misery.
Bill Parcells,"Success is never final, but failure can be."
Bill Parcells,"Something goes wrong, I yell at them -Fix it- whether it's their fault or not. You can only really yell at the players you trust."
Bill Parcells,"No matter how much you've won, no matter how many games, no matter how many championships, no matter how many Super Bowls, you're not winning now, so you stink."
Bill Parcells,My entire life has been spent thinking about this game. That's pretty narrow... I don't view myself as a person who's well-versed in very many subjects. I'm not proud of that.
Bill Parcells,I like linebackers. I collect 'em. You can't have too many good ones.
Bill Parcells,Don't worry about it. It's just a bunch of guys with an odd-shaped ball.
Bill Parcells,I think so. I know I'm not going to go forever at my age. We'll see.
Bill Parcells,"I think they're doing a good job protecting the quarterback. And they're doing a good job with their play-action passes. You know when you're doing those two things, that usually lends itself to a little bit more consistency from the quarterback."
Bill Parcells,"Actually, his running, his ability, really isn't much different, ... But his preparation has been quite a bit different. I think he's much stronger physically now. I think Julius has really absorbed a lot of things that I've tried to tell him. I'm talking about peripheral things. I'm not talking about the Xs and Os."
Alan Pardew,"When Sergei became a free agent I thought with his reputation, record and skill we would be foolish not to have a look at him."
Alan Pardew,It's a horrible thing and I would never want it again. Harry has regret about it because it's a horrible thing to put your family through. Harry will probably be the first person to say that usually the family suffer more than the individual because they are the ones who have to sit up in the stands and suffer whatever.
Alan Pardew,This was a reality check for us.
Alan Pardew,"My philosophy wherever I have been a manager is to bring young players into the club,"
Alan Pardew,"I think the rest of the players perhaps owe him an apology for the performance because he was terrific and he deserved to have a better team in front of him. I think I made myself clear [in the dressing room] about what the standards are at this level, what we expect from them. They can't ever let that happen again."
Alan Pardew,"Perhaps it was fitting that Rooney put in a performance like that after the tribute to George Best,"
Alan Pardew,"I was learning pretty quickly in that first 20 minutes last week when my team felt slightly intimidated by the whole scenario,"
Alan Pardew,We are talking to Nigel and we want to make a statement of intent to him of my faith in him and I think if we secure a new contract it will be a great fillip for the club.
Alan Pardew,"The goal changed the game, ... It knocked a little bit of energy out of them and then we could have won it at the end. Great sides might have won that game, we ain't a great team yet, but we ain't bad."
Alan Pardew,The biggest injury worry is Dean and potentially he could be a doubt for the final.
Alan Pardew,"I put one word on my notes today, that was 'destiny'. I'm pleased for their families who have lost two people. So for the two families of Greenwood and Lyall - that was for you."
Alan Pardew,"He is a wily player, very clever. He is very experienced and you have to always know where he is in the box. He is still very much a force to be reckoned with."
Alan Pardew,He was world class. I think we knew that Chelsea were gearing up for this game after they had been some criticism at their door. The 10 players they had showed world class performances today.
Alan Pardew,"Character is something I do look for in players,"
Alan Pardew,"The one thing about David is that he is a strong character and the fact England have qualified for the World Cup will strive him on to get on that plane and be a part of it,"
Alan Pardew,"There is great belief here at the moment. I have 22 top-drawer players and it is about us. We need to make sure we take our chances when they come and we will get the points,"
Alan Pardew,It's been an absolutely fantastic season. It's a fantastic achievement for a club that's been promoted.
James Park,"The market was under pressure for most of President Bush's speech. Once that was over, tech led a rebound on gains for Intel and a turnaround in shares of Oracle."
James Park,"[The October jobs report] is one we're looking at, especially after the claims report today, ... It could be more significant in which way the Fed will go next time."
James Park,"The markets should have held on to gains after the jobs report, ... What we're seeing is definitely a reaction to the terror threat level being raised."
James Park,"Right now I think the expectation is that a lot of these companies are meeting muted estimates. I think you'll see earnings guided higher, but that outlooks will be tempered."
James Park,"When the economic numbers are all skewed in one direction, that brings up the Fed again."
James Park,"I just see a lot of listless trading into the end of the summer -- there isn't much conviction,"
Candace Parker,We're going to come into the regional with fire.
Candace Parker,"This is huge. This is a great experience, and I just came into this thing wanting to learn and wanting to grow and to take everything in. This is a really great experience for me, and I just want to learn from it."
Candace Parker,I take away from this experience a lot of different things. I learned from a lot of great veterans about the game of basketball.
Candace Parker,"Coach told me to dribble some time off, then we went into our isolation play. I knew they would not double down because of our outside shooters. I was taller so I just shot the ball over her."
Candace Parker,We're the only team ever to be part of a coach winning 900 games.
Candace Parker,"It was just 1-on-1 with me and her, and I knew I had the height advantage over her, so I just took it and shot over her. Fortunately it went in."
David Parker,We have averaged [sales gains of] over 20 percent per year over the last 10 years. Our goal is $85 million this year and $102 million for 2005.
David Parker,"The NRC likes to see players that have a fair amount of assets with very experienced nuclear management teams that are focused just on that. If you get down to being only a group of three plants, your clout or your view with the NRC is diminished."
David Parker,Imagine the life of a brilliant man who can inspire others but do nothing for himself. This disease has already put him in jail.
Doug Parker,There's a lot of buzz in the industry about consolidation. There's a lot of value to be created by putting two airlines together.
Doug Parker,"The flip-side of that though is if you create value, you create value. And I think we're showing that you can create a lot of value -- much more than I think people thought -- by putting two airlines together."
Doug Parker,The weakness has been largely concentrated in the technology sector.
Doug Parker,"Today's results reflect overwhelming support for our proposed merger with US Airways, which will create a stronger airline that offers improved job stability for our employees, expanded service for our customers and a more long-term, viable investment for our stockholders."
Doug Parker,"We continue to make great progress in building the new US Airways, and today's announcements furthers that momentum. We are thrilled to welcome these employees back to a new airline that has a fresh attitude and bright future ahead of it."
Doug Parker,I know he has the potential to go to the NFL. I don't want him to mess that up. I just want him to live out a better experience than I did. But it starts with making the right decisions.
Doug Parker,"Our quarterly financial results reflect the continued difficult industry environment but also show some encouraging trends. Both US Airways' and America West's stand-alone results, excluding special charges, are much improved versus last year despite a nearly $200 million increase in expenses due to higher fuel prices."
Doug Parker,"Our consolidation was largely driven by crisis. US Airways needed it to survive. And as the industry improves, there will be fewer crises."
Doug Parker,"The biggest news from our third quarter 2005 was the completion of the US Airways/America West merger, and obviously our third-quarter results do not yet include any of the expected positive effects from that merger."
Doug Parker,"When you're that age, 17 or 18, you're saying I'm going to have some fun on these visits. I'm going to ball out at these school. Putting on a hat and making a show of it isn't going to determine where you are the rest of your life. The choice you make will, so it's important to be serious about why you picked one school over another."

Gilbert Parker,He knew the lie of silence to be as evil as the lie of speech.
Gilbert Parker,"He came by a leap to the goal of purpose, not by the toilsome steps of reason. On the instant his headlong spirit declared his purpose: this was the one being for him in all the world: at this altar he would light a lamp of devotion, and keep it burning forever."
Gilbert Parker,"She belongs to a race of delightful women, who never do any harm, whom everybody calls good, and who are very severe on those who do not pretend to be good."
Gilbert Parker,Imagination is at the root of much that passes for love.
Gilbert Parker,"In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they may be, or for what good end they may be set to serve. Secrecy means evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind."
Gilbert Parker,Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars.
Gilbert Parker,"There is no refuge from memory and remorse in this world. The spirits of our foolish deeds haunt us, with or without repentance."
James Parker,It is exciting to be first to market in a region that has so much potential and offers so many attractive investment opportunities.
James Parker,it is no longer indisputable ... that the missing tapes contain crown jewel information about the nation's nuclear weapons program.
James Parker,A lot of terrain is so rugged and dense with foliage you wouldn't think about taking your family to those areas. It's amazing how much work these Mexicans put in to get a crop out.
James Parker,"We are excited to become a Comstock Homebuilding Company. The financial strength, diverse range of product capabilities and entrepreneurial spirit of the Comstock organization will help Parker Chandler Homes execute on our vision of becoming a leading urban and suburban homebuilder in the Atlanta market and in other strong markets in the southeast."

Jim Parker,"What happens when (the machine) runs out, it puts itself out of service. We have to reset it,"
Jim Parker,"I can't say I'm disappointed. Based upon our practice rounds, we've been lowering our scores a little bit. We were having a hard time breaking a 200 (in nine-hole events) and we got down to a 185. We had a couple other rounds in the 190s, so we're getting a little better."
Jim Parker,I was the envy of our neighborhood touch football gang.
Jim Parker,"[DES MOINES, Iowa -- Plans for a live debate on the eve of Saturday's Iowa straw poll have been canceled after only three candidates -- former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah -- agreed to participate. WOI-TV agreed to hold the debate only if six candidates signed on. It was also to be carried by KCAU-TV in Sioux City and WHBF-TV in the Quad Cities.] Obviously, we're very disappointed given the fact that many of these candidates in their appearances throughout the state in recent times have stated that there ought to be forums, there ought to be debates for the candidates to air their views, ... When push came to shove and we presented a forum ... many of the candidates balked or simply didn't respond."
Jim Parker,"She's 20 pounds of love, she may be cheating on that a bit. She might be 21, but you know what, she's my cat. She's my responsibility."

John Parker,exactly what I had in mind.
John Parker,"They stopped several men that had stolen a postal delivery truck,"
John Parker,"We will certainly see cost improvements from the technology simplification, and I believe we will see cost improvement from the workflow and productivity tools we can put on top of it, ... The bigger part, though, is the benefit to the clients, because our financial consultants will have better data with which to work and also will have a better understanding of the frequency in which they are talking to clients."
John Parker,Alyssa was tough underneath. She is a great low-post player who is hard to stop.
John Parker,We had that tough loss to Cabot and the girls came back with intensity. They came out with defensive intensity and it paid off.
John Parker,"I'm thrilled for my client, I'm thrilled for justice. It reinforces some faith in the system."
John Parker,"That just makes you feel good and gives you more energy to be able,"
John Parker,"We want to urge people to use common sense. Don't be out in the weather if you don't have to,"
John Parker,"This defendant is a repeat felon who took advantage of a medical emergency. A real neighbor in that situation would have brought dinner over. But instead, he tried to rip them off."
Ken Parker,"It's another dimension for women. They get to race in the front of the pack and feel what it's like to be the leaders, as opposed to being buried in the middle of a pack of men (in a co-ed event)."
Ken Parker,Intellectual pursuits are more well-rounded when people have arts as a means to observe as well. Part of learning has a lot to do with delight.
Ken Parker,"We believe it's going to happen, ... The question is when."
Kevin Parker,"The biggest opportunity for systems integrators, first, is to use free tools. But there are many other opportunities to put together Eclipse with other components and build tool chains that mix and match open source and commercial components. It's the plumbing, and the glue."
Kevin Parker,"One thing I realized is that even when the witness is so small in a place, God is at work."
Kevin Parker,"ALF changes everything. As tools evolve, ALF will remain the constant integrator, enabling developers to select best-in-class technologies in support of enterprise initiatives."

Kevin Parker,"Having a combined Strategic Planning and Business Development function will give us greater ability to leverage our focused business strategies and capitalize on market opportunities. Tom's broader responsibilities will further enhance his team's effectiveness in identifying future strategic opportunities. Our record results for 2005 underline the significant progress we have made in realigning the division, streamlining processes and strengthening the business. These two appointments mark a very positive step in the development of Deutsche Asset Management."
Kim Parker,"In school or in anything I do, I just feel like I have to do it well, ... I've always worked hard in class, and my goal is to get a 4.0 this semester. It's going to be tough because I have organic chemistry."
Kim Parker,"When people look at the shutouts and the low number of goals allowed, they say 'the keeper is amazing,'  ... It's really the defense and midfielders keeping the ball away from me. When you don't have to do anything, you look good."
Kim Parker,"Our defense still should be extremely solid, ... We've got a lot of experience, and they know what they're doing."
Kim Parker,"You have to look at what is best for your kids, ... Charter schools give you a choice over being stuck sending them to the public school down the street."

Mark Parker,"We've delivered consistent results, largely with the management team in place today."
Mark Parker,"The Air Max 360 is an innovation milestone for Nike and for runners. A dream more than 20 years in the making, Air Max 360 reflects Nike's product innovation commitment to create a full air cushioning system for runners. We've replaced foam with 360 degrees of Nike Air, creating the most cushioned Air Max running shoe ever and allowing runners to experience the feeling of running on air."
Mark Parker,I really think we're confident that our Nike Inc. growth strategy is the right one.
Mark Parker,"Over the past 12 months, we've done an exhaustive review on future strategy and growth strategy, and I'm confident Nike Inc.'s strategy is the right one. We will get some wind in the sails and create some energy for this company."
Paul Parker,"If an appraisal is done, it basically describes that item and puts a current value on it. If it can be replaced, it will be replaced. If not, the claims department can look at the appraisal."

Robert Parker,"I don't want to work hard on a book that is not going to be published in my lifetime. I want the money now! And, of course, I want to see the book published."
Robert Parker,"Trust me, I didn't add any points for Ms. Samson's personal presentation."
Robert Parker,It was like a member of the family. We loved the dog. There is nothing wrong on our part.
Robert Parker,"Being a professor and working are not the same thing. The academic community is composed largely of nitwits. If I may generalize. People who don't know very much about what matters very much, who view life through literature rather than the other way around."
Robert Parker,"On the big issues, Joan and I are amazingly in tune, but on the creature-comfort level, we're incompatible."
Smush Parker,This is disappointing. There are not words to describe it other than disappointing.
Smush Parker,"That just initiates the rest of the team to find our own offense within the triangle. Kobe started off slow, but that just allowed us to get offense from everybody else."
Smush Parker,I got here around 10 a.m.. It was strange. We don't usually practice this early. I was in bed by 9:30 last night just so I'd get up on time.
Steve Parker,"The Nature Conservancy has most of its barrier islands open to the public, free of charge, ... It is not appropriate for somebody to turn around and charge the public for access to the same places for their own personal gain."
Steve Parker,"We make our living off of phone numbers that spell words, ... We've created companies like 1-800-FLY-CHEAP. We actually pioneered shared usage."
Steve Parker,"This is definitely a learning game. This is the best team we've played so far, the only team we can't beat. We have to take some notes from this game and do better next time."
Steve Parker,I can't recall anyone placing that high in two events.
Steve Parker,"The specific facts and circumstances are scary,"
Theodore Parker,Humanity is the sin of God
Theodore Parker,"Let us do our duty, in our shop in our kitchen, in the market, the street, the office, the school, the home, just as faithfully as if we stood in the front rank of some great battle, and knew that victory for mankind depends on our bravery, strength, and skill. When we do that, the humblest of us will be serving in that great army which achieves the welfare of the world."
Theodore Parker,"There is what I call the American idea. . . . This idea demands, as the proximate organization thereof, a democracy,--that is, a government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people. For shortness' sake I will call it the idea of Freedom."
Theodore Parker,Democracy means not I am as good as you are but You are as good as I am

Theodore Parker,"Kodak sells film, but they don't advertise film. They advertise memories."
Tony Parker,"It's a nice reward for all the hard work I put in. I'm proud,"
Tony Parker,"I think with Jay Williams, he just needs more freedom. He needs to be able to play and not think. Last year I was thinking too much sometimes. When you?re thinking too much you can?t play free."
Tony Parker,We have to understand that Dallas is for real. Avery [Johnson] is a good coach and he knows our playbook by heart.
Tony Parker,We have a pretty tough schedule coming up. We have to stay strong mentally and must focus on getting better.
Tony Parker,"It hurts. Frankly, it hurts terribly. I have just lived one of the biggest loss of my career. It will be difficult to digest that moment. It is extremely hard to accept. I am disappointed."
Willie Parker,"He [Waddell] told me he stood up and did a speech on me this week. He told them that just because I didn't get drafted, you better worry about Willie Parker and stuff like that,"
Willie Parker,They free him up and let him make plays like Ray Lewis does. He can be running sideways and nobody can get a hand on him. He makes all the plays for them.
Willie Parker,"It's real important to get the running game going. We're a running team, the Pittsburgh offense."
Willie Parker,"My senior year, there were scouts that used to come to practice and see me run and ask why I wasn't playing. I didn't know why I wasn't playing, either."
Willie Parker,We didn't want to go to overtime. They had all the momentum.
Willie Parker,It's cool with me. He's a Hall of Fame guy and he's the guy who took me under his arm. It would be wrong for me to say I feel neglected.
Willie Parker,"We all have faith in Duce to step in and get the job done. The running game will be ready, just as it always is, and we'll be ready to run even more without Ben in there."
Willie Parker,Just open the coaches' eyes and let them know this kid can play. This year I am more relaxed and patient running the ball.
Willie Parker,"That's not even in my wildest dreams, winning MVP in this game."
Willie Parker,He'll have a conversation with people on the street.
Willie Parker,"I'm not going to blame it on all the coaches,"
Willie Parker,"Iâ€™m not going to blame it on all the (North Carolina) coaches, ... I have my share of [fault]. I probably didnâ€™t listen, run the right hole or I tried to do more than the play was supposed to be. Iâ€™ll take all that credit. Iâ€™m going to quit talking about the coaches; from now on youâ€™ll never hear me say anything about the coaches at UNC."
Willie Parker,"I'm not going to blame it on all the (North Carolina) coaches. I have my share of [fault]. I probably didn't listen, run the right hole or I tried to do more than the play was supposed to be. I'll take all that credit. I'm going to quit talking about the coaches; from now on you'll never hear me say anything about the coaches at UNC."
Gordon Parks,"I suffered evils, but without allowing them to rob me of the freedom to expand."
Gordon Parks,"You know, the camera is not meant just to show misery."
Gordon Parks,"Well, I was born in Kansas, raised in Minnesota and spent a good part of my early life, up until I was about fifteen or sixteen, in Kansas."
Gordon Parks,"Washington, D.C. in 1942 was not the easiest place in the world for a Negro to get along."
Gordon Parks,"There's another horizon out there, one more horizon that you have to make for yourself and let other people discover it, and someone else will take it further on, you know."
Gordon Parks,The subject matter is so much more important than the photographer.
Gordon Parks,The photographer begins to feel big and bloated and so big he can't walk through one of these doors because he gets a good byline; he gets notices all over the world and so forth; but they're really - the important people are the people he photographs.
Gordon Parks,"The man at Kodak told me the shots were very good and if I kept it up, they would give me an exhibition. Later, Kodak gave me my first exhibition."
Gordon Parks,"That was my first day in Washington, D.C., in 1942. I had experienced a kind of bigotry and discrimination here that I never expected to experience."
Gordon Parks,"So I went to Chicago in 1940, I think, '41, and the photographs that I made there, aside from fashion, were things that I was trying to express in a social conscious way."
Gordon Parks,"People in millenniums ahead will know what we were like in the 1930's and the thing that, the important major things that shaped our history at that time. This is as important for historic reasons as any other."
Gordon Parks,"It's like people expect me to criticize my mother who died when I was fifteen because all I knew from her was perfection, you know?"
Gordon Parks,I've been with Life now for seventeen years and I have written several articles for them and will be doing more writing and do at least two assignments a year besides my writing.
Gordon Parks,"I'd become sort of involved in things that were happening to people. No matter what color they be, whether they be Indians, or Negroes, the poor white person or anyone who was I thought more or less getting a bad shake."
Gordon Parks,"I was there less than a year before I was assigned to the Paris bureau. I spent two years there and, in fact, before I even went on the staff I was sent to Europe to do assignments which they wouldn't normally do for a young photographer just starting out."
Gordon Parks,"I think maybe the rural influence in my life helped me in a sense, of knowing how to get close to people and talk to them and get my work done."
Gordon Parks,"I had a tremendous interest and I just kept plugging away and knocking at doors, you know, seeking out encouragement where I could get it."
Gordon Parks,"I bought my first camera in Seattle, Washington. Only paid about seven dollars and fifty cents for it."
Gordon Parks,"But I was very disappointed that I didn't get a chance to go overseas with that group, might not have gotten back but I wanted very much to go because there's not much of a record of the exploits of the first Negro fighter group."
Gordon Parks,"But I do feel a little teeny right now that I'm just about ready to start, and winter is entering. Half past autumn has arrived."
Gordon Parks,"At first I wasn't sure that I had the talent, but I did know I had a fear of failure, and that fear compelled me to fight off anything that might abet it."
Gordon Parks,"And now, I feel at 85, I really feel that I'm just ready to start."
Gordon Parks,"And I think that after nearly 85 years upon this planet that I have a right after working so hard at showing the desolation and the poverty, to show something beautiful for somebody as well."
Gordon Parks,"Many times I wondered whether my achievement was worth the loneliness I experienced, but now I realize the price was small."

Rosa Parks,"Mother Parks, take your rest."
Rosa Parks,"The only tired I was, was tired of giving in,"

Rosa Parks,"Victory or defeat? It is the slogan of all-powerful militarism in every belligerent nation. And yet, what can victory bring to the proletariat?"
Rosa Parks,It was not pre-arranged. It just happened that the driver made a demand and I just didn't feel like obeying his demand. I was quite tired after spending a full day working.
Rosa Parks,I would like to be remembered as a person who wanted to be free... so other people would be also free.
Rosa Parks,At the time I was arrested I had no idea it would turn into this. It was just a day like any other day. The only thing that made it significant was that the masses of the people joined in.
Rosa Parks,I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen.
Rosa Parks,Why do you all push us around?
Rosa Parks,"Memories of our lives, of our works and our deeds will continue in others."
Rosa Parks,"I have learned over the years that when one's mind is made up, this diminishes fear; knowing what must be done does away with fear."
Rosa Parks,Each person must live their life as a model for others.
Rosa Parks,My only concern was to get home after a hard day's work.
Rosa Parks,"Whatever my individual desires were to be free, I was not alone. There were many others who felt the same way."

Rosa Parks,All I was doing was trying to get home from work.
Rosa Parks,"Have you ever been hurt and the place tries to heal a bit, and you just pull the scar off of it over and over again."
Rosa Parks,a living icon for freedom in America.
Jesper Parnevik,"Everybody wants to start the year on a good note, because it usually carries through the rest of the year."
Jesper Parnevik,"I'm very happy with four-under, ... I mean yesterday after the Pro-Am or the practice rounds, I would have taken even par in a heartbeat and not even gone out today. This is probably the toughest course we've played all year. You have to hit it in the fairway."
Jesper Parnevik,"Some guys hate it, some guys like it."
Jesper Parnevik,"Then, when you notice you can actually play pretty bad golf, then it's tougher to come back to that level where you feel confident over every shot, every week."
Jesper Parnevik,I would say it's like Pinehurst but maybe that's giving it too much credit.
George Parnham,"I have grave, grave concerns about Andrea's safety."
George Parnham,"A woman with this notoriety, with this type of offense charged, would be at risk ... I have grave, grave concerns."
George Parnham,I don't take these things lightly. I don't make allegations of this nature unless there is something to suggest that something smells.
George Parnham,"Only one mental health expert testified that Andrea knew that what she was doing was wrong, and that was the celebrated Park Dietz. Every other mental health expert ... testified that she was either incapable of knowing what she was doing was wrong or did not know what she was doing was wrong."
George Parnham,"Obviously a plea bargain isn't an option, as long as there's nothing on the table to address the mental health issues that are so apparent with Andrea. Given that, the only other option is to go to trial. I don't believe there will be any meaningful negotiations in this matter short of going before a jury."
George Parnham,"He thought that the court had done the right thing, and he wants only mental health care for Andrea,"
George Parnham,"I have bittersweet feelings about (the remarriage). I told Rusty a number of years ago that, obviously, there has to come a point in where he gets on with his life. Andrea has to get on with hers."
George Parnham,"She's doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances, which I know you understand are extreme."
George Parnham,We may as well wipe it off the books.
Earl Parreno,"She has consolidated her hold on power, but it does not mean that she has crushed the opposition."
Earl Parreno,It will backfire if they start dispersing rallies and arresting people. It will arouse the passion of unaffected citizens.
Earl Parreno,"Arroyo may be weak, but she is safe and is in no danger of being removed by force during the first six months of 2006. The threats were bloated out of proportions. There may be groups within the army that were not happy with her, but they have no capability to stage a coup."
Earl Parreno,"The government is overreacting. There may be a threat from a small faction within the army, but it's not serious enough to topple her government."
Robert Parry,"It would seem to me he would be more comfortable with a freer exchange of ideas, not coming in 100 percent convinced of what should be done."
Robert Parry,He felt very strongly that society should have a social conscience.
Robert Parry,"At the same time, we need to proceed with some caution, because there's a fair bit of uncertainty about the economy's behavior right now,"
Rod Parsley,"Concerning the brief 32 year history of this nation (The Bahamas), my heart wanted to rejoice and I do rejoice with you, but I trust that your heart will feel just a bit saddened with mine."
Rod Parsley,"You know, there are only about 10 people in the United States that have ever argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court, this man has won 25 cases before the Supreme Court. He's an overwhelming choice."
Rod Parsley,We know that this man has a proven record of being a 'strict constructionist.' Our President has given us his word that he will interpret the Constitution rather than make new laws from the bench.
Rod Parsley,The left has chosen the courts as a major battlefield over social issues.
Rod Parsley,"No secular state ever existed and none would exist until the end of the French Revolution, and so we understand that America was built on the Judeo-Christian ethic and we believe that this nominee is going to see to it that those truths are upheld."
Rod Parsley,He has selected from a group of overwhelming candidates. This candidate was nominated to the Supreme Court because of his extremely overwhelming qualifications.
Rod Parsley,"Have faith in the process, and pray for our United States Senators, that they'll act with civility and move this process along as it should be moved."
David Parsons,My senior year at Central (1971-72) was the last year of Central High School.
David Parsons,"We rather think it was some personal interplay between the people, who perhaps knew each other. Certainly they were fighting and uncontrollable, and clearly the calming techniques which we teach our cabin crews didn't work. Diversion was the only option."
David Parsons,the recent high profile of bad behavior among passengers has meant that no airline is prepared to accept this sort of behavior.
Richard Parsons,We feel all the more confident in pursuing a more aggressive path to create value at AOL through both its subscription and advertising business initiatives.
Richard Parsons,"In my view, the real source of undervaluation is neither of these things, ... The real driver of enhanced value, I think, is going to be AOL in the short term and the long term."
Richard Parsons,"Combining the Warner-EMI roster and relationships with AOL's subscriber base and ease-of-use know-how, we will be able to lead the industry in the way this business develops,"
Richard Parsons,"While no one can stand here and say we're never going to make a mistake, we're not going to make a mistake out of aggressiveness,"
Richard Parsons,"My daughter watches the news, ... I think kids today are pretty well-informed about what's going on in the world. Hopefully, they'll be a generation that's going to be more understanding, open and willing to cooperate to solve the problems we have."
Richard Parsons,"The big growth opportunity - big value accretion opportunity for us - is in AOL, ... We need to accelerate a path that we have been on."
Richard Parsons,"New technologies have always ended up giving content more advantages than disadvantages. I think they will again this time, but it's not clear to the market yet."
Richard Parsons,I am 100 percent committed to the strategic vision that drove Steve Case and Jerry Levin to fashion the merger of AOL Time Warner in the first instance.
Richard Parsons,"There may be, but we're not there right now, ... We're not heading in that direction. We believe in AOL, we believe in its fit with our other assets, and we're trying to make it work as we laid out for investors a week ago."
Richard Parsons,"I don't think you can compromise ... news either has integrity or it doesn't, ... It either is accurate, balanced and fair or it isn't."
Richard Parsons,commitment to deliver greater value to shareholders.
Richard Parsons,"I don't think you can compromise, news either has integrity or it doesn't. It either is accurate, balanced and fair or it isn't."
Richard Parsons,"Even though the total amount of the restatement represents a small portion of America Online's total revenues during the period, we have taken, and do take, this matter very seriously,"
Richard Parsons,"I'm satisfied with the company's overall performance, ... Except for America Online, our business is doing quite well."
Richard Parsons,"As we move through this year and into the next, we expect America Online to turn the corner on its advertising business and thereafter become a key driver of growth for the company,"
Richard Parsons,"Our agreement to work together on digital media initiatives marks an important step forward in better serving consumers and protecting the interests of all content businesses, ... We look forward to others in the media and entertainment industries joining together with us to help to advance the digital distribution of content to consumers while maintaining copyright protection."
Richard Parsons,We have great respect for his long record achievement -- as a co-founder of AOL to a valuable member of our board.
Richard Parsons,"his focus, his ability to analyze the facts and get to the bottom line, and his ability to motivate an organization."
Talcott Parsons,"Science is intimately integrated with the whole social structure and cultural tradition. They mutually support one other -- only in certain types of society can science flourish, and conversely without a continuous and healthy development and application of science such a society cannot function properly."
Talcott Parsons,"Thus, in general, in the first instance, the direction of interest in empirical fact will be canalised by the logical structure of the theoretical system."
Talcott Parsons,"Theory not only formulates what we know but also tells us what we want to know, that is, the questions to which an answer is needed."
Talcott Parsons,The system becomes logically closed when each of the logical implications which can be derived from any one proposition within the system finds its statement in another proposition in the same system.
Talcott Parsons,"The simplest way to see the meaning of the concept of a closed, system in this sense is to consider the example of a system of simultaneous equations."
Talcott Parsons,The part an actor played on stage was once written on a separate roll of paper.
Talcott Parsons,The importance of certain problems concerning the facts will be inherent in the structure of the system.
Talcott Parsons,"The implications of these considerations justify the statement that all empirically verifiable knowledge even the commonsense knowledge of everyday life - involves implicitly, if not explicitly, systematic theory in this sense."
Talcott Parsons,"The hypothesis may be put forward, to be tested by the s subsequent investigation, that this development has been in large part a matter of the reciprocal interaction of new factual insights and knowledge on the one hand with changes in the theoretical system on the other."
Talcott Parsons,"The functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society, but on behalf of personality."
Talcott Parsons,"The conception that, instead of this, contemporary society is at or near a turning point is very prominent in the views of a school of social scientists who, though they are still comparatively few, are getting more and more of a hearing."
Talcott Parsons,"That is, a system starts with a group of interrelated propositions which involve reference to empirical observations within the logical framework of the propositions in question."
Talcott Parsons,"Spencer's god was Evolution, sometimes also called Progress."
Talcott Parsons,Special emphasis should be laid on this intimate interrelation of general statements about empirical fact with the logical elements and structure of theoretical systems.
Talcott Parsons,"Of course there may well be particular reasons why Spencer rather than others is dead, as there were also particular reasons why he rather than others made such a stir."
Talcott Parsons,"Now obviously the propositions of the system have reference to matters of empirical fact; if they did not, they could have no claim to be called scientific."
Talcott Parsons,Empirical interest will be in the facts so far as they are relevant to the solution of these problems.
Talcott Parsons,But the scientific importance of a change in knowledge of fact consists precisely in j its having consequences for a system of theory.
Talcott Parsons,But the fact a person denies that he is theorising is no reason for taking him at his word and failing to investigate what implicit theory is involved in his statements.
Talcott Parsons,"Among those who are satisfactory in this respect it is desirable to have represented as great a diversity of intellectual tradition, social milieu and personal character as possible."
Talcott Parsons,A theoretical system does not merely state facts which have been observed and that logically deducible relations to other facts which have also been observed.
Talcott Parsons,A gloss is a total system of perception and language.
Talcott Parsons,"Moreover, the structure of a theoretical system tells us what alternatives are open in the possible answers to a given question."
Talcott Parsons,Knowledge is held to be an entirely quantitative affair. The one important thing is to have observed what had not been observed before.
Talcott Parsons,"It is that of increasing knowledge of empirical fact, intimately combined with changing interpretations of this body of fact - hence changing general statements about it - and, not least, a changing a structure of the theoretical system."
Talcott Parsons,"It is probably safe to say that all the changes of factual knowledge which have led to the relativity theory, resulting in a very great theoretical development, are completely trivial from any point of view except their relevance to the structure of a theoretical system."
Talcott Parsons,In so far as such a theory is empirically correct it will also tell us what empirical facts it should be possible to observe in a given set of circumstances.
Talcott Parsons,"If there are four equations and only three variables, and no one of the equations is derivable from the others by algebraic manipulation then there is another variable missing."
Talcott Parsons,"If observed facts of undoubted accuracy will not fit any of the alternatives it leaves open, the system itself is in need of reconstruction."
Talcott Parsons,"From all this it follows what the general character of the problem of the development of a body of scientific knowledge is, in so far as it depends on elements internal to science itself."
Tom Parsons,"I don't know if it's anything to be alarmed about. As long as it's used for intelligence versus harassment, I have no problem with it."
Tom Parsons,"The number of cheap seats available to the general public will dwindle as a result of higher energy prices, ... For the peak family travel times during the winter -- Christmas and Thanksgiving -- I expect that the cheap seats won't be there to be sold."
Tom Parsons,Probably almost any commercial airport in America has an airfare sale going on today.
Tom Parsons,"Probably almost any commercial airport in America has an airfare sale going on today,"
Tom Parsons,"We're losing an airline that brought super low fares to America. Those super low fares put them into bankruptcy, too."
Dolly Parton,Hopefully now that we're older we'll have to settle down. Maybe when we're old women we'll do a third one. We are old women.
Dolly Parton,The magic is inside you. There aint no crystal ball.
Dolly Parton,"At a certain point, you start to think about your legacy, ... If you're lucky enough that someone's listening in 100 years, you want 'em to have all the pieces."
Dolly Parton,After the Gold Rush.

Dolly Parton,"If you talk bad about country music, it's like saying bad things about my momma. Them's fightin' words"
Dolly Parton,"I've always been a freak and different, oddball even in my childhood and my own family, so I can relate to people who are struggling and trying to find their true identity. I do not sit in the seat of judgment. ... I love people for who they are. We're all God's children."
Dolly Parton,You'd be surprised how much it costs to look this cheap!
Dolly Parton,I look just like the girls next door... if you happen to live next door to an amusement park.
Dolly Parton,Plastic surgeons are always making mountains out of molehills.
Dolly Parton,You'll never do a whole lot unless you're brave enough to try.
Dolly Parton,Storms make trees take deeper roots.
Dolly Parton,"It's a good thing I was born a girl, otherwise I'd be a drag queen."
Dolly Parton,I'm not offended by dumb blonde jokes because I know that I'm not dumb. I also know I'm not blonde.
Dolly Parton,I modelled my looks on the town tramp.
Dolly Parton,"I wanted to be the first woman to burn her bra, but it would have taken the fire department four days to put it out."
Dolly Parton,I'm not going to limit myself just because people won't accept the fact that I can do something else.
Dolly Parton,I was the first woman to burn my bra - it took the fire department four days to put it out.
Dolly Parton,"I'm old enough and cranky enough now that if someone tried to tell me what to do, I'd tell them where to put it."
Dolly Parton,"If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one."
Dolly Parton,"If you talk bad about country music, it's like saying bad things about my momma. Them's fightin' words."
Dolly Parton,"I hated school. Even to this day, when I see a school bus it's just depressing to me. The poor little kids."
Dolly Parton,"When I'm inspired, I get excited because I can't wait to see what I'll come up with next."
Dolly Parton,"The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain."
Dolly Parton,I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb... and I also know that I'm not blonde.
Dolly Parton,My weaknesses have always been food and men - in that order.
Blaise Pascal,If I had more time I would write a shorter letter.
Blaise Pascal,The last thing we decide in writing a book is what to put first.
Blaise Pascal,"Those are weaklings who know the truth and uphold it as long as it suits their purpose, and then abandon it."
Blaise Pascal,The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread.
Blaise Pascal,"Immateriality of the soul, philosophers who have mastered their passions. What matter could do that?"

Blaise Pascal,"All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc., are true. But their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are also true."

Blaise Pascal,"If you would have people speak well of you, then do not speak well of yourself."
Blaise Pascal,"Vanity is so secure in the heart of man that everyone wants to be admired: even I who write this, and you who read this"
Blaise Pascal,Those who do not hate their own selfishness and regard themselves as more important than the rest of the world are blind because the truth lies elsewhere
Blaise Pascal,"If our condition were truly happy, we would not seek diversion from it in order to make ourselves happy"
Blaise Pascal,Habit is the second nature which destroys the first.
Blaise Pascal,"The present is never our goal: the past and present are our means: the future alone is our goal. Thus, we never live but we hope to live; and always hoping to be happy, it is inevitable that we will never be so."
Blaise Pascal,I made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it short.
Blaise Pascal,"The sensitivity of men to small matters, and their indifference to great ones, indicates a strange inversion."

Blaise Pascal,When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before.
Blaise Pascal,"Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater evil to be full of them and to be unwilling to recognize them, since that is to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion."
Blaise Pascal,"Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves."
Blaise Pascal,"There are two kinds of people one can call reasonable: those who serve God with all their heart because they know him, and those who seek him with all their heart because they do not know him."
Blaise Pascal,The weather and my mood have little connection. I have my foggy and my fine days within me; my prosperity or misfortune has little to do with the matter.
Blaise Pascal,"The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his efforts, but by his ordinary life."
Blaise Pascal,The self is hateful.
Blaise Pascal,The last proceeding of reason is to recognize that there is an infinity of things which are beyond it. There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal of reason.
Blaise Pascal,"The last act is bloody, however pleasant all the rest of the play is: a little earth is thrown at last upon our head, and that is the end forever."
Blaise Pascal,The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him.
Blaise Pascal,The heart has reasons which reason knows nothing of.
Blaise Pascal,The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.
Blaise Pascal,The greatness of man is great in that he knows himself to be wretched. A tree does not know itself to be wretched.
Blaise Pascal,"The finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice."
Blaise Pascal,People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come in to the mind of others.
Blaise Pascal,"Nothing fortifies scepticism more than the fact that there are some who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong."
Blaise Pascal,Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true.
Blaise Pascal,Men blaspheme what they do not know.
Blaise Pascal,"Man is but a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed."
Blaise Pascal,"Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed."
Blaise Pascal,"Justice is what is established; and thus all our established laws will necessarily be regarded as just without examination, since they are established."
Blaise Pascal,Justice and truth are too such subtle points that our tools are too blunt to touch them accurately.
Blaise Pascal,"It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible that he should not exist."
Blaise Pascal,"It is good to be tired and wearied by the futile search after the true good, that we may stretch out our arms to the Redeemer."

Blaise Pascal,"If our condition were truly happy, we would not seek diversion from it in order to make ourselves happy."
Blaise Pascal,"If our condition were truly happy, we would not need diversion from thinking of it in order to make ourselves happy."
Blaise Pascal,"I can well conceive a man without hands, feet, head. But I cannot conceive man without thought; he would be a stone or a brute."
Blaise Pascal,"Continuous eloquence wearies. Grandeur must be abandoned to be appreciated. Continuity in everything is unpleasant. Cold is agreeable, that we may get warm."

Blaise Pascal,"Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them."

Blaise Pascal,"I have made this letter longer than usual, only because I have not had the time to make it shorter."
Blaise Pascal,The heart has its reasons which reason does not know.
Blaise Pascal,"Man's true nature being lost, everything becomes his nature; as, his true good being lost, everything becomes his good."
Blaise Pascal,"When we see a natural style, we are astonished and delighted; for we expected to see an author, and we find a man."
Blaise Pascal,"There are some who speak well and write badly. For the place and the audience warm them, and draw from their minds more than they think of without that warmth."
Blaise Pascal,"Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature necessity, and can believe nothing else."
Blaise Pascal,"Reason commands us far more imperiously than a master; for in disobeying the one we are unfortunate, and in disobeying the other we are fools."
Blaise Pascal,The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence to us and which touches us so profoundly that we must have lost all feeling to be indifferent about it.
Blaise Pascal,All of our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling.
Blaise Pascal,"One must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life and there is nothing better."

Blaise Pascal,Men often take their imagination for their heart; and they believe they are converted as soon as they think of being converted.
Blaise Pascal,"If man made himself the first object of study, he would see how incapable he is of going further. How can a part know the whole?"
Blaise Pascal,The supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are beyond reason.
Blaise Pascal,"It is the heart which perceives God and not the reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not by the reason."

Blaise Pascal,"If we examine our thoughts, we shall find them always occupied with the past and the future."
Blaise Pascal,"In each action we must look beyond the action at our past, present, and future state, and at others whom it affects, and see the relations of all those things. And then we shall be very cautious."
Blaise Pascal,"It is the fight alone that pleases us, not the victory."
Blaise Pascal,Eloquence is a painting of the thoughts.
Blaise Pascal,"The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary persons find no difference between men."

Blaise Pascal,"Since we cannot know all that there is to be known about anything, we ought to know a little about everything."

Blaise Pascal,Nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth.
Blaise Pascal,"Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth."
Blaise Pascal,"Belief is a wise wager. Granted that faith cannot be proved, what harm will come to you if you gamble on its truth and it proves false? If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists."
Blaise Pascal,"Faith certainly tells us what the senses do not, but not the contrary of what they see; it is above, not against them."
Blaise Pascal,"Nothing is as approved as mediocrity, the majority has established it and it fixes it fangs on whatever gets beyond it either way."
Blaise Pascal,Vanity is but the surface.
Blaise Pascal,"The present letter is a very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter."
Blaise Pascal,"I have discovered that all human evil comes from this, man's being unable to sit still in a room."
Blaise Pascal,"Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same."
Blaise Pascal,"Desire and force between them are responsible for all our actions; desire causes our voluntary acts, force our involuntary."
Blaise Pascal,Through space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; through thought I comprehend the world.
Blaise Pascal,To have no time for philosophy is to be a true philosopher.

Blaise Pascal,The gospel to me is simply irresistible.
Blaise Pascal,There are only two kinds of men: the righteous who think they are sinners and the sinners who think they are righteous.
Blaise Pascal,"When we see a natural style, we are astonished and charmed; for we expected to see an author, and we find a person."
Blaise Pascal,We only consult the ear because the heart is wanting.
Blaise Pascal,"Habit is a second nature that destroys the first. But what is nature? Why is habit not natural? I am very much afraid that nature itself is only a first habit, just as habit is a second nature."
Blaise Pascal,That we must love one God only is a thing so evident that it does not require miracles to prove it.
Blaise Pascal,Love has reasons which reason cannot understand.
Blaise Pascal,All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.
Blaise Pascal,"Law, without force, is impotent."
Blaise Pascal,Justice without force is powerless; force without justice is tyrannical.
Blaise Pascal,Kind words do not cost much. Yet they accomplish much.
Blaise Pascal,The heart has reasons that reason cannot know.
Blaise Pascal,"Even those who write against fame wish for the fame of having written well, and those who read their works desire the fame of having read them."
Blaise Pascal,"We are only falsehood, duplicity, contradiction; we both conceal and disguise ourselves from ourselves."
Blaise Pascal,"Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that, unless we love the truth, we cannot know it."
Blaise Pascal,Faith embraces many truths which seem to contradict each other.
Blaise Pascal,"Faith is different from proof; the latter is human, the former is a Gift from God."
Blaise Pascal,How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find in the expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What reason for boasting that we are in impenetrable darkness? And how can it happen that the following argument occurs to a reasonable man?
Blaise Pascal,"Evil is easy, and has infinite forms."
Blaise Pascal,The vanity of the sciences. Physical science will not console me for the ignorance of morality in the time of affliction. But the science of ethics will always console me for the ignorance of the physical sciences.
Blaise Pascal,"When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of space of which I am ignorant, and which knows me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there, why now rather than then?"
Blaise Pascal,"Imagination cannot make fools wise; but she can make them happy, to the envy of reason, who can only make her friends miserable"
Blaise Pascal,"He that takes truth for his guide, and duty for his end, may safely trust to God's providence to lead him aright"
Blaise Pascal,"To deny, to believe, and to doubt absolutely -- this is for man what running is for a horse."

Blaise Pascal,People are usually more convinced by reasons they discovered themselves than by those found by others.
Blaise Pascal,Man is obviously made for thinking. Therein lies all his dignity and his merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought.
Blaise Pascal,We like to be deceived.
Blaise Pascal,"Two things control men's nature, instinct and experience."
Blaise Pascal,Men never do evil so fully and cheerfully as when we do it out of conscience.
Blaise Pascal,"The highest order of mind is accused of folly, as well as the lowest. Nothing is thoroughly approved but mediocrity. The majority has established this, and it fixes its fangs on whatever gets beyond it either way."
Blaise Pascal,It is false zeal to keep truth while wounding charity
Blaise Pascal,"What a chimera then is man!  What a novelty!  What a monster, what a chaos, what a contradiction, what a prodigy!  Judge of all things, feeble earthworm, depository of truth, a sink of uncertainty and error, the glory and the shame of the universe"
Blaise Pascal,"Weariness.Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptin"
Blaise Pascal,Brave deeds are wasted when hidden
Blaise Pascal,"Man finds nothing so intolerable as to be in a state of complete rest, without passions, without occupation, without diversion, without effort. Then he feels his nullity, loneliness, inadequacy, dependence, helplessness, emptiness."
Blaise Pascal,Beauty is a harmonious relation between something in our nature and the quality of the object which delights us.
Blaise Pascal,"Vanity of science. Knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction, but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science."

Blaise Pascal,Animals do not admire each other. A horse does not admire its companion.
Blaise Pascal,"All human evil comes from a single cause, man's inability to sit still in a room"
Blaise Pascal,Human beings must be known to be loved; but Divine beings must be loved to be known.
Blaise Pascal,"What a strange vanity painting is; it attracts admiration by resembling the original, we do not admire."
Blaise Pascal,"Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for weariness... and so frivolous is he that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient enough to amuse him."
Blaise Pascal,Man's greatness lies in his power of thought.
Blaise Pascal,"Justice and power must be brought together, so that whatever is just may be powerful, and whatever is powerful may be just."
Blaise Pascal,"Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary."
Blaise Pascal,Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.
Blaise Pascal,"Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both without us and within us."
Blaise Pascal,In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.
Blaise Pascal,"Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them."
Blaise Pascal,"Imagination disposes of everything; it creates beauty, justice, and happiness, which are everything in this world."
Richard Pasch,The intensity of a hurricane does not mean that the strength of the wind is the same everywhere around the storm's circulation.
Richard Pasch,"It's going to be very close. We're not saying there is a threat now, but there is a potential threat."
Richard Pasch,The main impediment to strengthening will be land. But Jamaica and even western Cuba are unlikely to have much impact.
David Passey,Our typical role is to work with the state in support of local and state agencies.
David Passey,The collection of bodies is not normally a FEMA responsibility.
David Passey,"The whole goal of the disaster-assistance program is to give people a start, but it was never meant to address all of one's needs."
Boris Pasternak,"Poetry is a rich, full-bodied whistle, cracked ice crunching in pails, the night that numbs the leaf, the duel of two nightingales, the sweet pea that has run wild, Creation's tears in shoulder blades."
Boris Pasternak,Surprise is the greatest gift which life can grant us.
Boris Pasternak,"You fall into my arms. / You are the good gift of destruction's path, / When life sickens more than disease / And boldness is the root of beauty- / Which draws us together."

Louis Pasteur,In the fields of observation chance favors only the prepared mind.
Louis Pasteur,"Where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind."
Louis Pasteur,"There are no such things as applied sciences, only applications of science."
Louis Pasteur,"Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world. Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence."
Louis Pasteur,"There does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science. There are science and the applications of science, bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it."
Louis Pasteur,"When I approach a child, he inspires in me two sentiments; tenderness for what he is, and respect for what he may become."
Louis Pasteur,"The universe is asymmetric and I am persuaded that life, as it is known to us, is a direct result of the asymmetry of the universe or of its indirect consequences. The universe is asymmetric."
George Pataki,Ensuring the security of New York's port operations is paramount and I am very concerned with the purchase of Peninsular & Oriental Steam by Dubai Ports World. I have directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to explore all legal options that may be available to them.
George Pataki,"The progress that is being made is probably more than anyone would have anticipated, or could have anticipated, on the afternoon of September 11."
George Pataki,"My view has always been and I believe it's the law in New York state, that marriage in New York is between a man and a woman, period. That's the law; it's been that way for 200 years,"
George Pataki,"I believe the law also includes publishing. Check with the lawyers on it, but that's what my counsels have advised me."
George Pataki,The penalties and fines under the Taylor Law exist. They are automatic. They cannot be waived. They're not going to be waived. And I just think it's unfortunate that the rank and file TWU members who work so hard every day are suffering these penalties because their leadership ordered them out on an illegal strike.
George Pataki,"Governor Bush in my view has the qualities, the personal qualities, the ideas, and the record to be a great president,"
George Pataki,"Cigarette smoking has an enormous negative impact on people's health, and it drives up the cost of health insurance and health care for all of us,"
George Pataki,"We know what it's like to be attacked. But we know what it's like to live in freedom and in confidence, and that's what we have got to do."
George Pataki,"The celebration of freedom is not inconsistent with the goals of memorializing our nearly 3,000 lost heroes,"
George Pataki,"I personally believe that the celebration of freedom is not inconsistent with the goals of memorializing our nearly 3,000 lost heroes,"
George Pataki,"Since June, we have offered the International Freedom Center (IFC) the time they needed to clarify their intentions and work with stakeholders to reach a consensus, ... Today there remains too much opposition, too much controversy over the programming of the IFC."

George Pataki,"Let this great Freedom Tower show the world that what our enemies sought to destroy -- our democracy, our freedom, our way of life -- stands taller than ever before,"
George Pataki,They endured life-threatening ... conditions and executed an extremely difficult and dangerous rescue mission ... It took courage and heroism for people to conclude that they would make the effort and attempt that rescue mission.
George Pataki,We have among the toughest boating laws in America.
George Pataki,"This unprecedented campaign not only sends a message to America and the world that New York is open for business, ... but makes a strong statement that we will never surrender our freedoms or back down from a challenge."
Himanshu Patel,"Although we are becoming more upbeat on the pace of restructuring, we worry about Ford North American production outlook, particularly in 2007."
Himanshu Patel,We still see more downside than upside risk to 2007 consensus earnings.
Himanshu Patel,"While fundamentals are admittedly weak, given the stock's weak recent performance, we are reluctant to get incrementally bearish, particularly ahead of a potential restructuring announcement."
Himanshu Patel,The market is likely to be reassured that management is now putting firmer parameters around 2006 performance.
Himanshu Patel,"Beyond guidance for favorable structural cost performance in 2006, and details on material cost savings goals, no specific guidance on the extent or cadence of structural cost savings was given. In addition, the company offered only limited details on the timing of plant actions."
Himanshu Patel,"The company's specificity on 2006 cost targets ... is likely to reassure the market, and heightens our belief that the company will see a meaningful earnings rebound in 2006."
Jay Paterno,"I've been around Penn State my entire life, so I have a good perspective for its history. Forty years from now when they write about Michael Robinson, they'll write that he was the ultimate team player. That's all you need to know about him."
Jay Paterno,"One of the things you don't plan for is to go into short yardage situations in the spring game, because you just go let everyone have fun."
Jay Paterno,You just ignore it. You know you're qualified. I know my father in my situation ... he's not going to hand me a job just because of who I am.
Jay Paterno,When people write about what college football is all about they should write about Michael Robinson. He's everything that's good about the game.
Jay Paterno,"He could coach 20 more years. I mean, I'm not exaggerating."
Jay Paterno,"They both play with the same kind of anger, not anger, but an edge to them. They both want to be great, not good, great. They may make one or two mistakes, but then they buckle down and make sure they won't make the same mistake again."
Joe Paterno,"They have most of them back, so I think they'll be a lot better. Now they're having trouble with their safety, one of their better players, who's been hurt. But they run real well. Really well, I guess, would be correct grammar. They'll give us a lot of problems."
Joe Paterno,"If they have to sleep out here, we have to do a better job. The way they're going, they're not gonna graduate."
Joe Paterno,"We never even got Danny to visit. I went over to the high school to see him, and he said, 'Coach, you've got Rocco. I can't beat out Rocco.' That's the way recruiting goes, so I never got a shot at him."
Joe Paterno,I haven't got the slightest idea. Saturday morning I'll wake up and I might go out there and practice.
Joe Paterno,"He's got the makings of a good back, he just has to have a little more patience. Once in a while, he'll take it to the outside and try to get cute, when he ought to just go straight up the field."
Joe Paterno,And that might have been a mistake on my part.
Joe Paterno,"Anybody who would take Michigan lightly has got to be out of their mind. I don't care if Michigan was 0-6, much less 3-3."
Joe Paterno,"This is a remarkable bunch of young men. It's a bunch of guys who got together and made up their minds that they were gonna have a good football team, and went to work."
Joe Paterno,They're not house-trained. And neither are horses. I stepped in something the mule dropped.
Joe Paterno,"One of the most pleasant things that came out of Saturday's game was that the younger players really handled themselves with a lot of poise, didn't make a lot of mistakes, and when they had the opportunity to do some things did it, ... Can we build on that? Yeah, I think we can build on that. Hopefully we can use them more. Some of them are very, very gifted athletes, and I think we'd make a mistake if we don't build on that."
Joe Paterno,They've done a great job with that young quarterback. He really played a heck of a game against Virginia Tech.
Joe Paterno,"I think Michael Robinson was a big loss because Michael Robinson was a guy who kind of carried the football team with him for a while and did some things in the clutch. There again, the job in the spring is to get some people who will step to the front."
Joe Paterno,"I think Michael Robinson is a big loss, because he was the guy that kind of carried the football team. But there again, the job for the spring is to get some people who will step to the front."
Joe Paterno,I think we played a pretty good football game overall. I think we played as well as we could at this time of the year.
Joe Paterno,I don't think there's a lot of difference anymore. The equality of the speed is close.
Joe Paterno,"So, I don't think it's worth the kid's future; he has a great future, so I doubt he will play."
Joe Paterno,"Derrick Williams is worth a touchdown, but I doubt, really, if he'll play."
Joe Paterno,"No question, Derrick Williams is worth a touchdown. I doubt he will play. He wants to play but the doctors are concerned. He had a very severe broken arm."
Joe Paterno,"I doubt if he'll play. He wants to play; he's out there running around but the doctors are concerned. He had a very severe broken arm, and they're worried if he did something with it there could be nerve damage and so forth. I don't think it's worth the kid's future."
Joe Paterno,He wants to play. The doctors are concerned because he had a very severe broken arm and... if we did something with him there could be nerve damage.
Joe Paterno,"I think we got too cute and a little careless,"
Joe Paterno,"Two things create fumbles: lack of courage and the other is lack of concentration, ... In our case, it's lack of concentration. I'm sure it's lack of concentration."
Joe Paterno,"I got a call from the [Penn State] president's office one day, he was getting all kinds of complaints because I wasn't answering my e-mail."
Joe Paterno,It's very flattering. The only thing I feel sometimes is that the head coach gets too much credit. I think sometimes it ought to be coaching staff of the year.
Joe Paterno,"He could coach 20 more years, ... I mean, I'm not exaggerating."
Joe Paterno,probably better suited for the outside. He can run. He's a good athlete.
Joe Paterno,"When a team outgrows individual performance and learns team confidence, excellency becomes a reality."
Joe Paterno,Losing a game is heartbreaking. Losing your sense of excellence or worth is a tragedy.
Joe Paterno,"Besides pride, loyalty, discipline, heart, and mind, confidence is the key to all the locks."
Joe Paterno,"Its the name on the front of the jersey that matters most, not the one on the back."
Joe Paterno,"The name on the front of the jersey is what really matters, not the name on the back."
Joe Paterno,Publicity is like poison; it doesn't hurt unless you swallow it.
Joe Paterno,"The minute you think you've got it made, disaster is just around the corner."
Joe Paterno,"You need to play with supreme confidence, or else you'll lose again, and then losing becomes a habit."
Joe Paterno,Believe deep down in your heart that you're destined to do great things.
Joe Paterno,You have to perform at a consistently higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.
Joe Paterno,"To be honest, Mack deserves to be up here. I guess at 79 years of age, it was my last shot. But seriously, Mack is a friend and I congratulate him on a great year."
Joe Paterno,"With the turnovers and penalties [five for 50 yards], we're at a point now where we're having some adversity. But we're overcoming it."
Joe Paterno,Both teams played as hard as they can play. Both teams overcame a lot of adversity.
Joe Paterno,"Steve Roach has an awful lot of ability, but he has kind of been a little bit reluctant, ... He hasn't taken the bull by the horns and gone after it. If Roach decides to play, he has a chance to be a heck of a football player."
Joe Paterno,"Success without honor is an unseasoned dish; it will satisfy your hunger, but it won't taste good."
Shivraj Patil,We have asked the police to furnish details on the loopholes.
Shivraj Patil,[That assessment contrasted with official comments Sunday. Police said then that they were questioning] numerous ... the investigation is going well.
Shivraj Patil,"We also fail understand what Dr Manmohan Singh means when he says he will await the detailed judgement, the full judgement can take any length of time"
Shivraj Patil,"We are not afraid of elections but we are not creating conditions for elections either, ... We are not pining for elections. Suppose people give the same kind of fractured verdict we will be back in the same situation."
Danica Patrick,"I guess my engineer, Ray Leto, must have some magic in him because he solved most of the problems from this morning. There was still a little bit of push, so I just kind of let the car go where it wanted to go. More than anything, I'm a little bit relieved after that run. A run like this helps you gain the confidence you need to keep your foot down."
Danica Patrick,You're at risk being in your own house. There is a risk of cancer with every breath you take. There is a chance for tragedy every second.
Danica Patrick,"You know, it's always good to have seen a track before, just to kind of know where the little bumps are here and there, and just the general feel for the size."
Danica Patrick,"To be honest, once you've driven around for about five, 10 laps, you don't notice a difference."
Danica Patrick,"I take none of that to heart. I don't feel like there's anything that I need to do for anybody else. I want to win bad enough for myself anyway, that nothing anybody can say can make me want to win any more."
Danica Patrick,"I mean, you've kind of got the track down, especially with ovals. The only thing that improves is that when race conditions come, you know what to expect slightly more from the track and from your car."
Danica Patrick,"I feel like, sometimes, people, because of the amount of media, because of the amount of attention, people seem to think I have to do things. Like, I have to win right now! But I don't feel like that."
Danica Patrick,"Three poles in a season is a great accomplishment for any driver. Since this ties the rookie pole record, you can bet I'll be shooting for my fourth pole."
Deval Patrick,"If the question is, is there some conflict of interest between where or what my sources are and where my sources are and the job of governing, you'll know that from my financial disclosure forms, and that's entirely appropriate."
Deval Patrick,"I certainly understand the instinct to favor someone with whom you make a personal connection. But I also understand, and everyone else does, the import of also doing the fundamentals in terms of a background check."
Deval Patrick,"In a healthy democracy, the voters choose representatives. In the system we have, the representatives choose the voters. That's upside down. This proposal puts us right side up again."
Deval Patrick,"Gun violence is on the rise in many of our cities today, and illegal gun trafficking from neighboring states is a big part of the problem. We need a coordinated effort to ensure partnership and cooperation with prosecution, community programs and crime prevention. We need leadership from the federal, state and local levels, as well as help from our neighboring states."
Deval Patrick,I frequently feel when I listen to him and to many other elected officials that they are speaking to an audience not in the room.
Chris Patten,"We want to know that if we are investing money in Macedonia, it is being spent to ensure Macedonia's stability and prosperity."
Chris Patten,"There is a sort of exotic preposterousness about a lot of elections, the way arguments are made even cruder."
Chris Patten,"We must dig deep in our pockets to make sure Pakistan isn't destabilized by the humanitarian crisis that may be about to engulf the country,"
Chris Patten,the whole international community needs to stand together in the face of new threats to our shared values.
David Patten,"It was straight-up luck, ... just threw his arms up and he hit the ball. He just happened to be Johnny on the spot. It was a well-executed play. I came scot-free across the middle. We won three games like that, and sometimes those games go the other way."
David Patten,We've got to go out there and show some consistency. We've got to show that we're going to be able to complement our defense.
David Patten,He has this ability to sit back there with all this commotion going on and just stay focused. I'm not talking about focusing on one guy. He spreads it around. He's going to hit the open guy. You can't defend that.
Carly Patterson,"You never know what can happen. I feel like I have a pretty good chance, but you never know."
Carly Patterson,"You know, I don't even really remember. I think he just said, 'Good job. Now we're going to get back in the gym and work for Trials.'"
Carly Patterson,"Yep, my body is doing good and everything feels good and I'm ready."
Carly Patterson,"Well, it's still another two-day competition, so it's really important to show that you're ready. Every meet is really important right now. You've got to keep showing you can hit."
Carly Patterson,"Well, first I have to make the team, of course."
Carly Patterson,"Then after I saw the scoreboard that we were tied, I was really happy, because I really wanted to win."
Carly Patterson,"The only thing I really, really want is for the U.S. to win again. Just to win another team gold. And, of course I would really want to win an all-around gold."
Carly Patterson,"She said I did good and I think she was happy with what I did. She just wants me to get my higher Start Value vault, which I'll be competing at Trials and, hopefully, the Olympics."
Carly Patterson,Probably Romania and China and Russia. I think they're all working really hard to beat us right now.
Carly Patterson,"It meant a lot because it was my first time to compete as a senior at that meet, which was kind of weird because I've done senior all year, but I didn't get to compete last year because of my elbow."
Carly Patterson,"It just meant a lot because it's something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to be a Senior National Champ. I was Junior National Champ in 2002, so now to be the senior champ is great."
Carly Patterson,"If they did it like they did it in '96 or whenever, just picking it from one meet, what if someone had the meet of their life but they're not usually a good competitor? That could be really bad for the team. So, I think this is the best way."
Carly Patterson,I've been working really hard to go to the Olympics. That's been my dream for my whole life. It would be great to have that dream come true.
Carly Patterson,I'm not really nervous yet. There is nothing to be nervous about - just train your routines so that you're ready for the competition.
Carly Patterson,"I'm just going to be training for the next two months. Just training, nothing else. It will be really hard, but it's worth it, especially at the end."
Carly Patterson,"I want to do it for myself. It's my goal and dream. All I can ask for is to get the chance and go out there and do the best I can, be as ready as I can."
Carly Patterson,"I thought I had gotten second, but I didn't, so I was really happy."
Carly Patterson,I think we're all really strong and we just need to keep working really hard. If we go out there and do our best we'll win again. All we need to do is hit.
Carly Patterson,"I think it helps me. You know, I've got two more meets under my belt, and that's always a good thing."
Carly Patterson,I guess I'm kind of used to it because it's always been that way for me.
Carly Patterson,I think we all have had better days in competition.
Floyd Patterson,I could never be with a woman during training. Because my knees would get very weak. My opinion is based on personal experience.
Floyd Patterson,The fighter loses more than his pride in the fight; he loses part of his future. He's a step closer to the slum he came from.
Floyd Patterson,I've been knocked down more than any heavyweight champion in history.
Floyd Patterson,For if you train hard and responsibly your confidence surges to a maximum.
Gary Patterson,We have the potential to do everything we've talked about doing â€“ and that's not just being in the Top 25. We can be a Top 10 contender in whatever we want to do.
Gary Patterson,"Robert is a very humble guy who's never asked for any glory. He's played through injuries, and he's a back we can count on to get the hard yards."
Gary Patterson,"Last year was frustrating for me as a head coach. Sometime when you take over a program, I see the word out there, I'm maintaining ... For me, I was part of that also. Now to be able to knock off an Oklahoma, there are a lot of positives with it."
Gary Patterson,Give Mendenhall and his boys a lot of credit. We have a pretty good defense and they scored 50 points on us.
James Patterson,His anger also made him cautious in a protective way.
James Patterson,"This summer, I'll be bringing out a mystery that involves a young lawyer and a court scene the likes of which I don't think you've ever seen. Hollywood said this is James Patterson meets John Grisham."
James Patterson,"The vampire underworld is much larger than most people could imagine. It exists in all the cities mentioned in the book, but also in many, many more. Teenagers, especially, seem to like to act out vampire fantasies."
James Patterson,"Other than my hundreds of arrests I really don't have that much experience with the law. While the majority of people aren't corrupt, there certainly is an awful lot of corruption in this country."
James Patterson,"Lately, I find that I'm working on three or more projects at any given time. For some reason, this is a very comfortable way for me to work."
James Patterson,"I read some, and then visited with people involved in this curious, exciting and somewhat misunderstood sub-culture. I met with a fang maker, who offered to fit me for an exquisite pair."
James Patterson,"I grew up in a house full of women: my mother, grandmother, three sisters, and two female cats. And I still have the buzz of their conversations in my head. As an adult, I have more female friends than male ones: I just love the way that women talk."
James Patterson,For many years I had heard about an underworld consisting of people who act out a vampire fantasy while I was living in New York. Fortunately for me there are also several books on the phenomena.
James Patterson,"Always expect the unexpected. Right around Thanksgiving, when the new Alex Cross will be out. It's called Four Blind Mice and it's a pretty amazing story about several murders inside the military."
James Patterson,"I did know that the book would end with a mind-boggling trial, but I didn't know exactly how it would turn out. I like a little suspense when I am writing, too."
Mark Patterson,"We're in a period of great greed right now,"
Mark Patterson,"This includes threat modeling, specifying the intended operational environment, defining of use and misuse cases, adopting of secure coding techniques, and performing source-level security reviews including source code analysis."
Mark Patterson,"Most IT administrators focus on the network tier, deploying firewalls, intrusion detection, and other perimeter-defense or monitoring mechanisms, ... In addition, applications exposed to the outside typically employ encryption methods like SSL to provide privacy of communications on the Internet and to ensure the identities of the endpoints are trusted."

In addition, applications exposed to the outside typically employ encryption methods like SSL to provide privacy of communications on the Internet and to ensure the identities of the endpoints are trusted."
Ruben Patterson,I think we were all devastated and hurt. It could have been worse. He could not be here today. We went out and played for him. I know he watched the game. It was a good win.
Ruben Patterson,We just kept playing hard. They were fighting to get back in it and Andre and Carmelo hit some big shots down the stretch.
Ruben Patterson,All you've got to know is everything is fine. It was just bad communication.
Ruben Patterson,"I just came out there and played. It felt good to get a win before Christmas. My offense was feeling good, so I just took the scoring over for us today."
Scott Pattison,The memory of the really bad downturn we had from 2002 to 2004 is strong. And there's always Medicaid. And a lot of states want to build up their rainy-day funds in case the economy goes soft again. So all of that is going to limit somewhat the momentum for new programs.
Scott Pattison,"But from an economics or financial management perspective, you'd say of course you want to start looking out way beyond one year."
Scott Pattison,"They really are at a point where the easy stuff to do has been done, so now the choice has become between tax increases and fairly stringent cuts in programs."
George S. Patton,If everyone is thinking alike then somebody isn't thinking.
George S. Patton,Take calculated risks. This is quite different from being rash.
George S. Patton,A good plan violently executed right now is far better than a perfect plan executed next week.
George S. Patton,A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.
George S. Patton,"I do not fear failure. I only fear the ''slowing up'' of the engine inside of me which is pounding, saying, ''Keep going, someone must be on top, why not you?''"
George S. Patton,"Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results."
George S. Patton,"Accept the challenges, so you may feel the exhilaration of victory."
George S. Patton,Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
George S. Patton,Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom.
George S. Patton,You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals.
George S. Patton,"If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."
George S. Patton,Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle.
George S. Patton,"A pint of sweat, saves a gallon of blood."
Ricardo Patton,He had to learn how hard he has to work to keep his spot. He's put together a good month of practice and has become what we thought when we brought him in here.
Ricardo Patton,I think we are past trying to get into the tournament. We'd like to get in the tournament and go deep in the tournament.
Ricardo Patton,"Roby had a difficult time all night. I thought they did an excellent job in guarding Roby -- being physical with him and creating issues with him getting open and getting good looks. Most of his shots that he took were under duress, and we ended up with Marcus Hall having to over-dribble more because guys couldn't get freed up."
Ricardo Patton,We've got to keep plugging away and see how we can correct some of the mistakes we made.
Ricardo Patton,There is no question in my mind. We can play the tape right now. Anybody can see that he was in the air and that he had left the ground and the ball had left his hand.
Ricardo Patton,"I think that he is a very talented young man. He does not mind working. We all have to realize that most of the times the NBA drafts on potential, and anyone that has seen Richard play over the past couple of seasons knows that he has a lot of potential. He will continue to improve every year that he plays basketball just because he is willing to work at it."
Ricardo Patton,"There are times when he thinks he is Magic (Johnson) and times we think he is tragic. Tonight, he came around."
Ricardo Patton,"If we come back and take care of our home court, that gives us 19 wins, maybe tied for fourth place in the league, and we'll have had a really good season."
Ricardo Patton,"This is what we face on the road every game, so it's nice to have our own home crowd motivation. Our guys really feed off that. It's a great energy to have."
Ricardo Patton,It's a matter of staying focused and not trying to make home-run plays.
Ricardo Patton,He is a future NBA guy. He reminds me of (former Cyclone Jamaal) Tinsley. He's that type of player with great size and strength about him. We've got clips of him just forearming guys and being physical. Nothing dirty. He's as tough as any player in the league.
Ricardo Patton,Baylor is going to be a team to be reckoned with in the future.
Ricardo Patton,"Boy, that's some kind of family gene."
Ricardo Patton,"His teams not only play hard, but they play with a great deal of discipline. The guys who are supposed to shoot the ball shoot the ball. The ones who are supposed to set screens set screens, and then they play off of everything else."
Ricardo Patton,"If you're averaging five or six (thousand) and wind up with eight (thousand), that's certainly moving in the right direction. At this point we don't have any complaints about the crowds we've had in the last few games. Can it be better? Certainly. But it's been awfully good based on where we started."
Ricardo Patton,"I believe the ACC and Big 12 are definitely two of the best conferences in the country anywhere, night in and night out."
Ricardo Patton,It's encouraging to hear him say those things. I know he is working hard to build community support for the department.
Ricardo Patton,I think it's very rewarding for the players that are participating at each place. I know every coach and every department has worked long and hard to get to this point where each program is having some success.
Ricardo Patton,"Every team has to have that one guy. But as I told Richard tonight, part of the character of good and great players is consistency. He has to make his presence felt on the floor every night."
Ricardo Patton,"My personal belief is that his communication with agents affects how he plays. I won't elaborate any further on it, but he and I have talked about that. But I certainly think it affects how he plays in certain games."
Alice Paul,"It is better, as far as getting the vote is concerned I believe, to have a small, united group than an immense debating society."
Alice Paul,"This world crisis came about without women having anything to do with it. If the women of the world had not been excluded from world affairs, things today might have been different."
Alice Paul,"It occurred to me that I just didn't see how I could go ahead and continue to eat meat. It just seemed so... cannibalistic to me. And so, I'm a vegetarian, and I have been ever since."
Alice Paul,Mr. President how long must women wait to get their liberty? Let us have the rights we deserve.
Alice Paul,"It is better, as far as getting the vote is concerned, I believe, to have a small, united group than an immense debating society."

Alice Paul,I always feel the movement is a sort of mosaic.
Alice Paul,"I never doubted that equal rights was the right direction. Most reforms, most problems are complicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary equality."
Alice Paul,We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twenty million women are denied the right to vote.
Alice Paul,Food simply isn't important to me.
Les Paul,"They've taken the, the licks and the ideas and applied 'em differently, so it's very amusing, or very interesting, to me to see how they've changed it and made it work, made it so new and different. It's always a pleasure to hear someone creating something new."
Les Paul,"Les Paul and Friends,"
Les Paul,"I have younger friends who donâ€™t work, and they arenâ€™t doing so well. My secret is to keep going, keep working."
Les Paul,The worst is over. I am doing better. I am grateful to all of my friends for their thoughts and I will be back shortly making them laugh.
Les Paul,We go in there and we work on altering those ideas and in many cases go in different directions.
Les Paul,"I wanted something very dense, something that would sustain long and more pieces of wood that would be soft, sweet, for more of a mellow sound."
Les Paul,When I got my first guitar my fingers wouldn't go to the sixth string so I took off the big E and played with just five strings. I was only 6 or 7.
Les Paul,"I used my mother's radio as a PA system. I'd take the telephone, the speaking part, and take those two leads off and lead them into the radio and the sound would come out of the speaker."
Les Paul,"Now I need to take a piece of wood and make it sound like the railroad track, but I also had to make it beautiful and lovable so that a person playing it would think of it in terms of his mistress, a bartender, his wife, a good psychiatrist - whatever."
Les Paul,"One minute we're over here, the next minute we're doing something completely different. But it's interesting because you are producing so many things you couldn't do with analog."
Ron Paul,"You run the risk of customers trading down, which drives down check averages and hurts profits."
Ron Paul,"We are, of course, proud of the many accomplishments we have achieved over the past 40 years. That said, I am even more excited about our plans for the future."
Ron Paul,"The obligations of our representatives in Washington are to protect our liberty, not coddle the world, precipitating no-win wars, while bringing bankruptcy and economic turmoil to our people."
Ron Paul,think that the best way to [deal with the disaster] is simply to write a huge check to the very government agency that failed so spectacularly.
Ron Paul,"They broke the mold when they decided to do music. If bookstores have coffee, then why can't a coffee store sell books and movies?"
Ron Paul,"The greatest threat facing America today is the disastrous fiscal policies of our own government, marked by shameless deficit spending and Federal Reserve currency devaluation. It is this one-two punch-- Congress spending more than it can tax or borrow, and the Fed printing money to make up the difference-- that threatens to impoverish us by further destroying the value of our dollars."
Tom Paulin,You are either a Zionist or an anti-Zionist.
Tom Paulin,This sympathy is not translated into force against the British government because it is not like the anti- apartheid movement which had a high profile here and Mandela is a more engaging figure than Yasser Arafat.
Tom Paulin,I think protest and actions have to be organised against the Israelis and their backers. There needs to be a concerted high profile campaign to raise awareness of the people in this country.
Tom Paulin,I think attacks on civilians in fact boost morale.
Tom Paulin,I don't think the British carry a historical consciousness either.
Tom Paulin,I am not very moved by historical apologies.
Tom Paulin,Hitler bombed London into submission but in fact it created a sense of national solidarity.
Tom Paulin,"Because there is a sort of amorphous, sort of darkness at the heart of things, because there is a certain kind of complacency and individualism."
Dr. Pauling,Facts are the air of scientists. Without them you can never fly.
Dr. Pauling,"The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas, and throw the bad ones away"

Dr. Pauling,Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life.
James Paulsen,"We've got total labor compensation growing at 6 percent. . . . We've got record-setting highs in terms of household net worth, and it's still a record high if you exclude housing."
James Paulsen,"This was not a year for macro-sector bets â€” whoever bet on sectors, or indexes other than energy, got extremely frustrated. This was the year of individual stocks."
James Paulsen,"This was not a year for macro-sector bets -- whoever bet on sectors, or indexes other than energy, got extremely frustrated. This was the year of individual stocks."
James Paulsen,That's how the economy pushes forward; new things emerge that no one was thinking about.
James Paulsen,"The stock market doesn't know if it should focus on the fact that the economy is strong and profit momentum is good, or that rates have to go higher."
Pat Paulsen,All the problems we face in the United States today can be traced to an unenlightened immigration policy on the part of the American Indian

Pat Paulsen,"If elected, I will win."
Pat Paulsen,"Assuming either the Left Wing or the Right Wing gained control of the country, it would probably fly around in circles."
Pat Paulsen,"I've upped my standards. Now, up yours."
Carl Pavano,It would be a great honor pitching in something like that. But all my thoughts right now are on getting healthy and being able to help the Yankees.
Carl Pavano,You have to turn the page. Don't let history repeat itself.
Carl Pavano,"It's hard, but if I look at the results we've been having with the way we've been going, how I've been feeling, as anxious as I am, I know this is the best thing for me. Sometimes, I'd like to go a little faster, but they say it's not in my best interests. I'm listening to them. Every time I've gone out there, I've gotten better."
Carl Pavano,"I don't think this is the most stable environment to have a relationship. Guys that do it, great -- but I haven't really mastered that part of it."
Carl Pavano,"Yeah, I've been anxious for six months. I feel great. The consistency is there, and that's something I didn't have at all last year. I'm definitely seeing things this year that I didn't see from myself at all last year, and that's the most encouraging thing about it."
Carl Pavano,"I like the way my body is reacting. My goal is to come back better than I was before [the injury]. I'm on that path. A big part of it is mental, just knowing the hard work you have to do."
Luciano Pavarotti,"Miserere ... You know I don't want to be a talent scout, but sometimes when I find someone very talented and very unique and different, if it's possible to give him a chance, why not? I'm very happy and very proud to find someone young -- a great musician or singer that I can write a song for and help him in a way."
Luciano Pavarotti,"I think it was very good. I would like to say it was romantic, absolutely, very difficult in 2001 to have something like that,"
Luciano Pavarotti,Learning music by reading about it is like making love by mail.
Joe Pavelski,"Two weekends left and then we've got playoffs. We're bearing down, trying to get something going here and I think we had a good start last weekend."
Joe Pavelski,"In the second period, we threw an interchange at them and they didn't know what to do. They started running at us, so we're like, 'Let's go down low and throw it right back at them.' They came out and they were fading. I kind of gave a look to (Robbie) Earl, they both kind of collapsed and Tom was just sitting there."
Joe Pavelski,You remember the days in the backyard when it's cold and you just had some fun.
Joe Pavelski,It's like a big family.
Joe Pavelski,But it's a very tough choice.
Robert Pavlik,"If we get a GDP or deflator number that's much stronger than the consensus estimate, then it could hurt the market because people will be talking about a tougher Fed."
Robert Pavlik,It's headed in the right direction. But we need to get past all this Treasury refunding.
Robert Pavlik,It's headed in the right direction. But we need get past all this Treasury refunding.
Sharad Pawar,We share Pakistan's stance on this. India also does not support a Twenty20 world tournament.
Sharad Pawar,More information on the earlier lines was placed before the working committee by the treasurer. The matter was discussed and it was decided to leave the matter to the discretion of the president.
Sharad Pawar,"With such high income, the associations should pledge to improve the standard of the game and also give better facilities to players so that they remain with the sport, grow with it and can make a living out of it."
Sharad Pawar,"I have spoken to the cricket board presidents of the other Test nations from Asia (Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) and have reached an understanding."
John Paxson,"We're closer than that. I've tried to look at this all along and say, 'We obviously value Tyson.' We acknowledge a lot of things out there and that because of his size and athletic ability he's a valuable player. So I've approached the negotiations that way."
John Paxson,"The issue with the sign-and-trade is we have to be willing to do that. Whether it's been requested or not is not the issue. In order to do that, we'd have to get something in return that we like, and I don't see that happening."
John Paxson,That's going to be an issue in terms of who assumes the risk of the deal. That is something we talked about.
John Paxson,"It was during a conditioning drill, and Eddy complained of chest pain and lightheadedness. We took him to the hospital."
John Paxson,"It was during a conditioning drill, and Eddy complained of chest pain and lightheadedness, ... We took him to the hospital."
John Paxson,"This move will give Dalibor an opportunity to play, ... He has been nothing but great to work with during his three years with the Bulls and I wish him and his family the very best of luck with his playing future."
John Paxson,"We were open to listening to other teams. But in the end, it came down to [that] we like our young guys and we weren't going to give them up unless we were convinced it was for good value."
John Paxson,Our intention through that whole process was to show him that we did care about him and that we were concerned about his well-being.
John Paxson,"In my heart, I would never put anyone in jeopardy. If this were a child of mine, I would have done the same thing."
John Paxson,"Let's face it, we've had several (coaches). So keeping that continuity was huge. And I honestly believe that Scott is one of the top coaches in the league because he teaches the game on the practice floor. And he also knows how to manage a game, how to use people. He's not afraid to try things."
John Paxson,"We talked about if there was a way to do something. Again, we're just in the beginning stages of this thing. You look at how long this thing with Tyson [had] gone on, and Leon and I have just started on Eddy. There are a lot of issues to work through with Eddy."
John Paxson,We're not allowed to make any agreement like that. The only thing I could do was get the financial situation the way I wanted it. That's what we did.
Charles Payne,"[Payne's second selection is travel firm Cendant.] It has four or five different household names in terms of travel. When Enron popped up, this stock went from $21 to $15 almost for no reason except they were guilty of some accounting issues in the past, ... I think the company is starting to recoup its reputation. I think when the stock gets above $20 it's going to attract a lot of buyers."

Charles Payne,"The market's at the mercy of sentiment, which is very bad. It's not panic selling, but there's a lack of buyers right now. There's a lot of money on the sidelines."
Charles Payne,We have a changing of the guard in technology. All these cornerstone tech names can't conjure up the magic they once did and I think it's time people started looking for new bellwethers.
Charles Payne,I'm hoping that it's accompanied with encouraging language.
Charles Payne,a real powerful mix for some kind of recovery.
Charles Payne,It would generate some income from an otherwise dead portfolio.

Charles Payne,"What you have in this type of environment is that when rallies fail or even stall, people say it's just time to dump."
Charles Payne,The air of enthusiasm is starting to seep out of the markets and there's a realization that it's going to take a long time to go from recession to expansion.

Octavio Paz,Modern man likes to pretend that his thinking is wide-awake. But this wide-awake thinking has led us into the mazes of a nightmare in which the torture chambers are endlessly repeated in the mirrors of reason.
Octavio Paz,"Writers, you know, are the beggars of Western society."
Octavio Paz,Deserve your dream.
Octavio Paz,"Love is an attempt at penetrating another being, but it can only succeed if the surrender is mutual."
Octavio Paz,Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone.
Octavio Paz,Technology is not an image of the world but a way of operating on reality. The nihilism of technology lies not only in the fact that it is the most perfect expression of the will to power... but also in the fact that it lacks meaning.
Octavio Paz,"Man, even man debased by the neocapitalism and pseudosocialism of our time, is a marvelous being because he sometimes speaks. Language is the mark, the sign, not of his fall but of his original innocence. Through the Word we may regain the lost kingdom and recover powers we possessed in the far-distant past."
Octavio Paz,"Today we all speak, if not the same tongue, the same universal language. There is no one center, and time has lost its former coherence: East and West, yesterday and tomorrow exist as a confused jumble in each one of us. Different times and different spaces are combined in a here and now that is everywhere at once."
Octavio Paz,The electoral process of July 6 perhaps represents a new era in the history of Mexico.
Octavio Paz,"Literature is the expression of a feeling of deprivation, a recourse against a sense of something missing. But the contrary is also true: language is what makes us human. It is a recourse against the meaningless noise and silence of nature and history."
Octavio Paz,"If we are a metaphor of the universe, the human couple is the metaphor par excellence, the point of intersection of all forces and the seed of all forms. The couple is time recaptured, the return to the time before time."
Octavio Paz,Social criticism begins with grammar and the re-establishing of meanings.
Octavio Paz,"A glass pitcher, a wicker basket, a tunic of coarse cotton cloth. Their beauty is inseparable from their function. Handicrafts belong to a world existing before the separation of the useful and the beautiful."
Octavio Paz,"The North American system only wants to consider the positive aspects of reality. Men and women are subjected from childhood to an inexorable process of adaptation; certain principles, contained in brief formulas are endlessly repeated by the Press, the radio, the churches, and the schools, and by those kindly, sinister beings, the North American mothers and wives. A person imprisoned by these schemes is like a plant in a flowerpot too small for it: he cannot grow or mature."
Octavio Paz,To read a poem is to hear it with our eyes; to hear it is to see it with our ears.
Octavio Paz,"Art is an invention of aesthetics, which in turn is an invention of philosophers... What we call art is a game."

Norman Vincent Peale,Live your life and forget your age.
Norman Vincent Peale,"Age-based retirement arbitrarily severs productive persons from their livelihood, squanders their talents, scars their health, strains an already overburdened Social Security system, and drives many elderly people into poverty and despair.

Harry Pearce,We have absolutely not delivered on our commitment with respect to (U.S.) market share.
Harry Pearce,"We needed stability, to be very transparent in our commitment to the future of the company. It was very important in my judgment that we not prolong the process. It had to be a high-quality search but we had to move quickly."
Bruce Pearl,"We deserved victory. It wasn't like we had to get hit in the mouth to start playing. We were ready to play, and we had to play well."
Bruce Pearl,"These guys, all year long, played every game trying to prove that they were better than what they had been playing. ... And we have to recapture that now."
Bruce Pearl,"How big was Bradshaw? Dane makes a couple of 3s. And playing with foul trouble, and once again doesn't have a turnover. That's like four or five games in a row. He doesn't turn the ball over. Just super-solid."
Bruce Pearl,Absolutely. There's a different set of rules for him than anybody else on the team.
Bruce Pearl,"You weren't recruited at that high major level, you don't travel the way (power conferences) travel, you're not on television as much."
Bruce Pearl,"I can't worry about what their tournament record was in the past. To me, that doesn't have a lot to do with this team."
Bruce Pearl,We will win more championships during my time here. We've won championships in the past. This one is going to be significant and it's going to be special because it was so unexpected and accomplished with a lot of obstacles and a lot to overcome. That said that's about all the reflecting I'm going to do on it because we have a lot of basketball to play.
Bruce Pearl,"He plays so hard and plays with guts and passion, and he's the kind of guy you'd like to have on your team, but hate to play against. I think it's a combination of respect, admiration and good fun."
Bruce Pearl,"I just think the opportunity to be on the road to the Final Four, to have the opportunity to be there for one shining moment, those are all the things we've got to push. We've got to try to get our identity back and playing a team out of conference that's not played us for the second or third time will be a positive. Ready or not, here it comes."
Bruce Pearl,I've been talking to this team all year about seeding. A good seed gives you a better opportunity to advance.
Bruce Pearl,"I think back in the fall if you'd given me an opportunity to come into this Monday morning press conference as SEC East champions having just lost to Arkansas on Saturday and asked if I'd have taken it, I think I probably would have taken it, so I'm absolutely positively not going to beat my team up today because they don't deserve it."
Bruce Pearl,I told every kid I'm recruiting to make sure they're watching (last night) on CBS. Phillip wears the same color shirt as I do. We're on the same team.
Bruce Pearl,"I am very disappointed in these young men. Our players need to take their responsibility for being a role model seriously, and if they don't act responsibly they won't be playing at Tennessee."
Bruce Pearl,"We'll be back. I'm very, very proud of these young men. I can't tell you how many people have written or called and said how much they enjoyed this basketball team. This Tennessee basketball team will go down as one of the all-time best, and this was the group that got it started."
Bruce Pearl,"Lofton did more than just get back on track. Lofton was the man. He got ready to play. He had that look in him, and Florida saw that look. National television and everybody saw that look."
Bruce Pearl,"March Madness has begun and we are very pleased to have won and advanced. I know this would have been hard for you (the media) to have not characterized it as an upset if we gotten beat, but we beat a very good basketball team. We played well. It was all we could do to win."
Bruce Pearl,"A big part of March madness is that there are going to be upsets. If Winthrop looks at the No. 2 seeds, they would be thankful they're playing Tennessee instead of some other two-seed."
Bruce Pearl,I've worked my whole life to get to a place like Tennessee.
Bruce Pearl,"They're the kind of team that could make some noise in the NCAA Tournament. We were playing for a (league) championship today, but they were playing for the (NCAA) tournament. They didn't play harder than we did -- nobody does -- but they played hard enough. I thought they wore us down with their offensive execution."
Bruce Pearl,We're going to be in close games all the time down the stretch. We're not going to run anybody off the floor.
Bruce Pearl,"I wasn't calling them out. I just remember some of coach Mears' teams, and the great games with Kentucky."
Bruce Pearl,"It was a fun, locker room moment."
Bruce Pearl,At least this buys us some time where people are not going to say it's just a football conference.
Bruce Pearl,"Fatigue may be a factor, but I don't want to make excuses. We're capable of defending better."
Bruce Pearl,We desperately want to win. We've tasted enough failure at Tennessee.
Bruce Pearl,"That's when we can separate and get on a run. Chris Lofton is a great example. I can't believe how open he got. I can't believe he made those shots. Had I called timeout, I couldn't have given him a better look."
Bruce Pearl,"I'm not at all unhappy with our fans or upset with the students. I shared their enthusiasm. OK, but we did it this one time. Let's not do it again."
Bruce Pearl,We played with great passion and great energy in the second half.
Bruce Pearl,"In the second half, Arkansas clearly was fresher. We did not have the energy to speed things up. Their size and athleticism made a difference. We struggled with our interior defense, and got dominated under the boards. It is hard to win when the numbers come out this way."
Bruce Pearl,"In the second half, Arkansas clearly was fresher. We did not have the energy to speed things up. We did not turn Arkansas over a lot. It takes energy to create offense or defense, and we needed more energy."
Bruce Pearl,"I was worried about him - so much emotion and so much going into one shot. If they would have won the game, it would have gotten them a little more recognition and they'd be happier, but it doesn't take away from what a great team, what a great program and what a coach he is. But I understand. I'm numb sitting here myself."
Bruce Pearl,He was extremely distraught after the game. I worried about him. So much emotion. So much going into that one shot. But I understand. I'm numb sitting here myself.
Bruce Pearl,"At this time, we are dealing with discipline internally."
Bruce Pearl,"He's better off the bounce. He's also getting more offense from his defense. He's a sophomore, so he's a year older, a year stronger."
Bruce Pearl,We got enough backdoor looks to deflate Texas ' defense.
Bruce Pearl,I am concerned with our second-half defense. We must focus on playing better. There is no margin for error with this team.
Bruce Pearl,We got enough backdoor looks to deflate Texas' defense.
Bruce Pearl,"If there was an award for Player of the Week in the country, I can't imagine a player getting it over Chris."
Bruce Pearl,Lofton was the man. He had that look in him that the whole country saw who were watching on television. Everybody saw it.
Bruce Pearl,You can't control what's happened but you can control what happens from here.
Bruce Pearl,"We've got to learn how to handle it with our crowd control and understand the responsibility that we have to the safety and well-being of our guests. If this fine draws attention to that fact, let's talk about it. Let's congratulate the fans on an amazing atmosphere, but understand we can't have that happen for the safety of the opponents."
Bruce Pearl,For the first time our confidence has got to be shook a little bit. We were disrupted by South Carolina.
Bruce Pearl,"The good news is that this is a talented class, the bad news is half our team is freshmen. It's like having two first years as a head coach."
Bruce Pearl,"That's a great crowd for a Christmas break. When you're trying to build a program, you need a village."
Bruce Pearl,"I think this team showed a lot of character tonight. Vanderbilt played awfully well, and we were up against it."
Bruce Pearl,We just made some choices that were out of character for us.
Bruce Pearl,"I think a lot of times, you find your (conference) tournament champion being somebody that underachieved."
Bruce Pearl,I think the body of work and the fact that we had such a tough schedule was respected here tonight.
Bruce Pearl,"It was obviously a tale of two halves. We played some really good basketball in the first half. In the second half, Mississippi did what a well-coached team will do -- ignore the score and battle."
Bruce Pearl,We are committed to up-tempo basketball. We will press 94 feet. There's a definite advantage because there is a different preparation (for opponents). I think the players do fit our style.
Bruce Pearl,"We have to focus on getting better down the stretch and playing better basketball. There's no margin for error with this team. When we slip up a little bit, obviously a team like Kentucky is able to expose that."
Bruce Pearl,"I think that we've got to focus on trying to come down the stretch here and start playing better basketball. Every night we've had some really, really intense, physical games the last three or four, and there's no margin for error with this team. When we slip up a little bit, obviously a team like Kentucky is able to expose it."
Bruce Pearl,"At the National Association of Basketball Coaches Meeting a few years ago, they explained how pods and seeding worked. One thing was clear. If a team is a three seed, it could easily be a two or a four. A lot of it has to do with travel, match-ups and how long it's been since a team has been in the tournament."
Bruce Pearl,"This is a real good night for Southeastern Conference basketball. ... When a team like Tennessee can do something to create better balance in the league, we all benefit."
Bruce Pearl,"It's incredible. To be seeded higher than any team in the history of Tennessee basketball, goes a long way. I'm happy with where we're at. Now we have to take advantage of this opportunity."
Bruce Pearl,"We'll be back. This Tennessee basketball team will go down as one of the all-time best, and this was the group that got it started."
Bruce Pearl,"He does more in the game of basketball than make baskets, but certainly we don't win without him making baskets. You can get other guys to rebound. You can get other guys to steal the ball. You can't get other guys to make the shots he's making."
Bruce Pearl,"It's the greatest sound in college basketball. The crowd makes this noise, like ' oh no ' when a guy who's hot gets the ball and has an open look. Even before he shoots, before he makes it, the crowd reacts. It's so cool, and it's a testament to how smart these fans are. And it's fun for the shooters, too."
Bruce Pearl,"We're tied with LSU. You just don't know when you'll get this close again, and you want to take advantage of it."
Minnie Pearl,"Show business is made up of disappointments, and it's through life's disappointments that you grow."
Minnie Pearl,Kissing a man with a beard is a lot like going to a picnic. You don't mind going through a little bush to get there!
Minnie Pearl,"God has a plan for all of us, but He expects us to do our share of the work."
Minnie Pearl,"The doctor must have put my pacemaker in wrong. Every time my husband kisses me, the garage door goes up."
Minnie Pearl,Take the back roads instead of the highways.
Brian Pearson,"What I like about the new framework is that it's based on research and best practices, ... The state has set a criteria, but it's not telling schools how to get there."
Brian Pearson,"What I was hoping was that these people would be removed so that other people wouldn't get the same experience I got. And two, I feel there is some kind of financial restitution I should receive."
Brian Pearson,They'll be recruiting everywhere. They're a big company. They've got resources.
Neil Peart,You can surrenderWithout a prayerBut never really prayPray without surrenderYou can fightWithout ever winningBut never ever winWithout a fight
Neil Peart,"When they turn the pages of history,when these days have passed long ago--will they read of us with sadnessfor the seeds that we let grow?"

Rick Peck,My defense played excellent again. Offensively we're in a rut. We need to be able to finish.
Rick Peck,"This was a much needed win. Our defense played a good game, we had a lot of scoring opportunity in the game, some that should have been called goals, but we will take this win."
Richard Peddie,"What we're missing out on is the single game sales and when you start the season 1-15, that doesn't get the heart racing. People aren't engaged yet."

Richard Peddie,"A general manager is evaluated in large part by the results of his decisions. Unfortunately, those results have not met our expectations."

Simon Pegg,I just love listening to the laughter.

Simon Pegg,"I always loved horror and that's sort of the reason we decided to make the film. We were nourished on those sorts of films, so it was a labor of love."
Simon Pegg,Chris Martin's a good friend of mine. I'm actually Apple's godfather. He's an old friend and we've been mates for quite a few years now.
Simon Pegg,"We don't watch the film anymore because we've seen it so many times, so we'll introduce it, walk out and we'll come back in right about when I wake up in the morning and walk over to the shop and everything's changed."
Simon Pegg,"The only spoof I think is the title, which was just we thought of very early on and it kind of stuck."
Simon Pegg,"The main jokes in this film are about big things, love and life and zombies - we all get that."
Simon Pegg,"That's what we wanted to get across in that moment, particularly when Shaun goes to the shop when he's all hung over. He doesn't notice any of the zombies around him just because he never had before, so why should he at that point?"
Simon Pegg,"I think at its best the American sense of humor is the same as the British sense of humor at its best, which is to be wry and ironic and self deprecating."

Simon Pegg,"We suddenly saw how people reacted in the event of massive social upheaval, and the way that the little problems in your life don't go away. You don't stop being frightened of spiders just because the world's blown up."
Simon Pegg,"There are a lot of visual marks that have to be hit, and lines that need to be said in a right way - so there wasn't really any improvisation on the set when it came to the bulk of the script."
Simon Pegg,The simple fact is that what you see on the screen is pretty much real.
Simon Pegg,"I mean, yeah, I'm sure that Python and the other things have paved the way for a greater understanding of the British sense of humor, but I don't think it's all that different than the American sense of humor."
Simon Pegg,I used to lie in bed in my flat and imagine what would happen if there was a zombie attack.

Manuel Pellegrini,"I think the referee constantly made mistakes, he didn't notice when our players were pulled as well as several fouls."

Manuel Pellegrini,We are still in contention and I believe we can go back home and get the result we need.
Manuel Pellegrini,"Of course it's important to go down in the history, but we are already thinking about how we can get to the semi-finals. There is no limit to the ambitions of this team. Our dreams are being held in place by the hard work and dedication of the whole squad."
Manuel Pellegrini,"He's full of desire. Besides, his soccer depends more on technique than physique."
Manuel Pellegrini,We were a bit rushed and we didn't gain control of the ball. Arsenal pressed hard and when by losing the ball we lost the offensive capacity we needed to get a goal.
Manuel Pellegrini,This isn't a miracle or a dream. It's based on hard work and belief.
Manuel Pellegrini,"If that allows them to believe they have a big advantage, it must be remembered that Inter haven't won anything since 1989."
Manuel Pellegrini,Physically he's not 100 percent because he's been out of action for 15 days. But he's really keen to play and his game is based more on technique than fitness.

Nancy Pelosi,"These are shameful words. I am appalled to have to say them on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Nancy Pelosi,"We should follow the lead of Congressman John Murtha, who has put forth a plan to make America safer, to make our military stronger, and to make Iraq more stable."
Nancy Pelosi,"It gives tax cuts of $70 billion largely to the wealthiest people in America, it increases the deficit by $20 billion and really doesn't help the victims of Katrina,"

Leonard Peltier,What Bill Clinton did to us was cruel. The White House gave my attorneys indications that there was a good chance for my clemency to be granted. I had to prepare myself for being released because there was no sign that my petition would be denied.
Leonard Peltier,"The United States government can indict you on something, and now you've got to prove your innocence. And that's not the Constitution of the United States."

Julius Peppers,"I see that he runs the ball hard and he has good vision for the cutback run. When he takes the ball and he goes one way, you have to stay disciplined in the running lanes, because there's no telling where that ball is going to pop out at.

Hafiz Persia,"One regret dear world, that I am determined not to have when I am lying on my deathbed is that I did not kiss you enough."
Hafiz Persia,"Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you."
Hafiz Persia,I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness the astonishing light of your own being.
Hafiz Persia,"We have come into this exquisite world to experience ever and ever more deeply our divine courage, freedom and light!"
Goran Persson,"A workplace safety plan is naturally something that should be drawn up, that is completely clear, but I didn't have the expertise to foresee that this sort of thing had to be done."
Goran Persson,"Remember one thing -- that Sweden is performing better than the rest of Europe,"
Goran Persson,It could become very expensive for Sweden to take responsibility in this way for other countries which haven't done their homework.
Goran Persson,I am the first to regret that we did not see then what now seems to be simple to see.
Goran Persson,"We, the leaders of the world, have for three days discussed how the United Nations can be strengthened to meet the challenges of the 21st century,"

Goran Persson,"So far we have seen too little action to be sure about the character of the (negotiating) partner we have in North Korea,"
Johnny Pesky,"If I was a poet laureate, I couldn't find the words."
Johnny Pesky,"That's the word I always had for him. He had that smooth way about him, that pleasant nature. He never screamed or hollered. And he never ripped a player because he didn't have to. He'd just tell you what he was seeing, and you could make your own opinion."
Johnny Pesky,"He was in a class with Mel Allen and all those great announcers. You always go by the voice, and when they got that good voice, you could listen to them all day."

Brian Peters,"I admire the guys who can do it with as little technology as possible, two turntables and a microphone."
Brian Peters,"Despite all of the apparent progress, the industry remains quite manually intensive and could be prone to disruption should it face several large or simultaneous credit events."
Brian Peters,"We have made significant progress on six additional branch offices, which we expect to open in the next few months. In addition, we have plans to open three other branch offices later this year, and will continue to explore further branch expansion opportunities in the greater Tampa Bay area. While we expect to see higher expenses in future periods as a result of our expansion, over time these new branches should further improve our profitability by providing us low cost deposits to fund our loan growth."
Brian Peters,We've had some very intoxicated people not know where their car was or if they drove a car that night.
Brian Peters,World Title Fight Night
Brian Peters,The man [Pearlman] has proven over and over again that he has his hands firmly on the pulse of the entertainment industry and always stays ahead of the curve. We are truly honored that he has chosen to become an integral part of our Company's ongoing development.
Brian Peters,This'll be great for the boy or girl who wins. They could be larger than life looking back on this one day as something that got them started. It's a great idea.
Brian Peters,"If you go down to the skate park, it's all kids. It's the 12-year-olds who are really into it. Keeping youth involved keeps it fresh. Anyone could have entered (the contest). It's no holds barred. It's about who's got the talent, not about names and images and connections. It's just straight-up talent."
Brian Peters,"Over the past 12 months, the major components of our loan portfolio have showed significant growth. We have increased residential construction loans 7% and commercial real estate loans 14% from a year ago. These components now make up 73% of the loan portfolio. In addition, we continue to let our installment loans drop off as they now represent just 8% of the loan portfolio compared to 9% a year ago."
Brian Peters,"Over the past 12 months, we have expanded our loan portfolio and anticipate that because of the high growth throughout the Tampa Bay area we should be able to continue at that rate this year."
Brian Peters,"While these new locations will temporarily decrease short-term profitability, they should provide solid contributions to earnings in future periods."
Brian Peters,"We want the show to be a vibrant and rewarding experience for its visitors and plan to bring it to life using theatre, entertainment and music. We intend to move it away from being just an exhibition to being a real show that competes head to head with any other top entertainment experience whilst demonstrating the excellence of British marine products."
Brian Peters,We were extremely impressed by the quality and creativity of ideas proposed in student essays that were submitted. It is clear that our nation's youth have intelligent opinions and perspectives on their schooling experience and Box Tops for Education is proud to support and encourage them to share their voice on Capitol Hill and in their home communities.
Brian Peters,We believe that it is very important for the dealers to work with this next class of active clients to have them sign on to the new market standards.
Brian Peters,"One of the primary purposes of this rapid branch expansion has been to take advantage of opportunities as they become available in attractive markets. Although these new locations have increased overhead expenses, we are confident they will contribute to profitability within the next few years."
Ralph Peters,The Influence of Sea Power on History.
Ralph Peters,"Fascinating...[A] heartfelt, valuable book ...Singer has gathered his evidence masterfully."
Ralph Peters,We will not be beaten. But we may be shamed and embarrassed on a needlessly long road to victory.
Ralph Peters,"The great paradox of the 21st century is that, in this age of powerful technology, the biggest problems we face internationally are problems of the human soul."
Ralph Peters,"Had the terrorists had any residual ability to strike in the US they would have done it in the wake of Katrina and with the 9/11 anniversary, but all they could do was make a tape."
Scott Peters,"We still have a great need to cooperate with the retirement system and cooperate with investigators,"
Scott Peters,"But I didn't ask the retirement board to sue us either, ... The retirement board has said they want to know the answer to the question of whether those benefits are legal. Both mayoral candidates say they want to know the answer to that question as well. We determined that the only way to get that question behind us is to get a court to decide."
Scott Peters,"The City Council does not agree that Aguirre can be the attorney for the retirement system but the City Council is willing to let the retirement board and city attorney duke it out over these two issues,"
Scott Peters,There's a lot of passion on both sides.
Scott Peters,All that is in the [labor agreements]. We've always had the understanding that we had to do more than labor concessions.

Scott Peters,That loss turned our season around. It woke our girls up.

Thomas Peters,Good managers have a bias for action.
Tim Peters,It's growing like crazy. One of the challenges you have is that the retailer only dedicates so much space to the size. But I think consumers are catching on.
Tim Peters,To hike down here or mountain bike down here -- you get solitude; you get the place to yourself.
Tim Peters,"We want to err on the side of caution. We're not child psychologists so we don't know if there's a problem, but it may merit further action or intervention."
Adrian Peterson,"A couple of those games we lost, we shouldn't have. Cleveland, Washington . . ."
Adrian Peterson,I don't know how you prepare for him. You have to pay notice to what he is. The game plan is different with each running back. We have to know which tailback is in the game.
Adrian Peterson,"We came out there and we played smash-mouth football,"
Adrian Peterson,"There was no doubt in my mind that we were going to get it, ... The guys out there, they were going to bust their butts for that one yard, and we got it. We got more. We got the touchdown."
Dave Peterson,I'm happy with our numbers.
Dave Peterson,I like what the Legislature did this year. They made a positive statement about education in the state.
Dave Peterson,They should tangle for a great race. One could be a state champion.
Dave Peterson,"We don't look like anything most of the people in our audience have ever seen. We wear vintage clothes-and hats-and we use one microphone for all our vocals, so there's a lot of movement on stage. We'll have every kind of harmony; every instrument will be featured; and we'll do everything from breakdowns to waltzes to gospel quartets. I guarantee this: from the moment we hit the stage until the moment we leave, the audience is going to be entertained."
Doug Peterson,It is important for us to support local organic growers and vendors.
Doug Peterson,"At this point, they're ready for flight assignment. But the reality is they could spend years in technical assignments learning the ins and outs of spaceflight. Then there's another year of training specifically for that flight."
Doug Peterson,"He was a pleasure, a joy. He was everything."
Doug Peterson,The boys did a good job of getting the ball down field.
Doug Peterson,The boys did a good job of keeping the ball low going into the wind. We played like the wind wasn't even blowing.
George Peterson,You can kind of read between the lines on that one.
George Peterson,"It got to the point where he hurt [Nielsen] several times by accident, and he just backed off when he could have just taken the guy out. About the second round, I noticed Williams going down -- without a punch [landing]. He had anticipated the punch that never landed, and went down."
George Peterson,"It's what most savvy Fortune 500 chairmen would do. Everyone expected GM would look bad, and (GM Chairman Rick) Wagoner figured it couldn't look any worse so he pulled ahead bad news for 2006 into 2005."
George Peterson,It's like making a Christmas wish list -- a list if it happens .
Oscar Peterson,"You not only have to know your own instrument, you must know the others and how to back them up at all times. That's jazz."
Oscar Peterson,We're not like pop musicians who have to perform the same top ten tunes every night of a tour.
Oscar Peterson,"Too many jazz pianists limit themselves to a personal style, a trademark, so to speak. They confine themselves to one type of playing."
Oscar Peterson,"Some people try to get very philosophical and cerebral about what they're trying to say with jazz. You don't need any prologues, you just play."
Oscar Peterson,"Montreal was a very active jazz center until club owners started putting in strippers instead of music. Before long, there was nothing to hear."
Oscar Peterson,"It's the group sound that's important, even when you're playing a solo."
Oscar Peterson,If you have something to say of any worth then people will listen to you.
Oscar Peterson,I play as I feel.
Oscar Peterson,I have no one style.
Oscar Peterson,"I don't do something because I think it will sell 30 million albums. I couldn't care less. If it sells one, it sells one."

Oscar Peterson,I believe in using the entire piano as a single instrument capable of expressing every possible musical idea.
Oscar Peterson,I am the worlds laziest writer.
Oscar Peterson,"The music field was the first to break down racial barriers, because in order to play together, you have to love the people you are playing with, and if you have any racial inhibitions, you wouldn't be able to do that."
Pete Peterson,We're just trying to keep our base invigorated and charging and continuing to move forward to fight annexation and this is the best way we know how to do it.
Pete Peterson,"The thing we're going to want to know is where do unit sales go moving forward, ... We'd like to see plans for unit growth to continue along with margin growth."
Pete Peterson,"The interesting thing there, though, is that they did cut back on sales of lower margin phones. That helped them get the higher operating margin, but it did cost them some revenue."
Pete Peterson,"We could see the potential of this [1X] really becoming much hotter and more mainstream issue, which would have some positive impact on the stock."
Pete Peterson,"We could see the potential of this [1X] really becoming much hotter and more mainstream issue, which would have some positive impact on the stock,"
Pete Peterson,"They showed some improvement on operating margins in handsets, which is what everybody was looking at."
Pete Peterson,"They showed some improvement on operating margins in handsets, which is what everybody was looking at,"
Pete Peterson,"The cooperation in the fullest possible accounting is excellent and we need to give the Vietnamese credit for having stayed the course on that,"
Tom Peterson,"It's crunch time near the end of school, so we gave the guys Friday off."
Tom Peterson,"We had some spectacular plays and at other times, the way we played we wouldn't be vying for any kind of championship."
Tom Peterson,Ivan is an excellent player and this is a great honor for him. This is also a great compliment to the team. Everyone played well and that opened things up for Ivan. He stepped up and was a big part of our attack.
Tom Peterson,"Consistency is everything for them. It's the same for us. Some matches we've come out poor the first game and then turned it on, and some matches it's been the other way around."
Tom Peterson,"It's do or die. We have the ability to rise to the occasion, so we think we have a shot at it. We cannot let anything bother us. We just need to play our game."
Francesco Petrarch,All pleasure in the world is a passing dream.
Francesco Petrarch,"True, we love life, not because we are used to living, but because we are used to loving. There is always some madness in love, but there is also always some reason in madness."
Francesco Petrarch,Who over-refines his argument brings himself to grief
Francesco Petrarch,Who naught suspects is easily deceived.
Francesco Petrarch,Suspicion is the cancer of friendship.
Bobby Petrino,"It was good to get our first Big East victory, ... I was proud of our players the way they came back. It was a very difficult week for all of us, but we did work extremely hard and we got some extremely good leadership. It wasn't easy; we didn't execute on all cylinders, but our players certainly played with great effort, really stuck together and had a lot of energy and enthusiasm."
Bobby Petrino,It always puts a smile on my face when Joshua has that much production because he works hard to get that.
Bobby Petrino,Virginia Tech did the best job any opponent has done of sticking with the running game after they fell behind. They ran the ball a little bit too much for our liking.
Bobby Petrino,It was good to see Michael back running the ball. He's certainly not 100 percent but he made up his mind he was going to play.
Bobby Petrino,"You always miss a great player, but I think the players on this team have taken a lot of pride in overcoming obstatcles when we have a player down ? not only the offensive players, but the defensive players. We were very fortunate that we played that well."
Bobby Petrino,"I think we had an opportunity to get a couple more points on the board, but I was really happy at halftime. I think we did a nice job of coming out early in the first quarter and getting points on the board. That's not an easy task against those guys."
Bobby Petrino,"Hunter got hit hard. He's a very courageous young man. You can't say enough about what he left on the field. I'm sure he's never been hit that hard before, but he hung in there and tried to do the best he could do. He had us in a position where we could win the game. We just made some mistakes late."
Bobby Petrino,"We hurt our reputation today,"
Bobby Petrino,It's really unfortunate. You hate to see stuff like that. You hate to have kids at home that are watching the game on TV see stuff like that. You don't know how the whole stadium sees it and none of the officials did.
Bobby Petrino,You hate to see kids watching on TV at home see something like that.
Bobby Petrino,It's really unfortunate. You hate to see something like that. You hate for the kids at home watching on TV to see something like that. I don't know how the whole stadium could see it and none of the officials do.
Bobby Petrino,"The way you win games like this, your players do what we call ring the bell. They give best performance to date. I think that's what it is going to take for us to win the game."
Bobby Petrino,"I was really happy with the way Michael ran at the end of the game because that is something we've been working hard on, getting the tough yards and the physical yards."
Bobby Petrino,"It's unfortunate. You hope both teams play hard, play by the rules. They're (Tech) a good football team. We've been talking to our kids all week about keeping our poise and doing things right."
Bobby Petrino,"It was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I learned a lot of football from Tom Coughlin and the other coaches I was able to work with. Any time you're locked up in the bottom of a stadium for 16 hours a day, you better absorb something."
Bobby Petrino,"He did get frustrated at times. But he kept fighting through it, kept playing hard. And in those games he made a lot of plays against the run, which is something that goes unnoticed."
Bobby Petrino,"I was pleased with energy that the players practiced with this morning. The focus was good and the players worked hard. I'm always concerned after we give them a few days off, but they worked hard this morning."
Bobby Petrino,"I think he would need to get some reps in practice. More for himself, for the confidence and feel of it, and say, 'Yeah, I can do this."
Bobby Petrino,I'm sure we're going in to face a team that now has some confidence and will be fired up to play us.
Bobby Petrino,"Hunter did a great job. That's his second college football game and he was going against the No. 1 defense in the country who were very physical, very fast and hit him harder than he has ever been hit. He's a tough kid. He hung in there and got us to the fourth quarter with an opportunity to win the game and then we just didn't finish it."
Bobby Petrino,"We felt good about our ability to come back in the second half, but the kick return and fumble really swung the momentum in their favor, ... We needed to make plays. But as it turned out, USF was the team able to do that."
Bobby Petrino,"We felt good about our ability to come back in the second half, but the kick return and fumble really swung the momentum in their favor. We needed to make plays. But as it turned out, USF was the team able to do that."
Bobby Petrino,He has the ability to teach the techniques and fundamentals we need.
Daniel Petrocelli,He is going to tell you in his own words whether he did any of these things.
Daniel Petrocelli,You could not keep him off that witness stand. He's going to tell you in his own words whether he did any of those things. He's going to tell you how much he loved that company.
Daniel Petrocelli,And what was the cause of that pain?
Daniel Petrocelli,"All that's a pack of lies?,"
Daniel Petrocelli,"This is not a case of hear no evil, see no evil. This is a case of there was no evil."
Daniel Petrocelli,Enron was no house of cards. It was a wonderful company.
Daniel Petrocelli,"Enron was no house of cards . . . It was a wonderful company, a shining star."
Daniel Petrocelli,We believe that videotape will disclose whether that knife was in the possession of his residence.
Daniel Petrocelli,We have to regroup. We don't have the ability to snap a finger and have Mr. Causey stand up and explain all of the accounting conditions and judgments that were made.
Kyle Petty,"Having Tony's support has been huge for Victory Junction. He was one of the first drivers to get on board with us, and beyond the money he and his foundation have donated to the camp, he's brought notoriety, which has helped fuel interest in the camp. It's just one more example of how when we're on the track we're fierce competitors, but off the track we're all united in trying to improve the lives of others, especially children. I've always admired his charitable work and it's an honor to have him as a part of the Victory Junction family."
Kyle Petty,"When you've lost a son, there's no price you can put on safety for the driver."
Kyle Petty,"Consistently running second or third gets you a championship every year in our series. That hasn't changed. You can talk about the Chase all you want, but . . . you're still going to get people who have a shot at the championship or are in the top 10 who haven't won races. There's nothing wrong with that."
Kyle Petty,"The problem isn't necessarily the driver signing a contract in August of 2005 to race for another team in 2007,"
Kyle Petty,"When we looked at it, we'd made very little progress over the last four or five years. We weren't going in the right direction, so we had to look outside our own circle."
Kyle Petty,"It was a night race when nothing else was a night race,"
Kyle Petty,"[Petty Enterprises driver/CEO Kyle Petty says both parties could lose. If McMurray pouts, it will hurt his reputation. But if Ganassi plays] too hard a ball, ... Jamie signed a contract, and he should live up to his contract."
Kyle Petty,"I look at it as smart growth. Smart marketing. Is there a case to be made that we're too many places and we're too many places too fast? There probably is. But at the same time, there's not a seat to be had in the house, and people are tuning in all over the country. So you can't argue against it, either."
Kyle Petty,"It's a funny thing, because I thought the longer I went, the easier it would get. The truth is, the longer it goes, the harder it gets."
Kyle Petty,"Robbie has been a part of our family for a long time, and we're happy to have him come home,"
Kyle Petty,"This sponsorship allows us some friendly competition, which is always fun. We are especially grateful to Checkers for their donation to the Victory Junction Gang, our camp for terminally ill children. We look forward to racing the Checkers Gator car at Miami."
Kyle Petty,"Obviously, keeping secrets in this garage isn't particularly a tradition or anything. You have the three main methods of communication ... telephone, telegraph and tell somebody in the Cup garage. Still, it could be done."
Kyle Petty,This time of year is like the reverse of Christmas. You automatically assume the worst of everyone and everyone's intentions.
Kyle Petty,Doing things like a poker tournament to raise money for any charity is just fun; getting the guys together to raise money just makes it that more special.
Richard Petty,"You can only live on the past for so long, and we kind of stretched our luck on that. We think we're on the way back, but it's just a matter of how quickly things come together. Common sense tells you it's not going to happen overnight because we're trying to catch up."
Richard Petty,"I see two or three cars that are really good, but they're not dominant. There's usually somebody who's got one that's a little bit better than everybody."
Richard Petty,"These sprint boys weren't happy with how the sport was being promoted and where it was going, so they asked me if I'd still be interested in helping them, and I am,"
Richard Petty,"All the boys did real good for their first time out. You couldn't ask for any better. We've got a few bugs to work out, but that's what this was for. We're going to keep practicing and get better."
Richard Petty,"We are excited to partner with TEAM, RADD and NHTSA on this campaign, designed to raise awareness of two major safety issues -- impaired driving and seatbelt use. Richard Petty Driving Experience provides the perfect venue for the campaign's messages and incentives, particularly for reaching young men, who make up the highest risk group for motor vehicle crashes, ... The collaboration of our staff, NASCAR driver hosts and fans with the celebrities and dignitaries that represent the campaign at Richard Petty Driving Experience is exciting to see."
Richard Petty,"Cats know, comin' out of four, they better be standin' on it, else they'll be standin' in it."
Richard Petty,"I quit driving, I'm not retired."
Richard Petty,"Cotton Owens was leading and daddy was second. They came up on me and I moved over to let them pass. Cotton went on, but daddy bumped me in the rear and my car went right into the wall."
Richard Petty,I'd rather be called King than other things I've been called.
Richard Petty,No one wants to quit when he's losing and no one wants to quit when he's winning.
Richard Petty,"If there are 10 people there, two or three are going to recognize you."
Richard Petty,Now they're getting so politically correct you can't even stick your tongue out at somebody.
Richard Petty,So I've realized that this outfit is part of Richard Petty now. And the real Richard Petty is still hidden behind these glasses.
Richard Petty,I don't know if it was much of an interview. We just shot the breeze.
Tom Petty,"You've also got to rebound the basketball, and I think Hartley will be the biggest challenge we've faced this year."
Tom Petty,"I'm frustrated by what I hear. Maybe it's not meant for me. Personally, I'm way too bright for a lot of the hip-hop lyrics to affect. I'm much too smart to think that jewelry or how cool I am is really going to change much about my personality. If you're dumb enough that it entertains you, have a great time. But I am seeking more than that."
Tom Petty,"We have a set list, but we work up a lot more (songs) than we're gonna do. That way we can throw things in and change it around, especially if we're in a place for two days. It's good to keep yourself interested. The last show we did five songs we never rehearsed and that certainly sparked us up."
Tom Petty,I'm reaching there to try and find a theme. It's just a really nice collection of songs. I think it does have an underlying theme of time and what it does to you.
Tom Petty,"We haven't always been boy scouts, but we never lost sight of the music, Let me remind you that this ain't the end."
Tom Petty,"This award comes at a particularly nice time, as the Heartbreakers and I go into the 30th year of our career, I'm very honored that Billboard has acknowledged me with this award."
Tom Petty,Even the losers get lucky sometimes. Even the losers keep a little bit of pride. They get lucky sometimes.
Tom Petty,"Let me run with you tonight, I'll take you on a moonlit ride..."
Tom Petty,"We enjoy playing with each other, which I think is a pretty important part of this. If we didn't, we'd have given it up a long time ago. The idea when we started was to take five people and keep 'em together no matter what and see what we could get out of it, and we've pretty much stuck to that plan."
Tom Petty,"like a deer in the headlights, frozen in real time and I'm losing my mind, it's time to move on."
Tom Petty,the waiting is the hardest part.
Tom Petty,"A person could visualize him putting on 20 pounds and being the kind of tight end you watch on Saturdays. By the same token, he?s got the kind of jump shot, agility and ball skills to make somebody a real nice forward."
Tom Petty,"You have four years to be irresponsible here. Relax. Work is for people with jobs. You'll never remember class time, but you'll remember time you wasted hanging out with your friends. So, stay out late. Go out on a Tuesday with your friends when you have a paper due Wednesday. Spend money you don't have. Drink 'til sunrise. The work never ends, but college does."

Tom Petty,"The music business looks like, you know, innocent schoolboys compared to the TV business. They care about nothing but profit."
Tom Petty,"It's very easy to be cynical about the hall of fame. But on the other hand, it's really a beautiful thing for someone like me. I dedicated my entire life to this music."
Tom Petty,It's funny how the music industry is enraged about the Internet and the way things are copied without being paid for. But you know why people steal the music? Because they can't afford the music.
Tom Petty,I'm barely prolific and incredibly lazy.
Tom Petty,Most things I worry about never happen anyway.
Tom Petty,"It didn't affect his ability for a long time. Heroin can be like that with musicians; I think that's why you see so many musicians drift that way, because you can remain musical for a long time. But I think, without exception, they all hit the wall eventually and the creativity goes."
John Peyton,"Kathryn and I are excited about this wonderful new addition to our family,"
John Peyton,"public outreach, communication, strategy and concerns."
John Peyton,This longstanding Jacksonville tradition captures the spirit of college football rivalry at its best and we are so pleased to serve as the host for years to come.
Phaedrus,Whoever is detected in a shameful fraud is ever after not believed even if they speak the truth

Rhoberta PhD,Right action is when the right people do the right thing for the right reasons at the right time. That about sums up success!

William Phelps,The happiest people in this world are those who have the most interesting thoughts
William Phelps,"The happiest people are those who think the most interesting thoughts.

William Phelps,If I were running the world I would have it rain only between 2 and 5 a.m. Anyone who was out then ought to get wet.

Marvin Philip,"Last year's team was special, but we have all the potential to have an even better year. There's no limit for what we can do. We've got a great team."

Emo Philips,"My girlfriend said to me in bed last night' 'you're a pervert' I said, 'that's a big word for a girl of nine'."

Emo Philips,"I got in a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said, I'm going to mop the floor with your face. I said, You'll be sorry. He said, Oh, yeah? Why? I said, Well, you won't be able to get into the corners very well."

Charles Phillips,"We've been in the on-demand hosting business five years,"
Charles Phillips,"The good thing about standards is, almost anybody we buy has a similar architecture to what we're marching toward."
Charles Phillips,"The Oracle Fusion Architecture is a unifying model of emerging trends in grid computing architecture, service oriented architecture, and enterprise information architecture. While each trend is a study unto itself, the fact that these techniques can now be united into a single architecture is an exciting idea. It gives customers and partners a good view of the direction that Oracle is taking to make the most of our core strengths in database, middleware and business applications."
Charles Phillips,"We have defined Oracle Fusion architecture, certified all Oracle applications on our world-class Oracle Fusion middleware, which includes a set of mature tools that are being used to develop the Oracle Fusion applications."
Charles Phillips,"[Even more critical to Oracle's future, however, was Phillips's announcement of Oracle Fusion Architecture (OFA), the company's massive SOA, combining the flexibility of model-driven process design and service- and event-enabled applications with ease of integration from its open, standards-based, hot-pluggable platform, and the scalability inherent in Oracle's grid computing architecture.] In 1925 business consultant Frederick Taylor said, 'Business processes are work processes tucked away in manuals.' The same thing is true today, but with applications instead of manuals, ... The Oracle Fusion Architecture is a unifying model of emerging trends in grid computing architecture, service-oriented architecture, and enterprise information architecture. It gives customers and partners a good view of the direction that Oracle is taking to make the most of our core strengths in database, middleware, and business applications."

Charles Phillips,Because you remember Meredith was walking along the highway there and somebody shot him.
Charles Phillips,They didn't know anything about the candidates and things of that sort. So they needed guidance. And that league was very instrumental in directing the people in the direction to go.
Charles Phillips,"That's where their office was, at the time, and talked with the manager about hiring two black drivers. He said he didn't have any openings."
Charles Phillips,"I don't know how a fellow looks, when he meets somebody that he hasn't seen, hasn't heard of, don't know where they are, know nothing about the house, whatever."
Charles Phillips,"The Voters League was, because you'd get ballots printed and they would have the people's names on the ballot, who was favorable to our movement."
Charles Phillips,"Some teachers had been trained to work out at Southern because I carried two out there. I carried a lady down here from Palmer's Crossing, used to play piano, and Billy Carter."
Charles Phillips,We used to hold those secret meetings at her house.
Charles Phillips,"We went to Detroit. I wanted to see what was going on in some other parts of the world. You know, I was just traveling, like. I had a minister that lived here. He was in St. Louis and he said things was going so well and that it was such a wonderful place."

David Phillips,"We had across Canada the wettest year in the past 60 years that we've been measuring records right across the country, particularly in the summer. It was the wettest summer on record."
David Phillips,"What we're saying is from Vancouver to Thunder Bay, Ont., that western part of Canada is looking like it'll be warmer than normal, so it's a continuation of what the fall has been like."
David Phillips,"What we're saying is from Vancouver to Thunder Bay, Ont., that western part of Canada is looking like it'll be warmer than normal, so it's a continuation of what the fall has been like,"
David Phillips,"Never has Canada been so wet as it's been here this year, and particularly the summer. It was also the most expensive summer from an insurance point of view."
David Phillips,"It's our best guess at what we think the character and personality of the winter in Canada will be like. It's not saying whether it's going to be a white Christmas, or whether there's going to be a January thaw, or what voting day will be like weather-wise. It's none of that."
David Phillips,From southern British Columbia across the southern part of Canada - where most people live - it looks like a colder than normal December.
David Phillips,"As much as I like the Miss America tradition, it too is part of a bygone era. Reality TV shows have taken over, and Miss America is so old-fashioned."
David Phillips,Both Bush and Blair were prepared to move forward with military action without fully appreciating the level of difficulty they would face.
David Phillips,"We are very happy with how far he's come and his ability to be able to succeed as a wild whale,"
Doug Phillips,"We knew we had a running game, but you have to give those guys up front and [assistant] coach Dan Gull credit. We believe we can run the football."
Doug Phillips,"We take great pride, but that was an area we wanted to improve upon this year. Even though we've been winning football games, we were not happy with how we were giving up the runs."
Doug Phillips,The sale has allowed us to finance a massive renovation of the property.
Doug Phillips,"This win is for the other seniors who have worked hard for four years. I told them emotion would last for the first three minutes of the game, so we had to be ready to play all four quarters. I never imagined it would be like this, but we really put it all together tonight."
Doug Phillips,"We haven't had a defeat like that since my first year here, ... [Canfield's] defense is the best I've seen here."
Doug Phillips,We haven't had a defeat like that since my first year here. [Canfield's] defense is the best I've seen here.
Doug Phillips,This will mean less choices for us.
Doug Phillips,"We made a choice to center everything around Intelâ€”their name, support and everything they stand forâ€”and then they say we can't sell you boards anymore."
Kevin Phillips,It's a good idea to self-disclose as much as you can in advance and to share things they need to know about you. That is an explicit invitation for them to manage up.
Kevin Phillips,There are no rules. No supervision. Anything goes. And because of that nobody gets into a fight.
Kevin Phillips,That's an end of an era for us. We've relied on them (the vans) for the past 30 years for transportation. Now we'll rely on small school buses for our primary mode of transportation.
Kevin Phillips,"Those guys can drink like fish. Their rider for the show every night, they get two big bottles of Jack Daniels, a big bottle of vodka, a big bottle of tequila and four cases of beer. And then that's not including when they go to the bar and people buy them drinks; that's just what they have backstage for them every night."
Kevin Phillips,It's called 'The Stupidest Rock Tour of the Summer' for a reason. It's really crazy to see how anxious girls are to lick Don Vito's toes and do that kind of nasty stuff. The audience is crazier than these guys are most of the time.
Kevin Phillips,For us to pull that one out helps our guys confidence-wise. We needed that game.
Kevin Phillips,They've got a distinct advantage over a lot of teams with that inside game.
Wade Phillips,"People don't understand the subtle ways he helps our defense. We were fourth in the league in sacks last year. When we blitzed, we never had to worry about leaving Keith in single coverage, because he can cover just about anybody."
Wade Phillips,"You have to have speed in this defense, and I think we're quick enough, ... In this defense, you're more mobile. You've got one more guy who's going to run to the football. But you're not as physical up front and that's what you worry about."
Wade Phillips,"People don't understand the subtle ways he helps our defense, ... We were fourth in the league in sacks last year. When we blitzed, we never had to worry about leaving Keith in single coverage, because he can cover just about anybody."

Wendell Phillips,The best education in the world is that got by struggling to get a living.
Wendell Phillips,"Truth is one forever absolute, but opinion is truth filtered through the moods, the blood, the disposition of the spectator."
Wendell Phillips,We live under a government of men and morning newspapers.
Wendell Phillips,Governments exist to protect the rights of minorities. The loved and the rich need no protection: they have many friends and few enemies.

Wendell Phillips,Insurrection of thought always precedes insurrection of arms.
Wendell Phillips,"Seldom ever was any knowledge given to keep, but to impart; the grace of this rich jewel is lost in concealment."

Robert Phipps,We should win at least seven games. There were a couple close game we could have one.
Robert Phipps,This was a fluke. We're going to come out and have great games every week for the next eight games.
River Phoenix,"I did my best work in The Mosquito Coast. I know it wasn't such a big hit, but for me it was more meaningful than anything else I'd ever done."
River Phoenix,Biggest problem was I was terrible for commercials - I couldn't smile on cue.
River Phoenix,"Music is my main goal, but I'm not going to rush a record out. There are so many actors who have come out with albums these days. I don't want to do it because it's the thing to do. I want to wait until the time is right."
River Phoenix,"I told them I was tired of being in the magazines, and how they made it sound like I love them and want girls so badly to buy them. I'm also doing a photo shoot in a couple of weeks - good honest pictures. They're going to print these pictures anyway, so they might as well be pictures of what I'm really like."
River Phoenix,I don't need tightly exploitative. Suggesting that I would use this personal part of my life for a (expletive) movie ... it kind of makes me sick.
River Phoenix,"I like girls who are natural because I am natural in everything I do. If I meet a girl who is snobby and wants special treatment, she's not going to get it from me because she hasn't earned it. But I've been basically lucky because I've met mostly nice girls - and that's what attracts me."
River Phoenix,"When I was in first grade, everyone made fun of my name, of course. I think it's kind of a big name to hold up when you're nine years old. It seemed goofy. I used to tell people I wanted to change the world and they used to think, 'This kid's really weird'."
River Phoenix,"I'm really normal. I play football, go to the beach, drive. We have dogs. I can imagine people calling me a character, but I'm Joe Straight."

River Phoenix,Commercials were too phony for me. I just didn't like selling products I didn't believe in.

Mike Piazza,"I saw myself getting thrown out at second there if I didn't get on my horse. I'll tell you, it's a big ballpark."
Mike Piazza,"It's a break, ... And three of the four doctors I've seen said breaks generally take six to eight weeks to heal."
Mike Piazza,We're definitely not moving in the wrong direction.
Mike Piazza,"I'm not very mechanical about these decisions. I just think it was meant to be. (Padres general manager) Kevin (Towers), from the start, showed a lot of interest. He said, 'We'll be here if you're interested.' When it came down to it, they were the best situation, without question."
Mike Piazza,"Yes, hard is good. When I was in high school, I spent a lot of time on my knees playing with balls. I guess it was only natural that I became a catcher."
Mike Piazza,"I long for the days when athletes were revered. I want to see the romance return to sports, to see people enjoy the game purely for the game and the players."
Mike Piazza,I have gone from a player who thought he would spend his whole career with one organization to a player who's been with three organizations in a week. It's like rotisserie baseball.

Mike Piazza,Never let your dreams go away.
Mike Piazza,Please don't quote me.
Mike Piazza,"I feel pretty good. My body actually looks like an old banana, but it's fine."

Pablo Picasso,"My mother said to me, If you are a soldier, you will become a general. If you are a monk, you will become the Pope. Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso."
Pablo Picasso,"You mustn't always believe what I say. Questions tempt you to tell lies, particularly when there is no answer."
Pablo Picasso,"Inspiration exists, but it has to find us working."
Pablo Picasso,"My mother said to me, ''If you become a soldier, you'll be a general; if you become a monk you'll end up as the pope.''

Pablo Picasso,It is personality with a penny's worth of talent. Error which chances to rise above the commonplace.

Pablo Picasso,The genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima.
Pablo Picasso,I who have been involved with all styles of painting can assure you that the only things that fluctuate are the waves of fashion which carry the snobs and speculators; the number of true connoisseurs remains more or less the same.
Pablo Picasso,"Now there is fame! Of all -- hunger, misery, the incomprehension by the public -- fame is by far the worst. It is the castigation of God by the artist. It is sad. It is true."
Pablo Picasso,"Now there is fame! Of all / hunger, misery, the incomprehension by the public / fame is by far the worst. It is the castigation of God by the artist. It is sad. It is true."
Pablo Picasso,To draw you must close your eyes and sing.
Pablo Picasso,I do not seek. I find.
Pablo Picasso,"If everybody is looking for it, then nobody is finding it. If we were cultured, we would not be conscious of lacking culture. We would regard it as something natural and would not make so much fuss about it. And if we knew the real value of this word we would be cultured enough not to give it so much importance."
Pablo Picasso,The chief enemy of creativity is good sense.
Pablo Picasso,"Each second we live is a new and unique moment of the universe, a moment that will never be again. And what do we teach our children? We teach them that two and two make four, and that Paris is the capital of France. When will we also teach them what they are? We should say to each of them: Do you know what you are? You are a marvel. You are unique. In all the years that have passed, there has never been another child like you. Your legs, your arms, your clever fingers, the way you move. You may become a Shakespeare, a Michelangelo, a Beethoven. You have the capacity for anything. Yes, you are a marvel. And when you grow up, can you then harm another who is, like you, a marvel? You must work, we must all work, to make the world worthy of its children."
Pablo Picasso,You can't run a business without taking risks.
Pablo Picasso,"When I was a child, my mother said to me, 'If you become a soldier, you'll be a general. If you become a monk you'll end up as the pope.' Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso."
Pablo Picasso,"He can who thinks he can, and he can't who thinks he can't. This is an inexorable, indisputable law."
Pablo Picasso,The older you get the stronger the wind gets - and it's always in your face.
Pablo Picasso,"One starts to get young at sixty, and then it's too late"

Pablo Picasso,"We don't grow older, we grow riper"
Pablo Picasso,Youth has no age.
Pablo Picasso,"I am always doing things I can't do, that's how I get to do them."
Pablo Picasso,"Accidents, try to change them -- it's impossible. The accidental reveals man."
Pablo Picasso,I don't believe in accidents. There are only encounters in history. There are no accidents.
Pablo Picasso,Work is a necessity for man. Man invented the alarm clock.
Pablo Picasso,It is your work in life that is the ultimate seduction.
Pablo Picasso,Action is the foundational key to all success.
Pablo Picasso,I'd like to live as a poor man with lots of money.
Pablo Picasso,"I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them."
Pablo Picasso,The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls.
Pablo Picasso,"The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider's web."
Pablo Picasso,"Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun."
Pablo Picasso,Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.
Pablo Picasso,It takes a long time to become young.
Mary Pickford,"Make them laugh, make them cry, and hack to laughter. What do people go to the theatre for? An emotional exercise. . . . I am a servant of the people. I have never forgotten that."
Mary Pickford,"There is always another chance... This thing called 'failure' is not falling down, but staying down."
Mary Pickford,"Supposing you have tried and failed again and again. You may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing that we call Failure is not the falling down, but the staying down."

Jodi Picoult,The truth is the truth.
Jodi Picoult,"It was a little like a scar on a polished wooden table--you'd try to see the rest of the gleaming surface, but your eyes and your fingers would be drawn to the pitted part, the one thing that kept it from being perfect."
Jodi Picoult,Could you really love someone who was capable of falling in love with someone else?
Jodi Picoult,"In the wake of a disaster, the last thing you needed to do was set off another bomb; instead, you walked through the rubble and told yourself that it wasn't nearly as bad as it looked."
Bobby Pierce,"We're trying to get another bat or two going. We're trying to solidify things and this early, it doesn't exactly have to be fully solidified, but we're not as far as I'd like to be."
Bobby Pierce,"The walks and hit batsmen continued to keep him in trouble. He was not as sharp as he has been in his first two games, but he didn't throw that bad. You can't put it all on him."
Bobby Pierce,"Joe didn't have very good stuff tonight, and that is not terribly unusual in a second start. After making a strong start last week, I thought he looked a little tired and you have to be able to battle through that."
Bobby Pierce,"I don't know whether to be happy or sad. This was an ugly, ugly game. The positive is that we continued to hit the ball well, but we didn't play very good defense, and we didn't pitch very well early in the game."
Bobby Pierce,"Very few times do you get to get as many people quality at-bats in a game situation as we have gotten in the last two days. The negatives are you don't want your team to play a sloppy side of baseball and take things for granted, and we've done that as well."
Bobby Pierce,You don't want them to be around a bunch of people because then you'll have a whole team infected. But they should be all right.
Bobby Pierce,"That takes someone from being a young man to being a man. The guys who I've had that have had a kid or been married or both have handled it well, and Ben seems to be doing the same thing."
Bobby Pierce,"I thought it was very special. I talked to his wife, mother-in-law and see the baby. I thought it was great and Ben had a good day and kept his streak alive. All and all, it was a very good day for us."
Bobby Pierce,"We got ourselves into some trouble early in the game, but once again these kids showed that they never give up. We have had several of these kinds of games over the last couple of weeks, and this team believes it is going to win every time."
Bobby Pierce,He's a guy that knows the strike zone well. We'll be giving him more opportunities.
Bobby Pierce,"It is a game of inches, but we just couldn't get one to go our way tonight. Still, I am proud of our group. They played hard tonight and showed that they are learning how to compete."
Bobby Pierce,I hope they enjoyed our baseball team. We had a very nice clinic for young kids that went well. It was a good day for our program and a good day hopefully for the city of Ozark.
Bobby Pierce,"We had a couple of balls where if they get down early instead of being caught, it's a different game. We've got to find a way to get some runs early and get momentum back on our side."
David Pierce,I probably was as bad as a security guard as I was as a tie salesman.
David Pierce,"In sitcom school they tell you how great it is to have a long-running show, but they don't tell you how hard it is to say goodbye."
David Pierce,I went and took golf lessons so Dad would let me play with him. I was just terrible... but I was able to have a wonderful time just walking around with Dad. I can see the real pleasure of that game.
David Pierce,"Sometimes in the most tragic situation, something just profoundly funny happens."
David Pierce,"Kelsey Grammer is wickedly funny. He's like an 8-year-old child. He's always doing pranks, and we have a great time."
David Pierce,"We can't control what the ratings will be. It's like, if you're going to go skiing, do you hope you'll have a good day of skiing? Yes. Do you hope you won't break your leg? Yes."
John Pierce,I could define the last 5 years of my life with one word. Scared....Scared of not being great.
John Pierce,It's the most important exhibit in the Oregon Historical Society's 107-year history.
John Pierce,"Even as early as the 1920s, the president's family was coming to Walter Reed."
John Pierce,"What I've seen is that we're ill equipped sometimes and not prepared to deal with it (at other events). Our rational (for breath tests) at school dances should be the same rational to have it available at other activities,"
John Pierce,"After growing wildly for years, the field of computing appears to be reaching its infancy."
John Pierce,"We definitely have not discounted any suspicious circumstances at this stage,"
Mary Pierce,"The key the ball was hitting the ball hard and deep, staying aggressive and trying to come forward."
Mary Pierce,"I didn't try and hit her on purpose. Sometimes that happens in tennis, but it was not my goal."
Mary Pierce,I had some problems at first but I felt better in the second set.
Mary Pierce,"I just did everything in my power the best that I could today, and it wasn't meant to be, ... She was very motivated out there today. I could see it. She wanted it. She definitely played better today than a couple days ago when I beat her."
Mary Pierce,I'm really disappointed because I've been playing really well. I was looking forward to continuing my performance of last week into this week as well.
Mary Pierce,"I think in the past it was just kind of difficult for me to just play my best in this environment, ... I feel that the difference this year for me is the experience and maturing and learning to deal with things in a different way and knowing myself better."
Mary Pierce,"I was really playing well, not making too many mistakes, ... I was really pleased with my first set."
Mary Pierce,"It was pretty crazy, ... She made a lot of mistakes. I was surprised how I won the first set quickly. I just kept fighting and hanging in there. It is never over until it's over."
Mary Pierce,I made mistakes on those match points but it's like that at times.
Mary Pierce,"Her serves weren't as fast, ... It can be difficult playing against somebody who is hurt."
Mary Pierce,"The hard work is definitely paying off, that's for sure, ... I have said before that last year I wasn't sure if I would play again and after much thought, decided I had more to do in tennis and really this year has just been amazing...This tournament was not on my original schedule for this year, but I saw last month that I might qualify for the WTA Tour Championships, so decided to stay in Europe and play the big events to try to get my points up."
Mary Pierce,"I was happy with the way I started out the match, ... I was really playing well. I knew what I needed to do against her. She's a dangerous player if you let her play. The key for me today was hitting the ball hard, being aggressive, hitting it deep."
Mary Pierce,"I'm just feeling so great, ... It's pretty special, it's pretty neat. I feel God has blessed me with this gift."
Mary Pierce,"Once you get to the top of the game, there are tons of girls now that can play really great tennis. We've got at least 10 that can win a tournament any week. So when you come down to it, it's more the mental part of the game and being able to deal with the little things that make the big difference."
Mary Pierce,"She made me play bad, I guess you could say, because she is far quicker than all the other girls that I've played so far. She got another ball back every time."
Mary Pierce,"She made me play bad. She was quicker than all the other girls I played so far. She would hit another ball back, and I would make a mistake."
Mary Pierce,"I think I had some troubles in the past just because (we) were friends, Fed Cup team-mates, just know each other so well, spend so much time together,"
Mary Pierce,The third set was a battle. I kept fighting and hanging in there.
Mary Pierce,"I'm ready to play but it's the captain's choice. If he feels another player can do a better job, fine."
Mary Pierce,"Its super to play with Martina, and she has huge amounts of talent. We have a lot of fun."
Mary Pierce,"My life off the court has changed. I'm feeling good inside, so I guess it shows on the outside too."
Mary Pierce,"I am the same as I always will be. I'm French and I'm American. I was born in Canada. I love living in America, and I love playing the French Open in front of my French people, who support me."
Mary Pierce,"She has done so well this week and had great success, so it wasn't easy, ... In the beginning she played really well. I didn't play great tennis but I had some good shots and it was important for me to play smart,"
Mary Pierce,"I had hard time adjusting to this surface. I was not confident enough at the beginning of the match but after I got up 4-1 [in the second set], I felt more comfortable... I tried to make her run a lot to make her tired and that tactic seemed to work."
Mary Pierce,"I could not concentrate on the match in the beginning, but at 4-all I calmed down and adjusted myself to a specific surface here and realized how to play,"
Mary Pierce,"I just played unbelievably well at the beginning, even my shanks were going in,"
Mary Pierce,"I was playing unbelievable in the beginning, even my shanks were going in,"
Paul Pierce,"I guess the league is trying to clean up the image. They've done surveys . . . and they say that we're behind baseball and football and the rest of the sports. But also we're one of the most visible sports in all of sports, so we get more notoriety. Our faces are shown. . . . We're just in tank tops and shorts. We're more visible. That's probably why we get that type of [negative] perception."
Paul Pierce,"You could tell this is a team that's ready to get the season over. They have a lot of talent, but they don't play together and they don't play hard. Mentally, those guys are ready for summer. They realize they have nothing to play for. Once you get a lead on them, they lose confidence. When you get a big lead, you feel you've got them."
Paul Pierce,"The kid had a lot of hype coming out of high school, and nobody understands the type of pressure that is at such a young age. It's amazing that he can handle the type of pressure that's been put on him since such a young age, and he's been doing it well."
Paul Pierce,We might have to cancel practice next year.
Paul Pierce,"That's in the past, and that's where it's staying."
Paul Pierce,One cool thing about mathematics is they (the audience) don't have to be able to understand math to see the passion that makes it so exciting to them.
Paul Pierce,"Well, he didn't give me a yes or a no. I just told him that it would be an honor, and that I'm interested."
Paul Pierce,"I think it was just one of those nights. Mama always said 'you're going to have games like this.' I just have to swallow it, brush it off and move on."
Paul Pierce,Two heartbreaking games (in a row).
Paul Pierce,"This was a much-needed one, ... Regardless of how we got it. We haven't played well the last five games."
Paul Pierce,"If we play like this for the rest of the year, we're going to win a lot of games."
Paul Pierce,"I'm just going out playing the way I know how to play. We're just having fun, staying positive. We feel like we can win each game. We turned it around ever since we gained a lot of confidence out west and I think it's starting to carry over."
Paul Pierce,"Its one of the greatest individual performances I've ever seen. I think he's done enough, in my eyes, to be on it."
Paul Pierce,"I think we played with a lot more energy,"
Paul Pierce,"When I saw the part about chains, hip-hop and throwback jerseys, I think that's part of our culture. The NBA is young black males."
Paul Pierce,"When I saw the part about chains, hip-hop and throwback jerseys, I think that's part of our culture, ... The NBA is young black males."
Paul Pierce,It's definitely a tough one to swallow. We were in control for most of the game.
Paul Pierce,"We're playing against a struggling team. They have a lack of confidence. I'm not going to take anything away from our team, but I felt like this is a game we're supposed to win."
Paul Pierce,This is one of the handful of musicals that our audience -- I know you'll be shocked and surprised to hear -- really loves.
Paul Pierce,The game isn't over till the clock says zero.
Paul Pierce,"Once people start making comparisons to a player of the past, they want you to be that player. I try to go out there and create my own image, my own style, my own type of game. Right now I can't even think of one guy I've been compared to."
Paul Pierce,I like the Raiders. That's my favorite team.
Paul Pierce,"At the beginning of the season, I set my goal to see if I can lead the league in scoring, because I feel I have that kind of ability. A lot of guys say it, but it's not really in their grasp. I feel that's really in my grasp."
Paul Pierce,The rim is looking bigger and bigger every game.
Paul Pierce,He has the ability. He has a great feel for the game. I just think it was a matter of him getting the experience.
Steve Pierce,"With a bit of humor, we're able to convey just how quick the commute to downtown is, and since many of our buyers work inside the Loop and are moving from neighborhoods inside the Loop, it's important to make that point."
Steve Pierce,"It raises questions about our culture. Sometimes things are percolating through our lives and it's hard to make sense of them. Because it's not an event, it is something that happens culturally."
Steve Pierce,"Use the emergency call button, sit back and relax and wait for rescue. That's the advice. Don't try to get out of it."
A.J. Pierzynski,I was trying to get a cheapie. It went foul. ... I was actually kind of mad at myself because it would have been an easy run for us. But it worked out.
A.J. Pierzynski,"I felt it, but I couldn't really hear it. The only people who knew it hit me were me and Steve. ... It was a lucky break, what can you say?"
A.J. Pierzynski,"We don't like to see people say stuff in the newspaper, but he didn't say anything bad about me. So good luck to Carl."
A.J. Pierzynski,You read stuff and see stuff where people are calling me (names) and that I was trying to cheat and this and that. I don't know what I did to deserve that.
A.J. Pierzynski,Do we feel lucky? No. Did they feel lucky when they won last night?
A.J. Pierzynski,I signed so many of those pictures. Somebody made a lot of money off that photo. I know that. It's good. It helped us win. That's the biggest thing.
A.J. Pierzynski,That's where you have to rely on spring training. You have to be open to learning about the guys. You respect them and hope they respect you and what you do. But it's hard. It's a lot of work.
A.J. Pierzynski,"They going to honor us in Kansas City and Detroit, too?"
A.J. Pierzynski,"We couldn't go down 0-2 playing at home. We haven't had a lot of success on the West Coast, so we've got to find a way to win some games."
A.J. Pierzynski,It kind of broke my heart.
A.J. Pierzynski,"He's a great pitcher. He's a Hall of Fame pitcher. But he's got to throw the ball over the plate and we have to try to hit it. If he makes a mistake, we have to hit it, not miss it. We have to find a way to get deep into the game and get deep into the pitch count and get him out. It's not going to be an easy task."
A.J. Pierzynski,We're built on pitching and defense and hitting here and there.
Albert Pike,"He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimmer, who struggles against a rapid current, in a river lashed into angry waves by the wind. Often they roar over his head, often they beat him back and baffle him. Most men yield to the stress of the current. Only here and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on towards ultimate success."
Albert Pike,"The Universe should be deemed an immense Being, always living, always moved and always moving in an eternal activity inherent in itself, and which, subordinate to no foreign cause, is communicated to all its parts, connects them together, and makes the world of things a complete and perfect whole."
Albert Pike,"The double law of attraction and radiation or of sympathy and antipathy, of fixedness and movement, which is the principle of Creation, and the perpetual cause of life."
Albert Pike,"True thoughts have duration in themselves. If the thoughts endure, the seed is enduring; if the seed endures, the energy endures; if the energy endures, then will the spirit endure. The spirit is thought; thought is the heart; the heart is the fire; the fire is the Elixir."
Albert Pike,"Philosophy is a kind of journey, ever learning yet never arriving at the ideal perfection of truth."
Albert Pike,The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but very different are the aspects which it bears to them.
Albert Pike,Will is the dynamic soul-force.
Albert Pike,"To work with the hands or brain, according to our requirements and our capacities, to do that which lies before us to do, is more honorable than rank and title."
Albert Pike,"We have all the light we need, we just need to put it in practice."
Albert Pike,"The universal medicine for the Soul is the Supreme Reason and Absolute Justice; for the mind, mathematical and practical Truth; for the body, the Quintessence, a combination of light and gold."
Albert Pike,"Doubt, the essential preliminary of all improvement and discovery, must accompany the stages of man's onward progress. The faculty of doubting and questioning, without which those of comparison and judgment would be useless, is itself a divine prerogative of the reason."
Albert Pike,"A man should live with his superiors as he does with his fire: not too near, lest he burn; nor too far off, lest he freeze."
Albert Pike,One man is equivalent to all Creation. One man is a World in miniature.

Albert Pike,Faith begins where Reason sinks exhausted.
Albert Pike,"Almost all the noblest things that have been achieved in the world, have been achieved by poor men; poor scholars, poor professional men, poor artisans and artists, poor philosophers, poets, and men of genius."
Albert Pike,"That which causes us trials shall yield us triumph: and that which make our hearts ache shall fill us with gladness. The only true happiness is to learn, to advance, and to improve: which could not happen unless we had commence with error, ignorance, and imperfection. We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light."
Albert Pike,What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.

Neal Pilson,"They're a very unique property. The Masters understands that the revenue potential is limited by reasons of their decisions, and they've never negotiated the rights fees they might otherwise be entitled to."
Neal Pilson,"They're a very unique property, ... The Masters understands that the revenue potential is limited by reasons of their decisions, and they've never negotiated the rights fees they might otherwise be entitled to."
Neal Pilson,"Golf ratings are up with or without Tiger. Nobody's going to argue the point that he impacts ratings. At the same time, golf is a highly profitable, highly successful sport. This isn't a doomsday scenario for golf."
Neal Pilson,"This is a watershed event. There have been a lot of events available on a subscription basis, priced modestly, but this is the first time that a significant national event ? which is also covered on television ? is being made available free, with the revenue stream coming from advertisers."
Neal Pilson,The consumer is going to have a lot more choices on what to watch or listen to and when.
Neal Pilson,The most remarkable thing that has happened in our business in the last few years has been the increasing number of available platforms for the distribution of the conventional picture.
Neal Pilson,"I have it on reasonable authority: Disney is looking at a possible shift of Monday Night Football to ESPN, ... I don't know if it will happen. But financially, Monday Night Football has been extremely difficult for ABC."
Neal Pilson,The leagues that can deliver audiences will thrive. Sports leagues will continue to go and franchise values will continue to grow.

Pindar Pindar,Whatever is beautiful is beautiful by necessity.
Pindar Pindar,The days that are still to come are the wisest witnesses.
Pindar Pindar,Not every truth is the better for showing its face undisguised; and often silence is the wisest thing for a man to heed.

Lou Piniella,"I had a front-row seat for this. Yes, there were some words exchanged, but I certainly didn't see any bumping or brimming or spraying."
Lou Piniella,"I had a front-row seat for this. Yes, there were swear words exchanged, but I certainly didn't see any bumping or brimming or spraying."
Lou Piniella,"I had a front-view seat of this. And yeah, there were some words exchanged. But I certainly didn't see any bumping or cap brimming or spraying. ... I think I had a better view than anybody. I was right there."
Lou Piniella,We hit some balls hard. We just got blown out there in the seventh inning. They've got some talent over there. A good young ballclub. They're right in the hunt for the postseason.
Lou Piniella,"I'm not going to take responsibility for this, ... If I had been given a $40 million or $45 million payroll, I'd stand up like a man and say it's my fault. Well, I'm not going to do it. So if you want answers about what's going on here, you call the new ownership group and let them give them to you."
Lou Piniella,"I think he's pitching with a little more purpose,"
Lou Piniella,"At the same time, it'll give me time to go home and relax, fish and play some golf. I'm tired. I need some time off. It'll give me a chance to do those things, and at the same time to evaluate and look at situations that might arise about my future."
Lou Piniella,"He's an intelligent guy. He's very good with mechanics. He's particularly good with putting together game plans on how to pitch the opposition -- utilizing his pitchers' strengths more than opposing hitters' weaknesses, which is a good way to go about it."
Lou Piniella,I might be doing this next year. It's not for sure - nothing's for sure. I like it. I'm enjoying this.
Lou Piniella,"[Gomes] put up 20 in a half-season, pretty impressive, ... He's got some energy. He's an energy player."
Lou Piniella,"[That's what makes this season so important in Tampa Bay. The Devil Rays need to start strong and hope for a boost in attendance from the league-low 13,070 average of last season. They need the extra revenue to chase after quality pitching next winter.] This year we divided our [free-agent] spending among a lot of low-cost players, ... Next year we hope to be able to take a little more money and maybe try to sign two or three players who could really help us immediately."
Lou Piniella,"It demonstrates commitment from ownership and it should send a clear message to our young players that if you go out and play hard and do the job you will be rewarded. It gives Carl security, and at the same time it gives the organization another key young player to build with."
Lou Piniella,A pitching coach is a manager's best friend. He's handling 12 out of the 25 players on the team.
Lou Piniella,These kids are playing hustling baseball.
Lou Piniella,"They don't realize how tired you get during a baseball season ... mentally tired, ... You need time to unwind."
Lou Piniella,"The interviews can be a little distracting, ... But they go by quickly. The important thing is you're pleasing the audience. And I'd rather do interviews than just have microphones around. During the action, things come out that can be embarrassing."
Lou Piniella,It tells you that the team has come of age a little bit. We're playing hard and we're making some things happen. And these kids are gaining good experience. That's really what it tells you.
Gary Pinkel,"We're so proud of our team. We're constantly talking about what it takes to win a game in the fourth quarter in terms of toughness, focus and perseverance."
Gary Pinkel,"Usually my players do a pretty good job of that. I think (New Mexico) is a very good football team. Just look at what they've accomplished in the past. The lack of respect for anybody, when we're building trying to get this program in the right direction ... We don't want to be irresponsible."
Gary Pinkel,You've got to be able to do things in order to get respect. You've got to be a good football player. That was first. And then he's got such great leadership qualities that that always just took care of itself.
Gary Pinkel,"They got the option going, and we were scrambling with that a little bit, then they play-action a little bit and come down with the ball. That's good play-calling and some good execution on their part."
Gary Pinkel,There's a lot of great enthusiasm in this team and I felt like that's something that's carried over since the bowl game.
Gary Pinkel,"I don't ever discuss the discipline things, although I'm very consistent with what I do."
Gary Pinkel,"I coach my coaches, and I feel very good about my staff. I think it's really easy to sit there and change coaches. To show people that, 'Hey, he's making a change and he's doing this and that.' But I won't do that. I'll do it if it's the right thing to do. I'll do it in a heartbeat if it's the right thing to do."
Gary Pinkel,"He's a lot bigger than what he was when he got here, believe it or not."
Steven Pinker,My laptop has freed me to travel.
Steven Pinker,All of us have a theory about human nature.
Steven Pinker,"I think that there is a quasi-religious theory of human nature that is prevalent among pundits and intellectuals, which includes both empirical assumptions about how the mind works and a set of values that people hang on those assumptions."
Steven Pinker,We may be seeing a coming together of the humanities and the science of human nature.
Steven Pinker,"The three-year-old, then, is a grammatical genius - master of most constructions, obeying rules farmore often than flouting them, respecting language universals, erring in sensible, adultlike ways, and avoiding many kinds of errors altogether."
Steven Pinker,Even if he does occasionally hurt people's feelings -- he occasionally hurts my feelings -- but I'm a big boy. I can get over it. I can argue back. We really need somebody to question the way a university is run.
Steven Pinker,"To make changes you have to make some enemies, but you also have to be careful not too make too many enemies. He made far too many enemies."
Steven Pinker,Evolutionary psychology is one of four sciences that are bringing human nature back into the picture.
Steven Pinker,"My opinions about human nature are shared by many psychologists, linguists, and biologists, not to mention philosophers and scholars going back centuries."
Steven Pinker,"There has to be innate circuitry that does the learning, that creates the culture, that acquires the culture, and that responds to socialization."
Steven Pinker,"One of them is a simple logical point that no matter how important learning and culture and socialization are, they don't happen by magic."
Steven Pinker,"Parents provide their children with genes as well as an environment, so the fact that talkative parents have kids with good language skills could simply mean that and that the same genes that make parents talkative make children articulate."
Steven Pinker,"Evolutionary psychology is taking that mindset and applying it to more emotionally charged aspects of behavior, such as sexuality, violence, beauty, and family feelings."
Steven Pinker,"There's no reason that we should give up that lever on people's behavior - namely, the inhibition systems of the brain - just because we're coming to understand more about the temptation systems."
Steven Pinker,Today there are movements in the arts to reintroduce beauty and narrative and melody and other basic human pleasures. And they are considered radical extremists!
Harold Pinter,"restored theater to its basic elements: an enclosed space and unpredictable dialogue, where people are at the mercy of each other and pretense crumbles."
Harold Pinter,"The past is what you remember, imagine you remember, convince yourself you remember, or pretend you remember"
Harold Pinter,It's a scintillating stratagem. Language is actually employed to keep thought at bay. The words 'the American people' provide a truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance. You don't need to think. Just lie back on the cushion. The cushion may be suffocating your intelligence and your critical faculties but it's very comfortable.
Harold Pinter,"As far as I'm concerned, 'The Caretaker' is funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it was because of that point that I wrote it."
Harold Pinter,"While The United States is the most powerful nation the world has ever seen, it is also the most detested nation that the world has ever known."
Harold Pinter,"This particular nurse said, Cancer cells are those which have forgotten how to die. I was so struck by this statement."
Harold Pinter,"There is a movement to get an international criminal court in the world, voted for by hundreds of states-but with the noticeable absence of the United States of America."
Harold Pinter,There are some good rules and there are some lousy rules.
Harold Pinter,"There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal, nor between what is true and what is false. A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false."
Harold Pinter,"The Room I wrote in 1957, and I was really gratified to find that it stood up. I didn't have to change a word."
Harold Pinter,"The past is what you remember, imagine you remember, convince yourself you remember, or pretend you remember."
Harold Pinter,The Companion of Honour I regarded as an award from the country for 50 years of work - which I thought was okay.
Harold Pinter,One is and is not in the centre of the maelstrom of it all.
Harold Pinter,"Occasionally it does hit me, the words on a page. And I still love doing that, as I have for the last 60 years."
Harold Pinter,"My second play, The Birthday Party, I wrote in 1958 - or 1957. It was totally destroyed by the critics of the day, who called it an absolute load of rubbish."
Harold Pinter,"Most of the press is in league with government, or with the status quo."
Harold Pinter,"It's so easy for propaganda to work, and dissent to be mocked."
Harold Pinter,"It was difficult being a conscientious objector in the 1940's, but I felt I had to stick to my guns."
Harold Pinter,"If Milosevic is to be tried, he has to be tried by a proper court, an impartial, properly constituted court which has international respect."
Harold Pinter,I think it is the responsibility of a citizen of any country to say what he thinks.
Harold Pinter,I ought not to speak about the dead because the dead are all over the place.
Harold Pinter,I never think of myself as wise. I think of myself as possessing a critical intelligence which I intend to allow to operate.
Harold Pinter,"I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn't possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There's a relationship to government about knights."
Harold Pinter,I don't think there's been any writer like Samuel Beckett. He's unique. He was a most charming man and I used to send him my plays.
Harold Pinter,I believe an international criminal court is very much to be desired.
Harold Pinter,"Clinton's hands remain incredibly clean, don't they, and Tony Blair's smile remains as wide as ever. I view these guises with profound contempt."
Harold Pinter,All that happens is that the destruction of human beings - unless they're Americans - is called collateral damage.
Harold Pinter,A short piece of work means as much to me as a long piece of work.
Harold Pinter,I also found being called Sir rather silly.
Harold Pinter,One's life has many compartments.
Harold Pinter,"Beckett had an unerring light on things, which I much appreciated."
Harold Pinter,"I mean, don't forget the earth's about five thousand million years old, at least. Who can afford to live in the past?"
Harold Pinter,One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness.
Harold Pinter,"Good writing excites me, and makes life worth living."
Harold Pinter,"The crimes of the U.S. throughout the world have been systematic, constant, clinical, remorseless, and fully documented but nobody talks about them."
Harold Pinter,"Apart from the known and the unknown, what else is there?"
Harold Pinter,"No matter how you look at it, all the emotions connected with love are not really immortal; like all other passions in life, they are bound to fade at some point. The trick is to convert love into some lasting friendship that overcomes the fading passion."
Harold Pinter,"I feel even more strongly now than I ever did about the mendacity and the corruption and the injustice of so many of the actions taken by what are called freedom-loving Western democracies,"
Harold Pinter,Iraq is just a symbol of the attitude of western democracies to the rest of the world.
Harold Pinter,An arbitrary military action inspired by a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public.
Peter Piot,"The reality is that the AIDS epidemic continues to outstrip the global and national efforts to contain it,"
Peter Piot,"The global response to AIDS has gained real momentum in the past decade, so much so that for the first time we can hope to get ahead of the epidemic."
Peter Piot,"We are on very thin ice here. AIDS has made a mess of Africa's health care systems, and none of the factors that created the AIDS disaster have gone away. But with bird flu, we could be looking at things getting worse in a matter of months, not decades."
Peter Piot,"AIDS continues to tear apart families and communities, leaving behind 15 million orphans and robbing countries of their future."
Peter Piot,We are facing here a crisis that is unprecedented.
George Pipas,"Our main contention here is that we do expect sales to fall off from these levels that are obviously quite high, and I think it's fair to say you can't maintain a sales rate which for the industry we estimate is going to be a at or near record levels, ... If you analyze this from a macro view, it's clear there is going to be payback from this program in the year ahead."
George Pipas,"Anytime you go from higher sales rates to lower sales rates, you're going to have to make some inventory adjustments, ... And it's clear there's more capacity being aimed at most profitable market in the world -- the North American light truck market. But you could see this coming a mile away. I think we are well positioned."
George Pipas,"I think what has to happen to impact sales is consumers have to come to believe that it (high gas prices) are permanent, not transitory, ... Buying a vehicle is a long-term commitment -- it's not easy to get out of it tomorrow. Gas prices have spiked in some regions in recent years and we haven't seen any significant impact on sales."
George Pipas,We expect sales in September to be lower than what we saw in August.
George Pipas,"sales declines, this year at least, in the traditional S.U.V. segment are becoming the norm, and we expect that to continue to be the case in the near future."
George Pipas,Sales in the short term are going to be more governed by the general economic landscape than currency exchange rates or consumer confidence measures. I'm not even sure 'moderate growth' describes the current economic expansion. Tepid is more like it.
George Pipas,"We weren't disappointed on overall sales, but cars did better and trucks didn't do as well as we thought. I think it's more fuel than anything. When you see these very rapid run ups, people get a little cautious."
George Pipas,"Anytime you go from higher sales rates to lower sales rates, you're going to have to make some inventory adjustments. And it's clear there's more capacity being aimed at most profitable market in the world -- the North American light truck market. But you could see this coming a mile away. I think we are well positioned."
George Pipas,"All our fleet sales are profitable, though daily-rental are the least so. What is Wall Street suggesting, that we stop selling to Hertz, Avis and Alamo? They're customers, and they're not going to fold their tents and go away."
George Pipas,"In many ways, it's running counter to the way the market is taking us."
George Pipas,"We have some owner concerns, more than we want. It became a big enough issue on Power Strokes, we came out with the incentives. We want to keep these owners with Ford."
George Pipas,I think these cars have yet to reach their full potential even at (that) level.
George Pipas,We're convinced this is the right thing to do from a long-term perspective but the withdrawal of this in some months is sometimes painful.
George Pipas,The real story is the improvement in revenue and product mix.
George Pipas,October wasn't a very good month for anybody. It was pretty much weak from the start and showed little improvement as the weeks progressed.
George Pipas,"While February was not a gold medal month, I think we definitely got back on the medals stand due to better-than-expected retail sales."
George Pipas,I would say that February sales are fairly close to our expectation.
George Pipas,"I think the outlook is very cloudy, ... It's difficult for anyone to assess what the impacts of these events, particularly when we were confronted with an economy in a pretty fragile condition."
George Pipas,"We are going to probably produce more cars and trucks in the first quarter than we had planned to before we saw the impact of the zero-percent financing program,"
George Pipas,"I feel good about our prospects, given the cars and crossovers in our lineup."
George Pipas,"Whatever level of incentives you start out at the beginning of model year, it rarely gets less expensive; it generally gets more expensive."
George Pipas,This is the golden age of the consumer. They want more for less and they're getting it.
Scottie Pippen,I wouldn't want to face the Bulls in the playoffs. They could be trouble.
Scottie Pippen,"It [would have] been very difficult. As I said, the rules ... but if the rules were put in place back when Michael Jordan was in his prime -- no hand-checking, the game was more geared toward offense, wanting to promote scoring in the game -- he could have probably got close. He did score 69."
Scottie Pippen,It's hard to put it in perspective right now. I'm starting to feel a little emotional about what's going to happen Friday night. Getting your number put in the rafters is always something that as a kid ... you dream of seeing happen to you.
Scottie Pippen,"I visualize the game. I think about who I am guarding, the things he likes to do."
Scottie Pippen,I've always led by example and I'm not that vocal.
Scottie Pippen,"Davis will give us some toughness inside and Williams has a lot of energy and enthusiasm, ... We got veteran guys who know how to play the game. I think it should make us better."
Luigi Pirandello,"Woman -- for example, look at her case! She turns tantalizing inviting glances on you. You seize her. No sooner does she feel herself in your grasp than she closes her eyes. It is a sign of her mission, the sign by which she says to man: ''Blind yourself, for I am blind.''"
Luigi Pirandello,Our whole knowledge of the world hangs on this very slender thread: the re-gu-la-ri-ty of our experiences
Luigi Pirandello,"Whatever is a reality today, whatever you touch and believe in and that seems real for you today, is going to be - like the reality of yesterday - an illusion tomorrow."
Luigi Pirandello,"It is misery, you know, unspeakable misery for the man who lives alone and who detests sordid, casual affairs; not old enough to do without women, but not young enough to be able to go and look for one without shame!"
Luigi Pirandello,"You too must not count too much on your reality as you feel it today, since like yesterday, it may prove an illusion for you tomorrow."
Luigi Pirandello,"I would love to spend all my time writing to you; I'd love to share with you all that goes through my mind, all that weighs on my heart, all that gives air to my soul; phantoms of art, dreams that would be so beautiful if they could come true."
Luigi Pirandello,The history of mankind is the history of ideas.
Luigi Pirandello,"When you say you are in love with humanity, you are well satisfied with yourself."
Luigi Pirandello,Women are like dreams - they are never the way you would like to have them
Luigi Pirandello,Nature uses human imagination to lift her work of creation to even higher levels.
Luigi Pirandello,In bed my real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream.
Luigi Pirandello,"Life is full of infinite absurdities, which, strangely enough, do not even need to appear plausible, since they are true"
Luigi Pirandello,"Drama is action, sir, action and not confounded philosophy."
Luigi Pirandello,"When the characters are really alive before their author, the latter does nothing but follow them in their action, in their words, in the situations which they suggest to him."

Jeanine Pirro,It only carries as much weight as his own prestige. ... Other chairmen have their own opinions.
Jeanine Pirro,"I am gratified by Rudy's support, particularly given our shared law enforcement background. I look forward to his being a part of my campaign for Senate."
Jeanine Pirro,"Those people ... never choose to be a part of the criminal justice system, ... I fought for the underdog, for a level playing field, to make sure that those people who were victims, whose lives were forever changed because a criminal choose to change them, were cared for, to give them a voice."
Jeanine Pirro,The potential for growth is enormous.
Jeanine Pirro,"Later, she was asked about earlier gaffes, including an embarrassing 30-second-plus delay in her kickoff speech caused by a missing page of text. Pirro responded, 'I got to tell you, was it my best day? Absolutely not. Am I better than that? Absolutely not (sic).'"
Jeanine Pirro,"Teachers play such an enormous role in forming, not just teaching them, but forming character in our kids. We really have to thank them for what they do. They are really the core that makes our society work."

Robert Pirsig,"It is a puzzling thing. The truth knocks on the door and you say, Go away, I'm looking for the truth, and so it goes away. Puzzling."

Robert Pirsig,"The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think otherwise is to demean the Buddha -- which is to demean oneself."
Robert Pirsig,Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all
Robert M. Pirsig,"It is always good policy to tell the truth unless of course you are an exceptionally good liar. Jerome K. Jerome It is a puzzling thing. The truth knocks on the door and you say, go away, I'm looking for the truth. and so it goes away. Puzzling."

Robert M. Pirsig,"Traditional scientific method has always been at the very best, 20 -- 20 hindsight. It's good for seeing where you've been. It's good for testing the truth of what you think you know, but it can't tell you where you ought to go."
Rick Pitino,"You work so hard to get the program to be a Final Four caliber program and then not to make your conference tournament is really slipping. Regardless of how close we've played teams, that wins you no medals."
Rick Pitino,"It's very discouraging to work this hard -- and believe me, the way we shoot the ball, to stay in the game we've got to really, really work hard -- to just keep coming up short. We just made some very inexperienced mistakes down the stretch."
Rick Pitino,We got a good victory. We didn't turn the ball over much [and] we worked very hard at the defensive end.
Rick Pitino,This wasn't a good victory. It was a great victory.
Rick Pitino,That's as well as we've played. It was a great tempo. That's what we're trying to do more than anything else.
Rick Pitino,"On every team, if you have a point guard who thinks pass before shot, you're in trouble. You need a point guard to think pass before shot, and that's what he does."
Rick Pitino,"We're going to have some trouble there because he's much more experienced. He's like what you would expect of Terrance Farley as a senior. He's got good offensive moves in the low post; he's very long, rebounds well. So he's someone we're concerned about, and we have to stay out of foul trouble."
Rick Pitino,"This is a great group of guys and they want to win badly, but we have a little talent deficiency on the backboard. They want to rebound, but every game they get their tails kicked on the glass."
Rick Pitino,They just overpowered us with physical talent. It was disturbing.
Rick Pitino,We have some major injury problems that we haven't let out that need to be taken care of at the end of the year. To take these guys and put them through more problems would be not the right thing to do.
Rick Pitino,His (pain) threshold and his eagerness to play has been unbelievable.
Rick Pitino,He certainly had a good night.
Rick Pitino,It's going to be brutal. You've really got to be on your game every night out. There are going to be some good teams at home come March when they might otherwise be in the (NCAA) tournament. The league is that good.
Rick Pitino,"David was brilliant the whole night. He was smart. He made big defensive plays. He knew when to foul, when to step up. He just played a great overall game."
Rick Pitino,"Even in the pros, I loved to watch March Madness. It brings back so many good memories and it?s a lot of fun to be part of again."
Rick Pitino,"It's very special because I love the young men that I coached,"
Rick Pitino,"I think our young players are learning how to play, but now they have to learn how to win, how to finish a game, and we're not doing it."
Rick Pitino,"I am really not pleased with the improvement that we are making. I think our guys are having a very difficult time putting together 40 minutes of basketball. Yes we are playing a lot of different players. Our fours and fives have to play bigger, they play too small. They have the size to play big, but they don't play big with their intimidation of challenging shots."
Rick Pitino,I'm not pleased with our improvement. All of our guys are having a difficult time playing for 40 minutes.
Rick Pitino,He's not progressing and getting better like you would hope. The main thing is to just try to get him through the season.
Rick Pitino,I just hope he lets the game come to him.
Rick Pitino,We won't lose hope. And we will not get discouraged until the last game is played.
Rick Pitino,"They were all impressed with his honesty. He had a great interview. They called me up and said he blew them away, and I said, 'I told you,' and then he was offered the job."
Rick Pitino,"With this conference, you can't lose at home and expect to win on the road."
Rick Pitino,"Our guys played with tremendous heart, and I'm really proud of them."
Rick Pitino,"I think we showed tremendous guts and heart down the stretch. Getting behind against Richmond was the worst possible scenario on a basketball court. You get behind on a team like that, and it's an uphill battle all the way with the treadmill level on 10."
Rick Pitino,"We needed to win this game, to meet our goals of two out of four on the road and sweeping at home (over the last seven games). Now we've got to do it at West Virginia, at Syracuse first and at Connecticut - a pretty easy task."
Rick Pitino,"Our goal is the same as it was when we left (for this road trip). We had six road games left. We want to win at least two of those and sweep our remaining four games at home. â€¦ We had a golden opportunity that we gave away (at Rutgers), which was one of our best opportunities on the road."
Rick Pitino,"We played a terrific game. We played great. They're just better. They have every player back (from last year) and we don't. We think we have a good grasp on how to play them, but they're just better at what they do than we are at what we do."
Rick Pitino,I was hoping they wouldn't have that type of game they had (Wednesday). I was hoping they'd save that for us. We're probably going to see a different Syracuse team against us because they have great pride. They need the game and we need the game.
Rick Pitino,We're playing like our life is on the line. That's hat makes it fun.
Rick Pitino,"We'll attempt to out-think one another, but once the game is over, we'll go back to being good friends. When he comes to Louisville, I'll have him over for dinner, and when we come to Syracuse, I'm sure he'll have me over to his house."
Rick Pitino,I just hope he lets the game come to him. When he tries to force things he looks about as bad as he can look. He's at his best when he lets the game come to him so I just hope he doesn't try to impress anybody.
Rick Pitino,"This is not Conference USA. That was a finesse, fast-break type league. This is a football league in a basketball league. We let them push us around on the glass. You've got to put pads on and get ready to go."
Rick Pitino,"Don't let that humility and quiet nature fool you, though. It can be there to fool you. Deep down there's that fire that competed on the court. It's in the coaches' box, too. Some of the best coaches of our time, Dean Smith and John Wooden, had that demeanor."
Rick Pitino,The best part about it is that he [Donovan] hasn't changed except growing older and having a family. He's still the same humble person from Providence College that he was in 1987.
Rick Pitino,"I'm not concerned about getting anybody experience anymore. We've got two games before the Big East starts, and we're going to get down to our normal rotation."
Rick Pitino,"They're deep, they're tall, they have great experience, they have a great point guard with an unbelievable assist-to-turnover ratio. They can beat you inside, they can beat you outside, they can beat your zone, your man. They're very powerful and they're tough kids. They're as good as it gets."
Rick Pitino,"We had these same problems last year, except we had great experience. Last year we were able to [win despite] the injuries because it was Conference USA. We could still get wins ... because there are so many programs rebuilding, you could withstand all that. You can't withstand it in the Big East."
Rick Pitino,"Marquette ran their offense, did some good things. But it takes great execution and a big night from someone to make that happen. You never know what's going to happen. You can't give up, you've got to stay in there and fight. You never know, Saturday could be the upset that turns this around."
Rick Pitino,"It's not for entertainment. It's going to be a very intense practice. We're not going to hold back because you are there. We're not going to watch our language, so if that bothers you, don't come."
Rick Pitino,"Over the last few days, his condition has deteriorated. The doctors say it's in his best interest to have the surgery now so he can begin the process of preparing for his return to the court."
Rick Pitino,"He coached a perfect game tonight, offense and defense. It was one of the best coached games I've seen in some time."
Rick Pitino,"They're practicing great. They always practice hard. We lost the Rutgers game by making mental mistakes on defense late in the game in two key situations. Unfortunately, we had the desire and the effort but we have a lot of immaturity and broke down mentally on key wrinkles to the defense."
Rick Pitino,"A man not perfect, but of heart so high, of such heroic rage, That even his hopes became a part of earth's eternal heritage."
Rick Pitino,"The one thing I learned about well-coached teams like this that control the ball is, don't worry about it, their style of play is going to win out. Just be fundamentally sound and don't get anxious and foul. Contain the basketball and rebound and that's what we did."
Rick Pitino,"Even though he is like a son to me, he has been seriously reprimanded. A lot of consequences are going to be paid for this, but it's a lesson for everybody."
Rick Pitino,We made smart plays tonight at the defensive end. (Winning) can help (our confidence) immensely.
Rick Pitino,"What it shows you is that not only are they not afraid of competition, but the name Louisville is certainly not going to intimidate this team one bit."
Rick Pitino,"What did (Noah) say, 'Last time I checked, there was food in the fridge. Noah is a terrific college player, but he's not ready. It's one thing to go to the pros, and another to be ready to play."
Rick Pitino,"He is special to our game. He is needed in our game, because everyone wants to coach someone with 1300 on the SAT. Everyone wants a Grant Hill, unfortunately not everyone can get a Grant Hill. Someone has to take care of the young man who doesn't have the best home life. Bob Huggins is someone who can get them over the hump in life. Many have progressed and moved on because of Bob Huggins."
Rick Pitino,I like this team a lot. This freshman class is really strong. I can't tell you who the best player is. I can't tell you who has the most potential. That's a very good statement to make.
Rick Pitino,"I actually think if you have a strong junior class, that's the best possible scenario. In their senior year, guys who are on the threshold of making it [to the NBA] start getting preoccupied in their thoughts elsewhere more than concerning themselves with the present. The junior class is the perfect age."
Rick Pitino,"The formula I always use for picking teams is whoever has the most  talent in the junior and senior class wins the championships,"
Rick Pitino,"Under the circumstances of what David has had to go through this year, he's had a darn good year. And he's done it under the most trying circumstances you can imagine. His threshold for pain is kind of incredible. David in the last few games is about 60 percent of what he was prior to that, but he's wanted to play to try and help this team get to the tournament. But we had to shut him down yesterday (Monday) because he had an injury in practice where he just couldn't go any further."
Rick Pitino,"Under the circumstances of what he's had to go through this year, he's had a darn good year."
Rick Pitino,"We have no choice but to win on the road if we want to be an NCAA (tournament) team. If we don't win, we don't deserve to be an NCAA team. It's just as simple as that."
Rick Pitino,"We got what we deserved from the first day of practice until right now. We showed remarkable character, we showed remarkable resilience with a lot of injuries but we also showed a lack of talent against great competition."
Rick Pitino,"He's a cancer survivor himself, and he's lost relatives and close friends, like Jim Valvano, to the disease, so I'm not surprised he's gone at this the way he has. He's the captain of this ship, leading the way for the rest of us."
Rick Pitino,"He's got to work on his body, to get stronger for the next level, but he's terrific. He doesn't get rattled; he's seen probably every defense."
Rick Pitino,T-Will did a very good job of passing the basketball. I think he's going to do a lot down the road what (former Cardinal) Francisco Garcia does. That's the best part about his game is his passing.
Rick Pitino,"We played a great basketball game in all phases. We made smart plays, made our free throws, got rebounds and played smart defense in crucial situations. I'm very happy for our guys because they got some rewards for working hard, very hard. You can see by the way we're playing, we're not looking forward to next year. Our time is now, and we're going to keep playing that way."
Rick Pitino,We have a whole new basketball team. It's going to take time to nurture this team. We may have survived a little if we were in Conference USA with this team. But surviving in the Big East is another story. You've got to grow up in a hurry.
Rick Pitino,"Villanova is certainly deserving of its ranking. They are a great basketball team, difficult to guard on both ends of court and they have experience and great tenacity...Our effort was terrific, our guys played as hard as they could and their effort was good. Villanova was just a better basketball team."
Rick Pitino,"He's out of shape, but for the shape he's in, he played great. He hasn't played basketball in three weeks, but under the circumstances, he played awesome."
Rick Pitino,They're a unique basketball team. They're very difficult to play against because they space the floor ... and play in a terrific system.
Rick Pitino,They're a great basketball team.
Rick Pitino,"We were already a painfully young basketball team (before Dean's injury) and young teams beat themselves because they don't know what not to do. Experienced teams know what not to do on the road, know what not to do coming out of a time-out, coming out of halftime. Young teams don't know that."
Rick Pitino,I loved our unselfishness tonight. I asked our young guys try to play like a mature basketball team.
Rick Pitino,"He needs to move without the basketball, score, get out on the break, be a good runner, be a good finisher. Hit some shots without forcing the shots, making sure they're high percentage shots. Defensively, he can do some things; offensively, he's very limited."
Rick Pitino,South Carolina is a terrific team. They are playing great basketball right now.
Rick Pitino,It's going to be a very tough game. They're a very good basketball team. Every team we're going to face in this tournament is tough in terms of talent (but) we'll be ready for it.
Rick Pitino,"We are just a painfully young basketball team. It's excruciating at times with six freshmen and three sophomores, but they play hard, and I'd rather have that and have them mature and gain from it."
Rick Pitino,"This is who we are; we are a very young and inexperienced basketball team. The key is, six weeks from now, how good can we become?"
Rick Pitino,"If we took care of the basketball a little bit, we actually could have won the game."
Rick Pitino,"Williams goes down seams and finds people. He's so clever with the basketball, and they're big-time finishers because they have the size to finish."
Rick Pitino,I agree with his decision. It's in his best interests for his basketball future. We wish him well with his future plans.
Rick Pitino,"That was an extremely disappointing loss for us, about as disappointing as we've had. To play such good basketball and come away empty-handed is an empty feeling to say the least. We played well enough to get a 'W' and we didn't."
Rick Pitino,We're like a baseball team that can't hit. The pitcher has to throw a four- or five-hitter every time out.
Rick Pitino,The formula I always use for picking teams is whoever has the most talent in the junior and senior class wins the championships.
Rick Pitino,I'd learned how much happiness money can bring you. Very little.
Rick Pitino,I can say that hands down from being in this business 32 years; we're going to be much better than we were last year just because there's eight new players that now have experience and Palacios will be healthy.
Rick Pitino,"He knew I enjoyed the relationships of college basketball. All along, he was the wise one."
Rick Pitino,"Even in the pros, I loved to watch March Madness. It brings back so many good memories and it's a lot of fun to be part of again."

Todd Pletcher,He stacks up well against a field of nice horses. I think there's enough speed that he'll be laying in a stalking position. And he's got an inside post (No. 2). We're happy with the position we're in.
Todd Pletcher,The key for horses like him in their first start at two turns is to relax just a little to make their speed dangerous. You can't get too caught up in who else is running in a given race. They all will get tougher as you go along.
Todd Pletcher,"The surface has a bit of a quirky reputation, so it's important that he already has started there. It can be tiring for some horses the first time over it, but he handled it. It has the reputation of being very safe and if it rains, since it's sand-based, it can handle the moisture."
Todd Pletcher,"When you get to October, it's generally the right time of year to try 3-year-olds against older horses. That part of it we're not overly concerned about. The kind of races he ran in the Jim Dandy and Travers â€” we don't necessarily really need to improve."
Todd Pletcher,He's a patient rider and we would like to see the horse settle in mid pack. I don't think he's a very difficult horse to ride.
George Plimpton,The New York Times published the guest list on the front page. The masks were a brilliant concept.
George Plimpton,"That is one of the problems with oral biography, in that many different points of view are offered: contradictions, refutations, and so on."
George Plimpton,My favorite monologue in the book is Kate Harrington's story of her relationship with Truman.
George Plimpton,"It is also one of the pleasures of oral biography, in that the reader, rather than editor, is jury."
George Plimpton,I think people are aware of how varied and interesting his life was-always at the center of things-as well as aspects of his decline.
George Plimpton,I remember being awed by it - the uniqueness and nicety of style - and I suspect I was a bit jealous because we were more or less of the same generation.
George Plimpton,"He was interviewed in the early '60s by a young novelist, Pati Hill."
David Plummer,We'd have been happy to have stuck to that (May 31 deadline) but speculation and events have meant we have had no alternative but to bring things forward.
David Plummer,Hull FC wish to place on record their appreciation for John's efforts over the past three and a half years and wish him all the best for the future.
David Plummer,What draws you to Will is that he has such a cool head for someone his age ? really beyond his years.
Jake Plummer,He has taken them down the field many times when they are written off and they still get the victory. That is the sign of a great quarterback to me
Jake Plummer,Someone has to account for him because he can cause you trouble.
Jake Plummer,The running game cranked up big time. It allowed us to do a lot of the things we want to do.
Jake Plummer,"They've done a great job in December of shutting down teams' offenses as far as running the ball and making guys throw the ball, and they don't give up a lot of big plays. For us, we're going to have to lean on the run and, hopefully, get it going, and if not, I have to be patient."
Jake Plummer,"They have quality all around, so nothing really changes. We are going to game plan for whether those guys were there or not."
Jake Plummer,"You never know with him. He?s a great coach - very smart, very good at game planning - and we know there is going to be something we haven?t seen. There will be some things that we probably have seen, but there will be something we haven?t, and hopefully we can react to it in the right way."
Jake Plummer,"We've had good years and lost in the first round the past two years. We got a first-round bye, so that's not going to happen. We know we got a game at home and a good chance to win (here). We're not done working yet."
Jake Plummer,"Regardless of what I've done in the past, this is a big game, carrying a lot of pressure. We all know what's at stake here."
Jake Plummer,"I'm already pretty financially set with what I've gotten there [in Arizona], ... For me, it's winning. Obviously the money will be there, but right the winning part is what I want to look at, which team is going to make that push, make that commitment to do anything and everything possible. Right now, these guys here, the Broncos, are showing me that's what they're geared for."
Jake Plummer,"I've been doing the same thing year in and year out, working hard to try to get here. We're here now, and I'm not going to analyze it and try to find an answer. I'm just going to go out and enjoy it."
Jake Plummer,"One of our goals was to win the division. We won the division. We wanted to get a playoff game at home. We got a playoff game at home. Those are all steps toward our ultimate goal, to win it all. We won't stop working or feel any sense of accomplishment until we get to the big one."
Jake Plummer,"That's the big question that people are trying to figure out. I am, too. I'm just playing football. Five years ago, I prepared the same way."
Jake Plummer,"It's a big win for this organization, for everybody. Obviously, John was a great quarterback and they had great football teams. Hopefully, we can continue on and get people to start appreciating what we've got now. I think people are, I think they have been."
Jake Plummer,"With their drive and desire to do something in history that's never been done, we know it's going to be a tough one."
Jake Plummer,That was huge. Our defense has been doing that all year. Our defense definitely stepped up.
Jake Plummer,"Sometimes the balls were good and sometimes they came out dirty and wet. No excuses. They had the same balls we did. We didn't dominate the game, we didn't outplay them by much, but we came out with a win. . . . It's something you've got to deal with. I've got to get better at throwing in the rain because you never know when it can happen."
Plutarch,"It is the admirer of himself, and not the admirer of virtue, that thinks himself superior to others"
Plutarch,Another such victory over the Romans and we are undone.
Plutarch,"To do an evil act is base. To do a good one without incurring danger, is common enough. But it is part of a good man to do great and noble deeds though he risks everything in doing them."

Plutarch,Character is simply habit long continued.
Plutarch,To make no mistakes is not in the power of man; but from their errors and mistakes the wise and good learn wisdom for the future.

Plutarch,The omission of good is no less reprehensible than the commission of evil.
Plutarch,"The first evil those who are prone to talk suffer, is that they hear nothing."
Plutarch,The very spring and root of honesty and virtue lie in good education.
Plutarch,"A Roman divorced from his wife, being highly blamed by his friends, who demanded, ''Was she not chaste? Was she not fair? Was she not fruitful?'' holding out his shoe, asked them whether it was not new and well made. ''Yet,'' added he, ''none of you can tell where it pinches me."
Plutarch,"Medicine to produce health must examine disease; and music, to create harmony must investigate discord."
Plutarch,"Not by lamentations and mournful chants ought we to celebrate the funeral of a good man, but by hymns, for in ceasing to be numbered with mortals he enters upon the heritage of a diviner life."

Lanny Poffo,The Genius was a lot more fun than
Lanny Poffo,"There's a fork in the road, you can be jealous, or you can be happy. I always choose happiness. Jealousy is one of the seven deadly sins, ... If I've got two loaves of bread under each arm, why must I feel jealous of anybody? Why can't I just be happy for myself? If that's the way you look at it, then why isn't Randy jealous of David Letterman or Jay Leno? Because there's always somebody better than you. The thing is, I would rather just be thankful and live each day as if it was a gift instead of a burden. It is a burden if you're so competitive or so ego-driven that you can't live unless you make everything else dead around you."

Roman Polanski,Cinema should make you forget you are sitting in a theater.

James Polk,"Peace, plenty, and contentment reign throughout our borders, and our beloved country presents a sublime moral spectacle to the world..."
James Polk,"The passion for office among members of Congress is very great, if not absolutely disreputable, and greatly embarrasses the operations of the Government. They create offices by their own votes and then seek to fill them themselves."

James Polk,The world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our Government.
James Polk,"There is more selfishness and less principle among members of Congress than I had any conception of, before I became President of the U.S."

Ron Polk,I'd hate to see our batting average with the bases loaded.

Ron Polk,"It's early, and the players get caught up in the emotions. They've never been through it before. I have. There are going to be some bumps in the road. I'm just preparing (them)."
Ron Polk,Our batting average with the bases loaded has to be the worst in the history of baseball. To be 22-3 and get out that much with the bases loaded is a miracle. But it's going to get better.

Sydney Pollack,"Well, there's no question that a good script is an absolutely essential, maybe the essential thing for a movie."
Sydney Pollack,"Well, the wonderful thing about making movies, oddly enough, is that they're sort of highly motivated graduate studies in one or another field."

Sydney Pollack,"I mean, certainly it's the single biggest event, I think, in terms of popular entertainment, or art even, if you say that, of the 20th Century. It's been film. It's the 20th Century's real art form."
Sydney Pollack,"I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon."
Sydney Pollack,I didn't believe that I'd ever be lucky enough to be able to make a living as an actor.
Sydney Pollack,"From my point of view I work just as hard, I care just as much, if the films fail it doesn't make me suddenly disown them, it just doesn't."
Sydney Pollack,"For example, a man who might not have enormous charisma, who could be president 40 years ago, and who was a deserving president, I don't know that George Washington would be a president today, I don't know that Abe Lincoln would, I don't know that Roosevelt would."

William Pollack,"Research shows, ... that while mothers tend to soothe their children and shield them from too much stimulation, the average father is inclined to arouse the emotions and stimulate a boy, playing with him zestfully and 'jazzing' him up. â€¦ That roughhousing between father and son that may make mom cringe is actually the rudimentary beginning of a boy's management of his aggression and his ability to substitute emotional mastery and mutual cooperation for violent interaction."
William Pollack,There is just one problem here - we're not in a jungle and boys aren't lions.
William Pollack,At 5 years old boys feel shamed if they don't push away from mom.
William Pollack,"Early on, many boys give up. Once they turn it off, they rarely go back to it."
William Pollack,There is a crisis in boyhood in America today.
William Pollack,"Many people, ... base their thinking about boys on the myth that 'testosterone = aggressiveness = boys,' but nothing in the research, mine included, proves that equation to be true . So why do men behave so much more violently than women do, if there is no male 'violence chromosome'? When boys feel disconnected (from adequate love and support) and afraid of being shamed, when they harden themselves and then put on the macho mask, the one emotion they feel it's acceptable to show, and thus the only emotion they will show, is anger."

Shaun Pollock,"I think we have more than enough talent. There are 13-14 match-winners in both the Test and one-day teams. They are guys that have won matches for their respective countries almost single-handedly over the years, so we definitely have enough talent to match the Aussies."
Shaun Pollock,"I only had five bowlers, so everyone had to step up and take responsibility."
Shaun Pollock,"Freddie is a champion from that perspective, he was really keen to go in,"

Shaun Pollock,There'll be no free deliveries or anything other than world class cricket.
Joe Polo,"Watching the girls go in the afternoon, we noticed (the ice) was swinging a little bit more. You can get more aggressive. It's nice to get aggressive because you don't have so many close games."
Joe Polo,"On the ice, he's nerves of steel. He has fun out there, but he just likes to stay as focused as he can."
Joe Polo,"It's perfect to play against Canada, because we want to take revenge."
Jason Pominville,"It's something you dream about. The first one, hopefully the first of many. It's a special night. I'll remember it for a while."
Jason Pominville,We talked about our first couple of games in the West and I don't think we played the way we wanted to. We regrouped and really pulled things together after that.
Jason Pominville,It's awesome. It doesn't happen too often. So it's fun to see the team work hard and have it finally pay off.
Cappie Pondexter,"She's been a believer is me. I've gotten strength through her; she's been a leader to me. She grew up in the South and went through some tough times. She never finished grammar school, but she's going to get her diploma soon."
Cappie Pondexter,It's hard. I've just got to move on.
Cappie Pondexter,"It comes down to a lack of focus and discipline. Like coach stresses time and time again, we have the elements. It's just a matter of us collectively putting it together. I mean, it can't come from her, it's just a mindset that we have to have. It comes from us. There's no more that she can give us."
Cappie Pondexter,Coach [C. Vivian Stringer] told us before it even started that it was going to come down to the last seconds.
Cappie Pondexter,"I guess that's how the basketball gods wanted it to be. When it comes around, we're going to be ready."
Cappie Pondexter,"The last month or so, we really started playing our type of basketball."
Cappie Pondexter,"It's definitely an accomplishment, but we can't settle on the win. We just look at it as a step toward the Big East title. It was big to come in here and win. It was the first time in history. We can't put everything on this game, they still have to come to our place. We still have to come here for the Big East tournament, so there's still a lot in front of us."
Ricky Ponting,"There's no room in sport for racism whatsoever. The players are all very aware of that, the crowd needs to be aware of that and enjoy the game for what it is."
Ricky Ponting,"We have a lot of work to do, and we have to improve our batting,"
Ricky Ponting,"We're just trying to pick the best team for this game, first and foremost, but he's a young bloke who is hopefully going to be around the team for a long time."
Ricky Ponting,"I don't know what he was trying to achieve out of it, whether he was trying to get under our skin and unsettle us a bit. But when you make statements like he has, then it puts you under a bit more pressure yourself. I guess sitting here right now we've had the last laugh."
Ricky Ponting,"I am doing the best I can and I am sure the other guys are trying their best as well, we just haven't put it together yet."
Ricky Ponting,To tell you the truth I'm not really sure where Mark's coming from there. It's disappointing to hear those sorts of things.
Ricky Ponting,"To tell the truth it hasn't been spoken about in any selection meeting that I've had so far,"
Ricky Ponting,"It might not be a bad thing for us, to tell the truth,"
Ricky Ponting,It was a total we were confident of defending. We were in a bit of trouble but Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey played beautifully.
Ricky Ponting,"It was a total we were confident of defending, ... We were in a bit of trouble but Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey played beautifully."
Ricky Ponting,We just want a bit more of a think about it and probably a sleep on it tonight with Bracken (and) MacGill. One of those two guys will play and one won't.
Ricky Ponting,"We couldn't risk or afford to have him actually have to face any deliveries in the game. If we needed two to win and he had to go on strike, I would probably have had to declare or do something like that, which would have been pretty hard. As he just said to me then, he wouldn't have spoken to me ever again as long as he was alive. [But] the risk factor there was extremely high."
Ricky Ponting,"We batted steadily enough to post a good total, and then Brett and the rest of the bowlers did a good job for us."
Ricky Ponting,I'm sure the rest of the players sitting here are 100 per cent behind the coach. I'm really happy with the feeling in the group at the moment. I think we all understand the challenge that lies before us and we're all up for it. I'm sure you'll see us play some great cricket.
Ricky Ponting,"With the amount of fast bowlers we've got in this squad at the moment, we'll look to rest players at different times."
Ricky Ponting,I thought it was an excellent all-round performance tonight. We always try and time our run during these competitions and build our momentum and we're getting better each match.
Ricky Ponting,"We played very well this week, and it was a good team performance. But I'm not sure if the West Indies played as well as they can. We probably expected a little bit more."
Ricky Ponting,"It's been a very good team performance from us, we have looked at lots of areas where we can improve our Test match cricket and we've certainly addressed some of those in this game,"
Ricky Ponting,"He has played every match for Australia in all forms of the game for the past 10 months, and we think this is the right time for him to allow his body to rest. These rests have been done before and we have found that when the guys have a chance to have a break, the results indicate that it is good for them."
Ricky Ponting,Once I got past about 30 I felt really settled. I've been saying all along I was batting well and a big score wasn't far away.
Ricky Ponting,"It's a great opportunity for South Australians to get behind this match, the first final we've ever had in Adelaide. I know the South Australian Cricket Association are very keen to make a success of it to prove that the Adelaide Oval is a venue worthy of more international cricket."
Ricky Ponting,"He said 'Let them all in', and at the end of that night my wife Daphne and I went up to the committee room and we walked across and raised a glass, because it was one of the great moments in our lives to that time and it remains as such."
Ricky Ponting,"Hopefully, the longer we make him bowl, the more mistakes he'll make,"
Ricky Ponting,"I think, within my mind and even within the selectors' minds, we know what our opening combination is going to be for the World Cup. I think that's been on display a fair bit before the last couple of games."
Ricky Ponting,"I had a bit of luck early on, obviously. I probably should have been caught at third slip on zero ...but there wasn't one there. I was dropped on a pretty easy chance not long after. It was a bit of luck along the way."
Ricky Ponting,"I had a bit of luck, I should have been caught at third slip when I had two but Graeme (Smith) didn't have a third slip. Then I was dropped on 17 and it was a pretty straightforward catch."
Ricky Ponting,"I've got no concerns for those two, ... I love having both those guys in the side and I think they'll be around for a bit longer yet."
Ricky Ponting,"I think listening to him before the game he wanted to be more economical and not go for as many runs which probably meant he wanted to drop his pace,"
Ricky Ponting,We're still learning and hopefully we'll learn a bit more tomorrow.
Ricky Ponting,It hurt him a lot not taking part in the last test match so he will be pretty keen to prove everybody wrong.
Ricky Ponting,I'm sure we'll be looking as soon as we get back home.
Ricky Ponting,"I knew Shane would do that for us. He loves that sort of occasion, and Brett bowled his heart out."
Ricky Ponting,"I would hate to think if we lost this series it is only my fault, all coming back to me,"
Ricky Ponting,"Every player has had an impact at some stage, and it would be hard to leave someone out."
Ricky Ponting,"He's not as hard on himself as he once was. He's learnt a lot about the way he has to play his cricket to be successful,"
Ricky Ponting,"I'm really happy with the way things have progressed and improved since we've returned from that tour,"
Ricky Ponting,"I think he's probably had a good look at his game and had a look at how he got out in Australia, and tried to rectify that. It's up to us to come back with something different. We've spoken about him and we know what we want to do."
Ricky Ponting,He goes out of the game and you're playing 11 against 12.
Ricky Ponting,I wouldn't take him at 60 or 70 percent fitness. He has to be right to bowl not just on Thursday morning but every morning of the match.
Ricky Ponting,"I've been a pretty nervous coming into this game?I've my family up here and a lot of friends here as well to watch, and it always tends to make it a little bit harder for you to do well, but I was just really happy with the way I played."
Ricky Ponting,"They may be less experienced at Test level, but they've all got a lot of experience under their belts and been around the Australian structure for a while,"
Ricky Ponting,"This match is another example that the team is capable of coming out of any trouble. It was a very, very good test match."
Ricky Ponting,"He is always missed any time he misses a game. There is no doubt we have missed him on a couple of occasions this series,"
Ricky Ponting,"Yes, probably right (more relief than joy after you have avoided an embarrassing defeat). It was a very good Test match win."
Ricky Ponting,It's a bit of a shame not to have Andrew because he's a fairly dynamic player in 20/20 cricket. But there's little point in him playing now and then being forced out in the middle of the one-day series.
Ricky Ponting,We are here to play our best test cricket. Things have been going according to plan for us in the past few weeks and we will try to freshen up and get our focus back.
Ricky Ponting,"This Australian cricket team is still the best cricket team in the world and as far as I'm concerned, the best sporting team in the world. For me to be the captain of that side is a great honor and a great thrill."
Ricky Ponting,We can go out and play instinctive cricket with the pressure off.
Ricky Ponting,"Cricket just takes a back seat, however much time he needs he's got. He's said his intention is to keep playing, but we'll just have to see how things unfold over the next weeks."
Ricky Ponting,"They have played some very good one-day cricket over the last couple of years, probably particularly in South Africa, so they'll be definitely up for it."
Ricky Ponting,I'm sure everybody watching had one of the greatest days of their lives. It was a great game of cricket.
Ricky Ponting,It does look like a good wicket. I think it'll be a fairly traditional Sydney cricket wicket. It'll be unlikely that we'll make any other changes.
Ricky Ponting,We have played very good cricket in Australia and we know what we are capable of.
Ricky Ponting,The sooner we can get back to playing the cricket we're used to and the cricket we'll be playing going forward the better. I think an agreement will be struck.
Ricky Ponting,"We have 14 players in the squad and a couple of those guys haven't played a lot of cricket, so we'll look at them in tomorrow's game against South Africa."
Ricky Ponting,"It's some of the best one-day cricket played in a long time _ no doubt about that,"
Ricky Ponting,He got the biggest response I've ever heard on a cricket ground.
Ricky Ponting,"I think we played some very good cricket, there's no doubt about that,"
Ricky Ponting,"To win ? you have to make hundreds in Test cricket, that's what it's all about. They're just not doing that right now. There's no doubt we'll sit down and talk about some of the individuals, but I must admit I'd be surprised if any changes would be made."
Ricky Ponting,It's probably the most nerve-racking end to a test match I've played in ... (maybe) any game of cricket I've ever played - tied World Cup semi-finals included.
Ricky Ponting,He was a fantastic player and leader. His services to cricket have been quite remarkable.
Ricky Ponting,The Test cricket we've played over the last few weeks has been of a very high standard.
Ricky Ponting,It's an extremely sad day for Australian cricket.
Ricky Ponting,I had said then that it was the biggest upset in the history of cricket. I can't say for sure whether that is true but it definitely has been the biggest disappointment for me.
Ricky Ponting,"It was knocked on the head quite sternly by most of the captains at the (International Cricket Council) captains meeting in Sydney a couple of weeks ago,"
Ricky Ponting,"They're [England] number two in the world now and have played excellent cricket of late, and I think both sides match up particularly well."
Ricky Ponting,"I was furious at a player being so disrespectful to himself, his teammates, his opponents and his country by turning up to play a game in that state, and I blurted out, 'He can go home then!' to Gilchrist before heading off to speak to (coach) John Buchanan."
Ricky Ponting,He should be able to take a lot of confidence from that. It was exactly what he needed. The game scenario presented itself beautifully for him.
Ricky Ponting,Bangladesh will take a lot of confidence from their performance in the first test.
Ricky Ponting,The competition we've had here has always been strong. The last series in Australia was particularly intense.
Ricky Ponting,We had a few communication mix ups and it cost us. Two of our first three wickets were run outs and we were on the back foot for most of our innings. Sri Lanka played a very good game though - they batted well and put us under pressure.
Ricky Ponting,"His cricket from that moment on has been terrific, his cricket has been first class and he needs to be applauded for it."
Ricky Ponting,It doesn't matter what the wicket looks like. He's a class performer in all sorts of conditions.
Ricky Ponting,Our cricket has been first class.
Ricky Ponting,"We've had great success against Graeme Smith over the summer, there's no doubt, but he is a class player and we have to keep coming up with different plans. There's no such thing as a watertight plan - it's a very irrational game."
Ricky Ponting,"The opening bowlers in particular were fantastic. Brett Lee is a top-class bowler and it's great to have him back in the side, as well as Andrew Symonds. We have some momentum now."
Ricky Ponting,"I am totally against drop-in wickets anywhere in the world, it takes all the character away from the grounds,"
Ricky Ponting,You would have thought over 400 would be enough. But Herschelle and the boys were too good and they deserved their win.
Ricky Ponting,There's a tendency for balls to swing around here and hopefully we can take a few early wickets.
Ricky Ponting,He's bowling 150km/h most balls. There's a very small margin for error there.
Ricky Ponting,This team has shown it can fight back from adversity.
Ricky Ponting,"Glenn's absence has thrown the attack a bit, but with Brett taking wickets early on with the new ball and Nathan Bracken and Stuart Clark stepping in and stepping up, I couldn't be much happier."
Ricky Ponting,"I'm proud of our ability to turn things around, especially after being below par in the Ashes."

Winnie Pooh,"Pooh, said Rabbit kindly, you haven't any brain. I know, said Pooh humbly."
Winnie Pooh,"I don't see much sense in that, said Rabbit.  No, said Pooh humbly, there isn't. But there was going to be when I began it. It's just that something happened to it along the way."

Alexander Pope,"Order is Heaven's first law; and this confessed, some are, and must be, greater than the rest, more rich, more wise; but who infers from hence that such are happier, shocks all common sense. Condition, circumstance, is not the thing; bliss is the same in subject or in king."

Gregg Popovich,Let's let Tony settle into what he's doing now and become great at it. He can worry about that kind of stuff in the future.
Gregg Popovich,"That's the least of what we worry about. We've got a lot of things to be concerned with on our own team, and that's how we spend our time."
Gregg Popovich,"I just think of it as two bad performances, and if it doesn't get better, we'll be in big trouble. . . . But there's no time for frustration."
Gregg Popovich,"I asked them if it wasn't too much trouble, if I wasn't being too pushy, if they could execute what we were trying to do. And if it didn't make them too angry, if they also wanted to play some defense on the other end, that would be great."
Gregg Popovich,"This is the deepest team we've had talent-wise. What I am hoping is that it ends up being the deepest team we've had knowledge-wise - professionalism, basketball IQ."

Gregg Popovich,"I feel bad for Minnesota because they have a lot of pride and they are in a real tough situation with so many guys out. Obviously, for that reason, it wasn't really a fair fight. We don't take too much from the game other than we stayed healthy and didn't get anyone hurt."
Gregg Popovich,I thought it was a bad performance on our part. It's a shame (Duncan) was feeling good and sprightly and we wasted it because the whole team wasn't reacting.
Gregg Popovich,I don't put much into momentum swings at this point of the season.
Gregg Popovich,"Everybody comes with their best game, which is great. Tonight we made a lot of mistakes but we plowed through it. In the end, we did a good job moving the ball and hitting our free throws and got the win."
Gregg Popovich,"And now I don't think they look at us in the same light. Manu plays with no fear, a tough kid. (Tony) Parker they knock around and he keeps bouncing back up. And maybe with those additions, they look at us differently."
Gregg Popovich,We moved the ball pretty well and our defense was pretty good all night long. Winning on the road is always sweet.
Gregg Popovich,"I think mostly the system is about consistency, ... Our system more than anything is just persistent and consistent with a defensive emphasis. We don't talk about how many games we're going to win, winning a division, winning a championship, none of that stuff. No goals, none like that. Our goal is to get better every day, to practice every day, to treat the game with respect. If we can come out every practice and every game, learning something that we did well or that we did poorly, we can go from there. And then, you know, the way you handle players off the court or around the court that's just an individual thing with every team."
Gregg Popovich,"We wanted to do something to show our appreciation and show his friends and family that we can come back. The schedule is so hectic he doesn't get to go home as much as he'd like, but this is a good opportunity for him to do it. There's not a lot of anxiety in the preseason. So it's just a lot of fun for Tim and his fans."
Gregg Popovich,"He looks aggressive to me, and that's what's important. He really is taking advantage of opportunities."
Clinton Portis,"I actually have learned to become more patient, just knowing what the guys are doing around me. Understanding the scheme, understanding our blocking, basically just reading it. I think last year I just got to the point where I wanted to make a play, and I was trying to do it on my own instead of taking the 4 and 5 yards. This year I take the 4 and 5, line up and keep pounding, and when the big play comes, it comes."
Clinton Portis,"I talked to Coach Shanahan in the Hall of Fame Game (in August 2004) and I came back out to Denver one or two times and saw Coach Shanahan,"
Clinton Portis,"They didn't have to let me go. I was tied into a contract, and I think Coach Shanahan, being the man that he is, allowed me the opportunity to go out and seek a better living for myself, and he gave me that, and I really appreciate it."
Clinton Portis,"Going through my play book, I'm looking for the plays that can get me in the end zone, so I'm really trying hard. Actually my eyes haven't been working that good."
Natalie Portman,"First of all, they can be enjoyed on a real popcorn level, really simple entertainment where you can go to different planets and be completely transported to a different place. On a deeper level, it's based on mythological elements that are things people really cling to."
Natalie Portman,"I was really into dancing, taking six classes a week, and my real dream was to be in a Broadway show."
Natalie Portman,"When a guy tells me I'm cute, it's not something desirable. Cute is more like what you want your pet to be."
Natalie Portman,"You could certainly draw a modern parallel with America, couldn't you?"
Natalie Portman,"It really wasn't my thing. It still isn't my thing, the whole science-fiction action thing. I prefer simpler, character-based movies."
Rob Portman,"This is one that we're going to have to work through carefully,"
Rob Portman,We have a lot of work to do and we need to do it together.
Rob Portman,"We had the best understanding yet in terms of being able to talk from the same page in terms of the impacts. That may seem insubstantial to you but that's actually been a major challenge, and frankly a frustration of mine that we have sometimes talked past each other."
Rob Portman,I think it's the intransigence of a relatively small number of European countries...(who) are once again trying to block something that would be very good for the global economy and good for development.
Rob Portman,We've been very aggressive on the enforcement side. We ought to aggressively enforce our laws with regard to unfair trade and we will continue to do that.
Rob Portman,We have a situation where the European Union is not willing or able to reduce barriers to trade.
Rob Portman,"Although we appreciate this step toward normalized beef trade with Korea, we are extremely disappointed that Korea did not fully open its market to all U.S. beef products."
Rob Portman,"I don't question his sincerity,"
Rob Portman,"The reality is that until we can agree on a formula that reduces tariffs globally we cannot meet this Doha promise for development. In order to keep momentum post-Hong Kong, the European Union must be willing to move."
Rob Portman,"What is lacking is enough progress on market access,"
Rob Portman,I'm disappointed because we haven't seen much progress on market access. Time is running out.
Rob Portman,"We are concerned because we are not seeing the progress that we had hoped for this week,"
Rob Portman,"I'm not encouraged. We did not make adequate progress. We made incremental, but not adequate progress."
Rob Portman,"I'm optimistic we are making the sort of progress that we need to meet our tight deadlines, ... We have come closer together."
Rob Portman,"I am sorry that we have not made the progress we hoped to make,"
Rob Portman,"This is not something where we can -- as the EU and the U.S. have unsuccessfully tried in the past -- come up with an agreement for everyone,"
Rob Portman,"The U.S. is willing to take some pain, ... We are ready to make meaningful changes to American farm programs provided our trading partners deliver tangible market access for U.S. agricultural exports."
Rob Portman,"The U.S. is willing to take some pain, ... But those who subsidize more need to reduce more."
Rob Portman,"It's an opportunity to take stock of where we are, but also again we'd hoped it would have been an opportunity to make some tough decisions on at the least the framework for discussions going forward."
Rob Portman,"Based on all available information, piracy and counterfeiting remain rampant in China despite years of engagement on this,"
Rob Portman,Biotechnology produces safe food. We believe it will help reduce poverty in poor countries. We believe it enhances development and it provides important environmental benefits.
Rob Portman,"The failure of the E.U. to put forward a real market access proposal has put the benefits of Doha at risk,"
Rob Portman,I believe we require a more vigorous enforcement effort with respect to China and the dedication of resources to make such an effort effective.
Rob Portman,"Over the past 20 years, Congress has made pensions less generous by lowering the contribution and benefit levels, while also making pensions more costly to offer by increasing the number of rules and regulations on employers."
Rob Portman,"I will work closely with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to prioritize essential spending that meets our national priorities, while reducing spending elsewhere."
Rob Portman,"We've been talking for four and a half years. Even if we didn't have the Trade Promotion Authority deadline, it's time to pull this round together."
Rob Portman,"This is a high-quality, comprehensive free trade agreement that will contribute to economic growth and trade between both countries,"
Rob Portman,"Accordingly, I believe that the accession package, both our bilateral  agreement and the broader multilateral negotiation which is nearing  completion, will warrant US support,"
Rob Portman,"This [agreement] represents progress for Saudi Arabia, the US and the WTO"
Rob Portman,"Soon US farmers, manufacturers and service providers will enjoy new opportunities in this growing market. The agreement also marks a milestone in strengthening ties and promoting freedom in the Middle East."
Rob Portman,"This agreement is a win-win situation for U.S. and EU winemakers, helping to establish predictable conditions for bilateral wine trade, ... I want to thank Chief Agricultural Negotiator Allen Johnson and especially Jim Murphy, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Agricultural Affairs, who have brought this difficult negotiation to a successful conclusion.?Ã¡ The culmination of this agreement reflects the extensive efforts by a number of Federal agencies in these negotiations and in particular the work done by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in the Treasury Department."
Rob Portman,"I&#x2019;m optimistic about a comprehensive agreement with China because I think it makes sense for China and for the US,"
Rob Portman,"Litigation has obviously not proved to be an effective way to resolve this relatively small but highly disruptive agreement,"
Rob Portman,"This agreement is a win-win situation for U.S. and EU winemakers, helping to establish predictable conditions for bilateral wine trade,"
Rob Portman,"The advice he gives the president, I hear constantly, is the single most important advice the president gets,"
Rob Portman,"I believe the textile agreement shows our ability to resolve tough trade disputes in a manner that benefits both countries,"
Jerrold Post,To whom is the physician responsible? Is he responsible to the suffering human being that he is treating? To the occupant of the role? Or to the American public? And can he simultaneously be responsible to all three?
Jerrold Post,"When a person is recovering from a major trauma or major surgery, he deserves the rest and rehabilitation that any of us mere mortals would have. The public expectation, at times, is so high that the president [is] always on duty."
Jerrold Post,"He has the most traumatized background of any leader I've profiled, ... Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World."
Jerrold Post,An illness to the president is not just a personal matter. It is a devastating public crisis.
Jerrold Post,"He recruited attractive young girls of junior high school age to take part in joy brigades. And the joy brigades' function was to help in relaxation to his senior officials. He lives in this seven-story pleasure palace. He has this collection of 15 to 20,000 movies,"

Chaim Potok,"Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a 'universal' without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere"
Chaim Potok,"Yes, there is some thought about making a film of My Name Is Asher Lev."
Chaim Potok,"What I have in advance are people I want to write about and a problem or problems that I see those people encountering and that I want to explore - it all proceeds sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, and scene by scene."
Chaim Potok,"Well, one hopes that if you're really related to the core of your particular culture, you have profound commitments to it, and that you are aware of how much you can strain it before you do violence to its essential nature."
Chaim Potok,Two hundred or more years ago most people on the planet were never aware of any reality other than the one into which they were brought up.
Chaim Potok,It is inconceivable to me that a million or three million or half a million human beings will think and feel precisely the same way on any single subject.
Chaim Potok,It is impossible to fuse totally with a culture for which you feel a measure of antagonism.
Chaim Potok,"If I had a plot that was all set in advance, why would I want go through the agony of writing the novel? A novel is a kind of exploration and discovery, for me at any rate."
Chaim Potok,I'm not altogether certain that a fundamentalism of necessity has to argue that it is the only reading of the human experience in order to stay alive.
Chaim Potok,"I'm constantly revising. Once the book is written and typed, I go through the entire draft again."
Chaim Potok,I think the hardest part of writing is revising. And by that I mean the following: A novelist has to create the piece of marble and then chip away to find the figure in it.
Chaim Potok,"I think that to a very great extent we are partners with the divine in this enterprise called history. That is an ongoing relationship, and there is absolutely no guarantee that things will automatically work out to our best advantage."
Chaim Potok,"I get up around 6:30. I work from about 8:00 to 1:00, take a break for lunch, work again until about 5:00, and then go for a long walk and have dinner. Then, if my wife and I have no previous plans, we decide what to do for the evening."
Chaim Potok,I don't work on my Sabbath. I write five-and-a-half or six days a week.
Chaim Potok,"Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty, to true culture, has been a rebel, a 'universal' without patriotism, without home, who has found his people everywhere."
Chaim Potok,Each work seems to give me the most trouble at the time I'm working on it.
Chaim Potok,But today we become aware of other readings of the human experience very quickly because of the media and the speed with which people travel the planet.
Chaim Potok,As a species we are always hungry for new knowledge.
Chaim Potok,Apocalyptic versions are fall-back systems when the normal systems cease to offer effective answers to the dilemmas of existence.
Chaim Potok,"I think most serious writers, certainly in the modern period, use their own lives or the lives of people close to them or lives they have heard about as the raw material for their creativity."
Chaim Potok,"And yet there are some magnificent things from Freud, profound insights into the nature of man."
Chaim Potok,"A non-fiction writer pretty much has the shape of the figure in front of him or her and goes about refining it. A work of non-fiction is not as difficult to write as a work of fiction, but it's not as satisfying in the end."
Chaim Potok,"Come, let us have some tea and continue to talk about happy things."
Chaim Potok,"All of us grow up in particular realities - a home, family, a clan, a small town, a neighborhood. Depending upon how we're brought up, we are either deeply aware of the particular reading of reality into which we are born, or we are peripherally aware of it."
Harry Potter,I think the image I had in my head from the book -- they've captured it.
Harry Potter,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
Harry Potter,"[W]izarding ability is inherited in a mendelian fashion, with the wizard allele (W) being recessive to the muggle allele (M)."
James Potter,"[So the Potters gave it a rest. Until last spring, that is, when they noticed that Ken Bacher was now spearheading the Dalai Lama's redux.] That's when I finally decided to take this issue public, ... As a result, we've been shunned by our friends. But this has been eating at me for 12 years."
James Potter,"There are serious questions that need to be addressed around the people who are running the show, ... And that's what it is essentially now--a show."
James Potter,We're hopefully going to build a base of knowledge for them.
David Pottruck,"Given our outlook regarding the potential duration of these uncertainties, we are taking additional measures to enhance our financial performance."
David Pottruck,"Our continued leadership in online investing is reflected in the growing number of customers using these services at Schwab,"
David Pottruck,"We have millions of these customers who are reasonably demanding of services, which we're pleased to provide but which have to be paid for, ... Customers have the opportunity to justify their service levels by adding to their account."
David Pottruck,"These estimated results reflect heavy trading volumes, the strength of our core domestic business, the absence of any international proprietary trading and a continued focus on staffing levels, expenses, and risk management."
David Pottruck,"These estimated results reflect heavy trading volumes, the strength of our core domestic business, the absence of any international proprietary trading and a continued focus on staffing levels, expenses, and risk management,"
Ian Poulter,"When you do that, you're going to win the golf tournament, and that's exactly what he did."
Ian Poulter,It's actually nice to get three weeks in a row where we can come out and play three great golf tournaments.
Ian Poulter,"After that quadruple bogey, I went into overdrive. I played some unbelievable golf."
Ian Poulter,I feel like taking my putter into the car park and giving it a right good thrashing.
Ian Poulter,"I haven't found that many differences playing in America as opposed to playing in Europe. In my eyes, there are slightly bigger crowds in America. The depth of players is slightly stronger in America, and that really is about it."
Dick Pound,"It's always been our view that sports should settle its own problems. Doping in sports is a serious problem and will be dealt with seriously, but it is not criminal."
Dick Pound,I would be inclined to say 'if you are not willing to cooperate and follow the rules of your international federation you are not the right track and field association to be part of the USOC'.
Dick Pound,"I would be inclined to say 'if you are not willing to cooperate and follow the rules of your international federation you are not the right track and field association to be part of the USOC',"
Dick Pound,It is in their disciplinary rules where we think they have not gone far enough.
Dick Pound,It is a good warning. It means if you are going to do this drug stuff you are at risk. It will be helpful as a deterrent.
Dick Pound,They said it's simply research.
Dick Pound,I think if you hang around with someone of this kind of reputation you're going to have to expect to be targeted and tested.
Dick Pound,"While one has to admit there's some progress, it's not very much."
Dick Pound,We tried to the best of our possibilities to provide the information that we have.
Dick Pound,I was simply defending my profession and my passion.
Dick Pound,"Poisoned by his mother? It is good, very good. It ranks up there with 'I got it from the toilet seat' (on Shane Warne's explanation for using a banned substance)"
Dick Pound,I bring to the job an experience that no other candidate has. I've done everything in the 23 years that I've been here. I've seen the good parts and the bad parts.
Dick Pound,public statements about the likely guilt of an athlete on the basis of a newspaper article and without all the facts being known.
Dick Pound,I regard this as early days. We're not taking the gold standard as a stake set in the ground and that is all you have to do.
Dick Pound,The number of tests is more an affirmation of that desire than it is a widespread suspicion that more people rather than less are doing this.
Dick Pound,We don't necessarily think you should go to jail (for drug cheating). We just don't want you in our sport.
Dick Pound,Maybe it will have the deterrent effect that they hoped. But it's a wrong message to send to people that sport is going to be run by criminal authorities. That's not what Italy promised.
Dick Pound,"It's .... quite clear the only way there could have been a match between the code numbers and a particular athlete was on the basis of information supplied by the UCI,"
Dick Pound,It's .... quite clear the only way there could have been a match between the code numbers and a particular athlete was on the basis of information supplied by the UCI.
Dick Pound,It's ... quite clear the only way there could have been a match between the code numbers and a particular athlete was on the basis of information supplied by the UCI.
Dick Pound,"We are not accusing any member of corruption or bribery or suggesting that there was criminal conduct, ... These members are guilty of breaking the oath they took and bringing the reputation of the IOC into disrepute."
Jerry Pournelle,"Write a lot. And finish what you write. Don't join writer's clubs and go sit around having coffee reading pieces of your manuscript to people. Write it. Finish it. I set those rules up years ago, and nothing's changed."
Jerry Pournelle,"We do a hard fantasy as well as hard science fiction, and I think I probably single-handedly recreated military science fiction. It was dead before I started working in it."
Jerry Pournelle,"There were probably, what, 300 science-fiction members in the SFWA, of whom probably a hundred were active members in the sense that they were selling something every year, or every couple years."
Jerry Pournelle,The importance of information is directly proportional to its improbability.
Jerry Pournelle,"Somebody's always getting me to come lecture to their writing class, and I don't talk about writing at all, I talk about the business of making a living at this racket."
Jerry Pournelle,"One the other hand, the publishing trend is ghastly, isn't it? Two hundred and something distributors are now down to 10 or 12? And what's the recruiting drive?"
Jerry Pournelle,"In any ethical situation, the thing you want least to do is probably the right action."
Jerry Pournelle,I think it takes about a million words to make a writer. I mean that you're going to throw away.
Jerry Pournelle,"I started in this racket in the early '70s, and when I was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, of which I was like the sixth president, I was the first one nobody ever heard of."
Jerry Pournelle,I have more information in one place than anybody in the world.
Jerry Pournelle,"Heinlein never had a best-seller. Even, I think, with Stranger in a Strange Land, I don't think it was actually on the New York Times best seller list."
Jerry Pournelle,"And that's another piece of advice I'll give junior writers; when you get to the point where they take you to lunch, let the editor suggest where to go."
Jerry Pournelle,"And meanwhile, the storytellers like me and Anderson, Silverberg... we tell stories. People like them. They want to know how it comes out, they want to know what the ending is."
Jerry Pournelle,"And in down times it shakes a lot of the bad SF out, a lot the stuff that was bought for literary reasons, which is neither entertaining nor great literature."
Jerry Pournelle,"The Aztecs believe they started up in what's now New Mexico, and wandered for 10,000 years before they got down into where they are now, in Mexico City. That's a weird legend."
Jerry Pournelle,"We're basically after Joe's beer money, and Joe likes his beer, so you better make sure that what you give him is at least as pleasurable to him as having his six-pack of beer would be."
Jerry Pournelle,"Asimov was the reason why we changed some rules in the SFWA, and I'm not convinced we changed it for the best."
Maury Povich,"His leads would be: The Redskins came on the field in their colors, burgundy, gold and Caucasian. Or Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns integrated the Redskins end zone three times. That's how he would do it."
Maury Povich,"Television viewers, they've been around a long time. They've been watching this thing now for 50 years. I mean, they know exactly what's happening when it comes to television programming. You can't put anything over on them anymore."
Maury Povich,It was the roughest time in my life. Connie helped me through it.
Maury Povich,"I'm hosting a quiz show, but I never considered myself a game show host."
Maury Povich,I think there's a good kid underneath everybody. I really do.
Maury Povich,"About six weeks later, she called because she had found a dress. And then she said yes."
Leon Powe,"The only thing we can control are wins and losses, and playing hard every time out. I expect us to go out and play hard and give it our all every time out. We know we can match up with any team in our conference. We got to have that confidence. You can't do anything with a lack of confidence."
Leon Powe,"To tell the truth I don't like playing this team. They give me headaches. It was one of the ugliest games. It felt like everything was in slow motion, and that's how they wanted it."
Leon Powe,"To tell you the truth, I don't like playing this team. They give me headaches."
Leon Powe,"I can show a lot of things I didn't show during the season. That's my plus side, what I'm happy about. I can shoot, dribble, post up, run the floor."
Leon Powe,"I was happy. I wasn't going to say anything about that. I looked around and said, 'Whoa! It's my lucky night."
Leon Powe,I was about to be happy.
Leon Powe,All the hard work and dedication is paying off now. We've just got to keep working hard and let everything take care of itself.
Leon Powe,"I came here for a win. My teammates and my coach did, too. We just have to use this for motivation for next game."
Leon Powe,"I told coach to put him back in. One foot, no foot, zero foot. Doesn't matter."
Colin Powell,"Far more Iraqis worry about our leaving too soon than about our staying too long, ... They need not worry, for we will neither leave too soon, nor stay too long."
Colin Powell,Colonel Wilkerson does not speak for or work for him.
Colin Powell,"Everybody knows what has to be done. The violence has to be brought down,"
Colin Powell,"Nobody is claiming that the level of violence is down where anybody could say it was either realistic or zero...But at the end of the day it is Mr Sharon who will make that judgment,"
Colin Powell,encouraging both of them to do everything they can to reduce the level of violence.
Colin Powell,It is very disturbing that the cycle of violence continues to go upward.
Colin Powell,"The looting and violence has gone down somewhat overnight,"
Colin Powell,deeply disturbed at this new escalation of the violence.
Colin Powell,"We discussed how it was necessary for all sides to move away from violence and incitement and to lift the siege as soon as possible to get economic activity restarted,"
Colin Powell,"We discussed how it is necessary for all sides to move away from violence and incitement and how it is necessary to lift the siege as soon as possible so that economic activity can begin again in the region. The challenge is how to get the process started,"
Colin Powell,"In accordance with this understanding, the two sides have agreed to restore the situation regarding the island that existed prior to July 2002. We believe this understanding is in the interests of both countries, and can serve as the basis for further steps in improving their bilateral relations."
Colin Powell,There is clear understanding of the need for some kind of monitoring observer function.
Colin Powell,"but the one thing I can assure you of is that it will be held in trust for the Iraqi people, to benefit the Iraqi people. That is a legal obligation that the occupying power will have."
Colin Powell,"No briefing book, no television picture can convey what really happened here."
Colin Powell,some of our embassies in addition to lacking up-to-date technology are not as secure as they should be - and so we have people who are not as secure as they should be.
Colin Powell,"Each donor will find its own way to contribute, but whatever form your support may take, it must be substantial because Iraq's requirements over the next few years are very substantial."
Colin Powell,"We support that goal,"
Colin Powell,That was a big mistake. It should never have been in the speech. I didn't need Joseph Wilson to tell me that there wasn't a Niger connection. He didn't tell us anything we didn't already know. I never believed it.
Colin Powell,"There are ways to talk about security, and there are ways to talk about intent, but they'll include a pact that will require some form of Senate confirmation or some form of legislative procedure,"
Colin Powell,We seek nothing for ourselves other than to bring security
Colin Powell,"We welcome Iraqis taking over security responsibilities,"
Colin Powell,they understand that security has to be number one.
Colin Powell,"The moment we find ourselves in now is a critical moment where we are being tested and where the Security Council of the United Nations and the international community is being tested,"
Colin Powell,The real issue is how do we fix the security and how do we put the pressure on the Sudanese government to do what needs to be done and how do we get the international community more fully mobilized?
Colin Powell,"We've just begun our consultations, and I'm encouraged by what I've heard so far from the Security Council representatives that I have spoken to, ... but this is a consultation and it is a negotiation and we are just now starting to look at language, so I wouldn't want to prejudge what my [Security] Council colleagues will agree to."
Colin Powell,"We know that Cuba has been doing some research with respect to biological offensive weapons possibly, and so we think that it is appropriate for us to point out this kind of activity,"
Colin Powell,This is very regrettable
Colin Powell,"We don't know whether they have been used for that purpose or not, but they were certainly designed and constructed for that purpose,"
Colin Powell,"I am prepared to go anywhere, anytime when it serves a useful purpose,"
Colin Powell,"I think the president has made his position clear: He wants the incursion stopped. He has noted some progress, but he wants to see more progress. And this is what I'll be discussing with Prime Minister Sharon in the morning,"
Colin Powell,"Never underestimate the power of a dictator, ... pretty much removed his [Hussein's] stings."
Colin Powell,there is no good reason to just trust the Iranian assurances. We need to see performance.
Colin Powell,"whole, free and at peace."
Colin Powell,an enemy of peace.
Colin Powell,"We want to be sure that the search for peace ... is seen in a broad regional context so that the quest doesn't stand alone in and of itself, ... obviously an increase in violence affects a number of issues throughout the region."
Colin Powell,"We think it is particularly outrageous that the young boy, the son, was held away from his parents, away from family members, for an extended period of time, and we were not notified in the timely manner that is required and expected, ... So we are expressing our displeasure about all of this to the Chinese government and expecting additional answers."
Colin Powell,We can't miss this opportunity.
Colin Powell,"examine possible measures of a diplomatic, economic or other nature as we move forward."
Colin Powell,"For the United States this is money well spent, ... not just a one-time shot."
Colin Powell,"There is no question in my mind ... it will get to the IAEA for consideration, ... There is not quite the sense of urgency I would have like to seen, but it is not a major problem for us."
Colin Powell,"I will always treasure the four years that I have spent with President Bush and with the wonderful men and women of the Department of State, ... I think we've accomplished a great deal."
Colin Powell,"There is no magic calendar as to when they should go in, ... They should go in when they have the authority to do their job."
Colin Powell,There is no magic calendar
Colin Powell,[He told NBC he was] very happy in my private life. ... It sounds fair to me.
Colin Powell,"As we start to encourage those southern tribes, I think they might start deciding that there's a better life ahead by separating themselves from the Taliban,"
Colin Powell,"We made clear to the leaders in the region that we want to move forward with negotiations as early as possible, ... And we're looking at different ways to do that once security has been established."
Colin Powell,imposed a visa ban on Zimbabwe's leaders and frozen their overseas assets.
Colin Powell,"In my conversations with the Saudi leaders ..., I've had no suggestion from them that they were about to ask us to leave,"
Colin Powell,language that might call on member states to do more.
Colin Powell,"They [terrorists] are criminals, they are murderers and they have to be dealt with and brought to justice. There was a basic understanding of that context among the ministers."
Colin Powell,are determined to see the guilty parties swiftly brought to justice.
Colin Powell,"I won't be happy until I see Mr. Karadzic and others standing before the bar of justice.,"
Colin Powell,"We have been asked by the Justice Department, those who are conducting this investigation, to make ourselves available for any purpose that they have, ... We have been asked to take a look at our calendars and documents to see if we have any information that is relevant to this inquiry, and we obviously will cooperate fully with the Department of Justice in getting the answers that they seek, as the president has directed us to do."
Colin Powell,"There's no basis for the story to begin with, and we're doing our jobs together."
Colin Powell,"I have made it clear that we have no intention of invading North Korea, of attacking North Korea, and on that basis we should find a way to move forward,"
Colin Powell,It has always been my intention that I would serve one term.
Colin Powell,"Since we have no intention of ratifying it, it is appropriate for us, because we have such serious problems with the ICC, to notify the ... secretary-general that we do not intend to ratify it and therefore we are no longer bound in any way to its purpose and objective, ... This Week."
Colin Powell,"Well, as you know, there have been a variety of reports coming in, intelligence reports that suggest we ought to be especially vigilant as we go into the Fourth of July season, ... Face the Nation."
Colin Powell,the intelligence system did not work well.
Colin Powell,"The very next sentence says that it had information that weapons had been dispersed to units,"
Colin Powell,"There was a lot of additional information that was very solid and substantiated that I didn't use because I didn't have time to use it all, and anything that we weren't totally comfortable with, we didn't use."
Colin Powell,"We have to make sure that all derogatory information we have on individuals who might be trying to get into the country are in that database, so that when our consular offices around the world receive a request for a visa and they put it into the database, we check every single name against our databases,"
Colin Powell,"We have some ideas, and we are examining what resources might be available, but I really need to talk to the Palestinians to see what their needs are before I make any announcements or commitments of anything."
Colin Powell,"because there has been movement, and because we are exchanging rather precise ideas as to how to bring this to a conclusion."
Colin Powell,"moving forward. We are in very intensive discussions and negotiations and exchanging ideas and papers and there has been movement, but that's as far as I'd like to go now."
Colin Powell,"We have some ideas with respect to security assurances which we will be presenting in due course,"
Colin Powell,"We don't want to hurt the Iraqi people,"
Colin Powell,I hope that the U.N. will not slip into irrelevance.
Colin Powell,"I hope that both sides will realize this is not the solution to any problem and that Macedonia should be free to live in peace without being attacked,"
Colin Powell,But I cannot give you a timeline as to when they'll all be home.
Colin Powell,irretrievable loss to the understanding of history and the efforts of Iraqi and international scholars to study and gain new insight into our past.
Colin Powell,"America's international counter-terrorism capability is strong, ... At all levels of government, we meet regularly, train together, share information, and use our resources as force multipliers."

Colin Powell,it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don't make a difficult situation that much more difficult.

Colin Powell,the rush toward conflict has slowed a bit.

We might actually have a better idea of what certain guys can't do."
Gary Powers,"That was the key to the game. We were cruising right along but they got two quick runs without really having to work at it and they were getting some momentum. But as soon as we hit those back-to-back home runs, it took the momentum right away."
Gary Powers,"In all honesty, we scored seven runs and that should have been enough to win the game. I give them credit, though. They are a hot team right now and they did what they needed to do. They forced us to make plays and we didn't make them."

Gary Powers,"We were lucky to get the two games in. Both teams played hard under the circumstances. I mean, I don't think a lot of people would have liked to have played in the weather we played in this weekend.

In fact, forcefully changing society to conform to societal images was the greatest cause of evil in the twentieth century."

Dennis Prager,"One of the great mind destroyers of college education is the belief that if it's very complex, it's very profound."
Dennis Prager,"Those who believe in nothing are very, very jealous and angry at those who believe in something."
Dennis Prager,Liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family.
Dennis Prager,Conservatives divide the world in terms of good and evil while liberals do it in terms of the rich and poor.
Dennis Prager,"Men need rule books. Women want men to intuit what they want. And only about 2% of men can do that, and most of them are not heterosexual."

Terry Pratchett,"God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of the players, (ie everybody), to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time."
Terry Pratchett,"Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder. Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels. Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment. Elves are terrific. They beget terror. The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. No one ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad."
Terry Pratchett,"The universe, they said, depended for its operation on the balance of four forces which they identified as charm, persuasion, uncertainty and bloody-mindedness."
Terry Pratchett,"You can't trust any bugger further than you can throw him, and there's nothing you can do about it, so let's have a drink"
Terry Pratchett,"The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it"
Terry Pratchett,"Humans need fantasy to be human. Take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.

Terry Pratchett,"The truth may be out there, but lies are inside your head."
Terry Pratchett,"The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it."

Terry Pratchett,"The intelligence of the creature known as a crowd, is the square root of the number of people in it."
Terry Pratchett,"Fantasy is an exercise bicycle for the mind. It might not take you anywhere, but it tones up the muscles that can. Of course, I could be wrong."

Terry Pratchett,It is often said that before you die your life passes before your eyes. It is in fact true. It's called living.
Terry Pratchett,"You can't trample infidels when you're a tortoise. I mean, all you could do is give them a meaningful look."
Terry Pratchett,"Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it."
Terry Pratchett,"Most gods throw dice, but Fate plays chess, and you don't find out til too late that he's been playing with two queens all along."
Terry Pratchett,In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this.
Terry Pratchett,"And therefore education at the University mostly worked by the age-old method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinity of a lot of books and hoping that something would pass from one to the other, while the actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns for exactly the same reason."
Terry Pratchett,Only in our dreams are we free. The rest of the time we need wages.
Hugh Prather,"Whenever we condemn, we cloak the world in pain."
Hugh Prather,Negative feedback is better that none. I would rather have a man hate me than overlook me. As long as he hates me I make a difference.
Hugh Prather,To live for results would be to sentence myself to continuous frustration. My only sure reward is in my actions and not from them.
Hugh Prather,"If the desire to write is not accompanied by actual writing, then the desire must be not to write."
Hugh Prather,Love expands.
Hugh Prather,"Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes."
Steve Prefontaine,"Most people race to see who is the fastest, I race to see who has the most guts."
Steve Prefontaine,"Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, 'I've never seen anyone run like that before.' It's more than just a race, it's a style. It's doing something better than anyone else. It's being creative."
Steve Prefontaine,"Somebody may beat me, but they are going to have to bleed to do it."
Steve Prefontaine,"I'm going to work so that it's a pure guts race at the end, and if it is, I am the only one who can win it."
Steve Prefontaine,"How does a kid from Coos Bay, with one leg longer than the other win races?"

Steve Prefontaine,What I want is to be number one.
Steve Prefontaine,"You have to wonder at times what you're doing out there. Over the years, I've given myself a thousand reasons to keep running, but it always comes back to where it started. It comes down to self-satisfaction and a sense of achievement."
Steve Prefontaine,To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.
Steve Prefontaine,"Something inside of me just said 'Hey, wait a minute, I want to beat him,' and I just took off."
Steve Prefontaine,I run to see who has the most guts.

Azim Premji,"We must overhaul our land laws, taxes and information system. Some 90 per cent of land in India is subject to legal disputes over ownership."

Azim Premji,We believe this combination of excellence in operations and strong execution of our strategy is critical to achieve our vision. We will continue to focus on both in future as well.
Azim Premji,The strategic initiatives we propose to undertake as part of our plan over the next few years position us well to lead this evolution.
Azim Premji,My company believes in hiring people based on merit.
Azim Premji,"Though delivery of superior solutions to our customers and creating sustainable value to the shareholders remain unchanged, we are devising strategies in anticipation of challenges and opportunities to focus on execution for higher operating productivity."
John Prendergast,"Early adopters of digital cameras most often printed at home, if they printed at all - there weren't many options yet available or convenient. Now the infrastructure to get digital prints at retail is in place and consumers are adopting this behavior more quickly, ... As the quality, functionality and ease-of-use of camera phones improve, we see users gravitating to the service, quality and cost-effectiveness of the retail destination."
John Prendergast,"Mobile imaging is still in its infancy, and we see the [mobile] printing [industry] having a similar growth pattern."
John Prendergast,"A government-made hurricane hit Darfur ... using these Janjaweed militias, ... And the human debris has washed up on the shores of Chad."

Dr. Prentice,We think that women who are currently on a low-fat diet can confidently continue on such a diet.
Dr. Prentice,Among the women who made larger reductions in saturated and trans fat we saw trends toward reduction in heart disease.
Dr. Prentice,"We observed that women in the low-fat diet group had a 9 percent lower risk of breast cancer than the usual diet group, but that difference could be due to chance."
Elvis Presley,Only thing worse than watching a bad movie is being in one

Morgan Pressel,"She's like a pop star. She said she lives in LA now, and I'm thinking, 'Where, Hollywood?' But all this attention is great for the tour."
Morgan Pressel,"There's a lot of competitiveness, especially from my Mom, ... I know she'd be proud of me. And it's not just golf. I'm competitive in everything, card games or whatever."
Morgan Pressel,"I know how to play golf. People look at age as something that should set me back, but I don't think it does."
David Price,"We have consensus on a couple of major points. One is the value of early retail contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and secondly, there needs to be a more diverse set of early contests. We're trying to give appropriate weight to both premises."
David Price,"Since we (the officials)Â are bound to Rules Book, we have to treat all shots 'through the green' exactly the same, ... Sure it's imperfect but believe it or not, the rules have evolved over the years. Maybe this will too."
David Price,"Having a kid like Will is a great joy. Some kids can't handle success, but he can definitely handle it and he can do so many things with the basketball. He can shoot it, he can handle it. He'd play any position I wanted him to play."
David Price,It's a great honor. Everyone on that list are people I heard about last year. I was able to play with a couple of them this summer. They are tremendous baseball players.
David Price,"A1 Team USA is focused so much on the driver and its race team, that it is an honor to be chosen to serve as part of this team for USA, ... I certainly will use my experience in the last 25 plus years to give Team USA the edge."
David Price,When those have hit he works very hard to get material in here so local contractors aren't having to pay the inflated rates. I would trust him with everything I had.
David Price,"The Rules of Golf do not differentiate between fairways, rough, or even aprons, stating all areas 'through the green' (all areas of the course except the teeing grounds, greens, and hazards) are similar in play. You can gain relief for an embedded ball in a closely mown area (see fairway), but 'closely mown' is only defined by local rules."
David Price,A lot of people would have written me off but I've faith in my heart and my chin.
David Price,"That's the main goal, this whole day is to make sure that that charity stays on their minds and people remember all of the fallen police and firefighters out there and their families."
David Price,"When he was in high school he was a man among boys and he's probably put on 40 pounds since high school. Eric's still the same, he's just fun to be around. He plays hard, he rebounds the ball, he loves to dunk and he's a great kid."
Lee Price,I'm dubious that the boost in corporate profitability from outsourcing has contributed much to creating new jobs.
Lee Price,That's not going to happen this time. We've got hundreds of thousands of people who had jobs who had to flee who don't have a job now or a place to live. There are wide areas where nobody is going to be able to live or work.
Lee Price,"Most of the population, they are not realizing real income gains."
Lee Price,"Until we can reach and sustain job growth of at least 150,000 every month, there will be growing slack in the job market. And until that happens, we are unlikely to see the kind of healthy wage and income growth that can sustain a strong recovery."
Lee Price,He had a lot of courage as a central banker. I give him a lot of credit.
Mark Price,"The budget has been cut before, but the money has always been found one way or another. This time, the money just wasn't there."
Mark Price,"This is the last step. I'll go home, we'll talk with my family and I want to be fair to Mark Cowan and the Dragons as well, and give them a decision in the near future because I know they need to get moving."
Mark Price,"The ones left are doing double duty, basically."
Mark Price,We're making sure our visitors and community are taken care of.
Mark Price,"Low-wage workers are also consumers. It's just common sense: when these workers have more take-home pay it leads to spending that trickles up to benefit many small, locally owned businesses."
Richard Price,I don't think you're going to see any significant difference in application of (MSHA) rules to the operators.
Richard Price,"I can never read this book, just like I can never see a movie that I wrote a screenplay for. I can read it and see it physically, but I can't accurately judge it. I'm too close to it. If I read it ten times I'll have ten different reactions."
Richard Price,"ADC's Fiber Distribution Hub best meets our network requirements relative to product features and functionality, performance, cost and proven success in the industry. We are very confident in our selection of ADC as a key supplier in support of our FTTX network deployment and are excited to be able to respond to the growing demands in our communities for advanced communication from the home."
Richard Price,I have expressed my regrets to the City. We made some mistakes out here and had some erosion problems.
Richard Price,I started thinking about my relationship with my students; I'm this guy who comes in from book - and movie - land and descends on angel wings into their classroom.
Richard Price,"There's a dangerous thrill - a rush - in goodness. If you don't keep your wits about you, if you don't have a very sober take on what you're doing and who you're doing it too, you can inadvertently set little fires. The very people you are helping can wind up, emotionally, in worse shape than they were before."
Richard Price,Very nice results. Pricing was a significant factor and they had no extraneous events in the quarter.
Richard Price,"I've worked in the sustainable design field for 10 years. And I wanted to finally practice what I preach. This kind of development is not only marketable, it's a feasible way to promote sustainable design."
Richard Price,"This book falls under the category of stuff I know, as opposed to stuff I need to learn."
Steve Price,"There's a lot of pride at stake, even in our practice matches, ... I'm really impressed with how hard they are working. There is a lot of good competition at practice, and that helps us stay tough."
Steve Price,I always want to be dealing with people I like and trust and who have a reputation for honesty and integrity.
Steve Price,"It was teeming  with a diversity of life, with mussels, tubeworms, fish and crabs. Struggles  for survival were playing out before our eyes. The incredible multitude  of crabs in combat with each other for existence is an image I will  never forget."
Steve Price,He is well-conditioned and a great athlete. We want him to get into the third period and let his conditioning take over.
Charley Pride,"I think they do that not just with the election, but in general."
Charley Pride,It's a way to showcase themselves and get involved in the community.
Charley Pride,"When I came up, there was room for the new and the old. For every new artist, an old one didn't have to be pushed out."
Charley Pride,"What we don't need in country music is divisiveness, public criticism of each other, and some arbitrary judgement of what belongs and what doesn't."
Charley Pride,"What qualifies me to tell people how to act or what to think? I'm Charley Pride, country singer. Period."
Charley Pride,"Until MTV, television had not been a huge influence on music. To compete with MTV, the country music moguls felt they had to appeal to the same young audience and do it the way MTV did."
Charley Pride,There is an intimacy about the Opry Theater that gives an entertainer a special charge.
Charley Pride,The time I spent thinking about how I was better than somebody else or worrying about somebody else's attitude was time I could put to better use.
Charley Pride,The tastes of country music fans are not limited to the narrow range defined by consultants and programmers and record company moguls.
Charley Pride,Singing as a full-time job was not something I had given a lot of thought to and I had no clear notion of the money to be made in it.
Charley Pride,Redd Foxx was the same gruff old codger you saw on television.
Charley Pride,"Performing is an experience, for me, that is as humbling as it is energizing."
Charley Pride,"Once your name becomes well known, politicians come courting."
Charley Pride,No one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another-I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.
Charley Pride,"It used to be that if you had a pretty good record, you could stop by a station in Little Rock or Atlanta and let the DJ listen to it. No way something like that can happen now."
Charley Pride,"It isn't reasonable to expect that everyone in the world is a country music fan. Not yet, anyway."
Charley Pride,In 20 years I had sold more records for RCA than any artist except Elvis Presley.
Charley Pride,I've tried to help a lot of young artists get started.
Charley Pride,I think there's enough room in country music for everybody.
Charley Pride,I learned to tune a guitar by ear. That method has served me pretty well.
Charley Pride,"For most entertainers, there is a single experience, one defining moment, when confidence replaces the self-doubt that most of us wrestle with."
Charley Pride,"Fans will praise you, scold you, and offer helpful advice. Fans will also defend you."
Charley Pride,Fans are what make a performer and I've always taken them seriously.
Charley Pride,Chet Atkins... is probably the best guitar player who ever lived.
Charley Pride,A black man singing about a blond girl was potential trouble.
Charley Pride,Any entertainer who tells you that the adoration of fans is not a heady experience probably never had the experience.
Charley Pride,"A fan will grab you and hug you and will not let go. When that happens, you wish it could be that way all over the world."
Charley Pride,"Even now, when I'm asked how I'm doing, I like to reply, 'Pretty good. I've got all my fingers and both eyes."
Charley Pride,"I was always a dreamer, in childhood especially. People thought I was a little strange."
Charley Pride,I grew up not liking my father very much. I never saw him cry. But he must have. Everybody cries.
Yevgeny Primakov,"The question is whether we're ready to undertake responsibility for overcoming the crisis or will again sink in debates, mutual recriminations and half-steps,"
Yevgeny Primakov,"I think that after the election in Kosovo the circumstances for dialogue will be better,"
Yevgeny Primakov,"Quickly passing the budget will strengthen our stance in the talks with international financial organizations,"
Scott Prince,He's very aggressive and he's a forward we had problems with a few weeks ago when we were playing the Cowboys. I suppose they're really going to miss his presence.
Scott Prince,"I think college is possible. I think you have to plan ahead a little bit, and make use of all of the resources available to you."
Scott Prince,I know college is expensive but it can be affordable. It's no surprise that financing college can seem to be a daunting task.
Scott Prince,He (Hodgson) would have been my first choice as well. He led my choices. He's a great bloke and a good friend. I support him 100 percent.
Victoria Principal,"Every year on her birthday, she would pick out a song which she would force me to sing at the top of my lungs with perverted lyrics. And she loved it. I tried to get in touch a few times, but she really wanted to be on her own."
Victoria Principal,"Success doesn't mean that you are healthy, success doesn't mean that you're happy, success doesn't mean that you're rested. Success really doesn't mean that you look good, or feel good, or are good."
Victoria Principal,I believe that how you feel is very important to how you look - that healthy equals beautiful.
Victoria Principal,"Unless we keep this planet healthy, everything else is for naught."
Jeff Probst,"[While not physically as strong, the women realized they had certain other advantages in competing against men stuck together for weeks in the tropics -- including the strategic use of a string bikini.] The women knew they could manipulate them, ... and the men were ready to be manipulated."
Jeff Probst,"[Judd Sergeant â€”] He's just one big opinion. Everything is 'man' this and 'man' that, ... He's a doorman by trade."
Jeff Probst,I finally met someone who could teach me about love.
Jeff Probst,definitely in love. More in love that I was six months ago.
Jeff Probst,"[Rafe Judkins â€”] The Ivy League student from Pittsburgh is very likable, ... It's funny; before the show he had taken a course in Mayan culture."
Jeff Probst,It was a lot of fun because we never had anyone on the show with such a lie to tell and tell it so well.
Jeff Probst,"You'll see many people on their back, on their knees, throwing up, eyes rolling back."
Jeff Probst,"It was a doozy. People were on their knees, on their backs, throwing up and having their eyes rolling back in their heads."
Jeff Probst,"I know the big events, like if a camp burned down from a fire. But in terms of the minutiae from day to day... not much. If somebody's just whining, I won't know about it, because everybody whines. But if there's a legitimate concern that a person may quit tonight at tribal council, then yes, I need to know that. Tribal council lasts anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half."
Jeff Probst,"In a 12-month study using Blue Sun's B20 biodiesel, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found nitrogen oxide (NOx) was reduced by 4 percent compared to conventional diesel."
Jeff Probst,"In a 12-month study using Blue Sun's B20 biodiesel, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found nitrogen oxide (NOx) was reduced by 5 percent compared to conventional diesel."
Jeff Probst,"Think about for a minute what your body goes through out there. On a Friday night, you have a steak and then Saturday morning, you get up and have some eggs and some pancakes. Then Sunday, you're on 'Survivor' and suddenly you have nothing."
Jeff Probst,There's something to be said for embracing who you are.
Jeff Probst,"The thing that surprises me most is, you cannot change who you are."
Jeff Probst,Survivor is like rock 'n' roll - you can do what you want.
Jeff Probst,"Reality is a genre that seems to be here to stay. I don't know how many of the new shows will last, but the more competition you have, the harder that pie is to slice up."
Jeff Probst,"My goal was, and still is, to write first, direct my own stuff whenever possible and control my own creative destiny."
Jeff Probst,"Most people I run into say, I haven't missed an episode. Either you like Survivor or you don't, but if you do, you're a loyal viewer."
Jeff Probst,"I'm not one of these guys who says, Now I'm on a really hot show, better quit soon before I get labeled. That's the most ridiculous notion I'd ever heard."
Jeff Probst,I feel good about the work I do on Survivor and am proud of my contribution.
Jeff Probst,"Everyone wants to talk, you've just got to find a way to get them to talk."
Jeff Probst,Every day I get more and more honest.
Jeff Probst,"In Survivor and Finder's Fee, it is about what you would do if you could get away with it. Survivor is about your own integrity and where you draw your own ethical and moral lines. There are no rules."
Jeff Probst,"They sign up for ... the adventure of a lifetime, ... And that includes the highest highs and the lowest lows."
Romano Prodi,There is nothing to worry about; we are serene.
Romano Prodi,"Finally this electoral story is over. After the court ruling, Italians have no further doubts about our victory. Now we are working for a strong government and to resolve the problems of Italian society."
Romano Prodi,Finally the electoral affair is over. Italians have no more doubts about our victory.
Romano Prodi,"As was obvious, the check hasn't brought anything new. Our victory is confirmed."
Romano Prodi,"As was obvious, the review (of the ballot) hasn't made any difference. The victory is confirmed."
Romano Prodi,"The longer the torment, the sweeter the victory."

Romano Prodi,We'll work for our electors but also to gain the trust of those who legitimately voted for the other coalition.

Romano Prodi,"This is above our every expectation,"
Romano Prodi,We will take important initiatives in the areas of water and energy. I call on others to follow our lead.
Romano Prodi,"A grand coalition is not only extraneous to our program, but it happens when no majority emerges from the elections. In this case, a majority came out."
Romano Prodi,"The government is the same as that formed after the April 1996 elections, ... The core of our programs has not changed."
Romano Prodi,The only solution is early elections.
Romano Prodi,"A move like this, with elections nearing, can cause a sense of anguish and fear, and there is no need for that."

Romano Prodi,"Democracy goes on, sometimes slowly, but it does. It is a very important step."
Romano Prodi,The Italians no longer have any doubt about our victory. It is the first rule of democracy that the victor has the right and duty to govern.
Romano Prodi,It's very sad that such things can happen in a mature democracy.
Romano Prodi,"With the pencil and the ballot sheet, the weapons of democracy, we will win."
Romano Prodi,"This would be a very grave violation of a law of state, the law on equal access, which defends democracy by preventing overexposure in the media. Laws of state are made to be observed."
Romano Prodi,I ask you all to keep patient. This delay is incomprehensible.
Romano Prodi,"When you fight so hard and do not reach the goal, we must see this as a defeat for me, a defeat for our campaign. Denmark has spoken -- our people the Danes have spoken -- and I'm very pleased that so many Danes have cast their vote, ... We will continue along our path."
Romano Prodi,This data is worse than what had been given to the European Commission. There's an increase in debt for a second year in a row after there had been such an effort made to lower it.
Romano Prodi,a serious danger that must be met with eyes wide open.
Romano Prodi,We can govern for five years. Of course we'll need cooperation.
Romano Prodi,"We can govern for five years. Of course we'll need cooperation, but last night I said we would work for all Italians, not just some of them."
Romano Prodi,"They won't still believe his lies. They have believed him once, have seen the consequences, and will decide accordingly."
Romano Prodi,Italy's sole commitment will be for reconstruction and aid.
Romano Prodi,"It is a clear sign of commitment to closer relations between the EU and Russia,"
Romano Prodi,It's time that we close this strange comedy and move forward.
Romano Prodi,The game is over. And I'm glad. It's time to recognize our victory so that this strange comedy can end and we can move on like we should.
Romano Prodi,"an attack against a diplomat in such circumstances is an attack against democracy, the founding principle of the European Union."
Romano Prodi,"The Lithuanian voters have made a historic choice over this weekend, one which I am sure is the right one,"
Romano Prodi,This is the final exam for a student that deserves to be failed. In the budget there is little or nothing to stimulate economic development.
Romano Prodi,It?s like a bed sheet. It?s the result of this disastrous electoral law and it should be displayed in all Italian homes.
Romano Prodi,"Today the voters have given a clear message. That the arrogance of the government will not succeed,"
Romano Prodi,"In the darkest days of European history, America stood close by us and today we stand close by America, nothing will ever be the same."
Romano Prodi,They will be present. It was part of the electoral agreement.
Romano Prodi,"are all under attack, and we behave with a joint action because of that."
Romano Prodi,It should not have waited until we were forced to count the dead to take action.
Chris Pronger,"My understanding, they're going to be calling it the same way. I can't really give you an answer until we really get started to see what they're going to do. But what they say and what they do, we'll find out."
Chris Pronger,It's our game we have to worry about. It's always our game.
Chris Pronger,It doesn't matter what happens with the other games and the other teams as long as we keep our destiny in our own hands.
Chris Pronger,We're going back to a building that's obviously going to be electric. I haven't played in Canada in the playoffs. It's going to be a lot of fun.
Chris Pronger,I know I've been constantly watching what I put into my body. I think this process has us on edge because it's not an exact science.
Chris Pronger,"You've got to face some adversity, hopefully, we've learned a lot from today's game. We've got to find our own identity and not look back to '02."
Skip Prosser,"I think the foul trouble with Johnson helped a little bit, but our guys did an excellent job against Thornton. He's an excellent player."
Skip Prosser,We talk a lot of times about executing your way out of trouble instead of shooting your way out of trouble. We had some guys make some outstanding individual plays.
Skip Prosser,"I think it's a role that's fluid, to be determined as practice ensues,"
Skip Prosser,It's up to me to coach him to maximize his talents and to reach his full potential. He's a young man who tries very hard. My goal is to continue to try to coach him to be more productive as he played.
Skip Prosser,"When you get one and they get two shots, it's really hard to win."
Skip Prosser,We're not very happy with our record in the league.
Skip Prosser,They're a great free-throw shooting team. One of our goals was to try to keep them out of the 1 and 1 early. We didn't do that.
Skip Prosser,They beat us handily both times we played this season. They have a Hall of Fame coach and two of the premier players in our conference. They have a stupendous record in this tournament. We hope we honor them by playing to our potential.
Skip Prosser,"There's no question it's a different approach. Any dreams we have of the NCAA Tournament are totally dependent on what we do in Greensboro. We're cognizant of that, and there's no question the approach is 180 degrees different."
Skip Prosser,That's a formula for disaster.
Skip Prosser,He gives the other players courage.
Skip Prosser,"Coach [John] Wooden used seven players at UCLA. Coach [Denny] Crum used to say, 'The more moving parts you have, the greater the chance you have for a breakdown.' I think there's a lot of veracity to that."
Skip Prosser,"Joe Dukes, our freshman, has yet to play a college basketball game, so he'll have to learn on the job. It's very difficult league for on-the-job training."
Skip Prosser,"You guys saw the game, they were guarding him with, like, four guys. They had the Red Army down there on him but our other guys have to make plays as well."
Skip Prosser,"We know Williams is effective, but the other team knows that, too. They had the Red Army down there on him, and our other guys have to make plays as well."
Skip Prosser,"It shows we can beat a quality team. Our ability to play well against N.C. State, hopefully, will give us some confidence going into the Florida State game."

Marcel Proust,"Our intellect is not the most subtle, the most powerful, the most appropriate, instrument for revealing the truth. It is life that, little by little, example by example, permits us to see that what is most important to our heart, or to our mind, is learned not by reasoning but through other agencies. Then it is that the intellect, observing their superiority, abdicates its control to them upon reasoned grounds and agrees to become their collaborator and lackey."
Marcel Proust,"Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way"
Marcel Proust,Often it is just lack of imagination that keeps a man from suffering very much.

Marcel Proust,A fashionable milieu is one in which everybody's opinion is made up of the opinion of all the others. Has everybody a different opinion? Then it is a literary milieu.
Marcel Proust,"Your soul is a dark forest. But the trees are of a particular species, they are genealogical trees."

Marcel Proust,"Time, which changes people, does not alter the image we have retained of them."
Marcel Proust,"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."

Marcel Proust,What a profound significance small things assume when the woman we love conceals them from us.
Marcel Proust,"We must never be afraid to go too far, for truth lies beyond."
Marcel Proust,"There is no man, however wise, who has not at some period of his youth said things, or lived in a way the consciousness of which is so unpleasant to him in later life that he would gladly, if he could, expunge it from his memory."

Marcel Proust,The bonds that unite another person to our self exist only in our mind.
Marcel Proust,The charms of the passing woman are generally in direct proportion to the swiftness of her passing.
