Mikhail Saakashvili,It means ... (we have) somebody at the table who could basically convince ... Russia that peace-making pays off ... we are working closely with the Americans on our peace plan and with the Russians on our peace plan.
Mikhail Saakashvili,"Understandably, no peace can sustained when people continue to suffer from hunger, lack of jobs, lack of basic public services - and most of all - lack of opportunity or hope."
Mikhail Saakashvili,"In any case there was no danger whatsoever for the presidents,"
Mikhail Saakashvili,He understood the shortcoming which we had. He understood we had corruption.
Mikhail Saakashvili,Our place is in European civilization.
Mikhail Saakashvili,"Today is the greatest day in the history of Georgia -- this is the day of our dignity, the birth of a new Georgia."
Mikhail Saakashvili,the army switched sides.
Mikhail Saakashvili,you've got a solid friend in America.
Nick Saban,"I'm not going to comment on and worry about who the starter is and when the starter is [being named]. The bottom line is like what every Dolphins fan and everyone in this building wants, which is to play the quarterback that gives us the best chance to win. That's what we're trying to do and work toward."
Nick Saban,"If we just didn't do that kind of stuff, we wouldn't have to worry about it."
Nick Saban,"I am not going to comment on and worry about who or when the starter is (going to be named) because the bottom line is, like every Dolphins fan, everybody that I know and everybody that works in this building, wants to play the quarterback that is going to give us the best opportunity to win. That is what we are going to try to do and work toward."
Nick Saban,I think he got enough work in the preseason to be ready for the first game. We did the best we could under the circumstances. We'll continue to try to develop him in the beginning of the season.
Nick Saban,It doesn't mean that just because we work somebody out that we have an issue. That is not something that anybody should assume. There are things called information gathering and we are allowed to use workouts of players who are not under contract to gather information about those players.
Nick Saban,"It was great that Ronnie Brown got untracked a little bit. We told him we were going to work him today. As the game wore on, it looked like he got a little better. Maybe that'll be a sign for us in the future."
Nick Saban,"There are a lot of questions about the offensive line, and we're going to continue to work some different players in different spots to get the best combination of what we can do,"
Nick Saban,"Just like in Scent of a Woman , you know, when the guy is up there and Al Pacino gives the speech to the headmaster -- give him a chance."
Nick Saban,"Understanding how important slotting is to top draft picks in terms of who got what . . . and how they fall into place, this is really a timing issue,"
Nick Saban,"Gus has a good understanding of the offense, he's very knowledgeable. And I think (he) can manage the game the best with a pretty young offensive team right now. . . . We weren't displeased with the job any of the quarterbacks did, but we felt that Gus would give us the best opportunity to be successful."
Nick Saban,"Gus has a good understanding of the offence. He's very knowledgeable, and we felt he would give us the best opportunity to be successful and develop this offensive team."
Nick Saban,"Gus has a good understanding of the offense. He's very knowledgeable, and we felt he would give us the best opportunity to be successful and develop this offensive team."
Nick Saban,I think every guy's different when it comes to that. Some guys are very instinctive and very understanding and therefore don't need to see it on the field as much.
Nick Saban,We're trying to get a deal that would satisfy him as well as work for us.
Nick Saban,"We have a sense of urgency about trying to get him ready, but we're not going to rush him and put him in a position where it's not going to be something he can have success at."
Nick Saban,"He did a fantastic job, especially at the end of the game. That's the toughest it ever gets. They're trying to take the air out of him. They're putting them all out there to stop you. He broke two runs that were as big as any in the game."
Nick Saban,"But what does it really mean? ... What are you trying to get from it? Basically, what you're trying to do is push people to a limit, not [to] ever harm them in any way, and get them to manage the 'bottom half,' the hard part of it that we all have to deal with in our life."
Nick Saban,I think he has the arm talent to do it. He can do it.
Nick Saban,"We have to do it, have success doing it, and then do it again,"
Nick Saban,"This was probably Ricky's best overall game out there, in terms of him having some space to work in, not only as a runner, but a couple of times as a receiver as well."
Nick Saban,"We were recruiting a player who had a coach from another school using the NFL as a negative about our program, ... The player said to him -- and I'm not making this up -- 'If the coach of your school is so good, why aren't they trying to hire him in the NFL?'"
Nick Saban,We have voids at linebacker and safety. We could use a more few defensive linemen.
Nick Saban,"He did some straight-line running (Monday). He threw the ball some. He took some easy drops. So it's not like this guy is not at a point where he can't start doing some things. Now, I didn't see all that. I'm just going on what the trainer and the people doing the rehab with him did. But he was there early and stayed late and worked hard. We were pleased with what he did."
Nick Saban,"We want to support every player, and I think every player knows he has a responsibility for what to do and what not to do. As a coach, I also feel a responsibility to put a player in the best situation possible so he can have success."
Nick Saban,"We all have a professional responsibility as clubs to live by the confidentiality rules, which are designed to protect players. However the information got out, I hope those people will take that responsibility and let us make any necessary changes. ... I'm going to be proactive in that effort."
Nick Saban,"The responsibility (Belichick) gave me with the Browns, well, I wouldn't be able to do what I do now if I hadn't had that kind of responsibility,"
Nick Saban,"We've obviously started our research in terms of what the options are going to be for us. One of the goals that we have is to develop the players we have so somebody can be a starter for our organization in the future, or to bring somebody to the organization that has the potential to be a future starter relative to our situation."
Nick Saban,There's a twofold purpose. Not just for bad weather but sometimes helping players recover.
Nick Saban,We just want to continue to be able to let them develop and progress. We're not disappointed in anybody. We're actually encouraged by our ability to throw the ball with consistency in the game by all the quarterbacks.
Nick Saban,Maybe we can create some problems and issues for teams by doing that.
Nick Saban,"At this point, I'm not ready to say that changing quarterbacks is going to solve all our problems, so that's where it's at."
Nick Saban,"If you don't have an indoor facility, you've got to cut down the practice time in preparation for the game so the players can recover. Or you change the environment they do the work in, which an indoor facility allows you to do. It's really a player health and safety issue as much as anything."
Nick Saban,"He did well, actually better than I thought he would. We did not want him to go the whole practice because we didn't want him to get in an overuse situation where he might fatigue that particular injury and have additional problems."
Nick Saban,"I would stop short of saying that Ronnie was 100 percent, but he did do everything in practice. Those decisions will be made on a day-to-day basis."
Nick Saban,"Nobody in this room, with all of our power and might put together, can have anything to do with where it goes. What we can try to do is have something to do with preparing for the game and doing our job well and having pride in the performance of what we have to do."
Nick Saban,There may be 25 players out there we feel are potential guys that would be first-round picks regardless of where we pick. We have to bring to some kind of organizational order to who brings the most value to us. That's something that's a work in progress.
Nick Saban,"While we do this, from a player's perspective it would be advantageous if we got fan support."
Nick Saban,There are times when we are getting an outstanding performance from the running back. There are times when we are getting a hat on a hat to finish a block. We just have to do it more consistently. ... It's just a matter of execution on a more consistent basis from the entire unit.
Nick Saban,"The Pac-10 obviously did pretty well against the SEC this past week, ... Our players need to be aware of that and know that our league is nationally-known and when we go play places people are anxious to play us."
Nick Saban,"One of the most difficult parts of my job is having to release players, and the past week has emphasized this fact. This is especially true when those players made significant contributions to the success of the team in the past. Ideally, we would like to keep many of those players on our roster, but we are simply not able to do that."
Nick Saban,"We went ahead and took the guy we could get. If the opportunity presents itself to get a quality, young quarterback in the draft, we will do it."
Nick Saban,"If we can get it worked out, maybe he will have the opportunity to play. If he can't, we will have his services later."
Nick Saban,"It's certainly an area that, if the opportunity presents itself, we will try to make some improvements in."
Nick Saban,We want to pick the quarterback that's going to give us the best opportunity to win. I'm not prepared after watching that game to make a statement about that.
Nick Saban,"John St. Clair will probably get an opportunity to play someplace else. We certainly wish him the best and in a lot of ways we would like to have him on our team again, but that may not happen."
Nick Saban,"It was a good opportunity for us to go out and practice in not so favorable conditions, and that may benefit us someday down the road."
Nick Saban,"If that is what it takes and gives us the best opportunity to win, the best opportunity to be successful and play winning football on offense, it's not something we wouldn't consider doing,"
Nick Saban,This is an opportunity for each and every one of those guys to show what they can do.
Nick Saban,"We understand the serious nature of the charges and certainly don't condone in any way the type of conduct which has been alleged. However, we will not make a comment about this specific matter until we collect more information."
Nick Saban,"When you have reached the pinnacle as a player of what you have always aspired for, what's your motivation? ... Some guys just work their tail off because they want to be good. It's important to them and their pride. Those guys have a better chance to succeed than the guy who did all of that to get here, and now all of a sudden the things that got him here don't seem to be important anymore."
Nick Saban,"I thought it was a very disappointing first half for us, to make some of the mistakes we made and get in a hole. Obviously we need to improve our ability to play in the beginning of games."
Nick Saban,He's done a good job. He has minimized his mental mistakes. He's become a starter and he has played fast in the games and made some plays. We (will) keep working with him in hopes that he'll be able to execute on a consistent basis and continue to eliminate those mental errors that can get him in trouble.
Nick Saban,I think everybody makes mistakes. People do things that they regret.
Nick Saban,We were very effective using both of those guys. I think we're learning and growing on how we do that.
Nick Saban,We're pleased to have someone as well-respected as Dom join the Dolphins. He brings a wealth of knowledge to Miami and will be a valuable addition to our staff.
Nick Saban,"Philosophically, I don't there's a lot of difference in terms of what we like to do. His knowledge of the league and being able to define things internally in the organization, so you have everybody on the same page, are probably his greatest assets. That and recognition of what people can do - the strength of players, coaches and people in the organization - and putting them in position where they can have success doing it."
Nick Saban,[Capers] brings a wealth of knowledge and will be a valuable addition to our staff. I'm sure his contributions will help us continue to improve as a team.
Nick Saban,"I tell my kids that a few times, too."
Nick Saban,We didn't do what we needed to do to get a stop. We have to do a better job as coaches getting our players ready so we have a better chance to be successful in those situations and we have to be more consistent in the way we perform.
Nick Saban,We have no intention of moving or trading Jason Taylor .
Nick Saban,We're still in the information-gathering stage. People like to ask strategic questions about what we're going to do.
Nick Saban,Nothing has changed. There is no new information.
Nick Saban,"We don't have to have a reason to bring anybody in. Sometimes, you have to gather information (in case) we need to."
Nick Saban,"We didn't get any information back, so I can't really report what the [problem] is with him, what the issue is, what we'll have to do to deal with that, if anything, in the future,"
Nick Saban,"When you bring guys in late, their learning curve, their resource of information, isn't what the other guys are so they're trying to learn everything at once. [We made the move] based on his performance in the last two games, his knowledge and experience."
Nick Saban,"The most disappointing thing to me is I don't think we showed improvement,"
Nick Saban,I don't feel like we have enough depth. Lance has certainly made a lot of improvement. He is a veteran player that's starting to feel more comfortable in the system. He did make a couple of good plays in this game.
Nick Saban,I don't see that changing significantly. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of new ideas that will complement that and help us improve in a lot of areas we need to improve in.
Nick Saban,"He is not badly hurt. He told me today that if it were the regular season, he would play in this game, but we are obviously not going to take any chances."
Nick Saban,"You would hope that a guy would want to do something for positive reasons, because he wants to be successful and he buys into the things that can make him successful at what he does."
Nick Saban,"It happens every week, so it is not fair to the players, in all honesty."
Nick Saban,It's been wonderful. I really do feel like this was coming home to play a game and it was exciting for me even though I didn't say it (earlier). It was exciting to be back in Tiger Stadium and I feel really great that our team did a nice job to make us proud of how they played.
Nick Saban,"Nobody has a crystal ball. Nobody can make a prediction. But based on history, the guy is making good progress to come back. ... And as you see his progress being made, it doesn't become a leap of faith to determine whether the guy can come back."
Nick Saban,We try to prevent health problems from happening. We space practices out where you have two meals and two opportunities to get hydrated.
Nick Saban,"Personally, I hate to release any of the guys. I feel like this is our team. These guys have been here. They've worked hard. They've all made a tremendous commitment and sacrifice to trying to make the team. I have a lot of respect for what they've tried to do and feel badly that every guy can't, maybe, realize his dreams."
Nick Saban,It's kind of hard to get everybody ready to start.
Nick Saban,I am so happy for Ricky. He has played a great role for this team all year. He has been unselfish and has been a really good team guy.
Nick Saban,"It's safe to say he's going to be out for, probably, a couple of games, I don't know."
Nick Saban,One game a season doesn't make.
Nick Saban,against things we haven't seen and that we will see in the near future.
Nick Saban,Our goal is to work against things we have not seen that we will see in the near future.
Nick Saban,I'm getting too old to run (or) jog. We have fun. It's probably good for the staff that we get together and do something like that.
Nick Saban,We all like winning. The fun of this is a job well done. The purpose of what we do is to have success. We focused a lot this year on the process of what you need to do to be successful. I think this team has bought into that and has a belief system that has been beneficial to how we've competed.
Nick Saban,"When you're talking about this position, you'd like to really know what a guy's football intuition, instinct and knowledge is and what the capacity for those things are. That's probably as big of a reason [for the visit]. We'd just like to get to know him."
Nick Saban,"We had a great first drive. We looked like a good football team, but we've got to do that with consistency. We just have to take advantage of field position when we get it."
Nick Saban,We had a great first drive. We looked like a good football team. But we've got to do that with consistency.
Nick Saban,"Gus has the best understanding of the offense right now. We feel like he hasn't played his best football yet, but with his knowledge and understanding and leadership, we're hopeful that he can show continued improvement, and that we can make some improvement as an offensive team. We've had spots of doing those types of things, and hopefully we'll continue to be more consistent."
Nick Saban,"Football is football. When guys don't do things that are intentional to hurt somebody, which neither one of those things were, I think it's a little ridiculous. And it happens every week. It's not fair to the players."
Nick Saban,"It's not the kind of football I like to see from our team. We'll work hard to try to get it fixed. There is no excuse for it. We dropped balls, we didn't execute, we didn't play with the kind of urgency and intensity that good teams play with. Everybody needs to decide what kind of team we're going to have."
Nick Saban,The last couple of days I've seen it in a lot of guys' eyes to the point where you really have a lot of compassion.
Nick Saban,"We're fortunate to be able to add someone with Mike's knowledge and experience to our staff. (With the Bills), he instilled in his players a sense of belief in his system and those leadership skills will serve him well in his new role."
Nick Saban,It's an expectation: What are the most important things to accomplish at this time? To find out as much as we can about what those combinations are may be more important at this time than the end result so we can build on a better end result in the long term.
Nick Saban,We have to get the kind of execution at quarterback that will give it to them.
Nick Saban,"I think that's a great example -- and those players know it who were involved -- that to play a game for 60 minutes, you've got to be disciplined and you never want to have undisciplined, unprovoked penalties like that. My advice is act like you've been there."
Nick Saban,"He sets a good example. He's a hard worker, a great person, a good guy. He tries to do everything that you want him to do. ... I think that his energy level and his example certainly affect other people."
Nick Saban,"We want to duplicate enthusiasm and team energy,"
Nick Saban,"I'm not blaming anybody, because that's not my nature, but we certainly didn't have the energy and enthusiasm we've had up to this point. We just didn't look like the same team out there, and I can't give you any reason exactly why."
Nick Saban,"I'm not blaming it on anything because that's not my nature, ... but we certainly didn't have the energy and enthusiasm that we've played with to this point."
Nick Saban,I would hope that self-indulgence is not something that we're concerned about at this point. Personal ego has to be given up a little bit out of respect for one another.
Nick Saban,"There is no doubt that quarterback is a critical position in every organization. That really has to be something that we look at to make a good assessment on how we move ahead at that position. We like all of the quarterbacks that we have here, but if we get an opportunity to improve the quality at that position, we most certainly will."
Nick Saban,"Our doctors felt comfortable about the circumstance of his injury, where he is in his rehab and where he can be in the future. It's our goal to get him ready for this season. He's on schedule to do that."
Nick Saban,"That's all bull, It's an excuse, and I'm not giving the players an excuse. You either have discipline or you don't. If we're going to give them a reason to fail all the time ... It's like my kid: `You got a D on the test? I don't want to hear about it.You didn't prepare well enough. You didn't have enough discipline to do what you had to do when you had to do it the way it was supposed to get done."
Nick Saban,"I've looked at all of them. Just because you're on a diet doesn't mean you can't look at the menu, right?"
Nick Saban,I think everybody needs to understand that we're not really changing our offense and we're not changing our defense. We're going to keep things as consistent for our players as we can.
Nick Saban,"We missed a couple of throws and had a couple of turnovers. . . We made some big plays on defense, which helped us. We just have to take advantage of the field position when we get it."
Nick Saban,"I haven't been pleased with the tackling on the perimeter of our defense for several weeks now. We are either going to get it out of the guys we have or we are going to get somebody who will do it, because that won't be tolerated."
Nick Saban,"He is one of the best quarterbacks in the country, and probably the best quarterback in the SEC. He makes good choices and decisions; they only have one turnover all year. ... He doesn't make a lot of bad plays."
Nick Saban,"This was just a conversation about would I be interested or not,"
Nick Saban,"My last conversation was awhile back and was really about our heritage, trying to figure out where we came from and what we did,"
Nick Saban,"(That) can only be brought about by a lot of conversation and getting to know someone. I don't know this particular player well enough to make that determination right now, but it's something we might be interested in in the future."
Nick Saban,You don't control whether you can go up or down sometimes. It's not something that you can just do because you want to. What is available to you may have some impact on what you decide to do if you did have an opportunity to do it.
Nick Saban,Right tackle has been somewhat of a problem. Us getting it together as a group with consistency has been somewhat of a problem that we need to improve on.
Nick Saban,"I think we still have a lot of areas we need to clean up and improve, and consistency is probably the big one. I don't think we're where we need to be or where we can be."
Nick Saban,Just think of the consequences of those penalties. There were several third-down stops that gave them first downs with penalties. It's the consequences of it that everybody needs to understand.
Nick Saban,"We have total faith, trust and confidence in the guy,"
Nick Saban,"I have total faith, trust and confidence in the guy, ... He's going to be a long-snapper for a long time in this league."
Nick Saban,"We have competition at safety and I think that's healthy and good, but I don't think that warrants any changes at this point."
Nick Saban,We will establish a plan for it and I'm sure that he will make a commitment to the plan and do everything that he can to do it.
Nick Saban,"The thing they were most concerned about is that he had a commitment to come back and try to help the team be successful,"
Nick Saban,"I think there's a pretty good formula for guys who at some point in time were college coaches and then they go to the NFL and, in whatever capacity they serve, they develop even further. When they go back to college, they're even more prepared, and they succeed there."
Nick Saban,"I've worked with Kirby and Bo and know the qualities they possess. They both have coached at successful major college programs, allowing them to make a smooth transition to the NFL. They are excellent teachers and will be positive additions to our staff."
Nick Saban,A lot of people want to know why I want to come back to college football.
Nick Saban,"I think there's a pretty good formula for guys who at some point in time were college coaches, and then they go to the NFL and, in whatever capacity they serve, they develop even further. When they go back to college, they're even more prepared, and they succeed there. There's pretty decent track record on that."
Nick Saban,"Lamar did a good job for us here. He worked hard. When you look at some of these circumstances, everybody has to have a role on the team. Some of the guys at that position are very good special teams contributors, and that certainly played a role in the backs that we've selected."
Nick Saban,"My only feeling is that the situation and the circumstance that created this whole thing is unfortunate for a lot of people. I think that it is unfortunate for the Saints that they have to go through a lot of changes to do what they have to do, but probably, more importantly, the fans and all of the people affected by this tragedy."
Nick Saban,"They double-covered him a couple of times, actually, so it was the right choice not to throw it to him. But he's a guy we need to have involved in the offense."
Nick Saban,"It's not really true to (the Bears) character and nature in the past to do that (during an exhibition game), ... But I thought our staff did an outstanding job with adapting in the game. That's probably why we had more success in the second and third quarters than we did in the beginning of the game."
Nick Saban,"This is a great football game against a very good football team. A lot of character, a lot of heart out there today on both sides of the ball -- that's what makes it special, when you can persevere and come away with the win."
Nick Saban,"It's most important that we use caution right now, in terms of trying to keep some of our better players and more experienced players that have impact and leadership ready for the season,"
Nick Saban,"The more success you have, the more belief you have in what you have to do to be successful. The key piece to the puzzle is that you understand what it takes for you to be successful, and you are not satisfied with what you have accomplished."
Nick Saban,"Sometimes when you press, you have high anxiety, and it affects the way you perform."
Nick Saban,"We are not disappointed in Ronnie Brown. As I said before, expectations always create frustration and a lot of anxiety, which doesn't necessarily help a guy's performance."
Nick Saban,"We've tried to make a plan on how we would operate if we do have an agreement, how it would that impact our ability to make improvements to the team. All we can do is manage the situation the best we can."
Nick Saban,"If we don't have an agreement this year, obviously it's going to affect the cap in an adverse way in terms of what's available to spend on players."
Nick Saban,"We certainly created some adversity for ourselves to overcome out there, ... but I was really pleased with how we responded time in and time out. Nobody's ever happy with penalties. Nobody's ever happy with turnovers. But I think it's most important to establish how you respond to that stuff when it happens in the game."
Nick Saban,"We need to improve our ability to play with discipline, especially on the road, especially in the beginning of games, ... That put us behind the 8-ball."
Nick Saban,"From an intangible standpoint, it's about things like effort, mental toughness, the ability to stay focused and execute, and be a little relentless in the way you try to go about your work, ... We're gladiators out there. We're modern-day gladiators and that mental toughness has got to permeate your team."
Nick Saban,It's the trademark of both guys in terms of their endurance and ability to get better as the game goes on. That's something we'd like to continue to utilize in the future if we can.
Nick Saban,"I think having poise and the ability to execute is critical to play in tough situations and we have to find a psychological balance that we can do that,"
Nick Saban,"We have total faith, trust and confidence in the guy. The guy has a tremendous amount of ability. He's going to be a long snapper for a long time in this league so the question is do we want to take the time to develop that or do we want to let him go snap for somebody else?"
Felix Sabates,We are having to live with paying the price for what happened before.
Felix Sabates,"I've told my wife that if the Hispanic population in NASCAR keeps growing, I'm going to ask Bill France Jr. for a job."
Felix Sabates,I gave Robby an unlimited budget for Indy and he managed to exceed that.
Felix Sabates,I saw a face I'd never seen before. Like someone had sucked the blood out and he was ready to die.
Brian Sabean,"I'm not worried about pitchers, but I have some concerns about Mo. Guys will be running 90 feet, throwing long, going all out. Yes, you have some anxieties."
Brian Sabean,"He has had some quality at-bats, and pitchers have pitched him really tough."
Brian Sabean,"As a GM, to get a switch-hitter who's a leadoff hitter with a lot of dimensions -- power, speed, the ability to play the outfield the way he does -- is a godsend to the organization. The opportunity was great, the timing was wonderful and he's very deserving."
Brian Sabean,"The opportunity was great, the timing wonderful."
Brian Sabean,"We're going into a pitchers' park whose team won the division last year. Then we're going home to our park, which is a pitchers' park, against two teams that can pitch. We saw what happened last year when teams came into our place, especially, and we didn't do the job to hold the opposition down and keep the opposition in check. So we're going to have to be ready to pitch, especially in those first three series."
Brian Sabean,"I don't want to be too hard-line about it, but the more we see of the old Jason Schmidt, the more you want to sign him."
Brian Sabean,I think his development has been lightning quick because of his God-given talent. He has great aptitude and he's been able to develop very fast in front of our eyes at every level.
Brian Sabean,"I'm not the manager, thank God. I just hope (Bonds) is in the lineup to bat somewhere. I think we all know what we're up against, and especially he knows what he's up against."
Brian Sabean,Only God and he know how much he's going to play. And the manager.
Brian Sabean,"By what I see, do I think he's capable of playing a lot? Yes. Only God and he knows how much he's going to play, and the manager."
Brian Sabean,"It's reasonable to think he can play 120 games. Now, will we be in a position to have to rest him and be conscious that he's going to come in some days cranky and not be able to go? The next step is to get him in spring training and get him in a position to be able to do that. I think he wants that."
Brian Sabean,"His stuff has been electric. He's throwing strikes and the breaking ball is improved. I think his future, and the impact he could have on the major-league roster, it looks like he'll probably start the year in the bullpen."
Brian Sabean,Todd brings a veteran presence to the team and he'll be one of the catchers in the competition for the backup spot behind Mike Matheny.
Brian Sabean,"I'm embarrassed we had to do it, ... The blame starts with me. We made choices, and they obviously didn't turn out."
Brian Sabean,"He's had his challenges in spring training to get out of the gate. If ever there a year that he needed to be on time, it's this year. He's a free agent-to-be, and we certainly need him."
Brian Sabean,"Him taking swings in a college batting cage is a long way from doing baseball work with us, ... It's just another step in his rehab. To what extent this is of any significance -- until I'm told otherwise -- it's just part of the exercise regimen he's going through. Once he's accelerated to the point where the doctors are ready to turn him over to us, then he can do more meaningful and substantial baseball activities. But for now, this is just another step."
Brian Sabean,Spring training was a long time ago. He could be starting from ground zero as far as the baseball activities.
Brian Sabean,I don't go that deep. It's all about our budget. We answer to a higher authority -- which is our lender.
Brian Sabean,I'm swallowing hard. I'm really trying to fathom how in this day in age it can even be said. This is not something we're going to take lightly. It's a very emotional subject. It's a blow below the belt. I know it deeply affected Felipe. I'm disappointed and disheartened we have to react to it. We stand by our manager and stand by his comments and feelings on the subject.
Brian Sabean,"To get a switch-hitter (who is) a leadoff hitter with a lot of dimensions -- power, speed -- the ability to play the outfield as he does is really a godsend to the organization."
Fred Saberhagen,There's a big overlap with the people you meet at the fantasy and science fiction cons.
Fred Saberhagen,"There are interactions with characters within the game which I think are pretty neatly done considering the limitations that you have to work with. I mean, a computer can't really generate a character that talks back and forth with you successfully."
Fred Saberhagen,"The Swords were still interesting but by then a cast of characters had started to appear and go on from book to book, and other things about the world began to feel constricting. And there were other things I wanted to do, so I closed the series up and stopped it."
Fred Saberhagen,"The same tools that make any writer good, plus a cheerful willingness to suspend belief."
Fred Saberhagen,"The critics and reviewers of a hundred years from now, if they remember any of us at all, may have opinions much different from those of today."
Fred Saberhagen,"The comments I most appreciate come from ordinary readers who've happened on one of my books at some time of stress in their lives, and who actually credit the book with helping them through a bad time. It's happened a few times in forty years."
Fred Saberhagen,"The Berserkers have been with me for about forty years, and we're not done yet."
Fred Saberhagen,"The advice would be the same for any kind of fiction. Keep writing, and keep sending things out, not to friends and relatives, but to people who have the power to buy. A lot of additional, useful tips could be added, but this is fundamental."
Fred Saberhagen,"Research is of considerable importance in certain fields, such as science and history."
Fred Saberhagen,Probably all the books I've ever written have been efforts to define the boundaries of humanity.
Fred Saberhagen,"Only towards the end of this process are any of the chapters in fully readable condition, a state of affairs that used to alarm my wife. But Joan's got used to it."
Fred Saberhagen,"Mysteries I read for fun, so I will probably never write one, for fear of spoiling the fun."
Fred Saberhagen,"My gut feeling is that paper and ink are going to be with us for a long time yet, and in substantial quantities, though certainly books are now going to be available in other forms."
Fred Saberhagen,"More immediately, I'm currently working on another Dracula in which there will be connections with ancient Egypt. That's about as far as I want to go in commenting on current work."
Fred Saberhagen,"If people ask me for the ingredients of success, I say one is talent, two is stubbornness or determination, and third is sheer luck. You have to have two out of the three. Any two will probably do."
Fred Saberhagen,"I wrote speculative fiction because I loved to read it, and thought I could do better than some of the people who were getting published."
Fred Saberhagen,I wouldn't like to just do one story or one type of stories all the time.
Fred Saberhagen,I suspect that writer's block afflicts mainly people who have some stable and ample source of income outside of writing. So far it hasn't been a problem.
Fred Saberhagen,"I started writing seriously about 1960, at the fairly advanced age of 30."
Fred Saberhagen,I have some good stories yet to tell.
Fred Saberhagen,I had immediate success in the sense that I sold something right off the bat. I thought it was going to be a piece of cake and it really wasn't. I have drawers full of - or I did have - drawers full of rejection slips.
Fred Saberhagen,"I guess if one set of my books was selling like Stephen King's, and the other wasn't selling at all, editors would want me to do the ones that sold like Stephen King's. But they seem to be willing to let me pick what I want to do next."
Fred Saberhagen,"I finally decided one day, reading science fiction magazines of the time, I could do at least as well as some of these people are doing. So I finally made a serious effort."
Fred Saberhagen,"I doubt I'll ever do another book collaboration; I've been spoiled. Roger and I both happened to move to New Mexico at about the same time, when we each had a family of young kids to raise. Socializing seemed to lead naturally to working together."
Fred Saberhagen,I don't know why a computer game can't be an art form just as a puppet show or an opera is. I'm still interested in computer games as something I would like to work on someday.
Fred Saberhagen,"I am generally way out of touch with trends, except now and then I am surprised to find myself leading one, like sympathetic vampires."
Fred Saberhagen,"Doing a work for hire is not necessarily bad, whether it's an encyclopedia article or a tie-in novel. It's just that you get no royalties."
Fred Saberhagen,"At this stage, my chief professional goal is simply to keep on writing and making a living at it."
Fred Saberhagen,"And what we know, or think we know, about the universe of space and time is changing very quickly."
Fred Saberhagen,"Actually ideas are everywhere. It's the paperwork, that is, sitting down and thinking them into a coherent story, trying to find just the right words, that can and usually does get to be labor."
Steve Sabol,"Everything Lombardi stood for, everything that the Packers accomplished, all the principles that Lombardi has espoused for the last five years would be tarnished if they lost. He was as crabby and cranky and miserable as I'd ever seen him."
Steve Sabol,"The NFL always seems open to innovation. Take the opener on Thursday. Now they take one game, make it special and have a celebration around it leading into a weekend of 'Kickoff Sunday.' That's great marketing."
Steve Sabol,"There's no comparison. One of the tenets of football, its essence, is triumphing over adversity. That can be your opponent, your shortcomings or it can be the weather."
Naji Sabri,"If the U.S. administration sticks to international law and listens carefully to the world public opinion and to the opinion of its own people, it should not embark on any aggression against Iraq,"
Naji Sabri,"We hope this round will be a step toward achieving comprehensive settlement and a comprehensive solution, at the forefront of which comes a lifting of the embargo imposed on our people for more than 12 years,"
Naji Sabri,"We will teach them a lesson they will not forget. Our people are fighting the attackers everywhere and we will put their head in the mud,"
Naji Sabri,"So after a long time of utilizing the American propaganda machine, along with official statements of lies, distortion and falsehood, the focus was basically turned on inciting the American public against Iraq and pushing them to accept the American administration's schemes of aggression as a fait accompli, as if it were the solution or the necessary rescue that would allow American citizens to live in security and stability, after what they had gone through in the September 11 attacks."
Naji Sabri,"The aggression has to stop,"
Jeffrey Sachs,"The essential truth for developing countries is, if you try to live by yourself, you will cut yourself off from the amazing progress of world technology. You won't be able to purchase the goods that you need from abroad, because you're not exporting to the rest of the world. You have to be part of the world system."
Jeffrey Sachs,"In 1991, a miraculous thing happened, and that's the Soviet Union ended. So there was an opportunity to build a very healthy and new world, on the basis of the change that the Russian people themselves wanted. But for Russia to make that change was going to be one of the most remarkably difficult and complex passages imaginable."
Jeffrey Sachs,"Development can really work everywhere. But most of sub-Saharan Africa, the Andean region, and Central Asia face obstacles."
Jeffrey Sachs,"The Russian government not only acted corruptly, not only built up a new oligarchy of billionaires out of nothing, basically, but also gave away its most valuable financial assets-its ownership of the huge natural resource sector in Russia."
Jeffrey Sachs,"The U.S. has a sound economy. It also has a cyclical economy. It also has stock market values right now that are hard to explain on historical norms. While it's always possible that everything can be based on the new economy, it's also quite possible that we're doing a little bit of exaggeration in just how wonderful things are."
Jeffrey Sachs,"There is no doubt that Malawi needs 100 percent debt cancellation as soon as possible, and I will do everything possible to speed that up."
Jeffrey Sachs,"I want the donors to think ahead, not just handle the immediate crisis,"
Jeffrey Sachs,"If you have billions and billions of dollars coming due in a country in a short period of time, and if a sense of panic develops among your creditors, so that everybody demands the money out all at once, it's almost inevitable that the debtor economy will collapse, because it won't be able to come up with that amount of money in a short period."
Jeffrey Sachs,"A lot of the old apparatchiks came back in, and corruption really dramatically increased in '94/'95, particularly around Yeltsin's re-election in 1996, when the government used corrupt practices to give money to business, part of which was returned to the campaign coffers, and helped pay for Yeltsin's re-election."
Jeffrey Sachs,I think the IMF helped to detonate the Indonesian crisis.
Jeffrey Sachs,"We, being the Western world, wouldn't let Russia off the hook on debt. So there were demands on debt servicing in the early days until they ran out of reserves. There was no real aid program, just a fictional aid program."
Jeffrey Sachs,"Roosevelt talked not only about Freedom from Fear, but also Freedom from Want."
Jeffrey Sachs,"The longer you wait, the less fun. If you wait until the bitter end, the whole economy can be destroyed."
Jeffrey Sachs,"When countries open up to trade, they generally benefit, because they can sell more, then they can buy more. And trade has two-way gain."
Jeffrey Sachs,Russia has gone through eight years of continuing economic pain.
Jeffrey Sachs,We're going to have to forgive a great deal of the Soviet era debt. There's no question about that. Let's face up to that. We're going to have to put in money if Russia is really going to consolidate a democracy.
Jeffrey Sachs,"There's a lot of strength in the U.S., but there's a lot of froth also. The froth will blow off. We're going to have to face up to some realities that we're not fully facing up to right now."
Jeffrey Sachs,"If you have a lot of short-term debt, it means that all of that money can be demanded in a very short period of time. Technically, short-term debt means money that's coming due within a year. Typically, it means money that's coming due within 30 to 90 days."
Jeffrey Sachs,"In Asia, a lot of successful economies that had been living on their own saving, decided to open up their financial markets to international capital in the early 1990s. So here were countries doing quite well, but they decided they'd borrow a bit more and do even better."
Jeffrey Sachs,"We were proposing, in a sense, that the rest of the world be made safe for American ideas, as they adopted intellectual property rights that gave patent protection to our very innovative economy."
Jeffrey Sachs,"If we continue this combination of high rhetoric and grossly insufficient action, I think the risks to (the United States ') own national security ... and the risk to global stability are very real."
Jeffrey Sachs,"We've taken the view that if the rest of the world would democratize and create market economies, that would spread the benefits of prosperity around the world, and that it would enhance our own prosperity, and our own stability and security, as well."
Jeffrey Sachs,"We had a booming stock market in 1929 and then went into the world's greatest depression. We have a booming stock market in 1999. Will the bubble somehow burst, and then we enter depression? Well, some things are not different."
Jonathan Sacks,Values are tapes we play on the Walkman of the mind: any tune we choose so long as it does not disturb others.
Jonathan Sacks,You are seeing a kind of dot-com madness.
Jonathan Sacks,"(Yahoo) is now so desperate over the fact that they are losing several experienced software engineers with years of experience in the mobile industry, that they are now taking the exact opposite legal position."
Mark Sadd,Whenever government limits access to meetings and public records the press is going to be concerned about access to public information. We only miss our rights when they are taken away from us.
Mark Sadd,"When we want to hire or fire, both are happy or sad occasions, the Legislature believes it's fair to try to negotiate with people or gently reveal to people without having to air the news."
Mark Sadd,"If the confidentiality outweighs the public's right to know, the body will go into executive session."
Muslih-uddin Sadi,"Whenever you argue with another wiser than yourself in order that others may admire your wisdom, they will discover your ignorance"
Muslih-uddin Sadi,To give pleasure to a single heart by a single kind act is better than a thousand head-bowings in prayer
Muslih-uddin Sadi,"He who learns the rules of wisdom, without conforming to them in his life, is like a man who labored in his fields, but did not sow"
Elliott Sadler,Everybody knows the story. I came here to watch races as a kid. I just want to go to victory lane here one time.
Elliott Sadler,run over you each and every week and then just get on TV with a little smile and say they're sorry and act like everything is OK.
Elliott Sadler,"What we want to do these last 10 races is just get back to where we were running. We know the world hasn't come to an end because we're not in the top 10. Our season is not over just because we're not in it. We've got to go out and win a couple of races for this team, our owners and our sponsors."
Elliott Sadler,"Nineteen laps to go, running for a million bucks, you're going to do every little trick in the trade and everything you know how to do to try and win the race, ... Mark outsmarted me a little bit on that one. That was a great job. He did a great job."
Elliott Sadler,"I think when a team is found guilty of breaking the rules, the team should also lose points."
Elliott Sadler,"I've got a great race team and we're all pulling together, ... This is what we work hard for -- we're all going to fail together or we're going to succeed together, and that's the way this 38 team is."
Elliott Sadler,"The world's not over with, ... I've got some great sponsors on this race car that believe in us whether we made it or not. I got a great car owner in Robert Yates. We've just got to try and maybe get that 11th spot."
Elliott Sadler,"It's going to take a lot to beat him. I think Jimmie is the best race car driver at this race track. He's got a beautiful line. He knows what his car needs. ... Before it's all said and done, we're going to have to outrun them."
Elliott Sadler,Now I know why they don't put speedometers in our race cars. It is very fast.
Elliott Sadler,"The Race to GED is making a difference in many Virginia communities and I am proud to be a part of it. By joining the Race to GED, working-age men and women can earn a GED quickly and get on with bettering their lives, either by qualifying for a higher paying job or by continuing their education."
Elliott Sadler,Guys are going to have to race their guts out to pass.
Elliott Sadler,"The philosophy has changed in how you race for a championship. The whole thrust is on getting into that top 10 to give yourself a chance. Once you get there, luck comes into play, and anything can happen."
Elliott Sadler,"He doesn't mind telling you what's on his mind and kind of the plan that he wants to do. I'm the same way, so, we've kind of hit it off pretty good."
Elliott Sadler,"Busch racing is so fun to me because there's no points involved and I can go race and try to win, take chances. We might make it on gas, we might not."
Elliott Sadler,I have 32 dogs. I've been raising dogs for about 15 years. I'm not married. I don't have any kids. They're kind of like my kids when I go home.
Elliott Sadler,"I've got a great comfort level working with Kevin -- I've worked with him now for two years and he's just been behind the scenes more than anything,"
Elliott Sadler,"I'm just glad we saw the checkered flag, ... We've had a lot of great cars here the last month and a half and haven't been able to show it. So, to see the checkered flag and get a top-10 was a big relief to this team."
Paul Saffo,We're seeing the rise of independent specialists who have a deep understanding of things that big companies don't have the ability to do.
Paul Saffo,The problem has not been hostility to technology; the problem has been big egos.
Paul Saffo,Browsers are becoming the default way to access information.
Paul Saffo,"My nightmare fear is some congressman is going to seize on this and they're going to pass some laws, ... I can just see people overreacting and doing things that would invade people's privacy or tie up the Internet with so much security nonsense that innovation slows down."
Paul Saffo,"With more technologies, there are more choices. Choose wisely and well. You don't have to read every e-mail you get; you need to develop your own rules of thumb and steps to sanity."
Marat Safin,"I won't worry about that until I meet him, but there's been no secret formula for anyone up against him on any surface for the last couple of years. But I'd like to get another crack."
Marat Safin,"I tried my best but unfortunately in the third set he was much better than me. I had no strength and almost fell over a couple of times, but I was trying."
Marat Safin,It is very hard for me to switch from clay to grass.
Marat Safin,"You can find flaws in Agassi and Sampras, but Federer has none."
Marat Safin,I took a risk to come here and start a bit early to prepare for the U.S. Open. I?m praying to God so I will be healthy and will be able to play good tennis in the U.S. Open.
Marat Safin,"I've been out for one month and a half and I didn't really practice before the tournament,"
Marat Safin,"I didn't practice for one month and a half and I played three matches in a row and today I felt really, really tired on the court. I couldn't move properly and I couldn't find my game. My timing was not there. So it's really difficult to play against any player."
Marat Safin,"It's kind of difficult. It (the knee injury) is still in my head. When you feel some pain in some movements, you try to avoid those. After the first couple of games, I tried to forget about it and focus on the game."
Marat Safin,"Maybe I went for it too much, ... I started to make mistakes and I became frustrated as he became more solid."
Marat Safin,"It was not enough matches, so many mistakes. Like I've said, you need to get the rhythm back. It doesn't come straight away. It's still a long way and I have many things to work on. I hope it will come back soon."
Marat Safin,"But, despite all that, I have a lot more good memories than bad of being here and I would love to come back next year."
Marat Safin,It's been a tough week for me. But I am satisfied with my game.
Marat Safin,"We were both fighting against each other and fighting against ourselves, ... Neither us of wanted to lose, and I think that given the [windy] conditions, we played good tennis."
Marat Safin,"it's more actually [that] I need to hold it. I need to hold these feelings and I need to hold it for a long time, as long as I can. Because now it looks like I found my game, I found the confidence that I was missing for past six months. I'll try not to lose it again."
Marat Safin,"We have eyes, and we see that not many people are interested in the sports."
Marat Safin,"Also, I got older a little bit. I have more experience so I know what to do. I've just tried to be a little bit more focused in what I'm doing, and it's working."
Marat Safin,"It is a good excuse,"
Marat Safin,"I think he had quite bad losses, for example, in the Davis Cup against us...He was supposed to be in the Top 10. I think it's a little bit a pity because he's quite talented guy. But he can be there, but he needs to be more brave, that's for sure."
Marat Safin,"I was missing a little bit of energy. I got sick two, three days ago, and I'm still a little bit weak."
Marat Safin,"I was missing a little bit of energy. I got sick two, three days ago, and I'm still little bit weak, so it's difficult to run around and try to make winners all over the court, especially on clay. So I had to work a little bit harder, and unfortunately, I'm not really ready for this."
Marat Safin,"There was so much wind, it was tough to play good tennis. I'm having trouble getting my confidence back. But I'm working hard and trying to do it."
Marat Safin,"I've played him many times, six times, but the way he is playing this year, with confidence, to beat him will be very tough. A little bit of luck would be great."
Marat Safin,It was difficult but this was a big step forward in confidence and it feels great.
Marat Safin,"I don't understand what Ferrero was complaining about,"
Marat Safin,You need to believe in yourself and I didn't.
Marat Safin,He's the kind of player that you need to be really careful and really focus from the beginning of the match.
Marat Safin,"It's still very painful, I have to think about every movement on the court, cannot hit the balls as I would like to,"
Marat Safin,I've slightly changed my action and movement and tonight it really worked well for me.
Marat Safin,New York is a fantastic city.
Bob Saget,"Leo, what's with Scorsese and music,"
Bob Saget,"You can talk about things indirectly, but if you want to talk how people really talk, you have to talk R-rated, ... I mean I've got three incredibly intelligent daughters, but when you get mad, you get mad and you talk like people talk. When a normal 17-year-old girl storms out of the house or 15-year-old boy is mad at his mom or dad, they're not talking the way people talk on TV. Unless it's cable."
Bob Saget,"The film, as crazy as it is, is a love letter to comedians and comedy and all the different ways they improv around something,"
Granth Sahib,The Creator has made me His Own. He has destroyed the city of sorrow.

Granth Sahib,"God is Wise, Giving, Tender-hearted, Pure, Beautiful and Infinite. He is our Companion and Helper, Supremely Great, Lofty and Utterly Infinite. He is not known as young or old; His Court is Steady and Stable. Whatever we seek from Him, we receive. He is the Support of the unsupported."
Granth Sahib,"God has produced everything in great abundance. Granting His Grace, God has satisfied all. Bless us with Your Gifts, O my Great Giver. All beings and creatures are satisfied."

Granth Sahib,"I am just a fool, Lord; I place my hopes in You!"
Granth Sahib,"I have done this, and I will do that  - I am an idiotic fool for saying this! I have forgotten the Doer of all; I am caught in the love of duality. There is no pain as great as the pain of Maya; it drives people to wander all around the world, until they become exhausted."
Granth Sahib,"With each breath and morsel of food, do not forget the Guru, the Embodiment of Fulfillment. None is seen to be as great as the Guru. Meditate on Him twenty-four hours a day. As He casts His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence."
Granth Sahib,"He came and he went, and now, even his name has died. After he left, food was offered on leaves, and the birds were called to come and eat."
Granth Sahib,"If I could live for millions and millions of years, and if the air was my food and drink, and if I lived in a cave and never saw either the sun or the moon, and if I never slept, even in dreams - even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name?"
Granth Sahib,"As it is pre-ordained, people speak their words. As it is pre-ordained, they consume their food. As it is pre-ordained, they walk along the way. As it is pre-ordained, they see and hear. As it is pre-ordained, they draw their breath. Why should I go and ask the scholars about this?"
Granth Sahib,"The wife yearns for gold and silver, and her friends, the senses, yearn for good food."
Granth Sahib,"The True Food is the Love of the Lord; the True Guru has spoken. With this True Food, I am satisfied, and with the Truth, I am delighted."

Granth Sahib,"God's inner nature is like that of fire, untouched and forever immaculate."
Granth Sahib,"without his command Your hands and feet will fall off in an instant, when you are burnt in the fire."
Granth Sahib,"If I dressed myself in fire, and built my house of snow, and made iron my food; and if I were to drink in all pain like water, and drive the entire earth before me."
Granth Sahib,Rare are those who are blessed with Fear of God Boat.
Granth Sahib,"In fear we are born, and in fear we die. Fear is always present in the mind."

Granth Sahib,"What sort of fear is that, which frightens other fears?"
Granth Sahib,"Place the Fear of God within the home of your heart; with this Fear of God in your heart, all other fears shall be frightened away."
Granth Sahib,"Without the Fear of God, all that is fashioned is false. Useless is the mold, and useless are the hammer-strokes on the mold."

Granth Sahib,No one succeeds through falsehood.
Granth Sahib,"O woman, the false ones are being cheated by falsehood. God is your Husband; He is Handsome and True. He is obtained by reflecting upon the Guru."
Granth Sahib,"O Baba, other wisdom is useless and irrelevant. If falsehood is practiced a hundred times, it is still false in its effects."
Granth Sahib,"Some are stuck in falsehood, and false are the rewards they receive."
Granth Sahib,Greed is a dog; falsehood is a filthy street-sweeper.

Granth Sahib,Emotional attachment to Maya is created by my God; He Himself misleads us through illusion and doubt.
Granth Sahib,"O Baba, Maya deceives with its illusion. Deceived by doubt, the discarded bride is not received into the Lap of her Beloved."
Granth Sahib,"Suffering and doubt are cut out from within, and peace is obtained."
Granth Sahib,He cannot be understood by reading scriptures; the deceitful pretenders are deluded by doubt.
Granth Sahib,"When good karma dawns, the wall of doubt is torn down."
Granth Sahib,"In this world of her parents' home, the soul-bride has been deluded by doubt. Attached to duality, she later comes to regret it. She forfeits both this world and the next, and even in her dreams, she does not find peace."
Granth Sahib,"Through doubt, the people are being destroyed."
Granth Sahib,With Guru the egg of doubt has burst; my mind has been enlightened
Granth Sahib,"Father, I am unfortunate, a fraud. I have not found Your Name; my mind is blind and deluded by doubt."
Granth Sahib,"By the Fear of the True Guru, doubt and fear are dispelled. Imbued with His Fear, we are absorbed in the Love of the True One."
Granth Sahib,"Practicing hypocrisy and attaching your mind to worldly objects, your doubt shall never depart."
Granth Sahib,"The dogs of greed are with me. In the early morning, they continually bark at the wind. Falsehood is my dagger; through deception, I eat the carcasses of the dead. I live as a wild hunter, O Creator!"
Granth Sahib,"If someone understands both the disease and the medicine, only then is he a wise physician."
Granth Sahib,"You may practice chanting, penance and austere self-discipline within your mind, but without the Name, life is useless."
Granth Sahib,"Make Truth your self-discipline, and make good deeds the lines you draw; make chanting the Name your cleansing bath."
Granth Sahib,"They chant and meditate, practicing austere self-discipline for years and years; they wander on journeys all over the earth; and yet, their hearts are not at peace, even for an instant."
Granth Sahib,"The merits of pilgrimages, fasts and hundreds of thousands of techniques of austere self-discipline are found in the dust of the feet of the Holy."
Granth Sahib,"When chanting, austere meditation and self-discipline become your protectors, then the lotus blossoms forth, and the honey trickles out."
Granth Sahib,"Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. Meditation, penance and austere self-discipline are found by surrendering to the True Guru's Will."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, become the dust of the feet of the humble Saints. In the Society of the Saints, the Guru is found. He is the Treasure of Liberation, the Source of all good fortune."
Granth Sahib,"Call permanent only the One, who does not have destiny inscribed upon His Forehead. The sky and the earth shall pass away; He alone is permanent."
Granth Sahib,One meets the Holy Saint only through perfect destiny.
Granth Sahib,"You are the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny. You are All-powerful, the Giver of Eternal Peace."

Granth Sahib,"The True Guru is the Giver of all things; through perfect destiny, He is met."
Granth Sahib,"Enjoy yourselves and eat, O Siblings of Destiny. In the Guru's Court, He has blessed me with the Robe of Honor."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, the terrifying world-ocean is so difficult to cross - I am terrified!"
Granth Sahib,"O Nanak, God's Flavor is sweet to the minds and bodies of those who have such blessed destiny written on their foreheads."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, filth is washed away by bathing in the Pure Water of the Name."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, the nine treasures are found in the Home of the Lord; He comes to meet those who deserve it by their past actions."
Granth Sahib,"Without destiny, the True Guru is not found, even though He sits within the home of our own inner being, always near and close at hand. There is ignorance within, and the pain of doubt, like a separating screen."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, it is received only when God Himself bestows it."
Granth Sahib,"Meet with the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, and contemplate the True Name. For the journey of the soul, gather those supplies which will go with you here and hereafter. These are obtained from the Perfect Guru, when God bestows His Glance of Grace. Those unto whom He is Merciful, receive His Grace."
Granth Sahib,"All the rewards which the mind desires are with the True Guru. One whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Wealth of the True Name."
Granth Sahib,Greatness is in the Hands of the Creator; it is obtained by pre-ordained destiny.
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, those who lack devotion - why have they even bothered to come into the world? They do not serve the Perfect Guru; they waste away their lives in vain."
Granth Sahib,"Everyone, all over the world, longs for the True Guru. Without the good fortune of destiny, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is not obtained."
Granth Sahib,"By perfect good fortune, one meets the True Guru, when one's destiny is awakened."
Granth Sahib,"O Nanak, He is obtained by those, upon whose faces and foreheads such pre-recorded destiny is written."
Granth Sahib,"The key is in the hands of the True Guru; no one else can open this door. By perfect destiny, He is met."
Granth Sahib,"As you plant, so shall you harvest; your destiny is recorded on your forehead."
Granth Sahib,"I have enjoyed the tastes, and now my pains have come to fruition; such is my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother"
Granth Sahib,"All serve the One True Lord; through pre-ordained destiny, they meet Him."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, let none think that they have any power."
Granth Sahib,"O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, there is no devotional worship. Without the Guru, devotion is not obtained, even though everyone may long for it."
Granth Sahib,"Subduing their desires, they merge with the True One; they see in their minds that everyone comes and goes in reincarnation."
Granth Sahib,"Consumed by desire, they have no understanding at all. They purchase poison, and they are thirsty with their fascination for poison. Telling lies, they eat poison."
Granth Sahib,"Renouncing desire, I have found intuitive peace and poise; I have enshrined the One within my mind."
Granth Sahib,"The tongue is asleep, in its desire for sweet flavors. The mind is asleep, fascinated by Maya."
Granth Sahib,"Another person on silence sits alone, but his heart is tied in knots of desire."
Granth Sahib,The waves of desire in the world-ocean are intoxicating wine.
Granth Sahib,"The desert is not satisfied by rain, and the fire is not quenched by desire. The king is not satisfied with his kingdom, and the oceans are full, but still they thirst for more. O Nanak, how many times must I seek and ask for the True Name? |"
Granth Sahib,"Through self-realization, people dwell within the home of their inner being; egotism and desire depart."
Granth Sahib,"The desire for the worldly drama arises in the intellect, but even with thousands of clever mental tricks, the heat of the Fear of God does not come into play."
Granth Sahib,"The fire of desire is deep within; unsatisfied, people remain hungry and thirsty."
Granth Sahib,Sexual desires are so strong and compelling; where has this sexual desire come from?
Granth Sahib,"Why, O soul, do you try such clever tricks? Taking away and giving back, God does not delay."
Granth Sahib,"Not a moment or an instant's delay is permitted, when one's measure of life is full. By Guru's Grace, one comes to know the True One, and is absorbed into Him."
Granth Sahib,"If someone tells him the truth, he looks upon that as poison. He cannot tell victory from defeat. This is the way of life in the world of the faithless cynic."
Granth Sahib,"By falsehood and deception, none have found Him. Whatever you plant, you shall eat."
Granth Sahib,"The love of Maya makes this mind dance, and the deceit within makes people suffer in pain."
Granth Sahib,My forehead has been branded with His brand; I owe such a great debt to the Guru. He has been so generous and kind to me; He has carried me across the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean.
Granth Sahib,"Some do not think of death; they entertain great hopes. They die, and are re-born, and die, over and over again. They are of no use at all! In their conscious minds, they call themselves good."
Granth Sahib,"Asleep in the darkness of the night, how shall she pass her life-night without her Husband? Her limbs shall burn, her body shall burn, and her mind and wealth shall burn as well."
Granth Sahib,Attachment to Maya is an ocean of darkness; neither this shore nor the one beyond can be seen.
Granth Sahib,"My mind has entered their Sanctuary. I have renounced my pride in my own strength, and the darkness of emotional attachment."
Granth Sahib,"Through the Guru's Teachings, the darkness has been dispelled, and the heavy doors have been opened."
Granth Sahib,"One who does not fear God shall live in fear; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness."
Granth Sahib,"The Guru has lit the brilliant light of spiritual wisdom, and the darkness of ignorance has been dispelled."
Granth Sahib,"Like a lamp lit in the darkness, the spiritual wisdom of the Guru dispels ignorance."
Granth Sahib,"Like a boat in the ocean of fear; like a lamp which illumines the darkness; like fire which takes away the pain of cold - just so, chanting the Name, the mind becomes peaceful."
Granth Sahib,"The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled, and my mind has been awakened; within the home of my inner being, I have found the genuine article."
Granth Sahib,"The Divine Light shines in their hearts who have good destiny, and like the sun which removes the darkness of night, it dispels the darkness of ignorance."
Granth Sahib,"Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. Without the Guru, there is utter darkness. In emotional attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Great Giver, the Giver of Peace."
Granth Sahib,"I have searched in vain, and I am so confused; in this darkness, I cannot find the path. In egotism, they cry out in pain. Says Nanak, how will they be saved?"
Granth Sahib,The foolish intellectuals are forever in spiritual darkness.
Granth Sahib,"What can the cold do to the fire? How can the night affect the sun? What can the darkness do to the moon? What can social status do to air and water? What are personal possessions to the earth, from which all things are produced?"
Granth Sahib,The four sources of creation are Yours; the spoken word is Yours.
Granth Sahib,"You created the world, and assigned tasks to one and all. You watch over Your Creation, and through Your All-powerful Creative Potency, You cast the dice."
Granth Sahib,You do not know the One who created the creation.
Granth Sahib,Deep within the self is the Light of God; It radiates throughout the expanse of His creation.
Granth Sahib,"The creation is subject to the Creator, who sustains it by His Almighty Power."
Granth Sahib,"The earth is Your servant, a slave at Your Feet. In the four sources of creation, and in all speech, You dwell. You are dear to the minds of all."
Granth Sahib,Nothing of the color and the form of the creation shall remain; the entire expanse is transitory.
Granth Sahib,"Give up the pleasures of corruption, or else you will surely die of them."
Granth Sahib,The virtuous obtain Truth; they give up their desires for evil and corruption.
Granth Sahib,The pleasures of corruption are false. All that is seen shall turn to ashes.
Granth Sahib,"The conscious mind is awake only to falsehood, corruption and attachment. It gathers in the assets of sin and greed."
Granth Sahib,"Intuitive peace and poise, contentment, enduring satisfaction and bliss come through the Pleasure of the Master's Will."
Granth Sahib,"Let wisdom be your mother, and contentment your father. Let Truth be your brother - these are your best relatives."
Granth Sahib,"Those who meditate on the Name, with one-pointed mind and focused consciousness, remain forever stable in the world."
Granth Sahib,"According to this inscription, gifts, light and glorious greatness are received. Joining with Maya, the spiritual consciousness is lost."
Granth Sahib,"The thirst of your mind shall be quenched, and all hopes shall be fulfilled. Your consciousness shall not waver."
Granth Sahib,"The consciousness of the wicked, faithless cynics wanders around in search of transitory wealth, unstable and distracted. Searching outside of themselves, they are ruined; the object of their search is in that sacred place within the home of the heart."
Granth Sahib,"He draws us to His Touchstone, to test our love and consciousness. The counterfeit have no place there, but the genuine are placed in His Treasury."
Granth Sahib,Those who focus their consciousness on the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and famous.
Granth Sahib,"O my mind, focus your consciousness on the One. Without the One, all entanglements are worthless; emotional attachment to Maya is totally false."
Granth Sahib,"I serve my True Guru with single-minded devotion, and lovingly focus my consciousness on Him. The True Guru is the mind's desire and the sacred shrine of pilgrimage, for those unto whom He has given this understanding. The blessings of the wishes of the mind are obtained, and the fruits of one's desires."
Granth Sahib,"By Guru's Grace, a few come to understand; they center their consciousness in the fourth state."
Granth Sahib,"When one's light merges into the Light, and one's intuitive consciousness is joined with the Intuitive Consciousness, then one's cruel and violent instincts and egotism depart, and skepticism and sorrow are taken away."
Granth Sahib,Those who suck the blood of human beings - how can their consciousness be pure?
Granth Sahib,"In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your consciousness is focused on wealth and youth."
Granth Sahib,"When the mind accepts, and is satisfied with the One, then the consciousness becomes steady and stable. Then, one's food is the True Name, one's garments are the True Name, and one's Support, O Nanak, is the True Name."
Granth Sahib,"Let sincere faith be your bowing in prayer, and let the conquest of your mind be your objective in life."
Granth Sahib,"I serve my True Guru, and meditate on Him all day and night. Renouncing selfishness and conceit, I seek His Sanctuary, and speak sweet words to Him."
Granth Sahib,"When selfishness and conceit are eradicated from within, then there is no attachment to Maya."
Granth Sahib,"I am egotistical and conceited, and my intellect is ignorant. Meeting the Guru, my selfishness and conceit have been abolished. The illness of egotism is gone, and I have found peace."
Granth Sahib,"Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, she wanders around the world, but her wealth and property will not go with her."
Granth Sahib,"The eyes which look upon corruption do not know the Love and the Fear of God. Conquering self-conceit, one obtains the Name."
Granth Sahib,"O mind, don't cry out that you are hungry, always hungry; stop complaining. The One who created the 8.4 million species of beings gives sustenance to all."
Granth Sahib,Wind and water have patience and tolerance; the earth has compassion and forgiveness
Granth Sahib,"O Nanak, it is absurd to ask to be spared from pain by begging for comfort."
Granth Sahib,"Your humble servants remain satisfied and fulfilled, and the True Guru blesses them with encouragement and comfort."
Granth Sahib,"Of all comforts, this is the true comfort. Keep the Guru's Teachings in your mind."
Granth Sahib,Tell your troubles to the One who is the Source of all comfort.
Granth Sahib,"He(God) gave all beings souls, bodies, mouths, noses and water to drink. He gave them corn to eat, clothes to wear, and other pleasures to enjoy. But they do not remember the One who gave them all this. The animals think that they made themselves!"
Granth Sahib,"If one's clothes are stained with blood, the garment becomes polluted."
Granth Sahib,"Turkish horses, gold, silver and loads of gorgeous clothes - none of these shall go with you, O Nanak. They are lost and left behind, you fool!"
Granth Sahib,"People are entangled in the enjoyment of fine clothes, but gold and silver are only dust. They acquire beautiful horses and elephants, and ornate carriages of many kinds. They think of nothing else, and they forget all their relatives. They ignore their Creator; without the Name, they are impure."
Granth Sahib,"I am a slave, purchased in Your market; what clever tricks do I have?"
Granth Sahib,"Nanak seeks the company of the lowest of the low class, the very lowest of the low. Why should he try to compete with the great? In that place where the lowly are cared for - there, the Blessings of Your Glance of Grace rain down."
Granth Sahib,"What good is social class and status? Truthfulness is measured within. Pride in one's status is like poison - holding it in your hand and eating it, you shall die."
Granth Sahib,Cheating is eating a rotting carcass.
Granth Sahib,Those who charm scorpions and handle snakes only brand themselves with their own hands.
Granth Sahib,"No one is saved by mere talk and speech, nor by reading loads of books."
Granth Sahib,No one can know His Value; no one can weigh it. He dwells deep within the mind and body.
Granth Sahib,"Without the merchandise of the Name, the house of the body and the store of the mind are empty. Meeting the Guru, the hard and heavy doors are opened."
Granth Sahib,"The empty body is dreadful, when the soul goes out from within. The burning fire of life is extinguished, and the smoke of the breath no longer emerges. The five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste away through the love of duality."
Granth Sahib,"Body and soul, all belong to Him. He gives His Support to all."
Granth Sahib,"I have searched my mind and body, through and through. How can I meet my Darling Beloved, O my mother?"
Granth Sahib,"You bless everyone. Please bring my life to fulfillment. The body-temple is sanctified by the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, and thus, the impregnable fort of the soul is conquered."
Granth Sahib,"Search your body and mind, and find the Name. Restrain your wandering mind, and keep it in check."
Granth Sahib,"The body is a furnace, and the mind is the iron within it; the five fires are heating it."
Granth Sahib,The union of the mother and father brings the body into being.
Granth Sahib,"This mind and body are so imbued, and this tongue is dyed in the deep crimson color of the poppy. Through the Love and the Fear of God, we are dyed in this color."
Granth Sahib,"For me, there is no other like You. By Your Glance of Grace, my body is blessed and sanctified."
Granth Sahib,"Her body and her status shall not go with her to the world hereafter. Where she is called to answer for her account, there, she shall be emancipated only by true actions."
Granth Sahib,The Master Himself bestows honor. He creates and bestows body and soul. He Himself preserves the honor of His servants; He places both His Hands upon their foreheads.
Granth Sahib,I have become the Master of my body-village; I have taken the five rivals as prisoners.
Granth Sahib,The whole world is a store-house of lamp-black; the body and mind are blackened with it.
Granth Sahib,"When the body falls, the play of life is over; what shall be the condition of the evil-doers then?"
Granth Sahib,The inner being is empty without love. The body shall crumble into a heap of ashes.
Granth Sahib,"This mind, body and wealth were given by God, who naturally adorns us. He has blessed us with all our energy, and infused His Infinite Light deep within us. Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on God; keep Him enshrined in your heart."
Granth Sahib,"Seeing Him, our evil inclinations vanish; mind and body become peaceful and tranquil."
Granth Sahib,"With your tongue, repeat the True Name, and your mind and body shall become pure. Your mother and father and all your relations - without Him, there are none at all."
Granth Sahib,"For His sake, you assumed this body; see God always with you. God is pervading the water, the land and the sky; He sees all with His Glance of Grace."
Granth Sahib,"You are not conscious of God, and your body shall be cast into the wilderness. Focus your consciousness on the True Guru; you shall enjoy bliss forever and ever."
Granth Sahib,"Arising each day, you cherish your body, but you are idiotic, ignorant and without understanding."
Granth Sahib,Filth does not stick to the body of one who has secured a dwelling in his True Home.
Granth Sahib,"As long as the soul-companion is with the body, it dwells in happiness. But when the companion arises and departs, then the body-bride mingles with dust."
Granth Sahib,"The wall of the body is temporary, as is the soul-mason within it. The flavor of the intellect is bland and insipid without the Salt. O Nanak, as He wills, He makes things right. Without the Name, no one is approved."
Granth Sahib,"The defect of the body which leads to sin is the mud puddle, and this mind is the frog, which does not appreciate the lotus flower at all."
Granth Sahib,My mind and body are afflicted with the pain of separation from the Guru.
Granth Sahib,Within my mind and body is the intense pain of separation; how can my Beloved come to meet me in my home?
Granth Sahib,"My breath of life is in Your Power, God; my soul and body are totally Yours."
Granth Sahib,My mind and body have been cooled and soothed; I have been blessed with patience and composure.
Granth Sahib,"O Baba, the pleasures of other foods are false. Eating them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind."
Granth Sahib,"Without the Name, the body suffers in pain; it crumbles like a wall of sand."
Granth Sahib,"If the mind is polluted, then the body is polluted, and the tongue is polluted as well."
Granth Sahib,"O body, you are living in a dream! What good deeds have you done? When I stole something by deception, then my mind was pleased."
Granth Sahib,"By good destiny, this union comes about; this body enjoys its pleasures. Those who have lost their destiny, suffer separation from this union."
Granth Sahib,"Destiny has brought together and united the body and the soul-swan. He who created them, also separates them."
Granth Sahib,"Twenty-four hours a day, destroy the eight things, and in the ninth place, conquer the body."
Granth Sahib,"Within this body are the two brothers, sin and virtue. When the two joined together, the Universe was produced. Subduing both, and entering into the Home of the One, through the Guru's Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace."
Granth Sahib,"Within the cave of this body, there is one beautiful place."
Granth Sahib,"On that day when the body perishes - at that time, she becomes a ghost."
Granth Sahib,"If my body were afflicted with pain, under the evil influence of unlucky stars; and if the blood-sucking kings were to hold power over me - even if this were my condition, I would still worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease."
Granth Sahib,"Someone may practice intensive meditation, and discipline his body, but his mind still runs around in ten directions"
Granth Sahib,"Why should we speak of any other? As long as Your Light is within the body, You speak through that Light. Without Your Light, who can do anything? Show me any such cleverness!"
Granth Sahib,"He placed the soul in the body which He had fashioned. He protects the Creation which He has created. With their eyes, they see, and with their tongues, they speak; with their ears, they bring the mind to awareness. With their feet, they walk, and with their hands, they work; they wear and eat whatever is given."
Granth Sahib,"giving one's head, one is emancipated, and the mind and body become true."
Granth Sahib,My body is pierced through with the arrow of love. How can any physician know the cure?
Granth Sahib,"The temple is being demolished; the body is being plundered, and the soul-bride, left all alone, is captured."
Granth Sahib,"God has erected the temple of the body; He has placed the nine doors, and the soul-bride sits within. She enjoys the sweet play again and again, while the five demons are plundering her."
Granth Sahib,"O body, I have seen you blowing away like dust on the earth."
Granth Sahib,"With your nectar-like body, you live in comfort, but this world is just a passing drama. You practice greed, avarice and great falsehood, and you carry such a heavy burden."
Granth Sahib,"True are the Teachings of the True Guru. The body and mind are cooled and soothed, by the touchstone of Truth. This is the true mark of wisdom, that one remains detached, like the water-lily, or the lotus upon the water."
Granth Sahib,"The body is wild, and the mind is foolish. Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, your life is passing away."
Granth Sahib,One who takes pride in himself shall never be right. The soul and body are all at Your disposal.
Granth Sahib,"Let contentment be your father; the Guru is the Primal Being, beyond birth or incarnation."
Granth Sahib,"Sublime is their birth, and the place where they dwell."
Granth Sahib,"My Friend, the True Guru, has been my Best Friend since I was very young. I cannot survive without seeing Him, O my mother!"
Granth Sahib,"Offer your most sincere prayers to the True Guru, so that He may unite you with your Best Friend."
Granth Sahib,"You are my Companion; You are my Best Friend. You are my Beloved; I am in love with You. You are my honor; You are my decoration. Without You, I cannot survive, even for an instant."
Granth Sahib,"That which is true, you believe to be untrue; what is transitory, you believe to be permanent"
Granth Sahib,"The husband is delighted seeing his sons, and his wife upon his bed. He applies sandalwood and scented oils, and dresses himself in his beautiful clothes. But dust shall mix with dust, and he shall depart, leaving hearth and home behind."
Granth Sahib,"You may have horses as fast as the wind, elephants to ride on, sandalwood oil, and beautiful women in bed, actors in dramas, singing in theaters - but even with them, the mind does not find contentment."
Granth Sahib,"If the floor of this palace was a mosaic of diamonds and rubies, and if my bed was encased with rubies, and if heavenly beauties, their faces adorned with emeralds, tried to entice me with sensual gestures of love - seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind."
Granth Sahib,You are wasting this life in the pride of wealth and the splendor of beauty.
Granth Sahib,"The eyes are asleep in corruption, gazing upon the beauty of another. The ears are asleep, listening to slanderous stories."
Granth Sahib,"Wealth, the beauty of youth and flowers are guests for only a few days. Like the leaves of the water-lily, they wither and fade and finally die."
Granth Sahib,The mind's pleasures of love and beauty bring just as many blames and sins
Granth Sahib,"I have seen God, fearless, of wondrous beauty; my mind shall never leave Him to go anywhere else."
Granth Sahib,"Into this blind clay, You have infused awareness. Everything, everywhere which You have given is good."
Granth Sahib,There is one awareness among all created beings. None have been created without this awareness.
Granth Sahib,"The body is dust; the wind speaks through it. Understand, O wise one, who has died. Awareness, conflict and ego have died, but the One who sees does not die."
Granth Sahib,"True is His Empire, and True is His Command. True is His Seat of True Authority. True is the Creative Power which He has created. True is the world which He has fashioned. O Nanak, chant the True Name; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him."
Granth Sahib,"The world is burning in the fire of desire, in greed, arrogance and excessive ego."
Granth Sahib,"If I were to become an emperor and raise a huge army, and sit on a throne, issuing commands and collecting taxes - O Nanak, all of this could pass away like a puff of wind. Seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind."
Granth Sahib,"When I dwell upon Him in my soul, all my sorrows depart. The sickness of anxiety and the disease of ego are cured; He Himself cherishes me."
Granth Sahib,You are my Protector everywhere; why should I feel any fear or anxiety?
Granth Sahib,"Sin is the charcoal placed upon it, which burns the mind; the tongs are anxiety and worry."
Granth Sahib,"I took the form of so many plants and trees, and so many animals. Many times I entered the families of snakes and flying birds."
Granth Sahib,"The conscious mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and Maya."
Granth Sahib,"The Guru has cut out the sinful mistakes of sexual desire and anger, and my hopes have been fulfilled."
Granth Sahib,"The body-village is filled to overflowing with sexual desire and anger, which were broken into bits when I met with the Holy Saint. By pre-ordained destiny, I have met with the Guru."
Granth Sahib,"Do not meet with, or even approach those people, whose hearts are filled with horrible anger."
Granth Sahib,"Cruelty, material attachment, greed and anger are the four rivers of fire. Falling into them, one is burned, O Nanak! One is saved only by holding tight to good deeds."
Granth Sahib,"Sexual desire and anger are diffused throughout the universe. Coming and going, people suffer in pain."
Granth Sahib,"The world is drunk, engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism. Seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and fall at their feet; your suffering and darkness shall be removed."

Granth Sahib,"Sexual desire and anger shall not seduce you, and the dog of greed shall depart."
Granth Sahib,"Renounce sexual desire, anger, falsehood and slander; forsake Maya and eliminate egotistical pride."
Granth Sahib,"In age after age, through all the ages, forever and ever, those who belong to the Guru's Family shall prosper and increase."
Granth Sahib,"At the age of ten, he is a child; at twenty, a youth, and at thirty, he is called handsome. At forty, he is full of life; at fifty, his foot slips, and at sixty, old age is upon him. At seventy, he loses his intellect, and at eighty, he cannot perform his duties. At ninety, he lies in his bed, and he cannot understand his weakness. After seeking and searching for such a long time, O Nanak, I have seen that the world is just a mansion of smoke."
Granth Sahib,Faith in Him has welled up within my mind. Nanak gives this advice.
Granth Sahib,"This opportunity shall not come again! I say to you, O my body, listen to my advice! You slander, and then praise others; you indulge in lies and gossip. You gaze upon the wives of others, O my soul; you steal and commit evil deeds."
Granth Sahib,"Listen - listen to my advice! Only the good deeds which you have done shall remain with you, O my soul."
Granth Sahib,He seeks no advice when He builds; He seeks no advice when He destroys. He seeks no advice while giving or taking. He alone knows His Creative Power; He Himself does all deeds. He beholds all in His Vision. He gives to those with whom He is pleased.
Granth Sahib,Whatever pleases You is a pure action of karma.
Granth Sahib,"Serve the True Guru fearlessly, and your doubt shall be dispelled."
Huseyin Sahin,She was brought to hospital with respiration problems very late.
Huseyin Sahin,"She was brought to hospital with respiration problems very late. We immediately began treatment for bird flu since she had contacted fowl, but her condition has become grave and we lost her today."
Huseyin Sahin,"Tests conducted by one of the doctors at our establishment determined that the six patients suffered from pulmonary infections, from pneumonia."
Huseyin Sahin,It can't be known whether the disease is bird flu or not before the test result is announced in Ankara.
Huseyin Sahin,"Fifteen of them are in bed, one in a critical condition and eight are able to move about. Most of the patients are children."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,More wisdom is latent in things as they are than in all the words men use.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Only he can understand what a farm is, what a country is, who shall have sacrificed part of himself to his farm or country, fought to save it, struggled to make it beautiful. Only then will the love of farm or country fill his heart."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness."

Antoine de Saint-Exupery,True love begins when nothing is looked for in return.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Sorrow is one of the vibrations that prove the fact of living
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"What do we mean by setting a man free? You cannot free a man who dwells in a desert and is an unfeeling brute. There is no liberty except the liberty of some one making his way towards something. Such a man can be set free if you will teach him the meaning of thirst, and how to trace a path to a well. Only then will he embark upon a course of action that will not be without significance. You could not liberate a stone if there were no law of gravity -- for where will the stone go, once it is quarried?"
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea"
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,A pile of rocks ceases to be a rock when somebody contemplates it with the idea of a cathedral in mind.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,We say nothing essential about the cathedral when we speak of its stones. We say nothing essential about Man when we seek to define him by the qualities of men.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"When you give yourself, you receive more than you give."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"For true love is inexhaustible; the more you give, the more you have. And if you go to draw at the true fountainhead, the more water you draw, the more abundant is its flow."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"To be a man is, precisely, to be responsible."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret; it is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"'Men have forgotten this truth,' said the fox. 'But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.'"
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking together in the same direction.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Grown-ups never understand anything for themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"To be a man is to be responsible. It is to feel shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery. It is to take pride in a victory won by one's comrades. It is to feel, when setting one's stone, that one is contributing to the building of the world."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Once men are caught up in an event, they cease to be afraid. Only the unknown frightens men."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"The meaning of things lies not in the things themselves, but in our attitude towards them."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"You are responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"The notion of looking on at life has always been hateful to me. What am I if I am not a participant? In order to be, I must participate."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"He who has gone, so we but cherish his memory, abides with us, more potent, nay, more present than the living man."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"It is such a secret place, the land of tears."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,A single event can awaken within us a stranger totally unknown to us. To live is to be slowly born.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"How could there be any question of acquiring or possessing, when the one thing needful for a man is to become -- to be at last, and to die in the fullness of his being."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,I know but one freedom and that is the freedom of the mind.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Let a man in a garret but burn with enough intensity and he will set fire to the world
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Man's progress is but a gradual discovery that his questions have no meaning
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction"
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Commonly, people believe that defeat is characterized by a general bustle and a feverish rush. Bustle and rush are the signs of victory, not of defeat. Victory is a thing of action. It is a house in the act of being built. Every participant in victory sweats and puffs, carrying the stones for the building of the house. But defeat is a thing of weariness, of incoherence, of boredom. And above all of futility."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"The injustice of defeat lies in the fact that its most innocent victims are made to look like heartless accomplices. It is impossible to see behind defeat, the sacrifices, the austere performance of duty, the self-discipline and the vigilance that are there -- those things the god of battle does not take account of."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Tell me who admires and loves you, and I will tell you who you are."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Love is not just looking at each other, it's looking in the same direction."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him; it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self-respect is a sin."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Transport of the mails, transport of the human voice, transport of flickering pictures --in this century as in others our highest accomplishments still have the single aim of bringing men together."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"A civilization is a heritage of beliefs, customs, and knowledge slowly accumulated in the course of centuries, elements difficult at times to justify by logic, but justifying themselves as paths when they lead somewhere, since they open up for man his inner distance."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"A civilization is built on what is required of men, not on that which is provided for them."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Charity never humiliated him who profited from it, nor ever bound him by the chains of gratitude, since it was not to him but to God that the gift was made."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Of what worth are convictions that bring not suffering?
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"You are beautiful, but you are empty. One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"It is in the compelling zest of high adventure and of victory, and in creative action, that man finds his supreme joys."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,The time for action is now. It's never too late to do something.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,What saves a man is to take a step. Then another step.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Whoever loves above all the approach of love will never know the joy of attaining it.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"What was my body to me? A kind of flunkey in my service. Let but my anger wax hot, my love grow exalted, my hatred collect in me, and that boasted solidarity between me and my body was gone."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"Loving is not just looking at each other, it's looking in the same direction."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
Buffy Sainte-Marie,Language and culture cannot be separated. Language is vital to understanding our unique cultural perspectives. Language is a tool that is used to explore and experience our cultures and the perspectives that are embedded in our cultures.
Buffy Sainte-Marie,"Instead of kids just hearing about beads and baskets and fringe, and about what 'was' and 'were,' we present Native American culture as a living contemporary culture."
Buffy Sainte-Marie,"It was a black and white only computer at the time, but it kept me fascinated."
Pat Sajak,"I suspect most self-described 18-year-old Scandinavian women named Inga who collect and wear string bikinis are, in reality, more likely to be middle-aged, pot-bellied guys named Lou who collect and wear string cheese."
Pat Sajak,"If I went in to pitch this show to a network, I would be laughed out of the room,"
Pat Sajak,"I'm talking about O.J. Simpson. As he prowls the nation's golf courses searching for the real murderers of his ex-wife, let us not forget that it was the Simpson saga that taught TV news directors an important lesson: a Big Story can generate big numbers and big profits."
Pat Sajak,"Baseball fans west of New York City might hate the Yankees, but Yankee-hating is a good thing for the sport. Stadiums sell out, ratings go up and a team's own shortcomings can be blamed on someone else."
Pat Sajak,"If I went in to pitch this show to a network, I would be laughed out of the room."
Pat Sajak,"I said yes, which turned out to be the right answer."
Pat Sajak,"It seems to me we have been in a rhetorical arms race in this country, with each side unwilling to lay down its weapons for fear - usually justified - the other side would beat them to a pulp."
Pat Sajak,"Anyone who has seen me spin that heavy, giant wheel on television knows that I'm not a steroid user."
Pat Sajak,That's the trouble with trying to influence an undecided voter. First you have to find one.
Pat Sajak,I'm more concerned about members of Congress being drug-free than I am about members of the Yankees or Giants.
Pat Sajak,"I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Clinton cost John Kerry more votes than he gained for him whenever they appeared together. Imagine being part of a crowd enraptured by the presence of Bill Clinton, and then having to listen to a speech by John Kerry!"
Pat Sajak,"I guess I can be moderately amusing at times, but the idea of standing up in front of 200 people with beers is just too frightening."
Pat Sajak,There is a certain comfort in waking up and finding that Michael Jackson is still the Big Story. At least it tells you that nothing horrible has happened in the world that would force them to move on to real news.
Pat Sajak,"Sometimes you just stumble into something that works, and here I am a quarter of a century later."
Pat Sajak,"A celebrity has just as much right to speak out as people who hold real jobs. This is America, after all, and you should not be precluded from voicing your opinions just because you sing songs, mouth other peoples' words on a sitcom or, for that matter, spin a giant multi-colored wheel on a game show."
Joe Sakic,"We weren't very good, that's obvious, and there's no real explanation. We can't worry about this game; it's over now. We have to keep our heads up and get excited for the playoffs."
Joe Sakic,"With the new rules, we think we can do that."
Joe Sakic,"I expect him, he's going to bounce back, especially with the new rules, and in Nashville, already they have a fast-skating team, so he is definitely going to help that. So I expect him to have a rebound year."
Joe Sakic,We were just watching Marty work his magic. He was unbelievable tonight.
Joe Sakic,"It means a lot because as a kid you watched him (Lafleur) in Montreal, doing his magic. I was fortunate to room with him on the road for the first couple of years I was in Quebec."
Joe Sakic,"The winning goal was bad luck, ... I knew Adam was there, but I didn't know he was changing. It was just bad judgment, I guess."
Joe Sakic,"It's a great honor, a privilege, and I'm looking forward to it. But to me it's not any extra pressure or anything. We're there to try and win a gold together."
Joe Sakic,"The regular season is over and we're all happy to be in this position and getting ready for the playoffs. This is when everybody wants to play. This is the fun time of the year, and we're excited about it."
Joe Sakic,We're there (Turin) to win gold.
Joe Sakic,I don't like playing against him so it's going to be fun playing with him.
Joe Sakic,"The benefit is competition, the thrill of playing in the Olympics, being an Olympian, playing against the best."
Joe Sakic,"You think of Canada, you think of hockey, you think of Wayne Gretzky. This is where he should be. I couldn't imagine it any other way. You saw what he meant to us in 2002. For most of us, he was our idol growing up. When he says something, you're going to listen."
Joe Sakic,"This is where he belongs. He assembled the team. When you think of Canada, you think of hockey and you think of Wayne Gretzky. This is where he should be."
Joe Sakic,"When you think of hockey, when you think of Canada, you think of Wayne Gretzky."
Joe Sakic,All the guys I talk to are happy with Ted. I can't believe this is even an issue.
Joe Sakic,"It's good to see them and show our appreciation. They're coming back, and we know we didn't do the most popular thing in the last year - both sides."
Joe Sakic,"We're facing adversity now, but it's better it be now than later. As the game went on, we did a better job keeping it together, but we're still not together."
Joe Sakic,"No one has given up this year, even when we've faced adversity. Guys are filling in and doing the job."
Angelica Salas,Immigrants are really trying to be present and visible in their opposition to the bill.
Angelica Salas,Immigration law is civil law; law enforcement never enforces civil law.
Angelica Salas,What we're doing is building a movement that will transform America.
John Salazar,"[The key to raising incomes in the low-wage service sector is to recruit more higher-paying businesses to the area, Salazar said. Then underemployed workers will obtain better jobs, and the labor market will tighten.] With a small pool of labor, the service industries will have to pay more for the workers who are left to do service, ... A rising tide raises all ships."
John Salazar,"For the moment, I have totally ruled out the governor's race,"
John Salazar,"For 70 years, Social Security has never failed to pay a promised benefit to seniors or people with disabilities - it has never been a day late or a dollar short, ... The plan he (Bush) is offering won't even come close to putting the program on solid financial footing."
D. Salinger,It's you I hate. You are a snooper and a thief.
D. Salinger,"The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let themdo it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them."
D. Salinger,"They didn't act like people and they didn't act like actors. It's hard to explain. They acted more like they knew they were celebrities and all. I mean they were good, but they were too good."
D. Salinger,"I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot."
D. Salinger,"I don't exactly know what i mean by that, but I mean it."
D. Salinger,I am a kind of paranoiac in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.
Harrison Salisbury,The Russians have an excellent system of higher education. They maintain very high standards. The system is highly structured and competitive.
Harrison Salisbury,The newspaper is a marvelous medium. It is extraordinarily convenient and cheap. Let's see. This one cost 75 cents. Now that's a little high. I bought it when I was downtown this morning.
Harrison Salisbury,Life within the Kremlin was shrouded in impenetrable secrecy.
Harrison Salisbury,"Journalism students need to understand it and need a solid background in the liberal arts, in sociology, economics, literature and language, because they won't get it later on."
Harrison Salisbury,"I visited the Chinese side last year. The Chinese are in a constant state of military readiness. They have all their nuclear weapons in the area, presumably trained on targets across the border."
Harrison Salisbury,"I think it's important to travel around in order to get a notion of what's going on, to find out what people are think about. I enjoy talking on campuses most because people are more informed and discussion is generally livelier."
Harrison Salisbury,"I got a cable from New York saying that what I'd written about the growth of Soviet agricultural production didn't make sense because the same levels were reached under the czars. I wanted to confirm it, but by then the censors were on to me."
Harrison Salisbury,"Here, class attendance is expected and students are required to take notes, which they are tested on. What is missing, it seems to me, is the use of knowledge, the practical training."
Harrison Salisbury,"By the way, I understand that now you can have the Times delivered to your door here in the Twin Cities."
Jonas Salk,Our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors
Jonas Salk,"I have had dreams and I have had nightmares, but I have conquered my nightmares because of my dreams"
Jonas Salk,"I have had dreams and I have had nightmares, but I have conquered my  nightmares because of my dreams"
Jonas Salk,Nothing happens quite by chance. It's a question of accretion of information and experience.
Jonas Salk,Intuition will tell the thinking mind where to look next.
Jonas Salk,I pictured myself as a virus or a cancer cell and tried to sense what it would be like.
Jonas Salk,"I have had dreams, and I've had nightmares. I overcame the nightmares because of my dreams."
Jonas Salk,"Hope lies in dreams, in imagination, and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality."
Jonas Salk,The worst tragedy that could have befallen me was my success. I knew right away that I was through - cast out.
Jonas Salk,The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more.
Jonas Salk,"It is always with excitement that I wake up in the morning wondering what my intuition will toss up to me, like gifts from the sea. I work with it and rely on it. It's my partner."
Jonas Salk,"There is hope in dreams, imagination, and in the courage of those who wish to make those dreams a reality."
Jonas Salk,I feel that the greatest reward for doing is the opportunity to do more.
Tim Salmon,"I haven't been in a game for a year. You're not just going to take a run at batting practice and jump into a game, ... Quite honestly, [to play] would be for selfish reasons."
Tim Salmon,"I'll see what kind of luck I bring,"
Tim Salmon,"I think in a lot of ways, I've responded to a lot of things this year kind of like a rookie Â¿ as far as appreciating things. I've been around a lot, but you can appreciate things a little bit differently when you've been away. It's a different Opening Day than I've experienced in the past, just because of where I've had to come from."
Tim Salmon,I think that is going to be a big step along in my scenario. I hate to sit back and try and figure what they're going to do. I can only control what I do out there.
Tim Salmon,That's our race. That's our playoffs.
Tim Salmon,"I'm a firm believer that the wild-card teams, because they're grinding it out until the final days, have a tremendous amount of excitement. That excitement carries over into the playoffs and really helps."
Alex Salmond,This winning habit will stand the party in good stead as we build towards winning the 20 first-past-the-post seats we need to win the Scottish election in 2007
Alex Salmond,It is true that Sean had a successful procedure carried out some weeks ago. But he's now fighting fit and raring to go.
Alex Salmond,It is true that Sean had a successful procedure carried out some weeks ago but he's now fighting fit and raring to go.
Alex Salmond,"Their whole by-election plan is in tatters, which is no surprise because everything Mr McConnell puts his fingers on usually collapses or turns to dust."
Alex Salmond,"We intend to lead a government of purpose and direction so that we can offer the people of this nation the opportunity to move forward to independence, democracy and equality."
Alex Salmond,The prime minister has just fallen off the high wire. He is a victim of his own arrogance. He may well be on the way out of office.
Pamela Salsberry,"We don't have physiological data, but our findings suggest that prenatal exposure can be seen as a risk factor. There's such a strong relationship."
Pamela Salsberry,Prevention of childhood obesity needs to begin before a woman ever gets pregnant.
Pamela Salsberry,"A child's weight at three years is a good prediction of what his weight will be at age five, and so on. Weight states tend to persist over time."
R. A. Salvatore,"Writing a book for me, I expect, is very similar to the experience of reading the book for my readers."
R. A. Salvatore,"I never intended to be a professional writer; as the story developed, the one thing I had in my hopes was that this would be something tangible to separate me from the nameless, numbered masses."
R. A. Salvatore,"I have absolutely no interest in power gaming. I've done it a couple of times, briefly, and couldn't even stand sitting at the computer."
R. A. Salvatore,"So, while I gave up the notions of publishing at that time, I never stopped editing and refining that book. A few years later, in 1987, I thought I had it ready to go out again."
R. A. Salvatore,I'm a working-class kid from a blue-collar New England family.
R. A. Salvatore,"I didn't and don't go to Internet for any business purposes. The book sales for me by this point are way beyond any influence I might have, positively, or others might have, negatively."
R. A. Salvatore,"I don't often know exactly what's coming next, and that makes it more fun. And you know, for me, this entire genre is all about that; it's all about having fun and getting away from the mundane world for just a little while."
R. A. Salvatore,Writing is an incredibly lonely job.
R. A. Salvatore,"Okay, I'm exaggerating, but the truth is that the Internet can be a powerful tool, both positive and negative, to a writer's career."
R. A. Salvatore,"I've always been a fighter. If you tell me I can't, I'll die trying to prove you wrong."
R. A. Salvatore,"It got so bad that by the time I was graduated, the only reading I did was in order to get the grade and the only writing I did was in order to get the grade."
R. A. Salvatore,"In the past, TSR and now Wizards of the Coast have asked me to do game stats for my characters, and I'm never comfortable doing that. It's all relative after all."
R. A. Salvatore,"I'm trying to make all the characters change and grow, or regress."
R. A. Salvatore,"I thought I would set the world on fire when I got out of college. I had done quite well in a field that was growing. Unfortunately, we got hit with a recession in 1981."
R. A. Salvatore,"I loved to read and to write, but then something happened. As I made my way through school, I kept getting handed books to read that didn't excite me and didn't even remotely connect to the realities of my life."
R. A. Salvatore,I loved the world of imagination.
R. A. Salvatore,"Here's the thing, for me at least: this is a huge genre now. It wasn't always so. Not so many years ago, it wasn't so. There is a tremendous diversity in fantasy today."
R. A. Salvatore,"Also, there are authors and publicists using the Internet to manipulate opinion, both positively for a work and negatively against the competition. I don't do this and can't stomach it, honestly."
R. A. Salvatore,"Definitely they write themselves. It's an amazing experience. It's like the characters have come alive and are sitting on my shoulder talking to me, telling me their tales."
Marian Salzman,"The content is as important as the shopping opportunity,"
Marian Salzman,"They are confident, masculine, stylish, and committed to uncompromising quality in all areas of life."
Marian Salzman,"This is going to be very sophisticated . . . consumer sleuthing, ... The degree of intelligence that you can compile this way is really mind-boggling."
Marian Salzman,This is going to be very sophisticated . . . consumer sleuthing. The degree of intelligence that you can compile this way is really mind-boggling.

Marian Salzman,"There is a dire shortage of great advertising to men,"
Juan Samaranch,"These members have done great harm to the Olympic ideal. Now the greatest service to the Olympic movement is simply to accept their fate,"
Juan Samaranch,"We are very grateful to the authorities concerned, and also for their excellent response in the security measures that have been taken,"
Juan Samaranch,"Olympism is a philosophy which, by blending sport with culture, seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal ethical principle"
Juan Samaranch,"Spain is not a racist country,"
Juan Samaranch,"Our philosophy precedes from the belief that sport is an inalienable part of the educational process and a factor for promoting peace, friendship, cooperation and understanding among peoples."
Jeff Samardzija,"It?s kind of an understanding between Brady and the receivers that being taller just creates an advantage in different situations. There?s times you can be covered but have a few inches on the guy, (and it) pretty much equals being uncovered."
Jeff Samardzija,"Everyone knows Brady's always had the arm. He's always had the physical talent. He's always been a smart quarterback. But once Coach Weis got here, he kind of instilled a mentality in Brady to let him know he's got that skill."
Jeff Samardzija,"It's going to be exciting - especially being a Big East game - coming home and getting that first start of the year. We'll see, hopefully it'll be a good opener on Friday under the lights."
Jeff Samardzija,"I'm surrounded by the right people. I've got a lot of good family and friends, two great head coaches. It will be a tough decision but not a bad one to have."
Jeff Samardzija,"I wasn't getting the low strike, and I live down there. That defense behind me was outstanding."
Jeff Samardzija,They made more plays than us on offense and defense.
Jeff Samardzija,"Coach Weis has brought a confidence to this team that's just kind of bled through the team. It's kind of something we're trying to feed off of. ... He's brought a lot of things, but I think the mentality he's brought has just been probably the key part."
Jeff Samardzija,"From the beginning I said I was going to give my heart to both sports and whatever worked out in the end was going to be my decision. After this season my decision has gotten exponentially tougher. Still, I'm not worried about it. I'm not leaning one way or the other. I'm just trying to have fun with these guys. It goes so fast. Before you know it I'll be playing my last home game at Notre Dame Stadium and trying to figure out what I want to do."
Jeff Samardzija,"I'm an athlete playing baseball and football, which is the proper way to say it. I love both of them. I'm not worrying about making a decision."
Jeff Samardzija,"Brady and Mo put up some crazy numbers. I just caught a couple of balls, but those two were going crazy. They were scoring touchdowns left and right."
Richie Sambora,"The real story is that there is no story. The truth is that after 11 years together, we are still happily married. Boring but true."
Richie Sambora,"The Army guys were kind enough to give us their big theater they have there, and at the end of the rehearsals, we're going to do a show for all of the (soldiers) and their families, ... It's not open to the public. We're just doing anything we can do. Really, it's just any time you can give back to those guys who are out there fighting for our freedom, for God's sakes."
Richie Sambora,"I want the people of New Jersey to jump off a cliff like Kurt Vonnegut so I can show them how to fly. This way, nobody needs to grow any wings, which would be impossible anyway because we're humans and not some kind of bird."
Richie Sambora,"That got me thinking. Bon Jovi kills in Jersey. Just kills. We did Atlantic City this past winter and man, you wouldn't believe the intensity in that crowd. Can I just talk for a minute about how amazingly hot Heather is?"
Pete Sampras,"(The tournament) was one of my more favorite stops and I know a lot of players love playing in the desert and it's good to see it's staying in the desert. Obviously playing the event for 14 or 15 years, I love the two weeks I would spend there. I have a home close to there and I can have a presence at the event now that I'm a very small piece to a big puzzle."
Pete Sampras,You kind of live and die by the serve.
Pete Sampras,"Where I fall down is my short game. I don't practice enough, and when I have to take a half swing from 50 yards out, that's trouble."
Pete Sampras,"Tennis is seen all around the world; if I am home or anywhere in the country, United States, people will stare."
Pete Sampras,It is nice to walk out on a court to have it packed.
Pete Sampras,"In tennis, you can make a couple of mistakes and still win. Not in golf. I played three rounds in that Tahoe event, and I was drained. Mentally, not physically."
Pete Sampras,"I don't know how I do it, I really don't."
Pete Sampras,I am going to hold serve the majority of the time. It is nice to have a little time to return serve.
Pete Sampras,Golfers are forever working on mechanics. My tennis swing hasn't changed in 10 years.
Pete Sampras,"For so long people have just taken what I do for granted. It is not easy to do year-in, year-out, to win Grand Slams and be No. 1."
Pete Sampras,"If Davis Cup was a little bit less or once every two years, I would be more inclined to play. But the way it is now, it is too much tennis for me."
Pete Sampras,"There's always one shot that I can rely on when I'm not hitting the ball that well, is my serve."
Pete Sampras,"People know me. I'm not going to produce any cartwheels out there. I'm not going to belong on Comedy Central. I'll always be a tennis player, not a celebrity."
Pete Sampras,"The difference of great players is at a certain point in a match they raise their level of play and maintain it. Lesser players play great for a set, but then less."
Pete Sampras,"I let my racket do the talking. That's what I am all about, really. I just go out and win tennis matches."
Pete Sampras,When you retire you want to get as far away as possible from the game for a couple of years.
Kelvin Sampson,The strength of the team is up front now. But we don't have a guy who you know can give you points when the going gets tough.
Kelvin Sampson,This isn't Cinderella. This is the security guard at the back door. They'll beat you up.
Kelvin Sampson,I just know that Ricardo does a great job there and he's got his team in the tournament and a guy who does that needs to be rewarded.
Kelvin Sampson,"I'm a huge proponent of weight training. We lift at 6 because of the work ethic required, the discipline and doing the right thing. It makes them accountable. It makes them be on time."
Kelvin Sampson,"From a common-sense standpoint, you're probably on the right road. The problem is, you're opening a can of worms you might not be able to shut. That might cause more problems than it solves."
Kelvin Sampson,"Duke is the premier basketball program in the nation. For us, this is a great opportunity, and to me, it is an honor to go to Duke and play. Playing Duke will be a great experience for our kids and will certainly prepare us for the wars we are going to have to play in the Big Ten."
David Samson,"We're marketing no expectation, and we're trying to introduce people to players."
David Samson,"[Owner] Jeffrey [Loria] has shown time and time again his desire to win year after year, ... He has shown his desire to have a competitive team. The reason why we never talk is the proof is always in the results, and it's far more powerful when actions speak without words."
David Samson,"Seat capacity will be similar, but in terms of design, that was designed to be next to the Orange Bowl, so the design will be different."
David Samson,It should be noted that Miami and south Florida continue to be our first choice. But the reality is we don't have a deal there because our lease expires after 2010.
David Samson,"We told them that Florida is our first choice, but we have no deal yet."
David Samson,"We're definitely negotiating with everybody, and we're trying to get a deal done here because it is our first choice. But we recognize it may not happen and we don't have much time left."

Sergei Samsonov,"It makes it easier. We trade thoughts, and obviously he is a big addition to the team."
Sergei Samsonov,"There's still a little bit of pain, it's still kind of there. But it's good enough to practice and play. Hopefully it will just fade away now over the next couple of weeks."
Sergei Samsonov,It was my first year in North America and we won the cup. It was one of my best years ever. I made a lot of friends during that time and it was a real big learning process for me.

Ricardo Sanchez,"America received a call to arms Sept. 11 when terrorists hit the heart of America,"
George Sand,"If they are ignorant, they are despised, if learned, mocked. In love they are reduced to the status of courtesans. As wives they are treated more as servants than as companions. Men do not love them: they make use of them, they exploit them, and expect, in that way, to make them subject to the law of fidelity."
George Sand,The prayers of a lover are more imperious than the menaces of the whole world
George Sand,"One is happy as a result of one's own efforts  once one knows the necessary ingredients of happiness  simple tastes, a certain degree of courage, self denial to a point, love of work, and above all, a clear conscience."

George Sand,"We cannot tear out a single page of our life, but we can throw the whole book in the fire"
George Sand,I have no enthusiasm for nature which the slightest chill will not instantly destroy
George Sand,"Faith is an excitement and an enthusiasm: it is a condition of intellectual magnificence to which we must cling as to a treasure, and not squander on our way through life in the small coin of empty words, or in exact and priggish argument."
George Sand,"It is sad, no doubt, to exhaust one's strength and one's days in cleaving the bosom of this jealous earth, which compels us to wring from it the treasures of its fertility, when a bit of the blackest and coarsest bread is, at the end of the day's work, the sole recompense and the sole profit attaching to so arduous a toil."
George Sand,"I regard as a mortal sin not only the lying of the senses in matters of love, but also the illusion which the senses seek to create where love is only partial. I say, I believe, that one must love with all of one's being, or else live, come what may, a life of complete chastity."

Ryne Sandberg,I got to see him when I got inducted into the Hall of Fame last July and he sang a song for my wife and myself that we danced to. He was just a big part of my experience with the Hall of Fame last July.

Ryne Sandberg,"In baseball, there's always the next day."
Ryne Sandberg,"If you played the game the right way, played the game for the team, good things would happen."
Ryne Sandberg,"If this validates anything, it's that learning how to bunt and hit and run and turning two is more important than knowing where to find the little red light at the dug out camera."
Ryne Sandberg,I was in the postseason twice and I'm thankful for that.
Ryne Sandberg,I was in awe every time I walked on to the field.
Ryne Sandberg,"I struggled many times when maybe it didn't look like I was struggling, and I had to work hard every day."

Ryne Sandberg,I had too much respect for the game to leave it behind or to make it my second or third sport in college.
Ryne Sandberg,I didn't want to let them down or let the fans down or my teammates or my family or myself. I had too much respect for them to let them down.

Ryne Sandberg,Baseball wasn't easy for me.
Ryne Sandberg,"A lot of people say this honor validates my career, but I didn't work hard for validation."
Ryne Sandberg,"Hit a home run - put your head down, drop the bat, run around the bases, because the name on the front is more - a lot more important than the name on the back."
Carl Sandburg,"And how should a beautiful, ignorant stream of water know it heads for an early release - out across the desert, running toward the Gulf, below sea level, to murmur its lullaby, and see the Imperial Valley rise out of burning sand with cotton blossoms, wheat, watermelons, roses, how should it know?"

Carl Sandburg,Nothing happens unless first we dream.
Carl Sandburg,Ordering a man to write a poem is like commanding a pregnant woman to give birth to a red-headed child.
Carl Sandburg,"Poetry is the journal of the sea animal living on land, wanting to fly in the air. Poetry is a search for syllables to shoot at the barriers of the unknown and the unknowable. Poetry is a phantom script telling how rainbows are made and why they go away."
Carl Sandburg,I've written some poetry I don't understand myself.
Carl Sandburg,I never made a mistake in grammar but one in my life and as soon as I done it I seen it.
Carl Sandburg,One of the greatest necessities in America is to discover creative solitude
Carl Sandburg,I'll die propped up in bed trying to do a poem about America.

Carl Sandburg,"I have always felt that a woman has the right to treat the subject of her age with ambiguity until, perhaps, she passes into the realm of over ninety. Then it is better she be candid with herself and with the world."

Barry Sanders,The game is the ultimate significance to me because it is so important to a lot of people. It has left a mark on our culture to be voted as one of the best to ever play.
Barry Sanders,My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire to remain in it. I have searched my heart through and through and feel comfortable with this decision.
Barry Sanders,Let's just win it and go home.
Barry Sanders,"It was a wonderful experience to play in the NFL, and I have no regrets. I truly will miss playing for the Lions. I consider the Lions' players, coaches, staff, management and fans my family. I leave on good terms with everyone in the organization."
Barry Sanders,I quit because I didn't feel like the Detroit Lions had a chance to win. It just killed my enjoyment of the game.
Barry Sanders,I want to thank all of the fans and media who made playing in the NFL such a wonderful experience. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of them.
Barry Sanders,"Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably would not return for the 1999-2000 season. I also felt that I should take as much time as possible to sort through my feelings and make sure that my feelings were backed with conviction."
Barry Sanders,"I wish my teammates, coaches and the entire Lions organization all the best."
Bob Sanders,"The way our defense is set up, it puts me in situations where I'm one-on-one in making tackles on running backs. When I go into it, I think I am going to win. It really doesn't matter the size, height, weight, whatever. I'm not afraid of putting my body in there."
Bob Sanders,"Peyton, he can't win it himself. I think Peyton's done a great job with us and he'll continue to get better."
Bob Sanders,"We squared up and his feet went flying over his head. Ever since I can remember, I've tackled the way I tackle now. I have always been a very aggressive football player. Once I put the pads on, I have this love for being aggressive, to just throw my body around."
Bob Sanders,"You'll notice that the college people weren't there, and that's because there is no agreement, and it's because these parts of the Open Meetings Act that I just explained to you have not happened, and that's the only way the college can settle a lawsuit."
Deion Sanders,Devin has talent I haven't seen before.
Deion Sanders,"I think I have unfinished business, particularly on behalf of last season, ... I think there was never a doubt with my teammates or the brass of the Ravens [that] I could perform, but I think with some of the reporters or public [there was], but that shouldn't be a doubt. The only problem is how can I perform, how long can I stay on the field? That's something I need your prayers about. If I stay on the field, I'm going to make plays."

Jerry Sanders,"I am really excited about the support I've gotten from San Diego,"
Jerry Sanders,"It disappeared as if somehow the citizens were to blame for the problems that we have right now. Starting today, that will be back on the city's Web site."

Jerry Sanders,"Some management positions vacated by these resignations will be eliminated, consistent with my plans to flatten and streamline City Hall bureaucracy,"

Jerry Sanders,"I think the problem is you can't just kind of reveal things,"
Jerry Sanders,"It's just a culture of concealing things from the public, and this is just another sample of it,"
Jerry Sanders,"Those efforts have failed as the performance deficiencies of computers based on Intel's Pentium 4 processors have become increasingly evident, ... Nevertheless, drastic price cuts and large, cash-backed marketing programs from Intel had the effect of driving down [average selling prices] on PC processors in the market segments where we compete directly."
Jerry Sanders,We are very proud to bring awareness to the issues on the Gulf Coast with the rebuilding. To have Major League Baseball contribute what they did and to allow us as a city to see what's going on -- to help build houses for Habitat for Humanity -- having corporate partners and most of all having the Padres invite us to be part of this -- we are very excited about it.
Larry Sanders,"We've upgraded our booking area and we've added security, with additional locks."
Larry Sanders,They (search crews) are doing a good job. Patience is the key.

Larry Sanders,"When deputy Ross Solberg returned from active duty in the military the board did not increase the budget, but we did not lay any officers off. Hopefully we're going to be able to fund that spot through our recreational patrols."
Reggie Sanders,"We all know if this team was full strength, what the outcome probably would have been. But for me, I think what sticks out the most is just the heart of players going out there hurt. Granted, things didn't turn out the way we wanted, but to me, I'm thinking about playing hurt [as opposed to] not playing at all. For guys to go out there and show heart, what more can you ask for?"
Reggie Sanders,"For me, what stands out is perseverance, ... This game is very tough politically. Sometimes you realize you have talent, and you have to go out and prove it and continue to work."
Reggie Sanders,"Once I got off the pain medication I wasn't at the level I thought I was, ... I think the pain medication was talking more than the body was. But the time I got off the pain medication and I got here, it wasn't good."

Reggie Sanders,"Oh yeah, I felt the eyes, ... But that's not a bad thing. It's a good thing to be wanted."
Reggie Sanders,The most important thing is to key in on your emotions. Look at my first at-bat. My emotions were all over the place.
Reggie Sanders,"I'm a lot older, experienced -- and you learn how to really house all the emotions that you may go through under the pressure, ... You know, for me, talking with Hal [McRae, the Cardinals' hitting coach], having a game plan and sticking with it and not altering it has been a plus, too. So really, it's just the experience, more than anything."
Reggie Sanders,"With experience, you learn how to house those emotions and focus on what you need to focus on, ... A lot of times you get too involved with outside forces instead of what you need to be worrying about."
Reggie Sanders,"My first at-bat, my emotions were all over the place, ... So you really sit back and think about what was going on. . . . You learn over the course that it's all about how you can house those emotions."
Reggie Sanders,"You've seen a variety of teams having success and that creates a belief across baseball that if you stick together, great things can happen."
Reggie Sanders,I'm one of those guys who believe things get better with age. This is all about preparation for opening day and I'm feeling good about where things are at this point.
Scott Sanders,"We all have obstacles to overcome and while our life's journey may not be identical to Celie, I think that triumph over adversity and moving on and finding self-love and yourself and your voice is something that we all need to do. I didn't feel like it was a black story or a woman's story, I thought it was universal and always thought the story sang, that it had so much music in its soul."
Scott Sanders,"I didn't want to believe the 3.8 percent number published in the League's little research book. That wasn't the way we would sell this show. We deliberately went out and created a marketing plan that would appeal to audiences of all races, genders, ages - everyone."
Scott Sanders,"Read these for the characters and tales, yes, but above all for the language, which seems to rise from the very springs of invention."
Scott Sanders,"[Though an arduous journey for Sanders, the humble impresario noted his is a backseat on the producing team.] I actually asked her if she would put her name above the title as a presenter as well as a producer and she said 'I can't do that to you, you've been working on this for eight years, I'd never do that.' ... My name doesn't sell two tickets, put your name on the marquee."
Scott Sanders,"I always thought Celie's journey was universal,"
Scott Sanders,It's a question of how do we pay those personnel costs. There are two main choices - raise property taxes or create a franchise fee on gas and electric. We're not seeing opportunities to decrease expenditures without harming services.
Scott Sanders,The key point to the budget is that there are only two staff increases. The budget is status quo with the exception of two new positions in the police department. People need to understand we're not hiring a bunch of people or growing the government with the exception of those two people.
Steve Sanders,"If there is a worker injured due to an intentional safety violation in any other industry, this ruling would apply to that situation as well."
Steve Sanders,"You can make a living going across the middle [of the field], that's what I always say, ... Because you have some guys who are scared to go across the middle."
Steve Sanders,They were the first electronic exchange in the options world so we certainly have a lot of faith in their ability to pull this off.
Steve Sanders,Let me just touch on the legal chaos this would drop in your lap.
Tim Sanders,The purpose and goal is to consolidate and coordinate all the bus lines that run throughout Lake and Porter counties.
Tim Sanders,"It was kind of like a pinball machine. Each team looked like it got the momentum, and then - turnover."
Tim Sanders,"We want them to have that local commitment to the community, and that's a big part of our request for proposals. We're not looking for Wells Fargo out of San Francisco."
Tim Sanders,"Not once in any of this have they ever complained about what we've asked them to do, ... It's an acceptance factor that they've come to us and said, 'Whatever you want us to do. We're here to do this to the best of our ability.' And the ability is sometimes limited, but you couldn't ask for better kids than what we've got."
Adam Sandler,I'm not comfortable being around too many people. I don't like being out in public too much. I don't like going to bars. I don't like doing celebrity stuff. So most of the characters I play are people who don't always feel comfortable beyond their small circle of friends.
Adam Sandler,"I bought my parents some stuff. That feels kind of good to be able to do that. I got them a place in Florida. I think I'm allowed to say that - I hope my dad doesn't get mad at me. But I don't spend money on myself. I don't like myself enough yet. But the people I love, I like spending the cash on them."
Adam Sandler,"I do love the movies I've done in the past,"
Adam Sandler,Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is bad when you make crack with it.
Adam Sandler,"Well, we're living in a material world, and I'm a material girl... or boy."
Adam Sandler,"My buddies, we've always just tried to make each other laugh, ... I mean, just like all friends hanging out -- that's the goal."
Adam Sandler,"So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink, put you to bed when you've had too much to drink.Oh, it could be so nice to grow old with you, I wanna grow old with you."
Adam Sandler,"I sang a song at my sister's wedding. My mother forced me into that, too. But that one felt all right."
Adam Sandler,"I sing seriously to my mom on the phone. To put her to sleep, I have to sing Maria from West Side Story. When I hear her snoring, I hang up."
Adam Sandler,"I mean, I look at my dad. He was twenty when he started having a family, and he was always the coolest dad. He did everything for his kids, and he never made us feel like he was pressured. I know that it must be a great feeling to be a guy like that."
Adam Sandler,"I'm 31 now. I think I'm beginning to understand what life is, what romance is, and what a relationship means."
Adam Sandler,I never had a speech from my father 'this is what you must do or shouldn't do' but I just learned to be led by example. My father wasn't perfect.
Adam Sandler,"Feels good to try, but playing a father, I'm getting a little older. I see now that I'm taking it more serious and I do want that lifestyle."
Bobby Sands,Our revenge will be the laughter of our children.
Bobby Sands,"We refuse to lie here in dishonor! We are not criminals, but Irishmen! This is the crime of which we stand accused."
Bobby Sands,"Generations will continue to meet the same fate unless the perennial oppressor-Britain-is removed, for she will unashamedly and mercilessly continue to maintain her occupation and economic exploitation of Ireland to judgment day, if she is not halted and ejected."
Bobby Sands,"They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart. The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show. It is then that we will see the rising of the moon."
Linda Sanford,"Fifteen years ago, New York had 1.1 million more jobs than Texas. Today, Texas has 1 million more jobs than New York. That's the lost ground we must recover."

Flip Saunders,"They (Pistons) trust each other and I think veteran players have a tendency to trust their teammates more and when you have great trust in your teammates, you will go out and play with a lot more confidence."
Flip Saunders,"I think because of the way our travel is, because we're going from one city to the other, it makes it a little more difficult from that angle."
Flip Saunders,"They can be a team that can get dynamic. What we have to do is know that our strength is defense and we have to just lock down defensively and make them beat us up over the top and know that we're going to contest every play, every shot that's run."
Flip Saunders,That's what pro sports is about.
Flip Saunders,"Ben senses what's coming in two weeks. You have to have an edge about you as an individual, but your game has to be right, too We're like a family. Sometimes there are things you don't agree upon and what you do is you air it out and deal with it. That's what we've done."
Flip Saunders,"He looked like he was 21 when he was sophomore in high school. It does amaze me. I think it amazes a lot of people. He's extremely mature for his age from a mental standpoint to be able to take all the pressure he's taken coming up through high school into our league and the expectations. And not only take those expectations, but live up to them. That's shows a great sign of maturity."
Flip Saunders,"I think ever since the league changed the rules (two years ago) and took away the contact and bumping, and allowed zone defenses, it forced teams to emphasize ball movement and player movement and team basketball."
Flip Saunders,He's fearless. He puts so much pressure on you. I am amazed at the punishment he takes. I'm amazed he's not hurt more (because of) how high he plays off the ground and the falls he takes.
Flip Saunders,"We're not into waste management. We don't take waste and give you great players. But that's how everybody is. At the trade deadline, we all want to get something for nothing."
Flip Saunders,"It's a team sport; it's not an individual sport. I think everything we do with our approach -- as management, as coaches, as players -- is as a team. They don't single anyone out. They win as a team, they lose as a team, and that's what's important."
Flip Saunders,"He got a perfect score. I was fairly impressed with his knowledge of things. Not just the plays, but our philosophy and what we are trying to get accomplished. It was sort of a litmus test to see how much he'd been listening. He's taken in quite a lot."
Flip Saunders,"We're not going to keep Michael to 11 points. We did a nice job, but we all know he's going to get 20 to 30 because he's that good of a player. But we have to make him earn that."
Flip Saunders,We stayed in the game because of Chauncey and Rip (Hamilton).
Flip Saunders,"The funny thing with Mo, he makes spectacular plays at both ends,"
Flip Saunders,"It's funny, everybody talks about trimming minutes, then when I trim minutes, everybody gets upset."
Flip Saunders,"The Bucks are fighting. You want to be as high a seed as you can. They came out, played well and did some nice things."
Flip Saunders,This was a big game for both teams. They're fighting San Antonio to try to win their division and we're fighting to make sure we maintain and keep our rhythm.
Flip Saunders,"It's well deserved. And you know what, he's not just a Hall of Fame player, he's a Hall of Fame person, which maybe is more important. The reason I'm here is because of him."
Flip Saunders,"It was a very entertaining game. You saw, both teams, who they are: meat-and-potato teams. Maybe this is why the game wasn't hyped as much. This is what basketball is meant to be like. Play defense, play team basketball. Not turn the ball over, and make plays for each other."
Flip Saunders,"We cannot exert so much energy. People said at one point, 'Chasing 70 games' - or you chase something, then all of a sudden at the end you've got nothing left. We're a team where if we have energy, we can beat anybody. If we don't have energy, we can be beat by anybody. We can't put ourselves in a situation where we're playing some of these guys 38-39 minutes."
Flip Saunders,"You know, it's a long season. I could have gotten on the guys and tried to raise some emotion, but I think when you do that you are setting yourself up for a low. This is a veteran team, and they have been in a lot of playoff series the last few years. It's not important for them to get too high or too low right now."
Flip Saunders,"Were they going to play 82 straight games? No. I doubt it. You know, when they broke the record, I wasn't even aware of the streak. It's not really a concern."
Flip Saunders,"We jumped on them and that was probably the worst thing. As a coach, you don't like to get up that big that early."
Flip Saunders,"From a coaching standpoint, it makes it kind of special to go and coach and know that you have four guys that are your own guys. They all deserve it, and I think it's great individually, great for the organization."
Flip Saunders,"This is what basketball was meant to be like -- play defense, play team basketball, not turn the ball over and make plays for each other."
Flip Saunders,He has the ability to rebound the ball and almost clear it with one dribble.
Flip Saunders,"He has the ability to knock down those corner threes and guys found him and we had some guys make some good plays. I thought Mo came in and gave us a great spark at both ends, offensively and defensively."
Flip Saunders,We have the ability to lock down and know when to lock down.
Flip Saunders,"What I've learned is I have the ability to do a lot of things. When you have guys who have the abilities that our team has, as a coach you can become more flexible, and when you're more flexible you become less predictable. The less predictable you are, the tougher it is to play against you."
Jennifer Saunders,"Well, I'm lucky because, you see, I'll probably bounce back from this role."
Jennifer Saunders,"Well, I would definitely give up performing... But I would still sit down in an office and pretend to write with Dawn, even if we never produced anything, because it's just hilarious. I would miss that."
Jennifer Saunders,"We were watching the first series recently, and it has a charm, a kind of amateur charm. At that point we didn't involve ourselves technically at all - we just messed about and told our jokes - and it looks a bit like that."
Jennifer Saunders,"They have become part of us in that if we get dressed up as them, we don't actually have to have a script. You can just become them. You just become nervy."
Jennifer Saunders,"There were a lot of areas we didn't cover that I'm hoping to cover if we do some specials. One is to see more of Patsy's home and her home life, which is just the saddest thing."
Jennifer Saunders,"The reason they keep it so tight is that no one liked them, so that without each other, actually, they couldn't exist. They support each other. They support their flaws and everything else."
Jennifer Saunders,"No, sometimes we just have to take liberties because the idea was so good. I wish we'd just gone with the idea that Patsy had been a man. It would have been fantastic."
Jennifer Saunders,"Lacroix has been fantastic. He's very nice. He gets the joke, and I think that's a good thing."
Jennifer Saunders,"I'd much rather have sat there and just been a fly on the wall, instead of having to smile at people. I'd rather have been a waitress. Just gone round and stared at people."
Jennifer Saunders,"I remember when the first police scary video thing came out, and you thought, wow, ooh, look at this, come and look, come and look. And now it's on every channel."
Jennifer Saunders,"I love the TV show, and if you make a bad movie it means you've soiled it. Just like if we made an advert. We were offered so many times and I'd say, look, this is the good thing, and you can't compromise that, because then you compromise the integrity of the characters."
Jennifer Saunders,"I grew up with a mother who, every time she saw something, would say, I'm going to look that up. And I've become that person - I've become the reference-book person."
Jennifer Saunders,I can remember the first face-lift show that came on. I rang up everyone - are you watching? I'm watching.
Jennifer Saunders,"But I think our humour is exactly the same today. Only, we've made rules now. We've said we are not going to do prosthetic make-up scenes, because when they take it off half your face comes off."
Jennifer Saunders,"You get crushes on people. You have to see them every day in that week. They're a fantastic person, and it could be a man or a woman."
Jennifer Saunders,"Men would find it much harder because men have such odd personal relationships with each other. They don't really emotionally connect, whereas women do. I think women become very close."
John Saunders,"Overall, advance ticket sales for Speed Weeks are trending ahead of last year."
John Saunders,I enjoyed watching her make it. I'd sit in this chair (in their living room) and watch her.

Adam Savage,I reject your reality and substitute it for my own.
Adam Savage,"I arrived at ILM during the final push to finish Episode I, and it was like going to heaven. A shop full of some of the best people I've ever had the honor to work with. I was lucky enough to spend a few weeks at Skywalker Ranch working on pre-production models for Episode II. Given that it was one of the first jobs I ever wanted to have, it was pretty cool to get a chance to participate."
Adam Savage,"That aesthetic of the Star Wars universe: the do-it-yourself, hotrod ethic that George Lucas exported from his childhood, is exactly the same kind of soul behind what we do and build for the show. It may not look pretty, but it gets the job done."
Adam Savage,I reject your reality and substitute my own.

Rick Savage,"You know, even though you have a limb severed, the signals keep running down the nerves so I still get an itch on my elbow or whatever."
Rick Savage,"There's so much that has been before the human race, and just contemplating that and then the earliest forms of communication, hand claps, body slaps and then ultimately the drum, which was really the first way that man could imitate the first sound they heard: their mothers heartbeat."
Rick Savage,"Just the same way I'd say a prayer before going onstage, taking that even further and using the drum to inspire people. And using that as a vehicle for the intention."
Rick Savage,Sometimes it's a negative because I still have a memory of some of the things I could do... when I still had two arms.
Rick Savage,"And really, it's my home life that my own personal foundation is based on and not necessarily the life within the band."
Rick Savage,"Thinking about what songs are coming next instead of just relaxing, breathing and playing from my heart. Sometimes it can get to be almost like the enemy."
Rick Savage,"But it's funny that now I'm in such a happy situation, I look more objectively at my own past and see what others have seen for a long time and I'm just so glad I've been able to get to this point."
Rick Savage,I really don't feel any strong allegiance to any country.
Rick Savage,"I prefer the rather old and battered, things with character, to the brand new."
Rick Savage,"With some of my previous relationships, they never really felt right even from the beginning but I persevered with them."
Rick Savage,"America feels like home as much as it does here. Although it's a strange situation as I feel almost like I'm in no-man's land some of the time, because although I'm a resident, I still can't vote so I don't really have a say in what goes on where I live."

Devon Sawa,Final Destination was the closest thing I've done to a teen movie but it certainly had an edge to it.
Diane Sawyer,It's in the preparation -- in those dreary pedestrian virtues they taught you in seventh grade and you didn't believe. It's making the extra call and caring a lot.
Diane Sawyer,"Whatever you want in life, other people are going to want it too.  Believe in yourself enough to accept the idea that you have an equal right to it."
Diane Sawyer,"Whatever you want in life, other people are going to want it too. Believe in yourself enough to accept the idea that you have an equal right to it."

John Sayles,"It reminded me how much Florida is a place of parallel communities that don't always intersect and have totally different ways of looking at the world. They might do certain things together, but they don't necessarily mix."
John Sayles,"You get to say, 'Here's my philosophical idea about what the costume should like,' and the costume designer comes and gives you choices and sometimes they're all good, and I say, 'What do you think?' and they pick the right thing."
John Sayles,"With Roger, it would be: 'On Page 67, we think this is a little quick to have another attack of Piranhas, so could you put it off until Page 69?'"
John Sayles,When I was really young I didn't know that there was such a thing as a screenwriter. I wrote stories.
John Sayles,"What I often find is it has to do with, is we need somebody who's in one scene to intimidate somebody who's over 5'10' and there I am on the set."
John Sayles,"Well, acting is cheap; I knew all these actors who weren't in the Screen Actors Guild yet, and it happened that they were all just about thirty years old."
John Sayles,"We just said, 'Okay, you're in the movie. Bring what you would bring for a three-day weekend and I hope you like the way you look in it because once you're on camera, that's your wardrobe.' But it worked; it worked and we were very surprised."
John Sayles,"To this day, I get rewrite offers where they say: 'We feel this script needs work with character, dialogue, plot and tone,' and when you ask what's left, they say: 'Well, the typing is very good.'"
John Sayles,"Those are fun, especially if they're going to shoot them in four weeks, because you know they're not going to mess with anything you do, so it can be very imaginative."
John Sayles,"There were not fifteen people in the story department and twenty-five producers and stuff. And Roger had produced 1,000 movies and directed a couple of hundred, and their comments were always very, very specific."
John Sayles,"There are genres I don't care for, and I've never worked in those genres, and then sometimes there are people that I haven't liked and I haven't worked for those people. But if I feel like there's a movie that I would like to go see, I'll jump into it."
John Sayles,The media in America has become so cowed and compromised.
John Sayles,"The hardest thing about movie acting is that if you're playing a character who changes within the movie, you've got to do that, but you've got to do it out of sequence, because we never have gotten to shoot in sequence, and that's really, really tough."
John Sayles,"So when I came to making movies, that's the way I wanted to do it. I didn't kind of wanting to just do one part of the process and leave it at that."
John Sayles,"Not that I've always loved the movie when they finally come out, or if they ever come out-because many of them don't come out-but I've gotten to work with really good story editors and stuff like that."
John Sayles,"My argument has always been that this is not an anti-Bush film, it's a pro-democracy film. And if Bush comes out on the wrong side of democracy, that's his problem."
John Sayles,"Michael Moore, whether you like him or hate him, has done something very important."

John Sayles,"If you write a movie for Roger Corman, it's going to get made. You saw it almost the next day."
John Sayles,I've always felt like I was on the margins. Once upon a time that's what independent used to mean.
John Sayles,"I think I got spoiled and that writing a short story and getting it published, or writing a novel and getting it published, you pretty much get to do the first, second and third draft yourself without a whole lot of interference."
John Sayles,"I take more jobs when I need more money, if I'm investing in films. I take fewer when I don't. Or if something really good comes along, I usually find a way to do a good job on it in the time that I've got."
John Sayles,"I remember being out here at the Sunset Marquis, and whoever knocked on the door, I would take that picture that I was writing and I would put that in the typewriter, so when I had the meeting, they would say: 'Oh, you're working on it right now?'"
John Sayles,"I probably wouldn't have done as many as I did in one year, which I did when I was trying to raise money."
John Sayles,I made it about a three-day weekend so people wouldn't have to change their clothes a lot. We didn't have an art department; we didn't have a make-up department.
John Sayles,I like to act. I work for scale. I don't have an acting agent. I'm in the book.
John Sayles,"I figured, 'When is that ever going to happen again?'. So I basically set out the opposite way movies are made; I set out with a budget first. I said, 'What can I do well for $40,000?'."
John Sayles,"I figured somebody wrote a story who had a typewriter and I thought that movies were made by the cowboys and that they just said, 'Okay, you fall off the horse this time.'"
John Sayles,"I certainly grew up seeing more movies and television than I read books, but when it came time to do the thing itself you don't have to hire a lot of people to sit down and write a book, so that was the story-telling medium that was available to me."
John Sayles,"I always felt like, okay, I'm going to try to tell stories whatever way I can and it would be cool to make a movie, and tell a story that way."
John Sayles,I always feel that there are no final victories and no final defeats. But it's true that America is in a hole right now. There are a lot of dead fish in the water.
John Sayles,"For me the writing, when I'm going to direct it myself, is really just the first draft, and I don't change it very much; I only change it on average about two lines per movie."
John Sayles,"But once I discovered that there was such a thing as a screenwriter and a director and all that, it stayed in my head as a possibility."
John Sayles,"But compared to writing a novel, where you can be God, I did the Bay of Pigs invasion in six pages once, and there were 50,000 guys with boots that I didn't have to pay, and all those extras; we didn't have to pay them."
John Sayles,"Basically, if you could get a good trailer out of the script, Roger had no objection to you making a really good movie. He liked it if you did. He liked the more cleverness and ingenuity you could bring to it. He just wasn't going to give you any more money."
John Sayles,"And it was out in the theaters in two weeks. This is not, 'We're going to develop twenty-five and maybe one's going to get made,' so the first three things I wrote got up on the screen and, good, bad or indifferent, I got to see them on their feet."
John Sayles,"And is there a movie, whatever the genre here, that I would like to go see? If I can see the germ of that there, I'll usually take the job."
John Sayles,Fahrenheit 9/11 took public domain information that should have been on the news every night and put it in a film that a lot of people went to see. But still Bush has never had to answer those charges.
John Sayles,I never thought about being a writer as I grew up. A writer wasn't something I wanted to be. An outfielder was something to be. Most of what I know about style I learned from Roberto Clemente.
Antonin Scalia,"I'm not even sure I wanted it, to tell you the truth,"
Antonin Scalia,"We say 'tough luck, you have to sell it in stores,'"
Antonin Scalia,The honor would have been wonderful.
Antonin Scalia,irrational hatred of the disabled.
Antonin Scalia,"There can be no such thing as either a creditor or a debtor race, ... In the eyes of government, we are just one race, it is American."
Antonin Scalia,"The first instinct of power is the retention of power, and under a Constitution that requires periodic elections, that is best achieved by the suppression of election-time speech,"
Antonin Scalia,Let the cancer patients suffer.
Antonin Scalia,"I do not believe my impartiality can reasonably be questioned,"
Antonin Scalia,You could have 50 different states having 50 different regulations... until they were all litigated out.
Antonin Scalia,Why can't the state accede to the public's wishes?
Antonin Scalia,There is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all.
Antonin Scalia,"In a big family the first child is kind of like the first pancake. If it's not perfect, that's okay, there are a lot more coming along."
Antonin Scalia,A journalistic purpose could be someone with a Xerox machine in a basement.
Antonin Scalia,"If we're picking people to draw out of their own conscience and experience a 'new' Constitution, we should not look principally for good lawyers. We should look to people who agree with us. When we are in that mode, you realize we have rendered the Constitution useless."
Antonin Scalia,Why in the world would you have it interpreted by nine lawyers?
Antonin Scalia,"A search is a search, even if it happens to disclose nothing but the bottom of a turntable."
Antonin Scalia,A law can be both economic folly and constitutional.
Antonin Scalia,What is a moderate interpretation of the text? Halfway between what it really means and what you'd like it to mean?
George Scalise,We are hopeful that a systematic collection of the penalties meted out for IP violations will pressure those regions within China where the penalties are insufficient to deter counterfeiting.
George Scalise,"The industry is currently experiencing lower sales due to an inventory overhang and deceleration in the end-equipment markets. Current forecasts suggest the inventory adjustment will be completed by the end of the third quarter, and end-market product demand will improve later in the year."

Current forecasts suggest the inventory adjustment will be completed by the end of the third quarter, and end-market product demand will improve later in the year."
George Scalise,"For the first time since the September quarter of 2000, Asia Pacific sales had a modest increase on a sequential basis reflecting improved supply-demand balance in the PC market,"
George Scalise,The October sales are another indication that the industry is on track to achieve our forecast of 4.7 percent growth in the fourth quarter.
George Scalise,"The sales increase was dominated by a record 82.4 percent sales rise in the DRAM market, with essentially flat sales in other product areas as forecasted,"
George Scalise,"Our forecast released in November calls fourth-quarter sales to be 4.7 percent higher than the third quarter, and with two months of data now in, we are on target to meet that projection."
George Scalise,"The oversupply of some semiconductor products, such as memory chips, has depressed sales revenue, ... However, we are still optimistic about the industry's position, because the demand for newer and more powerful chips continues to increase."
George Scalise,"There has been stronger-than-expected demand for our products across the board. There is far better inventory management, better capital investment management,"
George Scalise,"China has enacted a number of laws to protect intellectual property, including a law to protect semiconductor layout designs. Enforcement of IP protection laws has been widely recognized as falling short of what is needed to deter violations. In some cases, penalties for violation of IP rights are so light that they are considered to be a routine cost of doing business."
George Scalise,"The tragic events of September 11 may slightly dampen sales for the month of September due to short-term logistical issues; however, we are still confident that we will see sequential quarterly growth commencing in the December quarter."
George Scalise,"The tragic events of September 11 may slightly dampen sales for the month of September due to short-term logistical issues; however, we are still confident that we will see sequential quarterly growth commencing in the December quarter,"
George Scalise,"Strong competition contributed to declining prices for semiconductors, which resulted in nominal growth on higher unit sales in July,"
Al Scates,He was running different routes. I don't know where he was going. He was doing a lot of verbal routes. It was between him and Dennis. He was running all over the place.
Al Scates,"Playing down to their level is usually a problem, but we have to have a mind-set that we're going to play hard before we get there. Last year they had all the emotion and we were lucky to get out of there with a win, and they're going to be excited about playing us again."
Al Scates,"I hope it's only a sprain. We're just verifying there are no broken bones. In any case, we won't be looking for him to play for a while."
Al Scates,"We need to win our home matches. We're 0-1 in the league and we need to win it all. We haven't been getting any first-place votes at this point. We have mostly first-year starters at the hitting positions, so it would be a very big upset. But we're capable of doing that."
Frank Schade,"Most kids don't take (the rivalry) too far. They want to beat one another obviously, but often times they are probably pulling for each other if they aren't playing against each other."
Frank Schade,"We just fell apart on execution. They threw a little trap on us and we did not execute. We got beat by a better team. That's all there is to it. We didn't execute the way we needed to execute, and they were better."
Frank Schade,I was really glad to see him have a breakout game. He's a good shooter and a good basketball player.
Frank Schade,"We have a lot of kids back. What they accomplished this year with 14 wins was far, far better than I had ever dreamed. I thought they worked through some adversity. Most games we went into I thought we were the underdog, and I was very pleased with how they handled themselves."
Frank Schade,"Sometimes when adversity strikes in your life or in your sport, you have to rise to the occasion. I thought our kids did that tonight and I'm very proud of them for that."
Wolfgang Schaeuble,We will do everything we can to stop this nonsense of dual citizenship.
Wolfgang Schaeuble,We are not little boys playing cowboys and Indians. A majority is a majority.
Wolfgang Schaeuble,If the SPD would only finally accept Merkel as chancellor we could have a coalition agreement by late October. We've got to respect the will of the voters.
James Schamus,"When we shed our earthly skin and when our real life begins, there will be no shame .... Just the love that we have made before time."
James Schamus,"It came from a couple bites on the Internet that collided. It showed up on one of these gossip sites, and Ang and I were like, 'Huh? What?' I'm a Dusty Springfield fan but it's all completely fabricated."
James Schamus,"Look out that window and you see a lot of people, including a lot of young ladies, ... That's the future of our film."
James Schamus,"In terms of American culture, I think Ang has an enormous empathy for everything we are,"
Kurt Scherf,"Right now, the content uses break out thusly: news, 41 percent; sports, 27 percent; entertainment, 19 percent; and music videos, 13 percent."
Kurt Scherf,"This year will be a watershed for delivering to consumers an array of new entertainment experiences. Thanks to broadband proliferation and growing cooperation between content producers and other members of the digital entertainment value chain, we'll see significant product and service announcements throughout 2006."
Kurt Scherf,"Because of the shift of increased spending by consumers, it's just such a critical industry right now. Christmas is proof of that. Sales of clothing and jewelry fell year over year, but consumer electronics picked up."
Greg Schiano,"I've done it before with better talent, given up 400 yards. Maybe it's the coordinator."
Greg Schiano,"We haven't. Our strength and our best, most experienced players are on the offensive side of the ball. I don't feel that we've really gotten enough from them to be the team we want to be."
Greg Schiano,"I am very much at peace with where we started, where we are now and where we are going."
Greg Schiano,"We've been here for four years, and I think we have made consistent improvement in every area. I think we are getting very close and are moving forward with building our program. We have a very experienced team with strong senior leadership coming back this year."
Greg Schiano,I just have a funny feeling that Ray is the kind of guy who likes the big lights.
Greg Schiano,"There were points in the game where the momentum could have swung in the other direction. It was the first time the entire team had a fighting, chopping wood attitude the entire game."
Greg Schiano,I really didn't have any complaints with the way it was last year.
Francesca Schiavone,"The humidity is high. You have to change your shirt, you have to drink correct, eat correct, sleep correct, ... To stay here is wonderful, but you have to follow every step."
Francesca Schiavone,"I am of course disappointed, but maybe I need a little practice in the finals of these big tournaments. This was my first Tier I final, and she was just too good for me today. She really played her best tennis, and I have to give her credit for playing a great tournament. I have been working very hard on my fitness and my game, and I hope to get another chance soon. I am very happy with my week and hope to continue my form next week in Zurich."
Francesca Schiavone,I had to think about my match and my games and my concentration because it's not easy to stay there every point. She is good -- (but) she missed a lot today.
Francesca Schiavone,"Lindsay is great champion,"
Francesca Schiavone,"It's very difficult playing against another Italian. Flavia and I are very good friends. We were together until an hour before the match, but when you go on court there are no friends."
Francesca Schiavone,"I'm looking forward to playing against Francesca, ... We are very good friends, so even if she beats me, I'll be happy for her."
Francesca Schiavone,"Something very personal. To prove myself, to keep going and believe in myself. It's not just a trophy for me. It's all that I did to arrive there. It's the most beautiful present that I could receive."
Francesca Schiavone,She is a great athlete and a great champion.
Richard Schickel,"Divorced, not loving their abandoned children as much as they loathe their former wives, directing a combination of need and hostility toward the women who drift in and out of their new lives, they are, as one character puts it, involved in a variety of pharmaceutical experiments."
Richard Schickel,Elia Kazan: A Biography
Richard Schickel,"A movie star is not an artist, he is an art object."
Richard Schickel,"He was the first to conceive of movies as an art form. His belief was that if the traditional art form would not find room for him, then he would make an art form of his own."
Richard Schickel,"That common cold of the male psyche, fear of commitment."
Richard Schickel,This is a soul under perpetual migraine attack.
Richard Schickel,"The law of unintended consequences pushes us ceaselessly through the years, permitting no pause for perspective."
Richard Schickel,A great novel is concerned primarily with the interior lives of its characters as they respond to the inconvenient narratives that fate imposes on them. Movie adaptations of these monumental fictions often fail because they become mere exercises in interior decoration.
Richard Schickel,Memory is the personal journalism of the soul.
Richard Schickel,There is a limbo of the lost through which American males of a certain age and status almost inevitably must pass these days.
Bob Schieffer,"It's certainly not forgotten, but we're moving past it. When you make a mistake like we made, you don't get your credibility back just by saying, 'I promise we're not going to do that again.' You have to make drastic changes, and then you have to work on getting your credibility back one day â€” and one story â€” at a time. That's what we're doing."
Bob Schieffer,"We talked about a thousand things, but we really talked about our parents. She is very close to her mother, and I was very close to my mother."
Bob Schieffer,"Mr. President, ... what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?"
Bob Schieffer,God knows where there is a safe place in Iraq.
Bob Schieffer,"It's certainly not forgotten, but we're moving past it. When you make a mistake like we made, you don't get your credibility back just by saying, 'I promise we're not going to do that again.' You have to make drastic changes, and then you have to work on getting your credibility back one day  and one story  at a time. That's what we're doing."
Bob Schieffer,"With Vietman, we found ourselves involved there before we really understood what was going on."
Bob Schieffer,We're far from perfect. It's a human enterprise.
Bob Schieffer,"We now assume that when people turn on the evening news, they basically already know what the news is. They've heard it on the radio. They've seen it on the Internet. They've seen it on one of the cable companies. So that makes our job a bit different."
Bob Schieffer,They've asked me to do this temporarily. I don't know what temporarily means. Life is temporary.
Bob Schieffer,There's fierce competition between all the networks to get the guest who can bring the most pertinent information about whatever the story of the moment happens to be.
Bob Schieffer,"The most challenging aspect of it is not interviewing the people, but getting the right people at the right time to be interviewed."
Bob Schieffer,"Prior to 9/11, everybody was talking about at least one of the evening news programs going away, that their future was very limited."
Bob Schieffer,People are more sophisticated in the way they go about dealing with the press.
Bob Schieffer,"One thing young people have to always keep in mind when deciding what they want to do with their lives is, is it fun? Is it something that I'm interested in? Is it something I enjoy?"
Bob Schieffer,"Once we get them in the studio, you interview a person the same way you would interview another. You ask them a question. You let them answer. You try to listen closely and then ask a follow-up."
Bob Schieffer,"Obviously, if the commander makes certain decisions that the reporter thinks is inhibiting his right to report a legitimate story, he has to appeal to the commander's boss to get that changed."
Bob Schieffer,Nowadays I'm not even sure if newspapers take into account whether a person is a good writer.
Bob Schieffer,"It's no longer just reporting the headlines of the day, but trying to put the headlines into some context and to add some perspective into what they mean."
Bob Schieffer,It's getting the right person that's the challenge.
Bob Schieffer,"In so many of the other beats these days, there are these layers of public relations people that you have to go through to get to the newsmakers themselves."
Bob Schieffer,"I've basically thought of myself as a writer, whether I was or not."
Bob Schieffer,"I'd covered the campaign in 1988, and I'd managed to gain an even 20 pounds, which is one of the dangers you have covering those campaigns."
Bob Schieffer,"I want to try to talk like normal people talk, not just stand there and bark at the camera."
Bob Schieffer,I used to be a print reporter.
Bob Schieffer,"I think journalism is a great way to do public service, to have an impact on your community."
Bob Schieffer,"I sometimes tell people, when I was hired at CBS, it was because I was a good writer, not whether I was or not was beside the point."
Bob Schieffer,"I had an idea in the beginning to do a book about some of the events that I had covered, just various stories that I've covered. Reporters spend a lot of time telling each other tales about how they covered stories, and that's what this book started out to be."
Bob Schieffer,"I had - all my life, everybody who knew me thought that I would probably grow up to be a reporter, a newspaper reporter because we didn't have much television in those days."
Bob Schieffer,I can't think of any other job in journalism where the newsmakers come to you.
Bob Schieffer,I always thought writing was the foundation and the basis for journalism in the same way being able to draw is the foundation for art.
Bob Schieffer,"I also think it's not just good for the American people to have independent observers along, I think it's also good for the military."
Bob Schieffer,"For sure, the American people have access to more information now than any other people who have ever lived on earth. And I think we do a pretty good job of sorting out what's important."
Bob Schieffer,"But with 9/11, we found that people tended to come back to the networks and the people who had been our core viewers in the past came back and they have stayed with us."
Bob Schieffer,"But the reporter has the responsibility to determine, number one, whether that is true, and number two, to make a judgment as to whether it's in the public interest and whether or not it should be part of the debate."
Bob Schieffer,"But if you're going to go out on a military unit, you've got to allow yourself to be under the control of the commander because you really could put the troops in danger."
Bob Schieffer,"But if you don't enjoy doing something, you'll be miserable no matter how much money you make."
Bob Schieffer,"At the White House, everybody works for the same person. They're all part of the same company. But on Capitol Hill, they're all independent contractors. They all work for themselves. That's a formula for getting news."
Bob Schieffer,"And I came away from that experience, and it was a very difficult experience - I came to understand that you have to practice at being a good father and practice at being a good husband, just as you have to practice at being a good journalist."
Bob Schieffer,"And as a result, I guess I'm just kind of a rubberneck. I'm kind of a - someone who likes to see things and likes to see these events and talk to the people who make them happen. But I don't think journalists are as important as the people they cover."
Bob Schieffer,My job is to give everyone a chance to catch their breath and step back from all this and get back to work.
Bob Schieffer,"And after about two years, I realized that creative writing was not going to help you ace those biological tests. So I switched over to journalism. I didn't graduate with honors, but I did graduate on time and with some doing."
Phil Schiller,We use every fraction of a millimeter of space to get things in there. It's like a puzzle to fit all that stuff together. It has the tightest tolerances of anything we've ever made in the history of this company.
Phil Schiller,"This is a real but minor issue involving a vendor quality problem in a small number of units. In fact, this issue has affected less than 1/10 of 1 per cent of the total iPod nano units that we've shipped. It is not a design issue."
Phil Schiller,"We think about making it so easy that a second-grader can use it, mom and dad at home can use it. The fun is in making your own movie, putting together your own content. It's such an emotional experience to see your kids and yourself and your friends in your own movie."
Phil Schiller,"It is not a design issue,"
Phil Schiller,"We always like to have more customers and we haven't stopped working hard to gain more. We are very proud that, over the last three quarters, our business has been growing twice as fast as the rest of the industry."
Bobby Schindler,"That is so offensive. If people knew how much Terri loved my father ? all of us. If they knew how much she loved him ... That is a totally ridiculous and, as I said, offensive statement to think that my dad would ever, ever belittle Terri."
Bobby Schindler,We believe he knows what happened to her that night.
Bobby Schindler,I think you're seeing the growing support of the pro-life movement.
Bobby Schindler,It's definitely the same battle. Everybody has a right to life.
Bobby Schindler,Our family will never believe Terri wanted to die this way.
Bobby Schindler,It doesn't matter what Michael says about our family.
Bobby Schindler,"The success or failure of the euthanasia movement is based on the classification of feeding tubes as a medical treatment,"
Margo Schlanger,Women justices have had a major impact on some things that you don't usually associate with the Supreme Court.
Margo Schlanger,"It's not clear to me that the big loss to women is the loss of a woman justice, it's the loss of a moderate voice to resist the authority."
Margo Schlanger,"If the alternative to a temporary race segregation is a riot, where people get hurt, then yeah, you can do that."
Margo Schlanger,"It was supposed to be a very friendly, very self-esteem building environment for women. Compared to VMI, which is not at all friendly, it is basically a series of hazing, and it is all about challenge, all about challenge all the time."
Anthony Schlegel,It's not necessarily revenge. But it's in the back of your mind.
Anthony Schlegel,"The thing with Texas is they have so many weapons, but I really think the speed of our defense will help us."
Anthony Schlegel,"I don't care. We're a team. We went 10-2, were No. 4 in the country. They're my best friends, and we played well together. I couldn't ask for a better college experience. It's an honor to play at Ohio State."
Friedrich Schlegel,"Prudishness is pretense of innocence without innocence. Women have to remain prudish as long as men are sentimental, dense, and evil enough to demand of them eternal innocence and lack of education. For innocence is the only thing which can ennoble lack of education."
Friedrich Schlegel,"Genius is, to be sure, not a matter of arbitrariness, but rather of freedom, just as wit, love, and faith, which once shall become arts and disciplines. We should demand genius from everybody, without, however, expecting it."
Friedrich Schlegel,"The most insignificant authors have at least this similarity to the Author of the Heavens and the Earth: that after a days work is done, they have a habit of saying to themselves, And behold, what he made was good."
Friedrich Schlegel,It is peculiar to mankind to transcend mankind.
Friedrich Schlegel,Virtue is reason which has become energy.
Friedrich Schlegel,"A critic is a reader who ruminates. Thus, he should have more than one stomach."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Women do not have as great a need for poetry because their own essence is poetry.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Women are treated as unjustly in poetry as in life. The feminine ones are not idealistic, and the idealistic not feminine."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Witty inspirations are the proverbs of the educated.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Wit is the appearance, the external flash of imagination. Thus its divinity, and the witty character of mysticism."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Wit is an explosion of the compound spirit.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Whoever does not philosophize for the sake of philosophy, but rather uses philosophy as a means, is a sophist."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"When reason and unreason come into contact, an electrical shock occurs. This is called polemics."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"What men are among the other formations of the earth, artists are among men."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Versatility of education can be found in our best poetry, but the depth of mankind should be found in the philosopher."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Think of something finite molded into the infinite, and you think of man."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"There is no self-knowledge but an historical one. No one knows what he himself is who does not know his fellow men, especially the most prominent one of the community, the master's master, the genius of the age."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,There are writers in Germany who drink the Absolute like water; and there are books in which even the dogs make references to the Infinite.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"The surest method of being incomprehensible or, moreover, to be misunderstood is to use words in their original sense; especially words from the ancient languages."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,The subject of history is the gradual realization of all that is practically necessary.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"The poetry of this one is called philosophical, of that one philological, of a third rhetorical, and so on. Which is then the poetic poetry?"
Friedrich Von Schlegel,The main thing is to know something and to say it.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,The historian is a prophet looking backward.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"The German national character is a favorite subject of character experts, probably because the less mature a nation, the more she is an object of criticism and not of history."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Strictly speaking, the idea of a scientific poem is probably as nonsensical as that of a poetic science."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Since philosophy now criticizes everything it comes across, a critique of philosophy would be nothing less than a just reprisal."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Reason is mechanical, wit chemical, and genius organic spirit."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Publication is to thinking as childbirth is to the first kiss.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,One has only as much morality as one has philosophy and poetry.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"One can only become a philosopher, but not be one. As one believes he is a philosopher, he stops being one."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Novels tend to end as the Paternoster begins: with the kingdom of God on earth.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Novels are the Socratic dialogues of our time. Practical wisdom fled from school wisdom into this liberal form.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Nothing truly convincing - which would possess thoroughness, vigor, and skill - has been written against the ancients as yet; especially not against their poetry."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Nothing is more witty and grotesque than ancient mythology and Christianity; that is because they are so mystical.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"No idea is isolated, but is only what it is among all ideas."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Mysteries are feminine; they like to veil themselves but still want to be seen and divined.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Morality without a sense of paradox is mean.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Many works of the ancients have become fragments. Many works of the moderns are fragments at the time of their origin.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Many a witty inspiration is like the surprising reunion of befriended thoughts after a long separation.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Man is free whenever he produces or manifests God, and through this he becomes immortal."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Man is a creative retrospection of nature upon itself.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Like Leibniz's possible worlds, most men are only equally entitled pretenders to existence. There are few existences."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Irony is a clear consciousness of an eternal agility, of the infinitely abundant chaos."

Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Ideas are infinite, original, and lively divine thoughts."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,How many authors are there among writers? Author means originator.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,He who does not become familiar with nature through love will never know her.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"God is each truly and exalted thing, therefore the individual himself to the highest degree. But are not nature and the world individuals?"
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"From what the moderns want, we must learn what poetry should become; from what the ancients did, what poetry must be."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Every uneducated person is a caricature of himself.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Every good man progressively becomes God. To become God, to be man, and to educate oneself, are expressions that are synonymous."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Every complete man has his genius. True virtue is genius.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Eternal life and the invisible world are only to be sought in God. Only within Him do all spirits dwell. He is an abyss of individuality, the only infinite plenitude."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Duty is for Kant the One and All. Out of the duty of gratitude, he claims, one has to defend and esteem the ancients; and only out of duty has he become a great man."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Considered subjectively, philosophy always begins in the middle, like an epic poem."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Combine the extremes, and you will have the true center."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Beauty is that which is simultaneously attractive and sublime.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"As the ancient commander addressed his soldiers before battle, so should the moralist speak to men in the struggle of the era."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Art and works of art do not make an artist; sense and enthusiasm and instinct do.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Aphorisms are the true form of the universal philosophy.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,All the classical genres are now ridiculous in their rigorous purity.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"All men are somewhat ridiculous and grotesque, just because they are men; and in this respect artists might well be regarded as man multiplied by two. So it is, was, and shall be."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,About no subject is there less philosophizing than about philosophy.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,A so-called happy marriage corresponds to love as a correct poem to an improvised song.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,A family can develop only with a loving woman as its center.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,A classical work doesn't ever have to be understood entirely. But those who are educated and who are still educating themselves must desire to learn more and more from it.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,What is lost in the good or excellent translation is precisely the best.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,It is as deadly for a mind to have a system as to have none. Therefore it will have to decide to combine both.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Kant introduced the concept of the negative into philosophy. Would it not also be worthwhile to try to introduce the concept of the positive into philosophy?
Friedrich Von Schlegel,An artist is he for whom the goal and center of life is to form his mind.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,"Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine."
Friedrich Von Schlegel,Irony is the form of paradox. Paradox is what is good and great at the same time.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,What is called good society is usually nothing but a mosaic of polished caricatures.
Friedrich Von Schlegel,A definition of poetry can only determine what poetry should be and not what poetry actually was and is; otherwise the most concise formula would be: Poetry is that which at some time and some place was thus named.
Mark Schlereth,"The talent is so close in the NFL that you're standing on the razor's edge of being an elite team and being a mediocre team, ... The Colts are one injury to Peyton Manning from being a .500 football team. Every team in the NFL is like that."
Mark Schlereth,Get over it. It's football season. Read about it in the newspapers.
Mark Schlereth,"The Colts don't owe anyone [a thing]. They have one debt on their ledger and that's an IOU they wrote to themselves in training camp and that's to win a world championship, not to have an undefeated season."
Mark Schlereth,"It takes a toll on your body, there's no question. It's like getting in a car wreck every day."
Arthur Schlesinger,"Science and technology revolutionize our lives, but memory, tradition and myth frame our response."
Arthur Schlesinger,"If we are to survive, we must have ideas, vision, and courage. These things are rarely produced by committees. Everything that matters in our intellectual and moral life begins with an individual confronting his own mind and conscience in a room by himself."
Arthur Schlesinger,"When lies must be told, they should be told by subordinate officials. At no point should the president be asked to lend himself to the cover operation. There seems to me merit in Secretary Rusk's suggestion that someone other than the president make the final decision and do so in his absence -- someone whose head can later be placed on the block if things go terribly wrong."
James Schlesinger,"Science is not a matter of consensus, as the histories of Galileo, Copernicus, Pasteur, Einstein and others will attest. Science depends not on speculation but on conclusions verified through experiment."
James Schlesinger,We believe that there is institutional and personal responsibility right up the chain of command as far as Washington is concerned.

Laura Schlessinger,Children are our second chance to have a great parent-child relationship.
Laura Schlessinger,"Values are principles and ideas that bring meaning to the seemingly mundane experience of life. A meaningful life that ultimately brings happiness and pride requires you to respond to temptations as well as challenges with honor, dignity, and courage."
Laura Schlessinger,"This is all you have. This is not a dry run. This is your life. If you want to fritter it away with your fears, then you will fritter it away, but you won't get it back later."
Laura Schlessinger,"When you're the victim of the behavior, it's black and white; when you're the perpetrator, there are a million shades of gray."
Matt Schmelzer,Conventional wisdom says you stall when you're the underdog. But it worked well for them.
Matt Schmelzer,"She's a fine young lady, a quality player and a quality person. She's going to be missed."
Matt Schmelzer,"At the time, I thought it was good for us. I thought it was giving us a rest. We didn't play very many kids. I thought it was to our advantage to have the stall game. ... I liked our chances at that point."
Mary Schmich,"The cell phone has transformed public places into giant phone-a-thons in which callers exist within narcissistic cocoons of private conversations. Like faxes, computer modems and other modern gadgets that have clogged out lives with phony urgency, cell phones represent the 20th Century's escalation of imaginary need. We didn't need cell phones until we had them. Clearly, cell phones cause not only a breakdown of courtesy, but the atrophy of basic skills."
Mary Schmich,The soul-sucking activity of TV-watching feels better when it is done with other souls.
Mary Schmich,"If this escapade has taught me anything, it's that you never know what's in the future,"

Mary Schmich,"Linda Tripp has shown that a true friend is an archivist, a biographer."
Mary Schmich,Barbie is just a doll.
Mary Schmich,Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you'll have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either of them might run out.
Mary Schmich,In twenty years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.
Mary Schmich,Reading is a discount ticket to everywhere.
Mary Schmich,"TV happens. And once it's happened, it's gone. When it's gone, you move on, no tears, no tantrums, no videotape."
Mary Schmich,You can figure out who you were by which movies you loved when.
Mary Schmich,"Every day each of us wakes up, reaches into drawers and closets, pulls out a costume for the day and proceeds to dress in a style that can only be called preposterous."
Mary Schmich,Good art is art that allows you to enter it from a variety of angles and to emerge with a variety of views.

Mary Schmich,"You can map your life through your favorite movies, and no two people's maps will be the same."
Mary Schmich,The movies we love and admire are to some extent a function of who we are when we see them.
Mary Schmich,"Like many women my age, I am 28 years old."
Sigi Schmid,"The No. 1 objective this week was not to give up goals. Offensively we need to get better, but I'm happy we held it together defensively and that we got a point. You've got to start one at a time."
Sigi Schmid,The number one objective for us was not to give up goals. We were doing that in the first two weeks. I thought defensively we did pretty well although we broke down on the one goal.
Sigi Schmid,I didn't think we were two goals worse. I thought the first 15 minutes of the second half we owned and then we give up the third goal and that takes the wind out of the sails so to speak. The adjustments were just guys needing to work a little harder.
Sigi Schmid,"I thought it (play against the Fire) was okay, especially considering he had been gone for a period of time and the one thing he didn't have was contact with the ball. I expect a lot more from him next week in L.A."
Sigi Schmid,"He should be getting some minutes for us this year. That's our expectation. That's why we drafted him. If we didn't expect him to play, we wouldn't have taken him."
Sigi Schmid,We played with a lot of grit and determination. And we played smarter than we have before.
Sigi Schmid,He's bigger than people realize and a little bit faster than people realize as well. His desire is good and his work rate is good. He is still in a phase where he's learning.
Sigi Schmid,"He is the type of player that has a tremendous desire to win. He needs to be an example to our younger players. He needs to be a vocal player, but he can't do any of that until he gets on the field, so first he needs to get healthy."
Sigi Schmid,Sebastian is a very attractive player. He has a huge pedigree in soccer and he has a strong desire to play in the States. He has the potential to be an impact player in this league.
Sigi Schmid,We need to improve on our concentration. We made a stride forward in the second half and proved that we can play good soccer. We should have been leading at halftime. We have to become mentally stronger.
Sigi Schmid,I think we've created a much more competitive environment. There is competition in all of the facets of the field.
Sigi Schmid,"I thought we came of age a little bit. This was what we have to do to build this team?s character. You have to have success in games like that, where you roll your sleeves up, where you battle till the end."
Joe Schmidt,"I'm like everyone else. You get frustrated. But, down deep, we all hope things turn around."
Joe Schmidt,"That's scary, especially here, because this is such a family-oriented neighborhood."
Joe Schmidt,The single-family neighborhoods aren't functioning like they're single-family.
Joe Schmidt,I'm just riding the wave until it hits the shore.
John Schmidt,The county board and the finance committee realized this was an important issue. Adding an assistant just made it happen.
John Schmidt,But we found out there was no room at the inn outside the campus community either. Apartment complexes and rental homes filled up pretty quickly.
John Schmidt,To suggest that the president should be censured because you don't agree with the legal advice he got seems to me to just -- to be out of the ballpark in terms of the way we can sensibly discuss and talk about issues like this.
Steve Schmidt,There must be some truth to that.
Steve Schmidt,"Kerry didn't show up at the Speed Queen or Leon's, but he had no trouble eating a filet mignon and asparagus at a lakefront restaurant instead, ... It will be interesting to see whether Kerry's cuisine matches his rhetoric in Kansas City tomorrow."
Steve Schmidt,"Kerry's travel schedule and ad buys do not match his campaign's spin about the status of the election. From the rust belt to the upper Midwest, [today's] campaign events are evidence that President Bush has the energy and momentum in the final six days."
Steve Schmidt,"While Kerry merely talks about investing in technology, the President's investments have preserved America's status as the world's leader in research and development."
Steve Schmidt,The president has been consistent in his support for our armed forces.
Steve Schmidt,"If it was CWD, it would be unprecedented to find that many showing obvious symptoms in a short space of time."
Steve Schmidt,"John Kerry's campaign attacks on gas prices ignore the reality of Kerry's long record of supporting higher gas prices and blocking the president's comprehensive energy plan,"
Steve Schmidt,John Kerry's campaign attacks on gas prices ignore the reality of Kerry's long record of supporting higher gas prices and blocking the president's comprehensive energy plan.
Steve Schmidt,It's important to look at how nominations have been handled in the past. [Justice] Ruth Bader Ginsburg took 45 days. There's no reason why this process can't be completed by the end of the year.
Steve Schmidt,Those documents will remain at the Department of Justice because they are privileged.
Steve Schmidt,good sense of humor.
Steve Schmidt,"Kerry's sham economic indicator says that our economy was better under Jimmy Carter than under Ronald Reagan, a deception few Ohioans are likely to believe,"
Steve Schmidt,"Kerry's sham economic indicator says that our economy was better under Jimmy Carter than under Ronald Reagan, a deception few Ohioans are likely to believe."
Steve Schmidt,I don't have bitter feelings about South America. I don't feel like they're trying to put us out of business. We're just trying to participate in a global economy.
Steve Schmidt,The grant is basically to increase their ability to increase patrols for alcohol-related offenses.
Jim Schmitz,He came to our camp. He's good. We were hoping he was someone from a small school and no one would find out about him but obviously that wasn't the case.
Jim Schmitz,"Up 2-0 in the seventh, we have to have people in the pen wanting to be there. Our relief pitchers haven't gotten the job done. We have to find someone with that personality."
Jim Schmitz,"Obviously, Brandon pitched a phenomenal game. We obviously made some big mistakes in the eighth inning. But the big question is the bats. This is not Oklahoma and Mississippi State. I'm very disappointed with the offense. (Ryan) Campbell is the only one swinging the bat well."
Jim Schmitz,It was a major failure on everybody's part.
Jim Schmitz,We have to do a little better about putting teams away. I have to create more action to take pressure off our guys.
Rob Schneider,I kind of realized early on I was playing him. That was a big responsibility for me.

Rob Schneider,"Studio people are idiots. Until they see someone else doing it and make a success of it, they don't open their minds. Most of them are idiots."
Rob Schneider,I try not to have too much of an ego. I'll do anything.
Rob Schneider,"A woman can laugh and cry in three seconds and it's not weird. But if a man does it, it's very disturbing. The way I'd describe it is like this: I have been allowed inside the house of womanhood, but I feel that they wouldn't let me in any of the interesting rooms."
Rob Schneider,"I lost that excitement I had when I first started out. It was all about the need to just get a job, and so I found the joy again when I was writing Deuce Bigelow. I was laughing so hard and along with my writing partner at the time, simply laughing until we cried."
Rob Schneider,I like to sneak in under the radar. I don't have any paparazzi following me or have to deal with that stuff. I'm never in the tabloids. I prefer that.
Rob Schneider,"Women always feel like they're being stared at and judged, and rightfully so."
Howard Schnellenberger,"I don't think he's come into a game where I haven't been happy with his performance,"
Howard Schnellenberger,"I guess you could say that I've just taken a few bad jobs,"
Howard Schnellenberger,"My emotions are going to be controlled by the game, ... I don't think I'm going to be nostalgic."
Howard Schnellenberger,We haven't had the offensive production we have needed. We are looking for some consistency and being able to run the ball since we haven't had a lot of that.
Ken Scholen,If you owe money on the house you can use part of your reverse mortgage to pay off your current debt.
Ken Scholen,"The older you are, the more money you can get because life expectancy is shorter."

Ken Scholen,"If you're only going to be in your home a couple of years, the cost of this loan is very, very high."
Peter Schoomaker,"We are now into '07-'09 in our planning,"
Peter Schoomaker,"The enemy aggressively 'reads' our open source and continues to exploit such information for use against our forces, ... Some soldiers continue to post sensitive information to Internet websites and blogs, e.g., photos depicting weapon system vulnerabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures. Such OPSEC [operational security] violations needlessly place lives at risk and degrade the effectiveness of our operations."
Peter Schoomaker,"Much of what we've gained out of Comanche we can push forward into the tech base for future joint rotor-craft kinds of capabilities, as we look further out,"

Arthur Schopenhauer,With people of limited ability modesty is merely honesty. But with those who possess great talent it is hypocrisy.
Arthur Schopenhauer,"For an author to write as he speaks is just as reprehensible as the opposite fault, to speak as he writes; for this gives a pedantic effect to what he says, and at the same time makes him hardly intelligible."
Arthur Schopenhauer,"Opinion is like a pendulum and obeys the same law. If it goes past the centre of gravity on one side, it must go a like distance on the other; and it is only after a certain time that it finds the true point at which it can remain at rest."
Arthur Schopenhauer,"There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be enjoyed, but to be overcome; to be got over."
Arthur Schopenhauer,"As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself."
Arthur Schopenhauer,"Every nation ridicules other nations, and all are right."
Arthur Schopenhauer,Reading is equivalent to thinking with someone else's head instead of with one's own.

Arthur Schopenhauer,"Newspapers are the second hand of history. This hand, however, is usually not only of inferior metal to the other hands, it also seldom works properly."

Arthur Schopenhauer,"In action a great heart is the chief qualification. In work, a great head."

Arthur Schopenhauer,The word of man is the most durable of all material.

Arthur Schopenhauer,Great minds are related to the brief span of time during which they live as great buildings are to a little square in which they stand: you cannot see them in all their magnitude because you are standing too close to them.
Arthur Schopenhauer,"Because people have no thoughts to deal in, they deal cards, and try and win one another's money. Idiots!"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"Patriotism, when it wants to make itself felt in the domain of learning, is a dirty fellow who should be thrown out of doors."

Arthur Schopenhauer,"The longer a man's fame is likely to last, the longer it will be in coming."
Arthur Schopenhauer,"That the outer man is a picture of the inner, and the face an expression and revelation of the whole character, is a presumption likely enough in itself, and therefore a safe one to go on; borne out as it is by the fact that people are always anxious to see anyone who has made himself famous. Photography offers the most complete satisfaction of our curiosity."
Arthur Schopenhauer,"The more unintelligent a man is, the less mysterious existence seems to him"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be enjoyed, but to be overcome /to be got over."
Arthur Schopenhauer,The difficulty is to try and teach the multitude that something can be true and untrue at the same time.
Arthur Schopenhauer,"How very paltry and limited the normal human intellect is, and how little lucidity there is in the human consciousness, may be judged from the fact that, despite the ephemeral brevity of human life, the uncertainty of our existence and the countless enigmas which press upon us from all sides, everyone does not continually and ceaselessly philosophize, but that only the rarest of exceptions do."

Marty Schottenheimer,"He's a terrific guy. He worked as hard as anybody. But the approach, the philosophy, were different."
Marty Schottenheimer,"To be able to do what they have done in an era in which everything is designed to get people to be .500 win-loss percentage, and they go out and win three championships in four years, to me that's remarkable."
Marty Schottenheimer,"You're damned if you do, damned if you don't. You need to make sure that each player gets an opportunity to prepare himself for the game tempo, albeit (in) preseason. So you end up making arbitrary, unilateral decisions."
Marty Schottenheimer,You could have made a lot of money betting that. I couldn't believe it.
Marty Schottenheimer,"I know the young man, and he's tough kid, a tough-minded person. So, you know, I'm sure the ultimate decision will be if he can make it significantly worse. I don't have any question he'll make every attempt to play, because he is a tough kid."
Marty Schottenheimer,"In the 3-4, it always starts with the nose man. They don't single block Jamal Williams ."
Marty Schottenheimer,"I think so, because of the language that had to be learned and understood. The last thing you get is the technique because the language you can put together. But to be able to put the fundamentals together at the speed necessary to be successful takes some time. You can't have a lot of thought going through your mind."
Marty Schottenheimer,I don't think our rush got there the way we needed to. We need to do a better job.
Marty Schottenheimer,"He is a very special player and a very special person. He has as big a heart as anyone around. With guys like that, you really don't need much coaching."
Marty Schottenheimer,He's got great stop-and-start quickness. As a runner he's hard to find. I'm not going to put him in his category but skill-wise he's like Barry Sanders. His stop-and-start quickness reminds me of that.
Marty Schottenheimer,Our offensive line is not giving him a lot of space.
Marty Schottenheimer,We cannot be complacent with playing good but not winning games.
Marty Schottenheimer,"I think it's needed. The game is about the team, not the individual."

Marty Schottenheimer,"Obviously, were all disappointed at the events of the last couple of days. I for one am particularly disappointed."
Marty Schottenheimer,"It's not physical issues, it's discipline issues in our coverage, and it's not where it needs to be, quite frankly. We're not getting people where they need to be on a consistent basis. My sense is that we've got to do a better job of coaching them, and they've got do a better job of understanding exactly what it is we're putting forward."
Marty Schottenheimer,"When I was playing, it was 10 or 12 plays that determined the outcome of a game. Now, because of the balance of talent in the league, it's come down to three or four plays a game. All you're looking for is to be in a position where you have a chance to win at the end. We haven't been able to do that, in a number of cases but we just keep chipping at it, trying to find a way to turn that corner."
Marty Schottenheimer,He brings everything you need to a 3-4 defense. He is selfless the way he goes about his job.
Marty Schottenheimer,We've got to get the coverage to a point where there's more consistency in it.
Marty Schottenheimer,"Everyone talks about the confidence Tom Brady has in what he does and I don't doubt that. But let's not overlook the confidence that he brings to every other guy on that football team on offense or defense or the kicking game - 'let's get the ball back; let's get field position because Tom can do it.' He is certainly not a one-man gang there, but to me, the one thing a quarterback can bring is hope and certainly he not only brings you hope, but in most cases if you give him an opportunity, he will get it done."
Marty Schottenheimer,"I have a lot of confidence in Nate, and I felt it was important to get it to a seven-point differential."
Marty Schottenheimer,We can legislate against that as long as it's officiated with common sense.
Marty Schottenheimer,"That's one of the reasons why he's a successful coach. You know that image he creates, with the jutting jaw? That's how he approached every task he's ever had. He started early on to find an edge because he needed it."
Marty Schottenheimer,"I believe with a certainty, in my opinion, he is the finest running back I have ever seen in professional football. And I know people say: 'Well what about Jim Brown? And what about Gale Sayers?' That's all well and good, but I tell you what, in the era that we're in now where you have defensive linemen that weigh 300 pounds and run 4.75, and these mammoth guys that are playing linebacker, I think with a certainty, in my opinion, he is the finest running back that I have ever seen."
Marty Schottenheimer,"I believe with a certainty, in my opinion, he is the finest running back I have ever seen in professional football."
Marty Schottenheimer,There is no evidence in their recent history that would indicate that injuries have in any way compromised their ability to perform in a winning way.
Ken Schrader,"I'd trade them all for one Cup win. . . . Nah, I wouldn't."
Ken Schrader,"We do have a responsibility,"
Ken Schrader,"After I'm out of [Cup], I'll probably race more because I'll have more weekends, ... I mean, instead of running one race on a weekend, I can be somewhere else running three."
Ken Schrader,I have a strong tie to tracks like this. These are the places where you grew up as a race car driver. It's like home. Our homes are all of these different race tracks scattered throughout the country. And some of them you just take a liking to - like this one.
Ken Schrader,"Believe me, (Roush's drivers) are going to race each other as hard as they race anybody else."
Ken Schrader,That's what I do. I like to race.
Ken Schrader,"You got a whole lot of obstacles in front of you, as far as being a top-10 car week in and week out, but it's not like you've got a mountain in front of you that you can't climb,"
Ken Schrader,It's a short little race that pays a lot of money.
Ken Schrader,"My life changed over seven years; his life has changed over two. He's getting pulled at from every direction, but I think he's handling it good. I don't see where it's changed him at all. Maybe it's confused him because he gets hit with (stuff) he don't want to worry about. He wants to do all the same stuff he always wanted to do. He just loves to race."
Ken Schrader,"I can't blame the drivers for making the move, and I can't blame the owners for being upset. Keep in mind, this ain't like the real world where you work somewhere and you can stay 40 years. Being able to see where you are going just a few years ahead is a pretty cool deal, and it doesn't happen too often in any sport, much less stock car racing."
Ken Schrader,"I can't blame the drivers for making the move, and I can't blame the owners for being upset,"
Aaron Schrein,We're hoping that we get our confidence back.
Aaron Schrein,"The competition wasn't all that tough. We just didn't wrestle very well, and that's very disappointing."
Aaron Schrein,"He's going to have a tough road. It's a very tough weight class, but I'm really pleased that he will be there."
Olive Schreiner,Power! Did you ever hear of men being asked whether other souls should have power or not? It is born in them.
Olive Schreiner,"From our earliest hour we have been taught that the thought of the heart, the shaping of the rain-cloud, the amount of wool that grows on a sheep's back, the length of a drought, and the growing of the corn, depend on nothing that moves immutable, at the heart of all things; but on the changeable will of a changeable being, whom our prayers can alter. To us, from the beginning, Nature has been but a poor plastic thing, to be toyed with this way or that, as man happens to please his deity or not; to go to church or not; to say his prayers right or not; to travel on a Sunday or not. Was it possible for us in an instant to see Nature as she is --the flowing vestment of an unchanging reality?"
Olive Schreiner,"We all enter the world little plastic beings, with so much natural force, perhaps, but for the rest -- blank; and the world tells us what we are to be, and shapes us by the ends it sets before us. To you it says -- Work; and to us it says -- Seem! To you it says -- As you approximate to man's highest ideal of God, as your arm is strong and your knowledge great, and the power to labor is with you, so you shall gain all that human heart desires. To us it says -- Strength shall not help you, nor knowledge, nor labor. You shall gain what men gain, but by other means. And so the world makes men and women."
Olive Schreiner,"A little weeping, a little wheedling, a little self-degradation, a little careful use of our advantages, and then some man will say ''.Come, be my wife!'' With good looks and youth marriage is easy to attain. There are men enough; but a woman who has sold herself, even for a ring and a new name, need hold her skirt aside for no creature in the street. They both earn their bread in one way. Marriage for love is the most beautiful external symbol of the union of souls; marriage without it is the least clean traffic that defiles the world."
Olive Schreiner,"Perhaps the old monks were right when they tried to root love out; perhaps the poets are right when they try to water it. It is a blood-red flower, with the color of sin; but there is always the scent of a god about it."
Olive Schreiner,No good work is ever done while the heart is hot and anxious and fretted
Olive Schreiner,How hard it is to make your thoughts look anything but imbecile fools when you paint them with ink on paper.
Olive Schreiner,"I have no conscience, none, but I would not like to bring a soul into this world. When it sinned and when it suffered something like a dead hand would fall on me, -- ''You did it, you, for your own pleasure you created this thing! See your work!'' If it lived to be eighty it would always hang like a millstone round my neck, have the right to demand good from me, and curse me for its sorrow. A parent is only like to God: if his work turns out bad so much the worse for him; he dare not wash his hands of it. Time and years can never bring the day when you can say to your child, ''Soul, what have I to do with you?''"
Olive Schreiner,"My feeling is that there is nothing in life but refraining from hurting others, and comforting those that are sad."
Gerhard Schroeder,"He did certain things in his youth that were not OK and which he has explained,"

Gerhard Schroeder,"With grief and outrage, I have heard of the terrible attacks in Madrid this morning. I am horrified at the high number of deaths and injured.

Gerhard Schroeder,that by overcoming dictatorship that the Iraqi people will have hope to live in peace and freedom and direct their own affairs as soon as possible.
Gerhard Schroeder,"Any speculation about failure would be counterproductive,"
Gerhard Schroeder,"I want to keep the debate factual and I don't want to take part in polemic disputes,"
Gerhard Schroeder,"[On Sept. 12, Germanyâ€™s party leaders met in the final pre-election debate in the format of a round-table discussion. Merkel attacked the current chancellorâ€™s economic record, declaring,] You have failed in this question. Thatâ€™s why you are in such a difficult position. ... as a medium-sized power which always tries to solve conflicts peacefully."
Gerhard Schroeder,"I see a military option a high-grade danger, ... Therefore I can certainly rule out that a German government under my leadership would take part in one."

Gerhard Schroeder,"I regard myself as confirmed in office by our country and intend that there will be stable government under my leadership,"
Gerhard Schroeder,"These challenges can only be mastered together. With great expectation, I see our continued cooperation on the basis of the close friendship between Germany and the United States."
Gerhard Schroeder,"I am very sorry about this, ... But it can not be allowed to have any consequences, any negative consequences on the building of a stable government."
Gerhard Schroeder,"It was a task that did not have anything to do with military conflict, ... There is no reason to question the mission."
Gerhard Schroeder,"His commitment to overcoming the East-West conflict and his vision of a free and united Europe helped pave the way for those developments that ultimately enabled Germany also to regain its unity,"
Gerhard Schroeder,"He has a biography that makes clear that he grew away from the (leftist) scene, and he's done great work for our country."
Gerhard Schroeder,The euro will raise the citizens' awareness of their belonging to one Europe more than any other integration step to date.
Gerhard Schroeder,This is one of the gravest crises Europe has ever experienced... An agreement failed because of the completely stubborn attitudes of the UK and the Netherlands.
Gerhard Schroeder,"[The agreement] has created a fully new quality of economic cooperation, ... This cooperation is not directed against anyone, but is for German and Russian interests."
Gerhard Schroeder,"That will be the subject of our talks today, and I think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time."
Gerhard Schroeder,"We condemn what happened today concerning the aggression against a brotherly state under the pretext that some organizations exist there,"
Gerhard Schroeder,"The problem is so complicated that no-one can give really good advice,"

John Schuerholz,"If you assume the worst, you have to also assume with modern medical technology he'll be fixed and may very well be ready for the next several years."
John Schuerholz,"Built to Win. After a lot of soul-searching, Tommy decided he was going to stay. Quite obviously, he was relieved. His wife was relieved. And I was bouncing their son on my knee."
John Schuerholz,He is an all-American-type kid. He's well-spoken. He's mature beyond his years. He has a winner's quality deeper and broader than any young man I've ever seen.
John Schuerholz,"I can't say we have more passion than anyone else, ... I can't say we have more intuititiveness. I can't say we have more creativity or more imagination, or we work harder. Our own internal expectation is to do those things better than everybody else we're competing against. I'm sure everybody else says the same thing, but our guys have found a way to do it."
John Schuerholz,"This particular camp is probably more beneficial than most because Roger has had the opportunity to acclimate himself to the deliveries of each of these pitchers, to put a face to an arm. He's been watching DVDs and looking at statistics. Now he can humanize these guys. So it's probably been more beneficial than any camp we've had in 16 years, from that standpoint."
John Schuerholz,"With the core group of leaders we have on this team, it has an uplifting effect on all of the rest of the roster. The environment, which they and Bobby and the coaches create, also has an uplifting impact. People rise with the tide of professional expectations. It's happened here for 15 straight years."
John Schuerholz,I hope he gets in there. I think he is a very deserving candidate and wonderful human being. He'd be a very wonderful recipient.
John Schuerholz,"This is the gold standard,"
John Schuerholz,"We almost thought there was no need to interview anyone else. When you have a Hall of Fame manager say, 'I really like this guy,' you listen."
John Schuerholz,He gets those guys to subjugate their individual egos and blend them into one team ego. It's an ego of one.
John Schuerholz,"Our doctors say this is an injury that will heal itself. It just takes time. It may not take quite as much time as 15 days, but we want to make absolutely certain that he's completely healthy before he returns, so we're putting him on the disabled list."
John Schuerholz,"His defense was consistent and eye-opening at times, and that got him in the lineup. And the more he played, the more he hit. He was really a big part of our improvement and our success last season."
John Schuerholz,"What they hear from him is constant support, constant affirmation, constant compliments, because that's his style. He's a positive guy. Even in the midst of difficulties, he's a positive guy."
John Schuerholz,"He really answered the call. The job was up for grabs, with a lot of competition, and he just rose up and took it."
John Schuerholz,"The best third-base prospect in baseball. He has awesome potential, excellent power and a good glove."
John Schuerholz,He's dominated in virtually every appearance. He was the best [available] bullpen guy in the industry.
John Schuerholz,"He's hardheaded, competitive. I've always had great admiration for him."

Robert H. Schuller,"Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines."

Robert H. Schuller,"If you listen to your fears, you will die never knowing what a great person you might have been."
John Schultz,"Dan Nichols loved his job. He did a difficult job well. As we've heard, Dan was especially good with kids on medical jobs, consoling them and reassuring them on the way to the hospital."
John Schultz,Firefighter Nichols' temporal assignment is completed. He has departed the fire ground and is now safely back in eternal quarters.
John Schultz,I was dropping off my daughter and I saw the smoke and called the fire department.

John Schultz,"Enthusiasm for his life, enthusiasm for his job, enthusiasm to get to his family for Christmas."
John Schultz,You can't throw balls away against a team that good and expect to win. It's tough to do.
Peter Schultz,"Three people were at work on a construction site. All were doing the same job, but when each was asked what the job was, the answers varied. ''Breaking rocks,'' the first replied. ''Earning my living,'' the second said. ''Helping to build a cathedral,'' said the third."
Peter Schultz,"The most significant finding is the nature of the surface of the comet. We now know that it isn't covered in a hard crust. It's a fine-grained, loosely glued layer of organic powder and ice. You couldn't make a snowball on Tempel 1."
Peter Schultz,"When I was your age, I saw the first satellite go around the earth. Today, you will have a chance to imagine what it's like on the moon."
Bruno Schulz,"Theses officers were good friends, so it must have been a terrible argument, because the one who played chess with my father was so angry that he walked over to the dentist's house and got the dentist out of bed and shot him."
Bruno Schulz,"One Sunday, a Sunday probably much like today, two Gestapo officers went out drinking together and they got drunk... They had an argument."
Bruno Schulz,"In our town there was a Gestapo officer who loved to play chess. After the occupation began, he found out that my father was the chess master of the region, and so he had him to his house every night."
Richard Schulze,"Everything has to do with quality,"
Richard Schulze,"His philosophy is he learned a lot through trial and error, and if any of that could be reduced in an academic setting, it would have accelerated his ability to move forward."
Richard Schulze,The facilities no longer fulfill the expectations and requirements of our guests. Today's travelers have more choices and alternatives which include new state-of-the-art accommodations.
Richard Schulze,"In view of the challenging economic environment, our ability to report record profits and exceed earnings estimates is particularly gratifying,"
Michael Schumacher,"It was a bit of a struggle, but luckily we know overtaking is nearly impossible here."
Michael Schumacher,"It was just too wet to go out. I think we would have needed a boat propeller to power our way round the track,"
Michael Schumacher,"I mean, that is bad luck as well, and if you lose it would be terrible, so this is good news to do it. Every championship is the best. It is a super effort from my people, from the team, from Fernando, we are very happy."
Michael Schumacher,I look forward to fighting them again next season.
Michael Schumacher,"I always have special feelings when Spa comes around but I have to admit our recent performances are dampening my enthusiasm,"
Michael Schumacher,My overriding memory of childhood is having the freedom to decide which way to go in life and having my parents' support.
Michael Schumacher,"It's not something that happens overnight. I kept saying that until mathematically things are impossible, I will keep fighting,"
Tony Schumacher,"It's great to run the way we are right now, but that early round is crucial. There's no way to look past it. I can't win my fourth in a row without winning the first round, so I must forget the last three years because it means nothing right now.  It takes just one mistake to go home."
Tony Schumacher,I'll still be nervous tomorrow morning. We just went 4.49 and Melanie went 4.50. That's not a huge advantage. There are lots of cars right there that could win. We just qualified a little bit better than they did.
Tony Schumacher,"It's exciting for me knowing that these kids will learn and benefit from our experiences and advice. Students participating in the YES program will understand that drag racing is not only a sport, but a launching pad for a multitude of careers."
Robert Schumann,He must be heard - and also seen; for if he played behind the scenes a great deal of the poetry of his playing would be lost
Robert Schumann,"In order to compose, all you need to do is remember a tune that nobody else has thought of."
Robert Schumann,"For me, music is always the language which permits one to converse with the Beyond"
Robert Schumann,It is music's lofty mission to shed light on the depths of the human heart
Robert Schumann,Nothing right can be accomplished in art without enthusiasm.
Robert Schumann,"If we were all determined to play the first violin we should never have an ensemble. Therefore, respect every musician in his proper place."
Robert Schumann,"It is the curse of talent that, although it labors with greater steadiness and perseverance than genius, it does not reach its goal, while genius already on the summit of the ideal, gazes laughingly about."
Robert Schumann,"Talent works, genius creates."
Robert Schumann,People compose for many reasons: to become immortal; because the pianoforte happens to be open; because they want to become a millionaire; because of the praise of friends; because they have looked into a pair of beautiful eyes; for no reason whatsoever.
Robert Schumann,To send light into the darkness of men's hearts - such is the duty of the artist.
Chuck Schumer,"It's hard to conceive of something that could hurt New York more than the elimination of state and local tax deductibility, ... We will do everything in our power to defeat this pernicious proposal."
Chuck Schumer,It's hard to conceive of something that could hurt New York more than the elimination of state and local tax deductibility. ... We will do everything in our power to defeat this pernicious proposal.
Chuck Schumer,"The door outside this room doesn't say, check your views out the door. So your failure to answer questions is confounding me. You've done it in instance, after instance, after instance, after instance."
Chuck Schumer,"If he is a Rehnquist, that would not be a cause for exultation in my book, but it would not be a cause for alarm. The court's balance will not be altered. But there is a reasonable danger that he will be like Justice Thomas, the most radical justice on the Supreme Court. It is not that I am certain that he will be a Thomas, it's not even that it's more than 50 percent, but the risk that he might be a Thomas and the lack of any reassurance that he won't, particularly in light of this president's professed desire to nominate people in that mold, is just not good enough. I hope he will not be a Justice Thomas but the risk is too great to bear."
Chuck Schumer,"Truth be told, though our economy operates in the Information Age, our power grid functions more like something from the Stone Age, ... We must act to change this now in the energy bill that is before the Congress."
Mike Schussler,"To say what the monetary value is at this stage is impossible, but it is probably running into the millions."
Mike Schussler,"Government will need to start thinking unconventionally about achieving its targets, or (it) may have to acknowledge that the targets are a bit ambitious."
Mike Schussler,I don't think the strike is having too much impact on companies and the economy; companies can operate without security guards.

Charles Schwab,The man who has done his best has done everything.

Charles Schwab,"When a man has put a limit on what he will do, he has put a limit on what he can do."
Charles Schwab,"Every one's got it in him, if he'll only make up his mind and stick at it. None of us is born with a stop-valve on his powers or with a set limit to his capacities, There's no limit possible to the expansion of each one of us."
Charles Schwab,A man who trims himself to suit everybody will soon whittle himself away.
Charles Schwab,"Lead the life that will make you kindly and friendly to everyone about you, and you will be surprised what a happy life you will lead."

Charles Schwab,"I have yet to find the man, however exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism."
Charles Schwab,A man can succeed at almost anything for which he has unlimited enthusiasm.
Charles Schwab,I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among men the greatest asset I possess. The way to develop the best that is in a man is by appreciation and encouragement.
Jim Schwartz,Players have already adjusted to the rules changes from 2004. They've developed alternate techniques that can be effective but less likely to draw an illegal-contact flag.
Jim Schwartz,Let's say a prayer the injury isn't too severe. He was dominating inside. I don't know if I've seen a defensive tackle inside dominate the way he did today.
Jim Schwartz,"The message to the players is we don't panic. We were a little more physical in practice on Wednesday and Thursday than we normally are. We don't wear shoulder pads in the Thursday practice, but we did this week. We still did the same tackle drills, though."
Jim Schwartz,I've always wanted to come back to Adrian as an administrator with the Adrian Police Department.
Jim Schwartz,I'm looking forward to working with the professional men and women of the Adrian Police Department.
Jonathan Schwartz,"The big wave in the marketplace to me is citizens getting involved in technology, individuals getting involved in technology decisions."
Jonathan Schwartz,The industry generally falls into two camps: Those who support what we're up to and others who want to collect a fee
Jonathan Schwartz,"Today is the culmination of a tremendous amount of [research and development], ... trying to fundamentally understand where we went wrong as a company, where we went off the rails, [and] how we can get back on the rails."
Jonathan Schwartz,We'll see if we can make progress there.
Jonathan Schwartz,"It's time the technology industry took a stand -- tripling your datacenter performance shouldn't mean tripling your power bill and needing more coal-fired power plants,"
Jonathan Schwartz,Proprietary technology relegates you either to a niche or to the ditch. We're growing our market opportunity by steadfastly open sourcing the entirety of our software portfolio--from the Solaris OS to Java developer tools--and now we're taking the next step by open sourcing the world's most innovative microprocessor under the GPL. Giving our customers more choice and driving community innovation expands our economic opportunity and is forcing our competitors to sit up and take notice--we are back on offense.

Morrie Schwartz,"So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things."

Arnold Schwarzenegger,great for our re-election.
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"My education budget for this year provides funding for new initiatives designed to support students and recognize excellent teachers,"

Arnold Schwarzenegger,"I've seen firsthand coming here with empty pockets but full of dreams, full of desire, full of will to succeed, but with the opportunities that I had, I could make it. This is why we have to get back and bring California back to where it once was."
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"get rid of our dependence on oil and move toward clean, renewable domestic energy policies."
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"We can debate over this issue about what to do about the driver's license from here to eternity, ... The bottom line is what we really need to do is work on the problem. What do we do with the undocumented immigrant? What do we do with the people who want to come to the United States? What do we do with employers who need workers from Mexico?"
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"As California is home to more legal immigrants than any other state in the country, we would shoulder a disproportionate share of this federal funding reduction,"
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"I recognize that we also need more bipartisan cooperation to make it all happen, ... And I promise I will deliver that, because Californians believe that the state is on the wrong track. Californians believe that we need reform, we need change. But the people of California are sick and tired of all the fighting, and they are sick and tired of all those negative TV ads."

Arnold Schwarzenegger,"There are so many high school students who are not interested in going to a four-year college to be a doctor or lawyer but who want to learn a trade,"
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"You can count on it that we will do the right - we will pick the right choice and that we will get the right replacement,"

Arnold Schwarzenegger,"America gave me opportunities, and my immigrant dreams came true, ... I want other people to get the same chances I did, the same opportunities. And I believe they can. That's why I believe in this country, that's why I believe in this party -- and that's why I believe in this president."
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"Look, I'm an immigrant, so I know what it is like to dream about coming to America and then to get here and be able to make your dreams a reality, ... Of course, there are millions of people who want to come here. Let's help them, let's find a legal way to do it."
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"That's why America is safer with George W. Bush as president,"
Arnold Schwarzenegger,"Everything I have, my career, my success, my family, I owe to America."

Kyle Schweigert,"I don't think it's any easier. I really don't. My first couple years as head coach, I ran around selling a dream, and I'm still selling a dream, only there is a little more substance to it now because we've taken a step in the right direct. But it's still just as hard of work to close the deal. And any time you relax, I don't think you'll do very well. You have to work just as hard as before."
Kyle Schweigert,"Signing day is an exciting time of the year, and once again, we think we have an exciting class coming to UMD. It's a little different than my first two classes.

Albert Schweitzer,The purpose of human life is to serve and to show compassion and the will to help others.
Albert Schweitzer,Our civilization lacks humane feeling. We are humans who are insufficiently humane! We must realize that and seek to find a new spirit. We have lost the sight of this ideal because we are solely occupied with thoughts of men instead of remembering th

Mike Scioscia,"He stepped up and pitched to his potential at a key time,"
Mike Scioscia,"It makes sense to have [Guerrero] ahead of Garret, but that has failed to work out over the past couple of months, especially for Garret. This might help out some things."
Mike Scioscia,"A big night for him. He deserved it. He played hard here. He flew under the radar, with A-Rod and Griffey and Randy Johnson, but as far as that team's success, if you're going to point to one guy, you're going to point to Danny Wilson."
Mike Scioscia,He was fine last night. He was a little stiff today and got some treatment.
Mike Scioscia,"Kelvim just shined the whole night, ... That gives us a big lift. It's one of the reasons we have him down there, for depth."
Mike Scioscia,"We had a lot of guys in our 'pen step up. Kelvim just shined the whole night. That's one of the big reasons why we have him for depth down there, and tonight it certainly paid off."
Mike Scioscia,Our bullpen came through. Kelvim shined the whole night. Kelvim made some big pitches and gave us a big lift.
Mike Scioscia,"It is something that we would welcome, but it is not an absolute necessity, ... does not have to hit home runs to be productive. What we need is for his production to get back to where it needs to be. He is one of the premier RBI guys in the last few years and we need that to re-emerge."
Mike Scioscia,"Nobody worked harder than Maz. I know he worked very, very hard at getting that team and their whole organization going in the right direction. But when it doesn't happen, you're accountable. That's the life of anybody who's in this position. If you're not moving the organization forward, they make you pass the baton to somebody else."
Mike Scioscia,"If he helps us pitch three or four games and we win, it will keep the bullpen continuity, ... It carries a lot more weight than if he were to pitch one game on Wednesday."
Mike Scioscia,"I really liked the way we had good situational hitting towards the back end of the game. Jose Molina, I don't know if he's had a bigger hit for us this year. That was huge."
Mike Scioscia,"I couldn't be in a better environment for us to achieve our goals, ... From everything from what Arte has committed to this organization, from the top down to the Minors couldn't be better. Nobody has a crystal ball, but I don't know if there is a better managerial job out there in baseball."
Mike Scioscia,"Anytime the Yankees are around, it seems like it's a more special environment. We've had some big games with the Yankees recently."
Mike Scioscia,It is an aggressive baserunning play. I don't think it is one we're going to design unless you're Willie Mays Hayes.
Mike Scioscia,"Coming up as a player, I was coached as much by another player as I was by a coach, and sometimes it carried more weight. We're all in this together. When they share thoughts, I think it makes us all better."
Mike Scioscia,I think it was a terrific effort against a good club and considering the circumstances of being in a pennant race.
Mike Scioscia,"He's pitched some good baseball against us, but that was probably the best game he's pitched against us. When his fastball was off he got his breaking ball over."
Mike Scioscia,But we're not going to get there if we don't play better baseball.
Mike Scioscia,We haven't played consistent baseball. Our offense has been spotty at times.
Mike Scioscia,"It's written into the fabric of baseball that with games on the line that have bearing on the race, you try and put your best lineup out there."

Martin Scorsese,"I'm going to be 60, and I'm almost used to myself."
Martin Scorsese,"I was born in 1942, so I was mainly aware of Howard Hughes' name on RKO Radio Pictures."

Martin Scorsese,"I think there's only one or two films where I've had all the financial support I needed. All the rest, I wish I'd had the money to shoot another ten days."

Martin Scorsese,"I grew up within Italian-American neighborhoods, everybody was coming into the house all the time, kids running around, that sort of stuff, so when I finally got into my own area, so to speak, to make films, I still carried on."
Martin Scorsese,"I don't agree with everything he did in his life, but we're dealing with this Howard Hughes, at this point. And also ultimately the flaw in Howard Hughes, the curse so to speak."
Martin Scorsese,I do know that some Buddhists are able to attain peace of mind.
Martin Scorsese,I certainly wasn't able to get it when I was a kid growing up on the Lower East Side; it was very hard at that time for me to balance what I really believed was the right way to live with the violence I saw all around me - I saw too much of it among the people I knew.
Martin Scorsese,I can't really envision a time when I'm not shooting something.
Martin Scorsese,"I always say that I've been in a bad mood for maybe 35 years now. I try to lighten it up, but that's what comes out when you get me on camera."

Martin Scorsese,"Now more than ever we need to talk to each other, to listen to each other and understand how we see the world, and cinema is the best medium for doing this."
Martin Scorsese,"It seems to me that any sensible person must see that violence does not change the world and if it does, then only temporarily."
Martin Scorsese,Cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out.

Adam Scott,I feel very comfortable playing this golf course. The shots here always seem to fit my eye.
Adam Scott,"Asia has been great to me. I played a good round of golf this afternoon and there you go. I've got this big trophy over here, my first national championship too."
Adam Scott,"It's good for golf at the moment. It's a big story and we need all the exposure we can get. If she starts making cuts, she can play as many as she wants. I think it wears a bit thin on everyone if she were to keep missing all the cuts, but there's no doubt she's good enough to make the cut."
Adam Scott,"I think Davis was much in the same boat. When you just get in the worst spots, there's no forgiveness."
Adam Scott,"It's totally a game of confidence. When you've got that confidence, you've got to run with it because who knows how long it's going to last?"
Adam Scott,"Rory has been on the leader board every week I've looked this year. When you've got that confidence, you have to run with it."
Adam Scott,"The teams are named, and we're ready to go. It's going to be some good competition. I'd like to get my hands on the trophy and look forward to the Sunday night celebration. We did a pretty good job celebrating last time, and we didn't even win the thing."

Adam Scott,All I did was listen to my body and you have to do that sometimes.

Beckie Scott,To say I'm an Olympic gold medallist now is the greatest honor. I'm just so happy that things turned out the way they did.
Beckie Scott,To be able to finish your career either first or second in the world would be a pretty remarkable achievement.
Byron Scott,"He's going to have to really grasp it a lot quicker. He seems to have some trouble with it. But once he gets there, I think he's going to be pretty good."
Byron Scott,"Sometimes we get ourselves into trouble on the offensive end. We might pass up a shot, but tonight we did a real good job of moving the ball around and that opened up the shots we can knock down."
Byron Scott,"Sometimes they get surprised he's so wide open. With a guard like that, you've got to keep your space and be ready to fire when the ball comes to you and take the shots that are given you. There was about four or five instances where we weren't ready to pull the trigger, and we end up making it into a bad play."
Byron Scott,I know that it's broken in two places. I would guess that he's done for the rest of the season. It's a big blow.

Byron Scott,"I'll always bleed purple and gold, but I'm not going to give up any wins."
Byron Scott,I don't think Chris will play (today). I would love to just let him relax for the next two games and see how he feels for Monday.
Byron Scott,They said he was going to be out a minimum of two weeks and he misses one game. It just shows you the type of person that he is. He's doing some unbelievable things for this basketball team. It just shows the type of character (he has).
Byron Scott,Even though we won the game we have a lot of things to learn from. Our athleticism and our quickness are the keys to our team and we need to use them to our advantage.
Byron Scott,The intensity level is getting tougher because teams are fighting for the playoffs. And we haven't gotten that message yet.
Byron Scott,Just bad defense on our part.
Byron Scott,"Our defense took over in the fourth quarter, and I was proud of the way our team played. Even though we won the game, we have a lot of things to learn. Our athleticism and quickness are the keys to our team, and we need to use them to our advantage."
Byron Scott,"[The Princeton offense] is old-style basketball. Dribble, pass and shoot. I always thought it's the way the game was supposed to be played."
Byron Scott,That's just a very good basketball team. They come with their hard hats on every night. They're not going to make a lot of mistakes.
Byron Scott,"Like I told the guys, that's a good basketball team. We hung in there, we kept fighting, but that is no consolation. We still have to learn how to get over the hump."
Byron Scott,"They were playing harder. They were getting after loose balls, long rebounds. We had to match their energy. In the third quarter and fourth quarter, we did a much better job."
Byron Scott,"We're excited. We bring in another athlete, a 7-foot athlete, 24 years old who runs and jumps and does a lot of the things that we want here. I think he'll fit in extremely well."
Byron Scott,"With all the adversity we've faced, I told them before the game that you guys have always done a good job of coming together in the face of adversity. That is something we're going to have to do, not just tonight, but the rest of the season."
Byron Scott,"It's not an achievement, it's what we expected. We've gotten to .500; now the key is to keep going. There are a lot of young guys that didn't experience the terrible season we had last year; the 19 wins is a nice accomplishment, but were looking to do bigger things this season."
David Scott,Expect some reasonable slowing in both unit sales and median sales prices across the first half of 2006.
David Scott,"Get ready for a dose of reality,"
David Scott,"If there are cuts to be made, why should we make them on food stamps? ... This is the meanest cut of all."
Eugenie Scott,Evolution is not controversial in the field of science. It's controversial in the public sphere because public education is highly politicized.
Eugenie Scott,Intelligent design is ultimately a science stopper.
Eugenie Scott,As a legal strategy intelligent design is dead. It will be very difficult for any school district in the future to successfully survive a legal challenge. That doesn't mean intelligent design is dead as a very popular social movement. This is an idea that has got legs.
Eugenie Scott,"This action is likely to be the playbook for creationism for the next several years, ... We can predict this fight happening elsewhere."
Jill Scott,"Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. 1,"
Jill Scott,"First, it was shock, ... Then depression, and then anger. There were newscasters saying, You've got to get out of here, everybody has to go now,' but nobody thought about the people who didn't have cars. And nobody came to help. Nobody brought food ... the system broke apart."
Jill Scott,"First, it was shock, ... Then depression, and then anger. There were newscasters saying, â€˜You've got to get out of here, everybody has to go now,' but nobody thought about the people who didn't have cars. And nobody came to help. Nobody brought food ... the system broke apart."
Jill Scott,"There's a high school in Camden, New Jersey, I call the Jill Scott School. It's the Camden Creative Arts High School. Those teachers and kids are so passionate about what they do, and 98 percent of the senior class went on to college."
Jill Scott,"God is ever present. He's in every breath, in every step. He's here, always, always."
Jill Scott,To be a queen of a household is a powerful thing.
Jim Scott,"There is potential for Australian marina developers in Thailand, now that Australian products enter tariff-free and more marinas are being built."
Jim Scott,It's a complicated process to look from receiver to receiver. The steep learning curve is going to turn off most casual gamers.
Jim Scott,She was a short little lady with a huge heart.
Jim Scott,She was very godly and just opened her heart to everybody.
Jim Scott,That's tempting a real serious fate.
Jim Scott,"This switch helped the company complete its U.S. distribution network, which now covers all 50 states."
Jim Scott,"The great thing is that a lot of their hikes aren't even written up in books, so by going on their hikes you can learn ones that you wouldn't have any other way of knowing about."
Jim Scott,"I favor giving localities more ability to make the transportation, land-use connection than they are doing right now, My inclination is to try to help local governments."
Larry Scott,"In the 21st century, it is morally indefensible that women competitors in a Grand Slam tournament should be receiving considerably less prize money than their male counterparts."
Larry Scott,We felt that we had to pursue every means possible to utilize technology to make sure that calls were accurate without losing the human element of officials on court.
Larry Scott,There have been quite a few notable matches over the past couple of years where the line calls were questionable and in fact proved to be wrong. So much is on the line. The opportunity to know the right call is impossible to resist.
Larry Scott,"What Kim has accomplished over the past year to become No. 1 again is truly remarkable. With the incredible depth in today's game, reaching the top of the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour rankings is an incredible feat."
Larry Scott,"Sony Ericsson is changing the face of women's tennis through the convergence of our sport with technology and music, ... These concerts are just one of the ways our partnership with Sony Ericsson will be bringing new and younger audiences to our game and heightening the overall fan experience for everyone who attends our tournaments around the world."
Larry Scott,"It's not about the money, neither for the club nor the players. It's certainly not about Wimbledon needing cash with their declared profit of Â£25 million. They are clearly trying to make a statement. On the one hand, they say they cherish the players and the champions, and on the other hand, they are telling the world that Venus Williams is less of a champion than Roger Federer."
Larry Scott,Nothing is more important to us than issues involving the health and safety of our players.
Larry Scott,"The addition of a touch of fashion adds that extra element of entertainment to the most important event on the WTA Tour calendar,"
Larry Scott,"He has given a lot to the sport, so it's a big ego boost to come here and have people want to see him."
Larry Scott,"Part of my surprise is that British culture is much more aligned with American and Australian culture, and this is a cultural and social issue, not a financial issue. Part of my surprise is that Wimbledon is the last one standing."
Larry Scott,That's the beauty of the system. The replay device tells you if the ball was in or out.
Larry Scott,There are lots of kids getting more serious about their tennis at a much earlier age than elsewhere.
Lee Scott,"We are confident our earnings momentum will continue and look forward to reporting another record year in sales and earnings,"

Lee Scott,"[In addition to his responsibility for Wal-Mart Stores, U.S. A., Menzer will head the divisions responsible for real estate, logistics, information services, benefits, global procurement, financial services, store planning and strategic planning.] John will continue to accelerate changes in the largest segment of our business, ... During the last six years, he transformed Wal-Mart International into a wellorganized, fast-growing and profitable business. Prior to that, as Wal-Marts corporate chief financial officer, John established a solid track record as a business strategist who delivers results."

Lee Scott,"The consumer still seems to us to be very cautious and probably will remain so until we see improvement in employment,"
Lee Scott,"These bills discourage companies from offering quality health care at a lower price. Even worse, they won't do a single thing to control the cost of health care for working families or their children."
Lee Scott,"Are you right to want to make sure that the kids of working families have health coverage, even if it's Medicaid? You bet you are."
Lee Scott,We know this because 30 percent of our associates who have our health coverage were uninsured before they started working at Wal-Mart.
Lee Scott,"Texas was a growth area for Wal-Mart,"
Lee Scott,"Roses, roses are always a favorite. It's an expression of love, everybody knows what the rose stands for."
Lee Scott,"[In pricing,] we are setting the pace, ... Our back-to-school experience was awesome."
Lee Scott,"We are particularly excited about organic food, the fastest-growing category in all of food. It's a great example of how Wal-Mart can appeal to a wider range of customers."
Lee Scott,"Our goal for the second half of the year remains double-digit earnings growth,. However, given the current economic environment this will be difficult to achieve, ... We expect earnings growth in the second half will show improvement over the first half of this year as we leverage our sales and market share gains, but the growth may not meet our original goals."
Lee Scott,"In a challenging retail environment, I am pleased to report our first year with net earnings in excess of $6 billion and our first-ever quarter with earnings over $2 billion,"
Lee Scott,"Even with the lingering impacts of the hurricanes, and the impact of higher energy prices, I believe we will have a good holiday season."
Lee Scott,As the economy has slowed customers have become more concerned about price.
Lee Scott,"We can see first-hand at Wal-Mart how many of our customers are struggling to get by, ... Our customers simply don't have the money to buy basic necessities."
Lee Scott,"The potential right now for success at that school is very, very high. Of the 30 kids in my class, about 10 are Hispanic. It's very difficult for me to look at those kids that I'm teaching now and know that statistically there's a good chance some of them will drop out of school."
Lee Scott,"You know, we opened a record number of stores last year."
Lee Scott,You can't take a store that is a struggling store anyway and add a bunch of people and a bunch of work rules that cause you to even be in worse shape.
Lee Scott,"Where we're not wrong or where the cost of settling is so much that it is totally disproportionate to the harm or the error that we made, we're not going to settle."
Lee Scott,"Where we have been incorrect in what we have done, then I think we have an obligation to settle."
Lee Scott,"We want to set a tone going into our fiscal year that starts Feb. 1, that Wal-Mart Stores is going to be aggressive in taking care of customers, taking care of our associates, communications and merchandising."
Lee Scott,There are going to be some people who never want Wal-Mart. That's OK.
Lee Scott,The customers want those Supercenters.
Lee Scott,The beauty of this country and what people participate in is the competitive nature that we allow to exist and the fact is that we are better because we have great competitors.
Lee Scott,"So I think we have an obligation with our size to make sure that we are open to what people have to say to us because the people who criticize us, they're not all mean-spirited."
Lee Scott,"Retailing, it's always true that there is some items that I wish we had a lot more of like the iPod and there is some items I wish we had a lot less of."
Lee Scott,"People aren't going to talk about it except me and that is communication and the visits I have personally had in our meetings with our store managers saying if you do these things you will be terminated, period."
Lee Scott,"Our size causes us, when we do something inappropriate, which is usually done out of stupidity, to come across as being done out of arrogance."
Lee Scott,"Our customer base is not necessarily a leader, an early adopter."
Lee Scott,"Or if you have one store manager that makes a bad decision, is that indicative that that is somehow what your company represents? No."
Lee Scott,"One of the things that strikes me is so many of the critics are people whose lifestyle doesn't change when the price of fuel changes, or if they keep a Wal-Mart store out of their area."
Lee Scott,"More and more, more and more digital, in particular, I think you'll see in our stores next year, as we start combining these digital products and they interface with each other, you'll see that represented in Wal-Mart."
Lee Scott,Many of them are doing it because they are concerned about smart growth.
Lee Scott,It's hard for us in our stores to be a leader in technology.
Lee Scott,"In some ways, people forget about average working people, and how they live their lives."
Lee Scott,"If you had all the small businesses who employed 1.5 million people collectively, would there be individual instances of issues?"
Lee Scott,"If we take care of the customers and associates and grow the business, Wall Street will be pleased."
Lee Scott,"If anything, the negative press and the criticism take away the opportunity to feel as good as you can feel about your employment."
Lee Scott,"I would guess that any criticism about Wal-Mart could have some element of truth with 1,500,000 people."
Lee Scott,I think in some ways we have allowed other people to set the agenda. Other people to define who we are.
Lee Scott,I just think that it's maybe fashionable today to try to take individual actions and individual failures and take the broadest possible brush and try to paint a company.
Lee Scott,I expect that our associates will walk with a little more bounce in their step and understand that this company is behind them and has respect for them.
Lee Scott,I don't think we'll win every election.
Lee Scott,"Don't say it's because of benefits, because our benefits are good."
Lee Scott,"But they are also better, our competitors are better because Wal-Mart exists."
Lee Scott,Because the truth is our wages are really competitive and they're good.
Lee Scott,Because in our clippings I see a lot of articles that are very positive about all the stores that are voted by local communities.
Lee Scott,"And what I am trying to say to them that through our ads and through our discussions is if you don't want us in your community, that's your choice, but don't say it's because of wages."
Lee Scott,And the greeter is what sets the tone for this company and I've been on TV a little bit this morning.
Lee Scott,The soaring cost of health care in America cannot be sustained over the long term by any business that offers health benefits to its employees.
Michael Scott,a safety net if things go wrong.

Michael Scott,I am going to marry Fantasia. She just doesn't know it yet.
Michael Scott,"We set out to capture what was happening, and then we cut that into the series."
Michael Scott,"You cannot take the second-slowest reproducing species in North America, manage it on a knife-edge and expect that in the long term it will survive. Nature will always throw you a curve."
Ridley Scott,"We're suffering from saturation, overkill,"
Ridley Scott,"We're suffering from saturation, overkill. The market place is flooded by demand, and there are too many films, so everything gets watered down. Demand is the boss and everything bends to that will. Bigger and not necessarily better shows seem to be the order of the day. I can't watch most of them."
Ridley Scott,"You have two people who are on two separate sides where a relationship is impossible, yet they come together."
Ron Scott,"We didn't just take an emotional response, we [realized] our situation, used theory and practice, and engaged them to read and study how their people are effected by various situations. Intellect guided what we where doing, regardless of education level. Black berets and leather jackets were not what we were about. We were about transformation and consistency to benefit them, not suppress them."
Ron Scott,We need to continue to enhance [our] understanding of the long-range struggle and capture the imagination of our youth.
Ron Scott,"It was about self-defense in urban areas, since police had been harassing people for many years at that time."
Steve Scott,"The infrastructure is a key to support the kind of development we're talking about. They have done a lot of infrastructure improvements on the other side of the tracks, but there's no development there to support it."
Steve Scott,Anybody can compete. We did it on purpose that way.
Steve Scott,"It's hard to say what we'd do different. Obviously, we didn't do enough."

Brent Scowcroft,"After all, we didn't bring democracy to Germany in 1945; Hitler destroyed democracy there first."
Richard Scrushy,"My reaction is to him is that I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. When I hear a man testify to all the horrible things he did, I wouldn't believe a word he says."
Richard Scrushy,problems we found during due diligence.
Richard Scrushy,"The committee wants me to answer charges without facing my accusers, ... I am therefore, by advice of my counsel, forced to take the Fifth Amendment today until I can get a venue where I can face my accusers."
Rob Scuderi,"The biggest thing about penalties and power plays, it's all momentum. If we have a lot of momentum going and take a bad penalty, it kind of kills it. It sends the swing of things back to the other team. Certainly, staying out of the box is going to help your chances."
Rob Scuderi,"I'm sure he's looking forward to playing in the playoffs, playing some games that really mean something. Hopefully, he does well."
Rob Scuderi,"I think the last three, four games we've been doing a really good job. Even some of the games we gave up goals, we still did a pretty good job. But it's definitely a positive."
Rob Scuderi,"I was really excited and happy that the Penguins had that much confidence in me, that I would be a regular guy there. I know I can play."
John Scully,He has always been a real straight shooting type of old school Italian guy.
John Scully,"Tokens are extremely portable, easy to use, and their life expectancy is more than seven years."
John Scully,"When you go to spar, everything is paid for - the flight, food, everything,"
Vin Scully,"It is going to be funny for me to go into the clubhouse in Vero Beach and not know half the players. In fact, I really wish we had the names on the back of the uniforms more than ever this year."
Vin Scully,"And look who's coming up. All year long, they looked to him (Kirk Gibson) to light the fire. All year long, he answered the demand; until he was physically unable to start tonight with two bad legs, a left hamstring, and a swollen right knee. And with two out, you talk about a roll of the dice. This is it!"
Vin Scully,It's a great time of the year... if you can stand it.
Vin Scully,As long as you live keep smiling because it brightens everybody's day.
Vin Scully,You can almost taste the pressure now.
Vin Scully,"I really love baseball. The guys and the game, and I love the challenge of describing things. The only thing I hate - and I know you have to be realistic and pay the bills in this life - is the loneliness on the road."
Vin Scully,It's easier to pick off a fast runner than to pick off a lazy runner.
Vin Scully,Losing feels worse than winning feels good.

Vin Scully,She may be the most energetic woman I've ever met. I just marvel at her optimism and her ability to get things done. She just can't be contained. She's bubbly beyond effervescent.
David Seabury,Modern science knows much about such conflicts. We call the mental state that engenders it AMBIVALENCE: a collision between thought and feeling.
David Seabury,"Nature is at work.. Character and destiny are her handiwork. She gives us love and hate, jealousy and reverence. All that is ours is the power to choose which impulse we shall follow."

David Seabury,"Enthusiasm is the best protection in any situation. Wholeheartedness is contagious. Give yourself, if you wish to get others."

Ryan Seacrest,"And so when he puts his mind to something and when he wants to do something like this television show and be there for everybody to see him, he'll do it."
Ryan Seacrest,"When I moved to Hollywood, one of the first people I ever wanted to meet wasn't a movie star. It was a disc jockey, it was Casey Kasem."
Ryan Seacrest,I've dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do. But these things have become part of my process. I think the things I do for my appearance help make me look better. I even color my hair because I like how it makes me look.
Ryan Seacrest,Madonna's fans have anxiously awaited the release of this album. I am excited to bring her closer to radio audiences around the world live!

Ryan Seacrest,"Look, a lot of women would be turned off with hearing me say how hot I think Brad Pitt is! Know what I mean? So I probably don't help my cause."

Bobby Seale,Marxist-Leninism per se was really a latter development: not until 1968 that we really considered the Red Book required reading.
Bobby Seale,"On the one hand, the guns were there to help capture the imagination of the people. But more important, since we knew that you couldn't observe the police without guns, we took our guns with us to let the police know that we have an equalizer."
Bobby Seale,"We were like heroes, to stand there and observe the police, and the police were scared to move upon us."
Bobby Seale,"They came down on us because we had a grass-roots, real people's revolution, complete with the programs, complete with the unity, complete with the working coalitions, where we crossed racial lines."
Bobby Seale,"You don't fight racism with racism, the best way to fight racism is with solidarity."
Bobby Seale,"The first point was we wanted power to determine our own destiny in our own black community. And what we had done is, we wanted to write a program that was straightforward to the people. We didn't want to give a long dissertation."
Junior Seau,"It just cramped up, and I didn't want to risk anything."
Junior Seau,"Whenever you get in that situation in the course of a game, you hope to get one tackle. To make three tackles is a career in the National Football League."

Junior Seau,"When you're putting your kids to bed and their prayer at night is 'God, please let Daddy win, sometime,' you know it's getting bad."

Aleksandr Sebryakov,"People search for love based on appearance, but they forgot about attitude and personality."
Aleksandr Sebryakov,"The only way to begin, change, and success is to simplify and go step by step.

Simplify and begin step by step without the process of thinking too much."
Aleksandr Sebryakov,"When you're alive you wonder how to live your life to the fullest, how to have accomplishment, success, money, and fame; but when you lay on your death-bed you wonder what good have I done in life!"

Adam Sedgwick,"The pretended physical philosophy of modern days strips Man of all his moral attributes, or holds them of no account in the estimate of his origin and place in the created world."
Adam Sedgwick,"As a system of philosophy it is not like the Tower of Babel, so daring its high aim as to seek a shelter against God's anger; but it is like a pyramid poised on its apex."
Ivan Seidenberg,"From our perspective, our (service) job is never done. Service is our most important issue. It's the bedrock of our company."
Ivan Seidenberg,"This is a logical fit, naturally uniting our U.S. properties and strong management teams, and enhancing the benefits of Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE,"
Ivan Seidenberg,"This is a significant step forward in the effort toward inter-industry cooperation in addressing the serious problem of copyright infringement over the Internet, ...

Jerry Seinfeld,"You know you're getting old when you get that one candle on the cake. It's like, 'See if you can blow this out.'"

Jerry Seinfeld,That's the true spirit of Christmas; people being helped by people other than me

No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's notto be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we areto the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing."

Teemu Selanne,"We showed a lot of pride coming back, especially when we got the bad break in the first period."
Teemu Selanne,"Obviously, everybody's living in this moment right now and it's awesome. It would be nice to bring the gold medal back to our country and our fans. We haven't done it before and it would be something very special for them and us, too. You have to enjoy this time."
Teemu Selanne,"If it was a playoff game, it would be different, but I have to be smart. I'd rather miss one or two games than two weeks."
Teemu Selanne,The ice has never been good here. It is OK. Nothing special. Not like in Canada.
Teemu Selanne,"We've played with a lot of confidence and that's been the key so far. Hopefully, we can take more confidence into the playoffs."
Teemu Selanne,"You keep shooting. You hope it goes in, and you smile."

Teemu Selanne,"When I was a kid, I remember playing hockey outside and whenever you did, you thought about playing for Finland vs. Sweden. That's just the way it was."
Bill Self,"There may be other teams that travel as well as we do, but nobody travels better."
Bill Self,"Last year, there were the seniors and then there was the rest of the team. This year, because we're so young and everybody's kind of an unproven commodity, everybody's about the same. I do think this is a closer-knit group maybe than we had last year."
Bill Self,Your job is based on how you do with the potential that you have. That's why I think Jim is a great coach. I think that Kansas State is one of the best four teams in our league in the last half of the Big 12 season. They have lost a lot of tough games.
Bill Self,"From a coach's perspective, if I watched Jim Wooldridge's team or Rick Barnes' team, it makes a difference. Your job is based on how you do with the potential that you have. That's why I think Jim is a great coach. I think Kansas State is one of the best four teams in our league in the last half of the Big 12 season."
Bill Self,You don't want to take away his freedom to make creative plays.

Bill Self,"I would say that if you could try to sum up those guys' four years, and the emotions they have, and multiply it by 15, that would give you an idea of what it will be like for Max. I would think he will be very emotional."
Peter Sellars,"[He is particularly proud of the inclusion in this scene of a petition signed by 70 scientists asking Truman not to bomb Japan. Leslie Groves, the crusty general who oversaw the Manhattan Project, made sure that the document never reached Truman.] What's beautiful, ... is to have documents that were quietly discarded in history now set for singers and orchestra for all the world to hear."
Peter Sellars,"[The chorus contains a statement of the principles behind the bomb, why it's practical and what it can accomplish.] It doesn't exactly say how to build a nuclear weapon, ... but it is a prÃ©cis of the science involved."
Peter Sellars,How old were you that night?
Peter Sellars,"Documents that were top secret and never meant to be seen are now set to music,"
Peter Sellars,Documents that were top secret and never meant to be seen are now set to music.
Peter Sellars,"You collect all this material and at a certain moment passages start speaking with other passages, ... A conversation that goes along with individual source material just takes off, and things start ricocheting and having surprising connections or counterbalances. You're always looking for yin and yang so the drama thrives on contrasts and contradictions."
Peter Sellars,"In these times in America I am very moved and grateful that the Gish Prize has chosen to support diversity, controversy, complexity, and non-conformity. I am a collaborative artist, and I accept this recognition on behalf of the courageous artists who have opened and challenged new worlds and old, in a body of work that has created shared space on a divided planet."

Ricardo Semler,"Growth and profit are a product of how people work together,"
Ricardo Semler,"I am not interested in...making sure that you (the employee) are here, that you are giving us so many hours a day. We need people who will deliver a final result."
Sue Semrau,"I think it is really important if you have any kind of vision for going to the championship game of the tournament because four days, four games is a very difficult task. It's been done, but at the same time, it's a lot easier if you have the chance to play three back-to-back games instead so I'm very proud of my team for finishing in the top four in the ACC."
Sue Semrau,"In the stages of growing and developing that teamwork and trust for each other on the defensive end of the floor, you have to help them believe that you're going to get there. It's not just the (wins). They can see the results in different possessions. And as they gain confidence possession by possession, they see themselves beating good teams."
Sue Semrau,The Georgia Tech game was physical but I think the rest of our conference schedule is going to be the same way. NC State comes in a very physical basketball team. We're going to have to really work to get to the point of screens even and make our cuts like we want to be able to do. Obviously the ACC is a conference that really does prepare you for March.
Sue Semrau,"I may regret sleeping in a tent come Sunday, but it's all being done in good spirits and I'm thrilled to do anything to help us fill the Tucker Center for this very special game."
Sue Semrau,"The thing I love most about Florida State is the people who support us. It's unbelievable to be at an FSU football game with 80,000 awesome fans. I want my players, who have done so much to elevate our women's basketball program, to experience that special atmosphere...and I'll camp out to rally those same fans to join us on Sunday at 1 p.m.!"
Sue Semrau,I am really proud of our players because there has been a lot of hard work on their part. The thing I'm really excited about is we will be playing on neutral courts. It was a tough route going up to Connecticut last season. We can deal with altitude but it's a lot more difficult to go out and play on a home court. Louisiana Tech is a great team. I know Chris Long well and he has done a great job as a first-year coach. It will be a tough one out there but it's something we will look forward to. We know we have to go out to Denver and take care of business. We can only take it one game at a time and we won't look past anything.
Sue Semrau,I thought we had an outstanding practice yesterday. Our players made a commitment to the defensive system and it seemed as though we were clicking on all cylinders...especially in the first half.
Sue Semrau,"We do believe we can go on a run. We feel like the Georgia Tech game is going to be really important for us in sustaining that. The win at Virginia can be a great start to that run if we can continue to take advantage of the momentum we have, at Georgia Tech. In essence, though, coming home and playing all but two games at home in the month of February is huge for us. We've built character and we're on solid ground. We feel like we have as much confidence as we've ever had."
Sue Semrau,"The important thing for us, we are not playing the program, but a basketball team. We will work on the types of things we need to do to match up with a very good team."
Sue Semrau,It is so important for our program to develop awareness that there is life outside of basketball. We want to continue to connect with young people and others in need.

Herb Sendek,We did a good job bouncing back and our guys came together and they battled. I think foul trouble really hurt both teams and especially us with Cedric Simmons in foul trouble. (Simmons) was really only a shell of himself trying not to pick up extra fouls.
Herb Sendek,We have not played our best recently. There also is a reality that March is a new season. We have to play better than we have.
Herb Sendek,They have established themselves. They have quality depth and a lot of athleticism. They have a lot of good working parts and really seem to be playing together.

Herb Sendek,I see great potential here.
Herb Sendek,"Obviously, in a situation like this, as you're well aware, we're really not at liberty to talk about it. Right now, he's practicing with our team. He's going to class. That's where I think we need to leave it."
Herb Sendek,"We're really not at liberty to talk about it. What I can tell you is that Gavin is a true gentleman, and he is working hard to pursue his degree at N.C. State."
Herb Sendek,"That's just kind of how this team has taken shape. I don't know if you're going to have that many guys night in and night out, but we certainly had terrific balance. Just a good team win."
Herb Sendek,I'm very excited about the direction of our program.
Herb Sendek,Eric Williams dominated and we had no counter for his ability to dominate around the basket.
Seneca,"We all sorely complain of the shortness of time, and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives are either spent in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them."

Lucius Annaeus Seneca,When ever the speech is corrupted so is the mind.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,"The acquisition of riches has been to many not an end to their miseries, but a change in them: The fault is not in the riches, but the disposition."

Lucius Annaeus Seneca,No one can be despised by another until he has learned to despise himself.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,Great grief does not of itself put an end to itself.

Lucius Annaeus Seneca,There is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,The pressure of adversity does not affect the mind of the brave man. It is more powerful than external circumstances.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,Let us train our minds to desire what the situation demands.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,"Fortune can take away riches, but not courage."

Lucius Annaeus Seneca,The greatest remedy for anger is delay.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,There is nothing more despicable than an old man who has no other proof than his age to offer of his having lived long in the world.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,"As for old age, embrace and love it. It abounds with pleasure if you know how to use it. The gradually declining years are among the sweetest in a man's life, and I maintain that, even when they have reached the extreme limit, they have their pleasure still."
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,"Consult your friend on all things, especially on those which respect yourself. His counsel may then be useful where your own self-love might impair your judgment."
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,Light troubles speak; the weighty are struck dumb.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,The good things of prosperity are to be wished; but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,No untroubled day has ever dawned for me.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,We become wiser by adversity; prosperity destroys our appreciation of the right.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,The bravest sight in the world is to see a great man struggling against adversity.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,No man was ever wise by chance.
Lucius Annaeus Seneca,"For many men, the acquisition of wealth does not end their troubles, it only changes them."

Rod Serling,I grew up in a single family household and when you decide to go to the wall on your first project you really want to go with material that you're passionate about and I think that is one of the reasons I felt so compelled to make this film.
Rod Serling,Imagination... its limits are only those of the mind itself.
Rod Serling,"Some people possess talent, others are possessed by it. When that happens, a talent becomes a curse."
Rod Serling,There is nothing in the dark that isn't there when the lights are on.
Frank Serpico,"We can still holler and shout but we have to light the lamps that shed the light on corruption, injustice, ineptitude and abuse of power. When we do, you will see the villains scurry into the woodwork the way roaches do when you turn on the light."
Frank Serpico,I'm retarded - I mean I'm retired.
Frank Serpico,"The fight for justice against corruption is never easy. It never has been and never will be. It exacts a toll on our self, our families, our friends, and especially our children. In the end, I believe, as in my case, the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity."
Frank Serpico,"Today it is becoming harder to speak out, with the inception of the Patriot Act, the president has legislated free speech to be a crime."
Frank Serpico,"We must hold our lawmakers accountable and our courts responsible, or democracy and freedom of speech in America will soon become extinct."

Jeff Sessions,"My advice to you is this. Keep your famous good humor, take your time, and explain the procedural posture of the cases and exactly how you ruled as a judge, or the position you took as a lawyer. Americans know these matters are often complex and will appreciate your answers."

Richie Sexson,The truth is that this is the worst I've ever felt at the plate for this long a period of time.

Richie Sexson,"It's funny because earlier in the game, I'd had a single with Raul (Ibanez) on second base and he didn't score, ... We were joking on the bench. Reeder said he would have scored on that one. And then later he's on second and he doesn't score. It's just one of those things. We didn't think any more about it."
Richie Sexson,I'd like to believe so. No one can ever say with certainty who's going to go to a World Series. But you have to come to the ballpark every day convinced you are going to win.
Richie Sexson,I don't think it was where he wanted it. He doesn't throw beach balls.
Richie Sexson,He's smart and he's got the ability to throw a pitch where he wants it. He's a student of the game. Guys who are younger should be hanging around his locker because he knows exactly what to do to every hitter.

Stephanie Shain,We applaud films that present the bond between dogs and their people. The downside is that people become so enamored by the character portrayed on screen that they want that dog in their home. They assume the breed is great without examining if it is the right match for their lifestyles.
Stephanie Shain,"Despite their cuddly appearance, rabbits are fragile creatures who require special care. Too often people buy a rabbit thinking you can put them in a cage and they'll be a great pet, which is completely wrong.

Shakira,[A group of four 16-year-olds from Westbury hooted about cutting school to attend the parade.] But Giuliani says it's OK! ... I'll write an essay.
Shakira,"I think that that's why I am probably a romantic and a passionate person. But I also have a very disciplined side, very disciplined and very demanding. Sometimes my sense of responsibility is my worst torturer."
Shakira,I always have you in my heart.
Shakira,"Writing songs has a therapeutic effect, and it either kills off love or wins the heart of the lover"
Shakira,Everyone can know what is in my heart because I find it hard to conceal myself

Shakira,"I don't go out without make up. I'm a woman, you know."
Shakira,"I admire Madonna because she always did whatever she felt like doing. She went through some controversial periods when people rejected her, but she kept on reinventing herself."
Shakira,"I admire a person who, for the love of art, is able to take off their clothes in front of a camera. But I'm not capable, I'm too cowardly for that."
Shakira,Everyone can know what is in my heart because I find it hard to conceal myself.
Shakira,"I am trying to make my accent so it won't bother anyone, but I am not going to drive myself crazy trying to pretend I am an American girl when I am from Colombia."
Shakira Shakira,"Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry."
Shakira Shakira,Writing in English was a major challenge. I didn't want other songwriters to write for me. I wanted to preserve the spirit of my songs in Spanish. I am the same Shakira in English as I am in Spanish.
Shakira Shakira,My songs are the reflection of how I think and how I feel in that moment. But I'm conscious of the fact that artists have a responsibility before the masses and they have to take care with their words.
Shakira Shakira,I'm Colombian and nothing will change that.
Shakira Shakira,I want some day to be able to love with the same intensity and unselfishness that parents love their children with.
Shakira Shakira,I pefer an ugly truth to a pretty lie. If someone is telling me the truth that is when I will give my heart.

Afeni Shakur,"This statue will serve as a reminder to all of those who visit the Peace Garden of Love and Hope, for peace is something my son always held in his heart. This sculpture and the Center that sorrounds it will carry Tupac's message on down to our children's children."

Tupac Shakur,So complicated to escape fate. And you can never understand til' we trade places
Tupac Shakur,"Thanks for comin out, God bless you, good night...What of fame?Everyone knows your face, the world screams your nameAnd never again, are you alone.."
Tupac Shakur,"I make sure everybody die , when we ride on your enemies."
Tupac Shakur,"I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward"
Tupac Shakur,"I know it seems hard sometimes but remember one thing. Through every dark night, theres a bright day after that. So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out, keep ya head up.... and handle it."

Tupac Shakur,"I believe that everything that you do bad comes back to you. So everything that I do that's bad, I'm going to suffer from it. But in my mind, I believe what I'm doing is right. So I feel like I'm going to heaven."
Tupac Shakur,"Must my guns Make em all Scatter,Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter."
Tupac Shakur,"Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?"
Tupac Shakur,The only thing that comes to a sleeping man is dreams.
Tupac Shakur,"I don't see myself being special; I just see myself having more responsibilities than the next man. People look to me to do things for them, to have answers."
Tupac Shakur,"When you do rap albums, you got to train yourself. You got to constantly be in character."
Tupac Shakur,Thug Life to me is dead.
Tupac Shakur,I would rather have been shot straight-up in cold blood-but to be set up? By people who you trusted? That's bad.
Tupac Shakur,I don't have to talk about whether or not I got raped in jail.
Tupac Shakur,Don't change on me. Don't extort me unless you intend to do it forever.
Tupac Shakur,With all my fans I got a family again.
Tupac Shakur,"We all gonna die, we bleed from similar veins."
Tupac Shakur,There's nobody in the business strong enough to scare me.
Tupac Shakur,The only time I have problems is when I sleep.
Tupac Shakur,It's the game of life. Do I win or do I lose? One day they're gonna shut the game down. I gotta have as much fun and go around the board as many times as I can before it's my turn to leave.
Tupac Shakur,It seems like every time you come up something happens to bring you back down.
Tupac Shakur,In my mind I'm a blind man doin' time.
Tupac Shakur,"If I win and get the money, then the Oakland Police department is going to buy a boys' home, me a house, my family a house, and a Stop Police Brutality Center."
Tupac Shakur,I'm a reflection of the community.
Tupac Shakur,"I'm 23 years old. I might just be my mother's child, but in all reality, I'm everybody's child. Nobody raised me; I was raised in this society."
Tupac Shakur,I worked hard all my life as far as this music business. I dreamed of the day when I could go to New York and feel comfortable and they could come out here and be comfortable.
Tupac Shakur,"I never killed anybody, I never raped anybody, I never committed no crimes that weren't honorable."
Tupac Shakur,I just don't know how to deal with so many people giving me that much affection. I never had that in my life.
Tupac Shakur,America wants its respect.
Tupac Shakur,What I learned in jail is that I can't change. I can't live a different lifestyle-this is it. This is the life that they gave and this is the life that I made.
Tupac Shakur,"I just spent 11 and a half months in a maximum-security jail, got shot five times, and was wrongly convicted of a crime I didn't commit."
Tupac Shakur,I'll probably be punished for hard living.
Tupac Shakur,"All I'm trying to do is survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty, unbelievable lifestyle that they gave me."
Tupac Shakur,"Dre was one of my heros in the music industry. If he's not down for his homeboys, I don't wanna be a part of him or around him."
Tupac Shakur,Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real.
Donna Shalala,She actually started the women's network in this town. Jodie brought all the women together from the Carter administration in her home.
Donna Shalala,"This early report is very promising and shows that we are making progress in moving parents on welfare into jobs or giving them the work skills they need to get a job,"
Donna Shalala,"What we would not want to do is ... take away health insurance for adults for which there is no insurance market. If you're 65 years old, what's the market for health insurance?"
Donna Shalala,"We believe we should keep going. We're telling a story about excellence, about going from being very good to extraordinary."
Donna Shalala,"What we're doing is protecting elderly disabled immigrants in nursing homes, ... They're not part of the welfare reform debate. The welfare reform debate is about moving people from welfare to work."
Silvan Shalom,"The foreign minister of China believed after his visit to Tehran that the Iranians are serious about they are planning to move this development or those efforts only in order to develop, let's say, nuclear energy, ... We know the truth. I think most of the world knows the truth."
Silvan Shalom,"He has failed to give us peace; he has failed to give us security,"
Silvan Shalom,"It could happen, ... But we need to see a timetable ? how we will start the peace process and how we will end."
Silvan Shalom,doesn't make it easier because there is no leader now in the Labor Party that can deal with us.
Silvan Shalom,"According to our people, security and intelligence, they are very, very close. It may be only six months before they will have that full knowledge."
Silvan Shalom,"Starting from that moment, all the responsibility will devolve onto the Egyptians and also the multinational force, which is supposed to supervise,"
Silvan Shalom,"We are close to a split and when the house is on fire, you have to do everything possible to extinguish the flames,"
Silvan Shalom,We will not allow Hamas to take part in the elections.

Silvan Shalom,I wish to particularly thank President Musharraf for his courage in promoting peace and moderation in our region and in general.
Silvan Shalom,"While the Palestinians are not doing anything, we would like to implement our commitments,"
Silvan Shalom,"In this situation, of course I can't vote for this agreement. I will see what they (Palestinians) will do in the near future,"
Silvan Shalom,"We reached an agreement with the Egyptians and the Palestinians that we will wait six more months before we consider the opening of the Rafah passage for two ways,"
Silvan Shalom,"The decision [to remove Arafat] that we took two days ago was not for immediate action, ... We are taking into account our allies and our friends, and that's the way we are working."
Adil Shamoo,"In these two cases I would say scientists were overzealous, too quick to push ahead. Scientists feel the pressure of our society like everyone else. Their decisions are clouded by visions of fame and dollars."
Adil Shamoo,"Unfortunately, research institutions and universities have not taken this issue seriously. They pay lip service to responsible conduct and research integrity."
Adil Shamoo,"In light of the problems they just had, I'm surprised they're doing this. What I would like to see are conflict-of-interest statements and complete financial disclosures for all involved, and the patients should be told that. This will affect what they're doing and the integrity of the research."
Adil Shamoo,"Our top research institutions brag about the amount of money they bring in, not the amount of new knowledge. It's really disturbing."
Adil Shamoo,"There is tremendous pressure today to be first. If you do something first, all the money and fame will come to you. All that is an obvious seduction for doing something like this."
Adil Shamoo,"If the IRS never conducted audits, what do you think would happen to people paying taxes in this country? If the public knows the IRS never conducts audits, don't you think there will be an increase in problems?"
Adil Shamoo,Right now scientific fraud and misconduct is alive and well in this country. We don't have to go to South Korea.
Adil Shamoo,"One of the issues we're going to have to address is institutional culture, which makes it easier for such behavior. Institutions haven't really dealt with these issues in a forthright manner. They're closing their eyes to it, or only opening them slightly."
Kazi Shams,One's greatest challenge is to control oneself.
Kazi Shams,Don't pretend cause in the end you will be the only one left perplexed between the two worlds.
Kazi Shams,Curiosity is a path that indefinitely leads to sins
Kazi Shams,It's easy to loose yourself but don't expect others to find your way back.
Kazi Shams,"It's rarely the people that makes you happy that stay forever, it's the people you make happy that does"
Kazi Shams,Judge people not by what they did but by what they can do.
Kazi Shams,Never judge a person for one sin he has committed
Kazi Shams,"Life is not about the things we win, but about the things we keep"
Kazi Shams,"If someone can make you laugh, they can make you cry"
Kazi Shams,Advice others not what you can't advice yourself.
Kazi Shams,"To be strong is to have passion, and to have passion is to believe."
Kazi Shams,"Guide others towards the right path and be hated, rather than letting them walk on and be loved."
Kazi Shams,"To learn is something, but to apply is something different."
Kazi Shams,"Money is temporary, sins are not."
Kazi Shams,"Learn from others, as you would learn from your own mistakes."
Kazi Shams,Lies can bring you fortune but the truth brings you peace
Kazi Shams,Half a truth is a whole lie
Kazi Shams,Beauty always comes with risk
Kazi Shams,Anger is what makes a clear mind clouded.
Shahid Shamsi,His house was surrounded by a large number of police and paramilitary forces and he is not being permitted to come out.
Shahid Shamsi,"We will keep fighting jihad with our pens and our voices. If there is need, we will fight with other means."
Shahid Shamsi,Such steps will escalate public anger.
Brendan Shanahan,"I think the fact that referees are going to have consistent partners, and they're usually only going to work just one conference - they'll get more familiar with us and we'll get more familiar with them - we hope that improves your ability to predict what a referee will and will not call."
Brendan Shanahan,"I was just trying to get a piece of the goalie and let it squeeze in, ... That's just kind of a hope play. You're lucky if it goes in."
Brendan Shanahan,"You prepare yourself the same against every team. You'd like to have that type of success against every team. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I can't explain it."
Brendan Shanahan,The league knows that the enforcement of the rules is really going to be judged in the second half of the season and in the playoffs. It will all mean nothing if the standard changes during that time.
Brendan Shanahan,"It definitely is going to test the depth. Hopefully these aren't serious injuries for these guys. Sometimes a little rest at this time of year can be a blessing in disguise for players like that. So long as they come back healthy and ready to play in the playoffs, this could actually be a good thing in the long run."
Brendan Shanahan,"From a players' perspective, and from a league perspective, when the markets are doing well and the season-ticket sales and the fan interest and the merchandise and all these things are going and improving and there's buzz - it's money in everyone's pockets,"
Brendan Shanahan,"a guy who spoke his mind, a colorful guy."
Brendan Shanahan,I don't mind that people are counting us out. My first year here was 1997 and that's when a lot of people thought the Red Wings had missed their window of opportunity and we won our first of three Stanley Cups together.
Brendan Shanahan,"Since the first day of training camp, he talked about us playing more like a playoff team and scoring playoff-style goals. It's a theme we hear every day. Sometimes you don't like the news the coach is delivering, but he's the coach. It's not his job to fit in with us. It's our job to fit in with him. You need one guy in charge, and he's the guy."
Brendan Shanahan,"Shortly after that, we got a couple of power-play goals because we fed off of those penalty-kills. That was the story of the night, the penalty-killing."
Brendan Shanahan,"This is the way we started games earlier in the season, and we need to get back to that. When teams have to play us from behind and are forced to open things up, we're at our best."
Brendan Shanahan,It's something that's separate from the game of hockey and we're not going to try to prostitute it into wins and losses.
Brendan Shanahan,"In this league, you can never look past opponents. You'll get yourself into trouble. Start thinking about the future, it's going to mess up your present."
Brendan Shanahan,"I see a lot of young players today who are supposed to be the future of the game and I shake my head. Guys who dive. Guy who don't put the team first,"
Brendan Shanahan,Playing hockey is fun. Going out and hooking and holding really isn't fun.
Brendan Shanahan,I want all the members of the media to know that I finished sixth in the (team's season-long) football pool. And Dan Cleary finished ninth.
Brendan Shanahan,"Seeing as I'm on the competition committee, I support the rule changes,"
Brendan Shanahan,"Sergei is a great player with world-class talent. Adding a player like that, I'm sure Columbus is hoping it'll get a lot of their young guys excited."
Brendan Shanahan,"Since I was 15 years old I've never been able to spend Christmas, Halloween or Thanksgiving (with friends and family). This was the first time I was able to enjoy a Super Bowl."
Brendan Shanahan,"It's one of the biggest challenges,"
Mike Shanahan,"Everybody wants difference makers and everybody wants great players. Sometimes, you get a great player that's not a team player and then you have a great player on your team and he might not help you win games."
Mike Shanahan,"He had a lot of reps in practice today and looked pretty good out there. So unless there's a setback, he should be ready to go."
Mike Shanahan,a lot has to do with pain and how he feels with the harness on later in the week.
Mike Shanahan,"Obviously, he hurt enough not to be able to play. The extent of it I can't tell you right now. (We) probably won't be able to tell for a couple of days. Obviously, it was bad enough that he couldn't go back in."
Mike Shanahan,"When you are 0-6 and you havent won a game out there, it is a great challenge for our football team, ... It is not with the same team, but it never is."
Mike Shanahan,"It's all about making decisions. We can't keep everybody . . . so you like to see how they react in a game situation, when the lights are on. The goal is that they make it hard."
Mike Shanahan,Coming out of college he was a zone running back. That was his style and we run a system very similar to the one he ran at Wisconsin. I think he fits our system a little better than the other system.
Mike Shanahan,"Coming out of college, he was a zone-running back. That was his style, and we run a system very similar to the one he ran at Wisconsin. I think he fits our system a little better than the (Giants) system."
Mike Shanahan,"I watch a lot of college film, not only looking at what different colleges do from an offense and defensive standpoint, but also evaluating players, ... so we do that quite a bit during the off-season. Especially a team like LSU, who has a number of players (in draft consideration) year-in and year-out."
Mike Shanahan,"It's one of the deeper teams we've had, I believe, ... We'll see in the end if we can keep it going. But the nature of this business is you're going to lose players. It happens to every football team. We've had guys step up and play well and hopefully we can keep it going."
Garry Shandling,"You know it's funny that none of the regular late-night shows now use guest hosts the way Johnny did. No one talks about it much, but it's curious that they don't do it. They would each have to be asked the reason why they don't."
Garry Shandling,"Yes, I'm a nice man and I enjoy babies. I'm a sensitive guy. I held a baby the other day and it was the first time either of us cried."
Garry Shandling,Without comedy as a defense mechanism I wouldn't be able to survive.
Garry Shandling,The only way I would go back to hosting would be if it were something entirely new. It would prevent me from wanting to host a standard-fare kind of talk show.
Garry Shandling,Rip as we know is vastly experienced and funnier than I think anyone knew. The show really reveals him to be a brilliant comedic actor.
Garry Shandling,"I've never had anyone put on a puppet show to convince me of anything. And I've done a lot of stuff. I don't know that I would put the puppets on when I was pitching a show. This was the head of the studio putting a puppet show on. And I'll tell you, he wasn't bad."
Garry Shandling,I'm not a party guy. I don't carouse very much.
Garry Shandling,"I'm good in bed, actually, and I think I could learn to be a good communicator, too. The only trouble with that is it leads to marriage."
Garry Shandling,"I think sometimes I should do more carousing, because I don't do much and maybe it would be fun occasionally. It's hard for me to have fun and I'm a serious thinker and a searcher and funny from the front."
Garry Shandling,"I think it's one of the main negative emotional ingredients that fuels show business, because there's so much at stake and the fear of failure looms large."
Garry Shandling,"I think I look great in green, and I'm going to start wearing more green."
Garry Shandling,I play basketball on Sundays and I'm a very spiritual guy; I read a lot of Eastern philosophy and I meditate.
Garry Shandling,I like going into nature and that's where I'm happiest.
Garry Shandling,"I guess he wanted to see a little more sexual activity because in real life, in bed I think less is more and let the woman come to me. Frankly, I don't even need a woman there."
Garry Shandling,"I don't know why men are so fascinated with television and I think it has something to do with - if I may judge from my own father, who used to sit and stare at the TV while my mother was speaking to him - I think that's a man's way of tuning out."
Garry Shandling,I don't know how to ground myself without the other actor present.
Garry Shandling,"I actually think I'm more of a turtle than Verne is. Where Verne is up on two legs and moving at full speed and doesn't pull his head into the shell very often, I in reality was five or ten minutes later to every recording session."
Garry Shandling,"Here's the thing - I'm single, I haven't been married, I don't have kids yet. If I do have kids I would be interested to see them in my life, so here's a movie for kids and I'm in there and I'm supposed to be kind of funny for kids."
Garry Shandling,"First of all, I'm not the kind of guy that likes to rehash the show and so forth and so on."
Garry Shandling,Carol Burnett was particularly funny. She swore for the first time on television on Larry Sanders.
Garry Shandling,"But I really like hosting, I think it's a strength of mine. It allows me to improvise, and I love the spontaneity of that, and I think I'm funny behind the desk when interviewing someone."
Garry Shandling,"Because I am afraid of commitment. This movie certainly has some bearing and is some reflection of my real feeling about relationships, because I do have commitment issues. My friends tell me I have intimacy problems, but they don't know me, so who cares what they think?"
Garry Shandling,My first appearance as a guest on The Tonight Show was in '81.
Garry Shandling,I'm too shy to express my sexual needs except over the phone to people I don't know.
Garry Shandling,My friends tell me I have an intimacy problem. But they don't really know me.
Garry Shandling,"The comic strip is what I looked at, and it's another reason I did it. The comic strip, where animals would comment on human behavior, interested me."
Garry Shandling,I am pretty tenacious as a perfectionist in terms of getting something right.
Garry Shandling,It's not the hair on your head that matters. It's the kind of hair you have inside.
Garry Shandling,"I once made love for an hour and fifteen minutes, but it was the night the clocks are set ahead."
Garry Shandling,"Which is, I'm an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship."
Garry Shandling,"I'm dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it."
Gary Shapiro,"Consumers are realizing the benefits of in-car entertainment and navigation systems. When used properly, these products are great tools that help drivers focus on the road. Consumers need to remember to follow state laws, watch the road and use common sense when putting these and other products to work."
Gary Shapiro,"While accessory items and embedded features help minimize driver distraction, nothing replaces simple common-sense when using a cell phone in the car. Pull over to the side of the road to dial manually, know the features and functions of your phone before you drive and allow voice mail to pick up your calls if you are driving - these are all simple and commonsensical steps we can all take to minimize distraction from in-car cell phone use."
Gary Shapiro,"With his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to innovation, Page is a natural fit for CES."
Mark Shapiro,We can't worry about the other teams. I still think we have one of the three or four best lineups in the American League.
Mark Shapiro,We're actually in discussions with two other players. We still have three weeks to work on that.
Mark Shapiro,We've got to get him more work. He's another switch-hitter and a solid receiver. It wouldn't be the worst thing for Josh to play more.
Mark Shapiro,It might be an easier deal to do next year because we'll have a clearer sense what the value is heading into the first year of arbitration.
Mark Shapiro,We'll get value for what Brandon is now. Not for what he might become.
Mark Shapiro,"There's nothing new on Brandon. We're still engaged in some conversations with other clubs. We're going to get the value for the player he is now, not the player he was projected to be."
Mark Shapiro,At no point did we look to move Coco. We had a clear sense of his value.
Mark Shapiro,"I think youth is not a panacea. In Eric's case, he had an understanding of what we're tying to do. He has good communication skills, an ability to understand and identify problems, an ability to teach and develop. Finally, he has a thirst and desire to not only manage, but to be part of a leadership team to help turn things around."
Mark Shapiro,"We are excited to add an experienced starting pitcher to our rotation, one that represents the team we are trying to build both on and off the field."
Mark Shapiro,"We have a bunch of young guys who really care about each other, and they were trying too hard, ... Victor Martinez won two batting titles (in the minors). He was going to hit. Aaron Boone fell into a huge hole. He's almost out of it."
Mark Shapiro,It's an undesirable side effect of a good trade.
Mark Shapiro,"He was everything we had hoped to see. The things you don't know when you make a trade ? the mental approach, whether he will be a good teammate, were the most encouraging things, in addition to his physical tools."
Mark Shapiro,"When you trade for a guy, you don't know his mental approach and the kind of teammate he is. That was probably the most encouraging thing, in addition to his physical tools. He fits in well with our team and our clubhouse."
Mark Shapiro,"We probably would not have done that if not for the other trade, though we like Jason quite a bit. But we would not have taken Arthur off the club if we couldn't add another pitcher to work in an eighth-inning role."
Mark Shapiro,"The talent is obviously there, but we want him to get comfortable so that he doesn't think that he has to have a day like that all the time to impress."
Mark Shapiro,"There are two relationships that are crucial to success. One is the GM-owner, and the other is the GM-manager. If there's not alignment in vision in where you're trying to go between either of those two relationships, then what happens is wasted energy, frankly."
Mark Shapiro,"We want him to throw quality strikes, not just hard strikes. He's going to be a contributor for us this year. Maybe not from day one, but at some point this season he'll be a factor for us."
Mark Shapiro,In Andy we are acquiring a right-handed power hitter who is also a good defensive third baseman.
Mark Shapiro,"He's definitely played the game the way we want it played. He has the power, size and athleticism combo to be a corner outfielder at the Major League level. His approach fits with our approach, and he's a local kid. It's a pretty good match. But he's still got to go to the next level, which he really hasn't been to yet."
Mark Shapiro,"The question and the unknown on him is going to be how much more power he's got. That's an unknown. ... Last year, he was very bad against left-handed pitching. Very bad."
Mark Shapiro,In Andy we are acquiring a right-handed power hitter who is also a good defensive third baseman. It is difficult to acquire a player of Andy's caliber and skill set via trade or free agency and third base is a position of need in our organization.
Mark Shapiro,The best option is when a player picks it up himself by his level of performance. He genuinely has a passion for the game and plays on a daily basis like he enjoys it. That is representative of the attributes we want in our players.
Mark Shapiro,"We saw the same things from him that we've seen in the past. A tremendous athlete, strong hands, a passion for the game. There was nothing different."
Mark Shapiro,"It's a unique evaluation opportunity. I was excited to see him get that opportunity ? that point in the game, in front of his countrymen, we couldn't simulate that type of atmosphere. It was cool to see."
Mark Shapiro,"The opportunity to explore [a long-term deal] is still there for multiple guys. At this point, [Peralta] is the only guy we've talked to specifically."
Mark Shapiro,I got the opportunity to call two flips. The White Sox called the other and all three times it came up heads for us.
Mark Shapiro,Fred and the crew have set the Monday night standard. We want to build on it and at the end of the day have a grand celebration.
Mark Shapiro,"We were looking for a bigger playing field. Folks expected to walk into clients without investing lots of money, but the so-called 'low-hanging fruit' wasn't there."
Mark Shapiro,"I feel good about our 25-man roster. And also about the next 10, which is also important."
Mark Shapiro,"A big part of it is we've stayed healthy, ... I'd like to think some of it is luck and some of it is design. We're so risk-averse, we have to look at other things other clubs don't have to look at."
Mark Shapiro,"We won't stand in the way of either one getting major league jobs. But just because we've made these decisions, that's not to say that either one couldn't be playing in Cleveland at some point this year."
Mark Shapiro,That's a good job by [farm director] John Farrell. One of John's jobs is to utilize our scouting information to find guys who can help us.
Mark Shapiro,I would hope [Thome will receive] resounding cheers.
Mark Shapiro,"We had a lot of quality, substantive conversations that I hope demonstrated to Cliff that he is a core part of this team. But a value we both felt good about was not one we could reach right now."
Mark Shapiro,You hope the back end is solid. The middle will have fluctuations. It's going to have some fluctuation over the next two to three days to get settled.
Mark Shapiro,"ESPN Classic is going through a transition. They're thirsty to put today's news in its proper historical sports context ... History defines sports. Without that context, today's news wouldn't be as grand."
Mark Shapiro,We're used to playing close games against them. We just need to do a better job of finishing them off.
Mark Shapiro,"Bear with me, hang in there and trust we have a very bright future in '06 and beyond."
Mark Shapiro,"Coco and Grady have similar skills, and we're extremely excited about Grady's future. Coco profiles best as a center fielder, which allowed us to be opportunistic and get a whole lot of value for him, which, in the end, was too much to turn down."
Mark Shapiro,"Hey, we're chasing the behemoths. I look up and watch Anaheim and the Yankees and Oakland, it's kind of funny. But shoot, Eric (Wedge, manager) is great at internalizing things."
Mark Shapiro,"It's funny now because, at the time, I was criticized for it being so far away. Our actual research back then suggested it was a very ambitious time frame. We were very fortunate to be able to do it. It's not easy to turn over an entire team."
Mark Shapiro,"Given the steady decline in hoops ratings and the doubling of our football inventory with the Western Athletic and Atlantic Coast Conferences, this was no longer in line with our strategy."
Mark Shapiro,I have mixed feelings. Charlie is a guy across the board that everybody here cares about deeply. But we're also excited about the opportunity he's gotten.
Mark Shapiro,"We are excited to add a veteran right-handed bat like Eduardo Perez. His experience, professionalism and knowledge will be a great compliment to this year's team."
Mark Shapiro,"We won't know until Monday night, but it's a realistic expectation."
Mark Shapiro,"To say we're contending with the Yankees and the A's was not our expectation coming into the season. If you told us our record would be 14, 15 games over .500, I would have said we'd be leading our division."
Mark Shapiro,The problem with ESPN2 is it doesn't have a signature event after the live events are over.
Mark Shapiro,"At Six Flags, our mission is to surround the best rides in the world with entertainment from the fields of music, theater, sports, film and television. We want to be about more than rides -- Six Flags must be about a wider, more fulfilling experience. We also look forward to recharging our broad relationship with Warner Bros. through such great brands as Looney Tunes and DC Comics."
Mark Shapiro,"He brings a positive energy and leadership qualities, even when he's off the field."
Mark Shapiro,"He's an energy player, and he can impact the game on both sides of the ball."
Mark Shapiro,"I doubt that Brandon will clear waivers, but it's not impossible."
Mark Shapiro,"I think he's made great progress from a year ago in his approach and plate discipline. The quality of his at-bats was significantly better. He's a guy that's coming. He needs to finish off some things offensively, but he's coming."
Mark Shapiro,You do everything you can to discipline yourself not to evaluate.
Mark Shapiro,He made great progress from a year ago in approach and plate discipline. The quality of his at-bats were significantly better.
Mark Shapiro,"The Colon trade was a decisive move, and every move after that was clearly in the direction of, rebuild with a foot on the accelerator, ... That's what it had been until maybe August last year. Everything since then has been, 'Let's see what we can do to try to finish off building the team within the constraints of the market.'"
Mark Shapiro,"We want to set the roster as early as we can. This year, the decisions are so few."
Mark Shapiro,"We're not looking to be judged along the way. We have certainly dealt with criticism, quite a bit of it, an extensive amount of it over the last three years, and we're making decisions that are in the best interest of the fans."
Mark Shapiro,I'm excited to see him do well in a meaningful game with the pressure of pitching for his country. We could not simulate that kind of atmosphere here.
Mark Shapiro,"While we are disappointed in Jason's lack of judgment and self-control, we will refrain from further comment out of respect to the judicial system."
Mark Shapiro,He didn't blink and how he handled that move mentally drove our confidence in making this offer.
Mark Shapiro,I love his demeanor and the way he carries himself. He plays with a great sense of presence and confidence.
Mark Shapiro,"Jason is a hard-nosed, tough player that compliments our lineup extremely well. He has always been a tough out while recording a high on-base percentage and has the ability to play all three outfield positions well."
Mark Shapiro,"There is a feeling of compassion for what Bob went through. Nobody wants to feel like they are not the number one choice. But it's not because we didn't like Bob. It was because we had the chance to get a multiple year guy. Bob was always an alternative for us, and one we feel good about."
Mark Shapiro,We've had a lot of conversations with a lot of people thus far. The key to this company is I think leveraging the media value of this company.
Mark Shapiro,"The company is debt- and asset-laden, so part of the strategy will be looking at the entire portfolio."
Mark Shapiro,"Obviously, this is a unique and significant commitment on behalf of ownership. Grady is one of our more unique guys. The level of commitment is distinct on both sides."
Mark Shapiro,"We will make a very competitive offer to Kevin Millwood, ... We will step beyond our comfort zone."
Mark Shapiro,He phoned us and told us that he was unhappy with his role on College GameDay . He felt that he was playing second fiddle.
Mark Shapiro,"He was unhappy with his role on 'College GameDay,'  ... He felt that he was playing second fiddle."
Mark Shapiro,"He's a high-character guy, and when he's healthy, he wins. I just thought he'd be a great fit here."
Mark Shapiro,"He's done the job before, he's versatile and he can play all three positions. His make-up fits the character of our team."
Mark Shapiro,"Character is very important to us, so to say we did an extensive background check on Jason would be an understatement. What we found is that he's a great teammate, he plays hard and is great in the clubhouse. We read the police report and talked to everyone involved. Our conclusion is we feel it was a mistake on Jason's part, but it's an isolated incident."
Mark Shapiro,"Character is very important to us, so to say we did an extensive background check on Jason would be an understatement. We read the police report and talked to everyone involved. We feel it was a mistake on Jason's part, but an isolated incident."
Mark Shapiro,"What makes poker work on television are the personalities, the players, their idiosyncrasies, their conversations, their body language, their humor. And darts has many of the same built-in factors. So we're gonna roll the dice."
Mark Shapiro,"What he can ultimately be is an everyday guy. He can benefit more as an everyday guy in Triple-A, but he could contribute [at the big-league level] during the year."
Mark Shapiro,There's not much not to believe. The fact we're having these conversations is a good sign for this franchise.
Mark Shapiro,"Do I believe our margin for error is tiny? Yes, it is tiny. Can we survive injuries like the larger market teams? No, we can't. But if you're a competitive person, you have to believe you can win to do this job."
Mark Shapiro,"When healthy, he's been one of the most effective relievers in baseball."
Mark Shapiro,"[ESPN2] doesn't have signature identity programming. After live events, it's void of 'SportsCenter,' 'Baseball Tonight,' 'Pardon the Interruption.' Shows that define a brand, ESPN2] currently lacks."
Mark Shapiro,"We're obviously not playing the kind of baseball we're capable of playing right now. But we've got 142 games to go. We're still .500 (10-10). It could be worse, but I think it will get better."
Mark Shapiro,"We're interested and we're waiting for a proposal from Major League Baseball. It's not going to generate the kind of excitement that World Cup soccer does, given the history and the equity just isn't there yet. But at least for this country, anything with the America's pastime and the American flag is sure to be a winning combination."
Mark Shapiro,Detroit's lineup is as deep as anyone's in baseball if those guys stay healthy and on the field.
Mark Shapiro,"At that point in my career, I didn't have an appreciation how difficult the transition is for young players to the big leagues. It's fortunate that everything's kind of broken right, that we've lived up to expectations. But that was a lofty expectation to place on the public here - no one's allowed me to forget that I gave that."
Mark Shapiro,We're not going to reach an agreement on a multi-year deal with Cliff. We'll look at it again next year. It will be more clear what his arbitration value will be. We couldn't reach a value on that right now.
Mark Shapiro,His options situation is not going to be an overriding factor. His long-term ability to help the team will be a bigger factor.
Mark Shapiro,We have a lot of versatile players. We have the ability to adjust. We have a lot of guys who could play a lot of positions.
Mark Shapiro,This club has the ability to have a better record than they have. This club has a chance to win a lot of games over the next two months and make it very interesting.
Natan Sharansky,"People may believe that there can be a society where dissent is not permitted, but which is nonetheless not a fear society because everyone agrees with one another and therefore no one wants to dissent."
Natan Sharansky,Will dissent be permitted? The answer to that question will determine whether the society is a free society or a fear society.
Natan Sharansky,"When we are unwilling to draw clear moral lines between free societies and fear societies, when we are unwilling to call the former good and the latter evil, we will not be able to advance the cause of peace because peace cannot be disconnected from freedom."
Natan Sharansky,"Unfortunately, little attention was paid to how Arafat ruled. In fact, some saw the harsh and repressive nature of Arafat's regime as actually bolstering the prospects for peace."
Natan Sharansky,To understand why dictators have a problem with making peace - or at least a genuine peace - the link between the nature of a regime and its external behavior must be understood.
Natan Sharansky,There were no dissidents then in the USSR because they were all killed.
Natan Sharansky,"The two most important things that can be done to promote democracy in the world is first, to bring moral clarity back to world affairs and second, to link international policies to the advance of democracy around the globe."
Natan Sharansky,"The three main sources of scepticism are first, that not every people desires freedom; second, that democracy in certain parts of the world would be dangerous; and third, that there is little the world's democracies can do to advance freedom outside their countries."
Natan Sharansky,"The only peace that can be made with a dictator is once that must be based on deterrence. For today, the dictator may be your friend, but tomorrow he will need you as an enemy."
Natan Sharansky,"Of course, there can be serious injustices within free societies."
Natan Sharansky,Non-democratic regimes always need to mobilize their people against external enemies in order to maintain internal stability.
Natan Sharansky,My optimism is not based primarily on the successful march of democracy in recent times but rather is based on the experience of having lived in a fear society and studied the mechanics of tyranny that sustain such a society.
Natan Sharansky,"Just as the sceptics were wrong then, I am convinced they are wrong now about the possibility of freedom spreading to the Middle East."
Natan Sharansky,"Just as the 99% of Soviet citizens who supported the Soviet regime in 1985 was no indication of what the people inside the USSR really thought, the army of true believers that we think we see in the Arab world is an illusion."
Natan Sharansky,"Japan is not a Western democracy. The Japanese have kept their traditions, culture and heritage, but they have joined the community of free nations."
Natan Sharansky,"It is important to remember that some of the most serious thinkers once thought that democracy was not compatible with the cultures of Germany, Italy, Japan, Latin America and Russia."
Natan Sharansky,"In contrast, fear societies are societies in which dissent is banned."
Natan Sharansky,I was inspired to write this book by those who are sceptical of the power of freedom to change the world.
Natan Sharansky,"I am optimistic that peace can be achieved in the region because I believe that every society on earth can be free and that if freedom comes to the Middle East, there can be peace."
Natan Sharansky,Free societies are societies in which the right of dissent is protected.
Natan Sharansky,"By helping readers understand these mechanics, I hope they will appreciate why freedom is for everyone, why it is essential for our security and why the free world plays a critically important role in advancing democracy around the globe."
Natan Sharansky,"By focusing once and for all on helping the Palestinians build a free society, I have no doubt that an historic compromise between Israelis and Palestinians can be reached and that peace can prevail."
Natan Sharansky,"But by having a right to dissent and having institutions which protect that right, free societies also have mechanisms to correct those abuses."
Natan Sharansky,"Believe me, the drug of freedom is universally potent."
Natan Sharansky,"Because of human diversity - different tastes, ambitions, interests, backgrounds, experiences, etc. - differences of opinion will be inevitable."
Natan Sharansky,"Can someone within that society walk into the town square and say what they want without fear of being punished for his or her views? If so, then that society is a free society. If not, it is a fear society."
Maria Sharapova,She's an experienced player. I have to move on and there are so many things I have to work on.
Maria Sharapova,"I haven't played a lot of matches, so I'm just trying to get used to the conditions, the stadium, the wind, playing under the lights for the first time in a while. When you're out for a little while, first match you're a little tentative. The injury, you don't know how it's going to be. So far it's OK."
Maria Sharapova,"As a player, I want to know that line calls are as accurate as technology will allow. In that sense, today's announcement is great news for all players."
Maria Sharapova,"It would be great. Of course I was disappointed last year, but I know I'll get the support again this year, and I'm going to get my revenge."
Maria Sharapova,"I knew I had to be consistent against her. That's her biggest strength, being consistent. She's not going to overpower me on the court. She's just going to try to make me hit another ball. I thought I did that really well. I took my opportunities, took my chances, and that was important."
Maria Sharapova,"The fact you are No. 1, it just puts a smile on your face,"
Maria Sharapova,"The injury gave me some good time to work on my strength and physical form, ... I'm still doing physical therapy and strengthening, and it feels good."
Maria Sharapova,I've been playing against older and stronger competition my whole life. It has made me a better tennis player and able to play against this kind of level despite their strength and experience.
Maria Sharapova,"I'm not the next anyone, I'm the first Maria Sharapova."
Maria Sharapova,"I'm just like every other girl who likes to shop, likes to look good, likes to spend time with friends."
Maria Sharapova,I learned there's a big difference between juniors and the pros.
Maria Sharapova,"I don't follow other players or the tournaments they play. I have my own schedule and do my own thing. I never really think, 'Oh, I want to be or play like so-and-so.' I just like being myself."
Maria Sharapova,A great tennis career is something that a 15-year-old normally doesn't have. I hope my example helps other teens believe they can accomplish things they never thought possible.
Maria Sharapova,Sometimes I feel my arm is like a swan's neck - so weak.
Maria Sharapova,"Well, fans always root for the underdog."
Maria Sharapova,"There was a lot of rustiness, ... The first match (after a layoff) is always tough. You practice hard and work on a lot of things, but the actual competition is totally different. I was just trying to get in a groove, get my feet wet."
Maria Sharapova,"I'll be seeing headlines: Maria can't get past the semis; Maria can't last the third set, I think it was a good match. I didn't come in the best prepared ... without many matches, to be able to play the quality of tennis I was able to play today is a big plus."
Maria Sharapova,"You can be playing great tennis the past week, you come out and no matter how good you might have been playing, the level of tennis goes down the drain simply because of the wind."
Maria Sharapova,"When I had the opportunity to win, I did. But I think I will play better. If I keep improving I definitely feel confident I can win it again."
Maria Sharapova,"I played well today, ... I started off strong but then I made a few mistakes and she capitalized. She's a good player and has a strong return. I just tried to play my game and in the end I got the win."
Maria Sharapova,"It's very unfortunate. She played unbelievable tennis, the best I've seen her play. She played basically out of her mind in the second set, and it was so close in the third set."
Maria Sharapova,"I love to look elegant and this dress is very light and cool, ... The best thing about tennis is that you can wear cute little dresses and express your individuality."
Maria Sharapova,"I wouldn't say I'm in love with [the extra inches. Because if I wear heels, I'm like 6-4. It's a little too tall."
Maria Sharapova,Today was probably one of the hottest days I've ever experienced in my life. It was pretty brutal out there.
Maria Sharapova,"But it's about being in those situations and learning from them and although I've played a lot of matches already in my life, I'm still pretty young and have a lot to learn. But I am learning and I think you can see that."
Maria Sharapova,"I hope everything will be all right, though when the tournament starts it may be different, but so far it's all right."
Maria Sharapova,"I think at some point I may be able to dominate, but honesty, I don't think I'm physically there yet and I don't want to go out there and say I am, when I'm really not."
Maria Sharapova,"I'm very happy to win the inaugural title,"
Maria Sharapova,"I wanted to say that I am happy for this win, ... But now I just want to say that I am sad for Milagros. I wish her the best, and I want her to know that she should be very proud of the great week she had."
Maria Sharapova,"I wanted to say that I am happy for this win. But now I just want to say that I am sad for Milagros. I wish her the best, and I want her to know that she should be very proud of the great week she had."
Maria Sharapova,"I hope to be able to play (the Gold Coast) in 2007, and will be doing everything possible in consultation with my doctors to be healthy enough to play this Australian Open."
Maria Sharapova,"Oh God, I don't know what I'm doing here right now, ... I'm so excited to be in the semis, it's an amazing feeling."
Maria Sharapova,"I'm so excited to be here, to be one of the top eight girls, ... It's great to be playing where the (Los Angeles) Lakers play. You just feel the excitement. I know I went out there and played my game. I was on."
Maria Sharapova,The first three games was a little bit tough. I haven't played a lot of matches. I had to get used to the conditions in the stadium. I haven't played under the lights for a while.
Maria Sharapova,"The first few games were a little bit tough getting used to the conditions, ... I haven't played a lot of matches. Then after a while you can really go after it. I feel a lot stronger in my arm. I move quite well. I don't think I have moved that well in quite a while."
Maria Sharapova,I know that in a few years when I do improve little things in my game by one or two percent that I will get better.
Maria Sharapova,She's very young and has a great future.
Maria Sharapova,"But in the future, dominating is something I would like, but I'm still not where I need to be physically or with my game."
Maria Sharapova,"The first few games I was serving 69 miles per hour, ... It's pretty funny. I think it's even funnier from TV because they can't see the wind. These people probably think we look like beginners. That's the sad part."
Maria Sharapova,"The funny thing was, he started clapping for me after that. I think he got scared. Then when I was waving to that side (after winning), he's like."
Maria Sharapova,What I do best is compete. This is just something I do for fun.
Maria Sharapova,"She's got a lot of fighting spirit out there, ... I was very proud of myself for being able to win that game. It was a very tough one."
Maria Sharapova,"I wasn't fighting out there in the second set, ... I wasn't the Maria you usually see, fighting for every single point."
Maria Sharapova,"In the second set, mentally I wasn't there and I didn't have any motivation. I wasn't fighting, I basically gave up."
Maria Sharapova,I wasn't fighting out there in the second set. It was like I was giving it up. But it gives me confidence I can pull out a win like that.
Maria Sharapova,"It wasn't the Maria that you usually see fighting out there. I was just kind of down and said, `Hey, you've got to get back to work now.'"
Maria Sharapova,In the second set I could have fought a little harder. I didn't have the fighting sprit that I usually have.
Maria Sharapova,"It's disappointing but no hard feelings, ... I know you can't win everything and you're going to lose sometimes. I'll go home and train now and get ready for the U.S. Open."
Maria Sharapova,I love Miami. There's a lot of entertainment going on. Some of the tournaments on the tour are pretty boring. This isn't one of them.
Maria Sharapova,"I put extra pressure on her second serve and I was in control on most points,"
Maria Sharapova,"I thought I played really well, ... I was in control for most of the match."
Maria Sharapova,"It comes on unexpectedly from day to day and I can't control it, ... I'm not a player who goes on court without intending to finish a match. It's bad enough to have to withdraw before you play, but to retire during a match is even more disappointing."
Maria Sharapova,It gives me a lot of confidence that I can pull out a win like that when there are points in the match where you don't feel great.
Maria Sharapova,We've had such tough matches and I've been able to pull through three in a row - it's a confidence boost.
Maria Sharapova,"I want to play for Russia, I definitely want to play for Russia in Fed Cup competition,"
Maria Sharapova,"I go there to play and would like to play against strong opponents. I always enjoy high-level competition,"
Maria Sharapova,"You practice hard and work on a lot of things, but the actual competition is totally different. I was just trying to get in a groove."
Maria Sharapova,"That's makes it even tougher but that's what it's all about. That's why we're here, for the competition. I love it when it gets tough."
Maria Sharapova,Iâ€™ve been playing against older and stronger competition my whole life. It has made me a better tennis player and able to play against this kind of level despite their strength and experience.
Maria Sharapova,"I had only myself as company, ... It just made me tougher."
Maria Sharapova,It's hard to get going when your body isn't there and your mind is on your pillow.
Maria Sharapova,"In the beginning of the match I wanted to dictate from the first point, I think it was very important. In the second set obviously it was very tough, but I was able to finish it off."
Maria Sharapova,"I thought it was too easy in the beginning,"
Maria Sharapova,"I definitely feel Russian inside, even when I'm in America I feel Russian,"
Maria Sharapova,She was picking the ball up early. She used my pace and the quickness of the court to her advantage and came up with some very good shots.
Maria Sharapova,"When the points started getting longer and longer, I felt that she had the advantage."
Maria Sharapova,I felt really good. It feels good to get back into action. It's good to be back on the court competing. That's where I belong.
Maria Sharapova,"It would be an amazing achievement,"
Maria Sharapova,It's an amazing achievement. That's all I really can say.
Ariel Sharon,"deepening its involvement in incitement, violence and terror."
Ariel Sharon,there is no link between the end of violence and the question of the settlements. That issue has to be discussed later on between the parties.
Ariel Sharon,"My own personal safety doesn't affect me and doesn't affect my plans,"
Ariel Sharon,"The situation is not simple, ... You have to see the whole picture. That responsibility is on my shoulders. I want to tell you restraint is an element of strength."
Ariel Sharon,"To my regret, as long as terror continues we shall not be able to move forward as we would have wished,"
Ariel Sharon,"a better peace, a realistic peace, a different way."
Ariel Sharon,concessions in exchange for peace.
Ariel Sharon,I'm glad we are working together to achieve peace.
Ariel Sharon,"elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror."
Ariel Sharon,"The ongoing conflict between us has caused heavy suffering to both peoples. The future can and must be different. Both our peoples are destined to live together side by side, on this small piece of land. This reality we cannot change."
Ariel Sharon,"In my talks with the prime minister I discovered that he's not prepared to abandon the Camp David ideas, and I cannot be a partner to such a policy, ... Just imagine and think how much graver our situation would be if the old city of Jerusalem were for the most part handed over to the Palestinians according to the Camp David ideas."
Ariel Sharon,"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: /A time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted; /A time to break down and a time to build upâ€¦"
Ariel Sharon,shares in the grief of the U.S. administration and expresses its condolences to the American people.
Ariel Sharon,"Someone tampered with the electricity and the microphone was cut off,"
Ariel Sharon,"The United States has stood beside us in difficult days and I think it is our duty to help it with whatever we are able to help,"
Ariel Sharon,"We desire a life living side-by-side, in understanding and peace. We have no desire to rule over you. We have no desire to run your affairs."
Ariel Sharon,"We have already paid an international price for the delay in these negotiations,"
Ariel Sharon,They are acts of self-defense against the same forces of evil and darkness bent on destroying civilized society.
Ariel Sharon,"Most of the conversation was about Gaza. What happens in Gaza is, to their mind, what will dictate the future of the peace process,"
Ariel Sharon,commitment does not stand anymore.
Ariel Sharon,"I believe that we can live together with the Palestinians, ... I came here to the holiest place of the Jewish people in order to see what happens here and really to have the feeling of how we need to move forward. There was no provocation here."
Ariel Sharon,"There cannot be any peace with a dictatorial, corrupt and tyrannical regime. This has to be a different authority,"
Ariel Sharon,"The Prime Minister's Office and the Defense Ministry have no knowledge whatsoever of an alleged approval to build 3,000 dwelling units in Ariel and we really don't know where this number comes from,"
Ariel Sharon,"I have seen the wars, the battles, the agony, ... I would like to reach an agreement. I am ready to dedicate several years to that."
Ariel Sharon,There has to be total agreement between the prime minister and me.
Ariel Sharon,"Once free of terror, we can move forward to implement the Tenet cease-fire agreement."
Ariel Sharon,"The government which I head will not conduct negotiations on a peace agreement under fire, or under terror,"
Ariel Sharon,"I personally don't believe we can reach, at the present time, a permanent agreement."
Ariel Sharon,"That would lead to a number of issues. We would lose a number of achievements that we have received. I say very clearly, first, whoever votes for the plan, supports me, whoever votes against the plan, votes against me."
Isadore Sharp,We work on the policy that we already provide the best level of service and amenities to all of our guests.
Isadore Sharp,"The tsunami forced our Resort to close, putting hundreds out of work at the moment when they needed income most as they started to rebuild their lives and communities. We couldn't let that happen.

Robert Sheckley,"So I wrote what I hoped would be science fiction, I was not at all sure if what I wrote would be acceptable even. But I don't say that I consciously wrote with humour. Humour is a part of you that comes out."
Robert Sheckley,"So I try to stick with the structure, make the sentences work, and not to follow one sentence of 114 words with another of the same length."
Robert Sheckley,Science fiction is very healthy in its form.
Robert Sheckley,"Once you find you can't walk as far and as fast as you were able, life becomes more complicated."
Robert Sheckley,"It takes me a long time to get with a landscape. It took me 20 years before I wrote anything about Ibiza, and I haven't written about Oregon yet, although I've been there 20 years - possibly I'm almost due."
Robert Sheckley,I've always thought of absurdism as a French fad I'd like to belong to.
Robert Sheckley,"I'm quite influenced in this by one of my heroes, Montaigne, who thought a man's real task was to render as honest an account of himself as he could."
Robert Sheckley,"I'm not too fond of the hard work and the constant battle with self-doubt that goes on when I write, but I figure that's part of the territory."
Robert Sheckley,I'm not so interested any more in how a great deal of science fiction goes. It goes into things like Star Wars and Star Trek which all go excellent in their own way.
Robert Sheckley,"I would like to do a novel where some curse turns that into how the world really is - a blessing or a curse, I don't know which."
Robert Sheckley,I was never able to write seriously about heroes because I was very aware that I was not one and that in my background there was not this heroic thing.
Robert Sheckley,I was forever reading outside of the field as well as in it.
Robert Sheckley,"I think it can be quite impossible to think well of yourself, so I prefer not to think about that too much. But I am very pleased, obviously."
Robert Sheckley,I sell well now in Russia. I remember one signing in Russia some years ago where the bookstore had two strongmen to hold the crowds back.
Robert Sheckley,I like to think that I have no single view nor any single situation that I think things arrive from. I try to give examples of what I think are interesting questions for me.
Robert Sheckley,I knew I was doing something right because it was selling so I didn't want to interfere with it.
Robert Sheckley,I have never been a critic of science fiction as a whole.
Robert Sheckley,I don't much like to look back with the idea that I was doing it wrong then or I'm doing it wrong now.
Robert Sheckley,"I don't finish every story, but I probably write and send out three out of five of them."
Robert Sheckley,I do think that short story writing is often a matter of luck.
Robert Sheckley,I am very pleased and perhaps a little surprised also because I don't think one knows the extent of one's own work or the acceptance of it.
Robert Sheckley,Ethical and questions of philosophy interest me a great deal.
Robert Sheckley,"But science perhaps is very difficult without faith. Also there is no simple way of saying now we have science, we don't need faith anymore."
Robert Sheckley,"As far as the mechanics go, working with other people on received ideas was for me a very interesting technical problem. I can't say that any of my collaborations engaged my heart, but they engaged the craftsman in me."
Robert Sheckley,A novel is often a longer process in handling self-doubt.
Robert Sheckley,"A lot of us don't want to be quite that serious about world problems. Our life is there to enjoy, not to be an eternal dissident, eternally unhappy with how things are and with the state of mankind."
Wilfrid Sheed,One reason the human race has such a low opinion of itself is that it gets so much of its wisdom from writers.
Wilfrid Sheed,Every writer is a writer of the generation before.
Wilfrid Sheed,The American male doesn't mature until he has exhausted all other possibilities.
Wilfrid Sheed,I picked up the writing on the very day he died. It was the only consolation I could find.
Kevin Sheedy,We've got to get back to learning to win.
Kevin Sheedy,It has been great to work with someone that has such a terrific knowledge and understanding of the game that has shone through in his preparation for each and every match we played.
Kevin Sheedy,"It's good to see hard work getting rewarded and I've got no doubt Seven and Ten, they won?t drop the baton."
Cindy Sheehan,I agree with her quest for the truth. She has been able to say he lied in such a poignant way. Her â€™emperor has no clothes' story really appeals to me.
Cindy Sheehan,"I never said I speak for them, ... I speak for myself."
Cindy Sheehan,It's a peace route now.
Cindy Sheehan,galvanized the peace movement.
Cindy Sheehan,recoiling from the agony of a bereaved mother â€¦
Cindy Sheehan,I know how Cindy Sheehan feels. I'm a mother too.
Cindy Sheehan,"I'll be a grieving mom until I die because of the lies that took my son, ... I plan on keeping this up until the troops are brought home."
Cindy Sheehan,"I now know he's sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis,"
Cindy Sheehan,I think their use of force was pretty excessive for someone that didn't have a permit.
Cindy Sheehan,That's democracy. He should be doing the will of the people.
Cindy Sheehan,wrapping herself in the courage of her son Casey...
Cindy Sheehan,"It's not patriotism when you say my country, right or wrong,"
Cindy Sheehan,He was very proud to serve for his country and to help the people of Iraq. [It is] very strong in our hearts what our country is doing for Iraq.
Cindy Sheehan,"The president says he feels compassion for me, but the best way to show that compassion is by meeting with me and the other mothers and families who are here, ... Our sons made the ultimate sacrifice and we want answers. All we're asking is that he sacrifice an hour out of his five-week vacation to talk to us, before the next mother loses her son in Iraq."
Cindy Sheehan,"The president says he feels compassion for me, but the best way to show that compassion is by meeting with me and the other mothers and families who are here. All we're asking is that he sacrifice an hour out of his five-week vacation to talk to us, before the next mother loses her son in Iraq."
Cindy Sheehan,These so-called women have no maternal instinct or compassion for the people that their policies have killed.
Cindy Sheehan,"Shame on you, ... How many more of other people's children are you willing to sacrifice?"
Cindy Sheehan,"We mean business, George Bush, ... and we're going to go to Congress and we're going to ask them, 'How many more of other people's children are you willing to sacrifice for the lies?' And we're going to say, 'Shame on you. Shame on you for giving him the authority to invade Iraq.'"
Cindy Sheehan,"You're taking away our freedoms. The Iraqi people aren't freer, they're much worse off than before you meddled in their country."
Cindy Sheehan,We really need to stop the imperialist tendencies of countries like the United States and Great Britain.
Cindy Sheehan,I'm just so honored that the universe chose me to be the spark that has set off a raging inferno.
Cindy Sheehan,"My son was killed in 2004. I am not paying my taxes for 2004. You killed my son, George Bush, and I don't owe you a penny."
Cindy Sheehan,I've always admired President Chavez for standing up to imperialism and the meddling of the American government in South America.
Cindy Sheehan,Blame America First crowd.
Cindy Sheehan,"Everyone in America should be appalled that that many were killed. What's more obscene, me wearing the number, or that there is a number at all? My son is one of those numbers."
Cindy Sheehan,This is the people's America and I think we are taking it back.
Cindy Sheehan,"I think it's going to be an amazing opportunity for the people of America to show their elected officials we mean business when we say we want our troops home,"
Cindy Sheehan,One of the bogus reasons that George Bush gives for this invasion (and) occupation of Iraq is to make America safer -- and Katrina exposed that clearly he has made America more vulnerable through his policies in Iraq.
George Sheehan,"The more I run, the more I want to run, and the more I live a life conditioned and influenced and fashioned by my running. And the more I run, the more certain I am that I am heading for my real goal: to become the person I am."
George Sheehan,"There are those of us who are always about to live. We are waiting until things change, until there is more time, until we are less tired, until we get a promotion, until we settle down -- until, until, until. It always seems as if there is some major event that must occur in our lives before we begin living."
George Sheehan,"We may think there is willpower involved, but more likely… change is due to want power. Wanting the new addiction more than the old one. Wanting the new me in preference to the person I am now."
George Sheehan,Happiness is different from pleasure. Happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing.
George Sheehan,Exercise is done against one's wishes and maintained only because the alternative is worse
George Sheehan,Anything that changes your values changes your behavior.
George Sheehan,The mind's first step to self-awareness must be through the body.
George Sheehan,"If you want to win anything -- a race, your self, your life -- you have to go a little berserk."
Neil Sheehan,You have to look at the broader perspective here. Before companies even submit applications (for license renewal) they have to do a tremendous amount of advance work.
Neil Sheehan,"The risk significance is low in terms of public health and safety, ... We're talking about a small amount of water. We're doing a special investigation because we want to make sure that (Entergy) has their hands around the extent of the cracking, the extent of the leakage, and determine exactly where this moisture originated."
Neil Sheehan,"The NRC looks at on-site response and (Federal Emergency Management Agency) evaluates the off-site response, ... The exercise is designed to make sure the emergency plans are capable of doing the job. The plan is a living document that needs to constantly be evaluated and upgraded."
Neil Sheehan,"You remember all those phrases about how these people - Asians - don't value human life like we do. Well if you spend any time around them, you discover that they love their children just as much as we love ours. That is certainly true of the Vietnamese."
Neil Sheehan,"We thought that whatever we wanted to do was right and good, simply because we were Americans, and we would succeed at it because we were Americans."
Neil Sheehan,"People talked to me in a way I think they would not have talked to somebody who hadn't shared the experience; they gave me their papers, they gave me their diaries. I found people constantly opening up to me. And I think they did because I had shared that experience with them."
Neil Sheehan,Just because you put higher-octane gasoline in your car doesn't mean you can break the speed limit. The speed limit's still 65.
Neil Sheehan,"I think you have to remember that Americans saw their purpose as so innately good that they could excuse the pain they would inflict on others to carry out those purposes. Because the purposes were so good, they would justify this pain we were inflicting on other people."
Fulton Sheen,Pride is an admission of weakness; it secretly fears all competition and dreads all rivals.
Fulton Sheen,"Leisure is a form of silence, not noiselessness. It is the silence of contemplation such as occurs when we let our minds rest on a rosebud, a child at play, a Divine mystery, or a waterfall."
Fulton Sheen,"The proud man counts his newspaper clippings, the humble man his blessings."
Fulton Sheen,Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.
Fulton Sheen,Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery.
Fulton Sheen,The simple shepherds heard the voice of an angel and found their Lamb; the wise men saw the light of a star and found their Wisdom.
Fulton Sheen,"You should realize that the community with which you deal is not the one of 42nd Street and Broadway, or Hollywood and Vine. These are the crusts on the great American sandwich. The meat is in between."
Fulton Sheen,An atheist is a man who has no invisible means of support.
Gary Sheffield,"I tell him the truth. I just tell him how it looks - how he looks: 'Dude, you look like an addict.' But he doesn't see it."
Gary Sheffield,"So I think he did it on purpose,"
Gary Sheffield,We're showing more enthusiasm now.
Gary Sheffield,"I don't want anybody to take my kindness as a weakness. Like I said before, this is where I want to be, but don't test me. It never was a done deal. It was a possibility. I'm happy about that. But there's two sides to that. On one side, I trust you, but don't play me. I don't care who it is, if it's the Boss, if it's him, don't play me. There are plenty of other teams out there that want my services ... that's the bottom line."
Gary Sheffield,"Well, everybody is trying to make this a money thing. If you send me to another team, let's see what I ask for. I won't ask for nothing. I'll play under the same terms. So it is not Gary wants more money. Gary has money. What else do I need?"
Gary Sheffield,The owners have the right to pay you whatever they want to. They don't have to pay you if they don't want to.
Gary Sheffield,I trust no one totally.
Richard Shelby,What we've got to do is find the truth.
Richard Shelby,Technology-driven proposals promoting electronic delivery of proxy materials and the use of interactive data will empower shareholders to make better informed investment decisions.
Richard Shelby,"This is perhaps just the tip of an iceberg. We need security at our national labs. ... It has been too loose, too long, and it's too important,"
Richard Shelby,"Everywhere, including the United States, will be at risk."
Richard Shelby,"Otherwise the taxpayer is going to ultimately underwrite everybody's risk,"
Richard Shelby,"I believe he will enforce the law without prejudice,"
Richard Shelby,"There were more failures of intelligence on his watch as director of the CIA than any other [director of Central Intelligence] in our history, ... I have long felt that, while an honorable man, he lacked the critical leadership necessary for our intelligence community to effectively operate, particularly in the post-9/11 world."
Richard Shelby,big failures of intelligence.
Richard Shelby,"It leads you to ask the question: Was it politically expedient not to pursue information like this? Should it have been pursued in earlier years? Should it have been pursued before now? I'd say yes,"
Richard Shelby,"I am disappointed that the Air Force did not choose Selma as the site for their Introductory Flight Training program. I believe Selma is an excellent location for IFT, as it meets all the education and training requirements set forth by the Air Force."
Richard Shelby,The American people fear there is some gouging going on.
Richard Shelby,"I think what you will see as these hearings come on and information dribbles out is a failure, big time, in communication between the agencies, ... We have to do better."
Richard Shelby,"We cannot cut and run. If we are to ensure freedom and democracy, it is essential that we follow through on our obligation to bring about stability in Iraq."
Richard Shelby,"I would like to know how it could take us 10 years, dozens of lives, numerous lawsuits, substantial consumer complaints, tire replacements overseas and repeated expressions of concern by an insurance company before any action was taken to initiate an investigation into the safety of a product being used by millions of American families. Simply put - the American people deserve better."
Richard Shelby,shows that the FBI and the other agencies of the intelligence community must remain vigilant.
Richard Shelby,"I share the president's commitment to bolstering the American economy, and I support his plan for targeted tax relief."
Richard Shelby,We must also look for ways to reduce mandatory spending which comprises more than two-thirds of the federal budget.
Richard Shelby,"I believe it is a strong bill,"
Richard Shelby,"I believe before they do anything substantive down there to rebuild, really rebuild, they should strengthen those levees ... otherwise, with hurricanes coming along, we could be right where we started,"
Richard Shelby,"I am changing parties to a party of hope for America, not a party of dependency,"
Sidney Sheldon,"On 'Jeannie' it said 'Created by Sidney Sheldon, written by Sidney Sheldon.' It was like an ego trip,"
Sidney Sheldon,Writing novels is the most exciting.
Sidney Sheldon,"In a novel, on the other hand, you not only have to describe the rooms, but the clothes, the characters and what they are thinking. It's a much more in-depth process."
Sidney Sheldon,"If there is any secret to my success, I think it's that my characters are very real to me. I feel everything they feel, and therefore I think my readers care about them."
Sidney Sheldon,I worked in Hollywood as a reader and a would-be writer for about 6 years before I sold my first story.
Sidney Sheldon,I will not write about anyplace in the world unless I've been there to personally research it.
Sidney Sheldon,"I wanted to make sure that the man who found the genie would not take terrible advantage of her, so he needed to be a person of integrity and honor - which is why I made the male lead an astronaut. The rest, as they say, is history."
Sidney Sheldon,"I think that's because believable action is based on authenticity, and accuracy is very important to me. I always spend time researching my novels, exploring the customs and attitudes of the county I'm using for their setting."
Sidney Sheldon,"I admire people who are, by nature, kind and fair to others."
Sidney Sheldon,Don't give up. There are too many nay-sayers out there who will try to discourage you. Don't listen to them. The only one who can make you give up is yourself.
Sidney Sheldon,"Another woman approached me while I was having lunch at the Russian Tea Room in New York and told me that the reason she had become a lawyer was because she had read Rage of Angels. To me, that kind of feedback has more meaning than any sales figures."
Sidney Sheldon,"Abraham Lincoln because he was a man filled with great compassion who believed that all men are created free and equal, and was not afraid to stand on that platform. The way Lincoln lived his life has served me well in mine."
Sidney Sheldon,What I do is put my characters into situations that are so precarious there is no way to get out. And then I figure how to get them out.
Sidney Sheldon,"When people tell me I've kept them up all night, I feel like I've succeeded."
Sidney Sheldon,"Usually, when people get to the end of a chapter, they close the book and go to sleep. I deliberately write a book so when the reader gets to the end of the chapter, he or she must turn one more page."
Sidney Sheldon,"My heroes are those who risk their lives every day to protect our world and make it a better place - police, firefighters and members of our armed forces."
Sidney Sheldon,I try to give both my heroes and villains an emotional dimensionality which provides the motivation for their actions.
Sidney Sheldon,I love the freedom that the narrative form provides.
Sidney Sheldon,Women's value has been under-recognized for far too long.
Sidney Sheldon,"When you write a movie, you have a hundred collaborators. But when you write a novel, it's yours."
Sidney Sheldon,Try to leave the Earth a better place than when you arrived.
Sidney Sheldon,There's this sense of excitement because you invent and control the characters. You decide whether they live or die. I find this type of creative process tremendously stimulating.
Sidney Sheldon,"The thing that made Groucho special was the way he used his body parts. He also had a wicked tongue. People didn't realize it, but when Groucho said something, he meant it."
Sidney Sheldon,The part of my writing I find the most rewarding is when people write to me or speak to me in public to tell me how his or her life has been changed by my books.
Sidney Sheldon,The fact that my female characters have strong personalities but are also physically attractive probably reflects the women I've known in my life.
Sidney Sheldon,"The Dalai Lama. He is a very wise man of great inner peace who believes that happiness is the purpose of our lives. Through his teachings and leadership, he continues to make this world a better place in which to live."
Sidney Sheldon,"Talent is a gift that can be given, and it can be taken away. We have to appreciate that."
Sidney Sheldon,"Stories had always been told about male genies coming out of bottles, but they were usually fat, old men. Never had the genie been a gorgeous woman, so that idea really appealed to me, and I created the series based on that premise."
Sidney Sheldon,I think people throughout the world identify with my characters.
Sidney Sheldon,I go to great lengths to make certain situations feel right to the reader.
Sidney Sheldon,"I always spend time exploring the customs and attitudes of the countries I'm using for locations, and interviewing the people who live there. I've visited over 90 countries thus far."
Rupert Sheldrake,"Well, natural selection was an idea that Darwin developed by analogy with conscious human selection. That's where he got the idea from."
Rupert Sheldrake,"Well, I'm always hoping to hear from interested chemists and protein chemists, because I'd love for these experiments to be done properly."
Rupert Sheldrake,There's a certain kind of scepticism that can't bear uncertainty.
Rupert Sheldrake,"The point of what I'm doing is to talk not about science backed up by hundreds of committees, thousands of professors, and many tons of textbooks."
Rupert Sheldrake,"The mechanistic theory of nature is a theory of nature, and one that I think is wrong, or at least too limited. It's not an eternal truth."
Rupert Sheldrake,"The idea is that there is a kind of memory in nature. Each kind of thing has a collective memory. So, take a squirrel living in New York now. That squirrel is being influenced by all past squirrels."
Rupert Sheldrake,"Right now, any opinion anyone has about whether dogs can or cannot really tell when their owner is coming home by some unknown means... nobody knows. The weight of evi dence suggests they can."
Rupert Sheldrake,"Of the seven experiments, the ones that have been most investigated so far have been the pets. The dogs who know when their masters for coming home, and the sense of being stared at."
Rupert Sheldrake,"Now the whole point about machines is they are designed not to be random. When you call up a word processing program on your computer, you don't want it to be different every time you call it up. You want it to stay the same."
Rupert Sheldrake,Most of nature is inherently chaotic. It's not rigidly determined in the old sense. It's not rigidly predictable.
Rupert Sheldrake,"I'm talking about science on the leading edge, where it's not clear which way things are going be cause we don't know, and I'm dealing with areas which we don't know about."
Rupert Sheldrake,Because a truly skeptical position would be a very uncertain one.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"January gray is here, like a sexton by her grave; February bears the bier, march with grief doth howl and rave, and April weeps - but, O ye hours! Follow with May's fairest flowers."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,Love is free; to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed; such a vow in both cases excludes us from all inquiry
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"The good want power, but to weep barren tears. The powerful goodness want: worse need for them. The wise want love; and those who love want wisdom; And all good things are thus confused with ill."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,The pleasure that is in sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,It is impossible that had Buonaparte descended from a race of vegetable feeders that he could have had either the inclination or the power to ascend the throne of the Bourbons.

Percy Bysshe Shelley,Only nature knows how to justly proportion to the fault the punishment it deserves.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"All things are sold: the very light of heaven is venal; earth's unsparing gifts of love, the smallest and most despicable things that lurk in the abysses of the deep, all objects of our life, even life itself, and the poor pittance which the laws allow of liberty, the fellowship of man, those duties which his heart of human love should urge him to perform instinctively, are bought and sold as in a public mart of not disguising selfishness, that sets on each its price, the stamp-mark of her reign."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"All Love is sweet. Given or returned. Common as light is love, And its familiar voice wearies not ever."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,Love is free; to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed; such a vow in both cases excludes us from all inquiry.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,To be omnipotent but friendless is to reign.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,There is no real wealth but the labor of man.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"A wild dissolving bliss Over my frame he breathed, approaching near, And bent his eyes of kindling tenderness Near mine, and on my lips impressed a lingering kiss,"

Percy Bysshe Shelley,"I have drunken deep of joy, And I will taste no other wine tonight"
Percy Bysshe Shelley,The great instrument of moral good is the imagination.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,To hope till Hope creates from its own wreck the thing it contemplates.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,Cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.

Percy Bysshe Shelley,The soul's joy lies in doing.

Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Winter is come and gone,But grief returns with the revolving year."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Government is an evil; it is only the thoughtlessness and vices of men that make it a necessary evil. When all men are good and wise, government will of itself decay."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Is it not odd that the only generous person I ever knew, who had money to be generous with, should be a stockbroker."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,The gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Their errors have been weighed and found to have been dust in the balance; if their sins were as scarlet, they are now white as snow: they have been washed in the blood of the mediator and the redeemer, Time."

Percy Bysshe Shelley,Man's yesterday may never be like his morrow; Nought may endure but Mutability.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Man who man would be, must rule the empire of himself."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"First our pleasures die - and then our hopes, and then our fears - and when these are dead, the debt is due dust claims dust - and we die too"
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"All love is sweet, Given or returned. Common as light is love, And its familiar voice wearies not ever. They who inspire is most are fortunate, As I am now: but those who feel it most Are happier still."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,The odious and disgusting aristocracy of wealth is built upon the ruins of all that is good in chivalry or republicanism; and luxury is the forerunner of a barbarism scarcely capable of cure.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Concerning God, freewill and destiny: Of all that earth has been or yet may be, all that vain men imagine or believe, or hope can paint or suffering may achieve, we descanted."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"When my cats aren't happy, I'm not happy. Not because I care about their mood but because I know they're just sitting there thinking up ways to get even."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"A husband and wife ought to continue united so long as they love each other. Any law which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny, and the most unworthy of toleration."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,"We look before and after, And pine for what is not; Our sincerest laughter With some pain is fraught; Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought."
Percy Bysshe Shelley,Nothing wilts faster than laurels that have been rested upon.

Percy Bysshe Shelley,History is a cyclic poem written by time upon the memories of man.
Kirk Shelmerdine,"Without a big corporate deal it was hard to pull off. People jumped in and helped like the Lopez family. ... They paid the whole tire bill, but I don't think they want us to talk about that. They are some devoted Dale Sr. fans."
Kirk Shelmerdine,"This is one of the big tracks every little boy dreams about racing cars on. I've had opportunities to come here and try to qualify several years in a row now, and it really feels good to be able to finally pull it off."
Kirk Shelmerdine,This is one of those tracks that every little boy dreams about racing cars on. It really feels good to finally be able to pull it off.
Kirk Shelmerdine,"There were 58 cars here, so I guess we had one-in-58 odds, but really it was a lot taller than that. Really, you don't have a prayer. ... A combination of everything did it for us."
Angela Shelton,"Marcus Allen (Former NFL running back) contributed a lot and told me to 'walk by faith and not sight.' I didn't know what it meant at the time, ... And Rosie O'Donnell paid my mortgage while I was on the road filming. They were all so helpful."
Angela Shelton,"I thought this would be a cute little film about meeting people with your same name, ...  I would shoot it during the summer and then start on my comedy."

I could have sold it to a studio, who wanted to make it into a film starring Julia Roberts, but they would have been the ones making the money, not the people who need it."
Bobby Shelton,"I'm a little set back. I had no idea they were looking at retirement. I thought it would stay around for many, many years kind of like the old B-52s did."
Bobby Shelton,It's one of those things that has to be done. We'd ask people to give themselves extra travel time if they have to go in that particular area.
Bobby Shelton,They can contact our traffic management division at 455-6100. We'd take their concerns and issues and put it on a list to study.
Bobby Shelton,"Initially, you don't need five lanes in each direction."
Bobby Shelton,"The reason it wasn't built out to five lanes in the beginning, back in 1990, was basically funding and need. There's probably no need at this point for five lanes in each direction. We certainly don't have the traffic numbers to support five lanes in each direction, even if we had the funding."
Bobby Shelton,"The last couple of accidents there (on Durango at Route 160), people ran stop signs. I find it hard to believe people aren't seeing those signs."

John Shelton,"Regardless of who's doing a controlled burn, we still have the responsibility to plan for what would be a concerned hazardous area. We have to put in a structures plan and an evacuation plan."
John Shelton,"Randy is qualified as a police officer for the state of Ohio, If he's called, he has got to go."
John Shelton,We had a call from a neighbor that he had to run children out of the house and that there is 3-4 feet of water in the basement. Can't something be done to secure the place until the owner can be found?
Alan Shepard,"You've done it in the simulator so many times, you don't have a real sense of being excited when the flight is going on. You're excited before, but as soon as the liftoff occurs, you are busy doing what you have to do."
Alan Shepard,"You may not have any extra talent, but maybe you are just paying more attention to what you are doing."
Alan Shepard,"Whether you are an astronomer or a life scientist, geophysicist, or a pilot, you've got to be there because you believe you are good in your field, and you can contribute, not because you are going to get a lot of fame or whatever when you get back."
Alan Shepard,"We worked with the engineers in the design and construction and testing phases in those various areas, then we would get back together at the end of the week and brief each other as to what had gone on."
Alan Shepard,"We wanted to be in great shape, we wanted to be able to cope with zero gravity, we wanted to be able to cope with accelerations and decelerations and so on. So all of us trained so that we were probably in the best physical condition we had ever been in up until that point."
Alan Shepard,They say any landing you can walk away from is a good one.
Alan Shepard,"Then there was the challenge to keep doing better and better, to fly the best test flight that anybody had ever flown. That led to my being recognized as one of the more experienced test pilots, and that led to the astronaut business."
Alan Shepard,"The rocket had worked perfectly, and all I had to do was survive the reentry forces. You do it all, in a flight like that, in a rather short period of time, just 16 minutes as a matter of fact."
Alan Shepard,"The pilot looked at his cues of attitude and speed and orientation and so on and responded as he would from the same cues in an airplane, but there was no way it flew the same. The simulators had showed us that."
Alan Shepard,"The first plane ride was in a homemade glider my buddy and I built. Unfortunately we didn't get more than four feet off the ground, because it crashed."
Alan Shepard,"The excitement really didn't start to build until the trailer - which was carrying me, with a space suit with ventilation and all that sort of stuff - pulled up to the launch pad."
Alan Shepard,"So everything turned out fine, and we were given the opportunity to go to Washington and be briefed on the project of man in space, and given the opportunity to choose whether we wanted to get involved or not."
Alan Shepard,"So even though we were there competing with each other for the first ride, we were still acting as a team, and helping each other in those days."
Alan Shepard,"Of course I was delighted the flight was over, but I still had to worry about cleaning up inside the cabin, I had to worry about the hatch, how to get in the sling, and so on."
Alan Shepard,"Obviously I was challenged by becoming a Naval aviator, by landing aboard aircraft carriers and so on."
Alan Shepard,"Later, in the early teens, I used to ride my bike every Saturday morning to the nearest airport, ten miles away, push airplanes in and out of the hangars, and clean up the hangars."
Alan Shepard,It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.
Alan Shepard,"I woke up an hour before I was supposed to, and started going over the mental checklist: where do I go from here, what do I do? I don't remember eating anything at all, just going through the physical, getting into the suit. We practiced that so much, it was all rote."
Alan Shepard,"I think the sense of family and family achievement, plus the discipline which I received there from that one-room school were really very helpful in what I did later on."
Alan Shepard,I think all of us certainly believed the statistics which said that probably 88% chance of mission success and maybe 96% chance of survival. And we were willing to take those odds.
Alan Shepard,"I didn't mind studying. Obviously math and the physical science subjects interested me more than some of the more artistic subjects, but I think I was a pretty good student."
Alan Shepard,"But when I was selected, after my very first tour of squadron duty, to become one of the youngest candidates for the test pilot school, I began to realize, maybe you are a little bit better."
Alan Shepard,"And I think that still is true of this business - which is basically research and development - that you probably spend more time in planning and training and designing for things to go wrong, and how you cope with them, than you do for things to go right."
Alan Shepard,"You have to be there not for the fame and glory and recognition and being a page in a history book, but you have to be there because you believe your talent and ability can be applied effectively to operation of the spacecraft."
Alan Shepard,"We also knew it would be difficult, because of the financial condition of the family, for me to go to college."
Alan Shepard,"Of course, in our grade school, in those days, there were no organized sports at all. We just went out and ran around the school yard for recess."
Alan Shepard,"It's been a long way, but we're here."
Alan Shepard,"I'd like to say I was smart enough to finish six grades in five years, but I think perhaps the teacher was just glad to get rid of me."
Alan Shepard,"I must admit, maybe I am a piece of history after all."
Alan Shepard,"You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world."
David Shepherd,It's an honor for me to be here and see this. It's really just spectacular.
David Shepherd,"It feels funny letting go of some of that stuffâ€”it's my life. But if it belongs anywhere, it's this University. This is where everything happened."
David Shepherd,"I was 25 when I first started playing for Gloucestershire, because my father had insisted I got a proper qualification before trying to make it as a cricketer,"
Jim Shepherd,I think there would be an awkwardness to say the least for a Canadian company to walk in the door and say where do we go from here.
Jim Shepherd,"There was nothing in the business model that made MBS unprofitable, it was just Microsoft didn't need the profits from MBS so they made the decision to spend more than what they were taking in on the business. MBS has been making steady progress. They had a hiccup last year where revenue's were disappointing. Clearly, growing faster than the market is always a good thing."
Jim Shepherd,"They must realize that even if ERP doesn't manage these functions as well as what they had, the benefit to the organization of having a single system of record outweighs the inconvenience of a less capable system."
Ian Shepherdson,"This is something of a surprise, given the relative strength of most of the regional surveys. The latter are not always a perfect guide to the national ISM but they rarely send such a clear, but wrong, signal."
Ian Shepherdson,Auto sales did not fall as far as the unit sales numbers suggested. This means there'll probably be a catch-up -- downwards -- next month.
Ian Shepherdson,"Given the extraordinarily weak chain store sales numbers [in September], this report comes as a huge relief -- it could have been much worse."
Ian Shepherdson,"Overall, the recent sales data appear to point to a renewed upturn in spending."
Ian Shepherdson,"It is tempting to argue that two straight months of sales nearer to the 900,000 level than one million...is evidence of a real slowing in housing. But it probably tells us more about the awful weather across much of the country,"
Ian Shepherdson,"It is tempting to blame the softness of core sales on the surge in gas prices, but we think it is too soon for that."
Ian Shepherdson,"The trend in sales is probably not as weak as this seems to suggest, but there is no question that the condo/co-op market is slowing much more dramatically than the market for single-family homes. Even in the latter case, however, sales have fallen more than 10% from their summer peak."
Ian Shepherdson,We've seen pauses in sales before; (it's) too soon to call this a trend.
Ian Shepherdson,"[Even so,] there is as yet no clear sign of a downturn in sales, despite the rise in mortgage rates over the past year, ... People are still shrugging off the rise in rates."
Ian Shepherdson,"Core sales slowed hugely at the end of the year, almost certainly as a result of the cash flow hit caused by the post-Katrina leap in energy prices. This is now over, and sales should rebound strongly in the first quarter."
Ian Shepherdson,"The revisions are not as big as we feared, ... The new April number shows sales at their lowest level since November, but the previous four months were exceptionally strong, in part due to favorable weather. Given the strong trend in mortgage applications, these data likely do not signal real housing weakness."
Ian Shepherdson,"If February is broadly similar, a March 28 rate hike is assured. The May meeting's risk is rising."
Ian Shepherdson,"Unfortunately, at current levels, and coupled with the extraordinarily low level of labor demand, the claims numbers are still consistent with flat or falling payrolls and a rising unemployment rate. There's no real relief in sight here yet."
Ian Shepherdson,"The labor market is tightening, but the tightening is not accelerating."
Ian Shepherdson,The data confirm that the labor market is still not generating the sort of cost pressures many analysts expected with 4 percent unemployment.
Ian Shepherdson,These are spectacular numbers and confirm that the labor market is not at the moment the source of anything that could be plausibly described as inflationary pressure.
Ian Shepherdson,The message from these claims numbers is strong and clear. The labor market is extremely tight.
Ian Shepherdson,"Behind the enormous distortions caused by the hurricanes, the underlying state of the labor market has continued to improve."
Ian Shepherdson,It signals that the labor market has now moved again to center stage in the Fed's analysis and policymaking process.
Ian Shepherdson,"The Fed's chief worry is still the labor market. So long as the unemployment rate does not fall further, and clear signs of consumer slowed own emerge, the Fed will be able to leave rates on hold."
Ian Shepherdson,"The Fed's chief worry is still the labor market, ... So long as the unemployment rate does not fall further, and clear signs of consumer slowed own emerge, the Fed will be able to leave rates on hold."
Ian Shepherdson,"The Fed's Beige Book acknowledges some of the improvement evident in recent economic data, but the tone of the survey could not yet be described as a ringing endorsement of the recovery story,"
Ian Shepherdson,"There was no comment on future Fed policy, but ... with no inflation risk, Mr. Greenspan can wait until recovery is secure. In the meantime, rates are on hold."
Ian Shepherdson,"If we had any faith in the reliability of these numbers, we'd have to call them disappointing, ... But we don't, so we won't."
Ian Shepherdson,"The improvement in the stock market is allowing the hugely favorable monetary and fiscal environment to do its work -- just as it was in the spring before the stock market melted down,"
Ian Shepherdson,"The headline reflects a 3.2 percent rise in gasoline prices. Natural gas and electricity prices were also much stronger than the PPI suggested. The good news is the 0.1 percent core, which supports the Fed's view that transitory factors have boosted inflation in recent months."
Ian Shepherdson,"The headline reflects a 3.2 percent rise in gasoline prices. Natural gas and electricity prices were also much stronger than the PPI suggested. The good news is the 0.1 percent core, which supports the Fed's view that transitory factors have boosted inflation in recent months,"
Ian Shepherdson,"While claims at 350,000 or so would not be a disaster, they would be consistent with (monthly) payrolls trending at only about 125,000 -- not enough to push the unemployment rate any lower."
Ian Shepherdson,"We think the trend in layoff is downwards, ... but we're not yet ready to argue that all the danger has passed."
Ian Shepherdson,"The report suggests that industrial orders are trending higher as manufacturing recovers from the Asia crisis, ... There are no real signs of a slowdown."
Ian Shepherdson,The report suggests that industrial orders are trending higher as manufacturing recovers from the Asia crisis. There are no real signs of a slowdown.
Ian Shepherdson,Clearly there is nothing here at all to comfort the Fed.
Ian Shepherdson,"These are pretty awful numbers and, as far as we know, there are no mitigating circumstances,"
Ian Shepherdson,"This is slightly baffling, given that existing home sales have been strengthening, ... It may be a reflection of caution on the part of builders, who have been reluctant to keep pace with sales because of fear the market strength will not last."
Ian Shepherdson,"It will profoundly damage Bush's ability to accomplish his legislative goals, ... drastic reforms of Social Security and Medicare, which would affect the state of public finances in the long run."
Andrew Sherman,"Clinicians and high-risk pregnant women should be aware of this research outcome so that we can avoid the escalation of pre-term birth and, in turn, save more babies' lives."
Andrew Sherman,"Grow Fast Grow Right's educational events and training are organized around three pillars: financial capital, intellectual capital and human capital. We believe that the products and services offered by Profiles International address those pillars -- specifically human capital."
Andrew Sherman,"The buzz I'm hearing around town is he's a relatively unknown choice, but an interesting one. It will be interesting to see how the nomination hearing goes."
Mike Sherman,"He did a lot of running yesterday with the strength coach, a lot of different movements, and today he did some route running with the offense and some blocking without the pads. He did all the functions of a tight end."
Mike Sherman,"We want to add a fifth receiver if we can. I don't think our philosophy - mine or Ted's - is to just to go out and get somebody to get somebody. But if we can get someone who can come in and help us, (we will)."
Mike Sherman,"They missed the call, ... It's bad enough you have to deal with the mistakes you make; we have to live with our mistakes. Now, we have to live with somebody else's mistakes. That makes it tough."
Mike Sherman,"No, you don't expect the mistakes to come from the guys that you've always been able to depend on. Sometimes it gets to the point where guys are pressing a little bit too hard. That may be the case in regard to Favre."
Mike Sherman,He's in much better shape. We know we can count on him. Last year he got hurt and the weight was a factor . . . I believe. We know we can depend on him this year. He's come back and been very accountable and that's very good. He looks like a player.
Mike Sherman,"For him to want to stay at the game over going to the doctor's was ludicrous, ... But, he wanted to be at the game and be a part of it so much."
Mike Sherman,"We took shots downfield but you can't force balls. It's very difficult missing a player like Javon, and we should still have been able to take shots down-field."
Mike Sherman,(The doctors) feel pretty confident that his head is going to be OK. We're just going to see how he feels with his back in the morning.
Mike Sherman,"I didn't have a whole lot of choices. The doctors have held them back, so my choices have been limited. So what do I do from here? Well, we get them on (the field), we continue to condition them, we try to get them in the game on Thursday night against Tennessee, try to get them ready. I can just deal with the options that are available to me, and these are the options. Do I like them? Not necessarily."
Mike Sherman,"I didn't have a whole lot of choices. The doctors have held (Hunt and Jackson) back, so my choices have been limited,"
Mike Sherman,"The things you don't have control over, you don't worry about. I have control over my attitude, my perception, how I do things, and you do the very best job you can. Other people have control over other things and you let them do their jobs."
Mike Sherman,"I can't think of a bye week we went into healthy, ... I think organizationally, we take full advantage of the bye. The philosophy whether we're going into the bye winning or losing, I've kept the same philosophy - how many days we're going to work with the players, the coaches' schedule, our research analysis, the changes we need to make."
Mike Sherman,He looks like he has the ability to run between the tackles pretty well. I've seen him bounce the ball outside with some speed. I don't think he had many opportunities to be successful in the game. I think from what I've seen I've been encouraged by him.
William Sherman,"My aim, then, was to whip the rebels, to humble their pride, to follow them to their inmost recesses, and make them fear and dread us. Fear is the beginning of wisdom."
William Sherman,"I would define true courage to be a perfect sensibility of the measure of danger, and a mental willingness to endure it."
William Sherman,The whole army is burning with an insatiable desire to wreak violence upon South Carolina. I almost tremble for her fate.
William Sherman,The voice of the people is the voice of humbug.
William Sherman,"But, my dear sirs, when peace does come, you may call on me for any thing. Then will I share with you the last cracker, and watch with you to shield your homes and families against danger from every quarter."
William Sherman,I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah.
William Sherman,"Courage - a perfect sensibility of the measure of danger, and a mental willingness to endure it."
William Sherman,"If nominated, I will not accept; if drafted, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve."
William Sherman,"There will soon come an armed contest between capital and labor. They will oppose each other, not with words and arguments, but with shot and shell, gun-powder and cannon. The better classes are tired of the insane howling of the lower strata and they mean to stop them."
William Sherman,A battery of field artillery is worth a thousand muskets.
William Sherman,"If you don't have my army supplied, and keep it supplied, we'll eat your mules up, sir."
William Sherman,It's a disagreeable thing to be whipped.
William Sherman,An Army is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man. Every change in the rules which impairs the principle weakens the army.
William Sherman,"I make up my opinions from facts and reasoning, and not to suit any body but myself. If people don't like my opinions, it makes little difference as I don't solicit their opinions or votes."
William Sherman,I think I understand what military fame is; to be killed on the field of battle and have your name misspelled in the newspapers.
William Sherman,I will accept no commission that would tend to create a rivalry with Grant. I want him to hold what he has earned and got. I have all the rank I want.
William Sherman,"Grant stood by me when I was crazy, and I stood by him when he was drunk, and now we stand by each other."
John Shin,While we still expect the housing market to cool gradually -- and the data over the past couple of quarters has been consistent with that view -- the February existing home sales number shows the considerable strength that is still in the residential sector.
John Shin,"Fourth-quarter growth is going to be softer, primarily because of lower consumer spending, but we expect better growth this quarter. A major part of it is the sharp drop in auto sales, and we wouldn't expect to see that again."
John Shin,It really does reflect the enormous amount of coverage of the Katrina disaster.
George Shinn,"My exact words were, 'Oklahoma where?'  ... I said, 'You've got to be kidding me, David. Do they have an arena?' I knew nothing about Oklahoma City."
George Shinn,There is no self-made man. You will reach your goals only with the help of others.
George Shinn,"If we sell out that game, that's a loud message."
George Shinn,"But we've got to remember the economics have to be there to support it,"
George Shinn,There is no such thing as a self-made man. You will reach your goals only with the help of others.
George Shinn,"I've told him that I want him back. I think he's a great coach, and he's good with the guys. So I told him if he wants to talk, he can talk to me. But I'm not going to talk to an agent. If he has an agent involved, he has to talk to (General Manager) Jeff Bower, not me."
George Shinn,"I believe it's going to come back. I feel its going to come back bigger and stronger. We're here (Oklahoma City) for this year. New Orleans has a lot do to get back and when they come back, we're coming back. I want the people there to have hope. In a lot of ways that's all some of them have, and I'm not going to take that away from them."
Mike Shinoda,"I would have never done this record if I didn't have the blessing of the rest of the guys, ... We're not, like, on hiatus. We're working. We're very serious about our records, and I know the guys are at home right now writing. Hopefully we are looking at next year for a record."
Mike Shinoda,"Because the Fort Minor record is coming out on Machine Shop, we have complete creative control, ... That's really nice to say we're running the show and whatever we want to do, we do. And be at the point in our career where [Machine Shop's parent company, Warner Bros.,] respects that. So when I want to make a video and say this is how I want to do it, everyone's been cool."
Mike Shinoda,"When we started the band, it was because we were waiting for a sound that never happened. We got tired of waiting, and we decided to just do it ourselves."
Mike Shinoda,We learned pretty early on in this band that you can't have snobbery in music.
Eric Shinseki,"Well, let's assume the world is linear. If we required a certain amount of troops per 25,000 population in the Balkans, if the world is not radically different, something of the same extent is going to be needed in Iraq."
Eric Shinseki,It's tough never being right.
Eric Shinseki,"It's not a battle that we would have designed. Heavy mechanized forces were coming up against light infantry, and frankly, we held our breath."
Jason Shirey,Leah threw a great ballgame. It's great to see her back to her normal self. I was glad to see that.
Jason Shirey,It seemed like we got a lot of two-out hits in this game. You can't risk getting the runner thrown out when you already have two outs.
Jason Shirey,"When you've got something special like that, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to get it. I was proud for her to get a perfect game. So many things could go wrong."
Jason Shirey,"Morgan did a great job throwing. She got ahead all night long, and I was glad to see that. It's not something we can take for granted. We can't assume we are going to score six or seven runs a night."
Jason Shirey,They made a lot of catches tonight; they earned their money out there.
Jason Shirey,"Two, big clutch hits. We had three, two-run hits and that tells me that we have kids coming up and producing in scoring situations."
Jason Shirey,She's got a great future ahead of her. We need to remember that. I think she does too. She didn't back down. She has that ability to go out and dominate a game.
Jason Shirey,"We've got experience coming back, we've got some solid players and I'm really looking for this team to do some good things this season. I really think we have the ability to get back where we were last year, but it's still a waiting game. We'll have to see how everything works out, and that takes a little time."
Jason Shirey,"As a coach, you always like the idea of controlling your own destiny. That's been our motto all year, just to go out and win our games and not worry about what other teams are doing. If we continue to win the games that we play, only good things will happen for us in the long run."
Jason Shirey,We gave up one hit. One hit and you get beat like that. That was frustrating. We played good defense and had good pitching. We just didn't compete offensively.
James Shirley,"Only the actions of the just, Smell sweet and blossom in their dust."
James Shirley,"The honor is overpaid, When he that did the act is commentator."
James Shirley,There is no armor against fate.
Jeremy Shockey,"There's a lot of talent here. We can be as good as we want. If we ever lose a game, it's us losing it. We're giving it away because we have great players on offense. There should be teams that come up with turnovers and things like that, but there should be no team that shuts us out for three and a half quarters. . . . Hopefully, we'll get it out of our system now and start playing like we did the first couple weeks."
Jeremy Shockey,"It's very satisfying to have the kind of talent to put up that many points, ... Now it's a matter of being consistent."
Jeremy Shockey,a threesome with a mother and her two twins.
Jeremy Shockey,"I was blocking somebody and I got shoved in the back, and the next thing I know, everybody's fighting. There's no bad blood. That's how football is. You might as well do it now, when you don't get fined and [NFL Commissioner] Paul Tagliabue can't take any money out of your pocket. Do it now, get it over with. I'm sure it happens at every other camp."
Jeremy Shockey,There are no hard feelings from our side. We don't have anything against the guys that came here and practiced against us.
Jeremy Shockey,"You're going to have your differences in the way you practice. There are no hard feelings from our side. It's an important preseason game for us, to show we're getting better. We don't have anything against the guys that came here and practiced against us. They're not in our conference; it's over with."
Jeremy Shockey,There are no hard feelings from our side.
Jeremy Shockey,No hard feelings from our side. It's important not to get caught up in bad feelings. We don't have anything against those guys.
Jeremy Shockey,"He's not going to play in a rougher environment than he played in, and he dealt with it."
Jeremy Shockey,"This is the biggest stage in America, ... If you like competition, if you like the spotlight, if you like being pointed at for every little right and, more importantly, every little wrong, this is the place to play."
Pauly Shore,"Whenever someone dies everyone says, I love that guy, except for Jeffrey Dahmer."
Pauly Shore,That's the biggest rule in Hollywood: Don't spend your own money.
Pauly Shore,"My mom is two people to me. She's my mom number one, and then she's this lady most comedians know as being a legendary owner of a nightclub that's responsible for starting a lot of heavy careers."
Pauly Shore,"My mom and dad are both in stand-up comedy, so that's where I started, that's where I got everything. My roots are holding the mic."
Pauly Shore,I'm not used to getting good reviews.
Pauly Shore,"I was one of the first veejays to take the camera out on location, and that's what was unique about MTV at that time."
Pauly Shore,Few if any teenagers can relate to getting up for school and finding famous comics like Pryor and Williams hanging out in your living room after a hard night of partying. But that's Hollywood.
Pauly Shore,"Even at my peak, I never went too over the top."
Pauly Shore,"Middle America ripping the fields, oooh."
Solomon Short,"Any great truth can - and eventually will - be expressed as a cliche - a cliche is a sure and certain way to dilute an idea. For instance, my grandmother used to say, 'The black cat is always the last one off the fence.' I have no idea what she meant, but at one time, it was undoubtedly true."
Solomon Short,"If God is watching us, we might as well be interesting."
Solomon Short,A diploma only proves that you know how to look up answers.
Solomon Short,Half of being smart is knowing what you are dumb about.
Solomon Short,"Nature abhors a hero. For one thing, he violates the law of conservation of energy. For another, how can it be the survival of the fittest when the fittest keeps putting himself in situations where he is most likely to be creamed?"
Frank Shorter,You don't run 26 miles at five minutes a mile on good looks and a secret recipe.
Frank Shorter,"Yes, winning the gold medal was undoubtedly the biggest day of my career - mostly because I won the way I had prepared to run it. It was a totally satisfying experience."
Frank Shorter,When you are caring about your children perhaps you always have to remember at what point you can become over involved because of something you need rather than something the child needs.
Frank Shorter,"When I am totally race fit, I don't worry about breathing or technique - they take care of themselves."
Frank Shorter,What you did was live on very little. I think all of us that were competing - Bill is the same way - you don't need much to live.
Frank Shorter,"To put it another way, Michael Jordan was a gym rat."
Frank Shorter,"The potential elite runner must realize that hard means hard, easy means easy and they must patiently seek out what combinations work for them. They have to learn to be persistent and patient with their training and racing."
Frank Shorter,"The marathon is all about energy management. I had planned to run it like a track race with strategic surges to blow up my competitors by putting them into oxygen debt, so that is the way I prepared."
Frank Shorter,"The irony of that is, what makes it kind of ironic, is when you do become successful as a professional athlete in particular, a lot of the young children who are emulating these stars do have a different perspective."
Frank Shorter,"So, in a way I was hedging and saying that if the Olympic stuff doesn't work out at least I can be a lawyer."
Frank Shorter,Running with others can help get you out when you might otherwise blow it off.
Frank Shorter,"Right now, after having had back surgery, I am finally back to running again."
Frank Shorter,"It is just called Continuing Legal Education. You can go to lectures, you can even listen to tapes on airplanes - they want you to stay current. So you do have to stay current to maintain your license even if you are not practicing."
Frank Shorter,Intervals and other types of speed work are essential to improve running speed.
Frank Shorter,In other words we have marketed our way into this health crisis.
Frank Shorter,I was actually going to law school in 1972.
Frank Shorter,"I think the secret of my light, quick, foot strike is related to the fact that I have fragile feet."
Frank Shorter,"I think he had a wake-up call. It's a different kind of race, and I think maybe he didn't take it quite as seriously as he might have, but you can bet he learned a lot of lessons."
Frank Shorter,"I started in law school in '71 and graduated in '74. So I was training for the Olympics, running or averaging around 20 miles a day and going to law school full time."
Frank Shorter,I plan to be running as long as I can and have no plans to stop.
Frank Shorter,"I graduated from Yale in 1969, from the University of Florida Law School in 1974, and passed the Colorado bar and was admitted in 1975."
Frank Shorter,I also held several masters running titles.
Frank Shorter,I admire runners older than I - they are now my heroes. I want to be like them as I grow older.
Frank Shorter,Hills are speedwork in disguise.
Frank Shorter,"For the novice runner, I'd say to give yourself at least 2 months of consistently running several times a week at a conversational pace before deciding whether you want to stick with it. Consistency is the most important aspect of training at this point."
Frank Shorter,"Experience has taught me how important it is to just keep going, focusing on running fast and relaxed. Eventually it passes and the flow returns. It's part of racing."
Frank Shorter,Being in school is the best place to be if you are an athlete because you can structure your own time.
Frank Shorter,Because running fast is more fun than running slow.
Frank Shorter,"As I've been able to once again gain the benefits of speed work, I'm enjoying my running more and more."
Frank Shorter,"Again, racing for me was about energy management."
Frank Shorter,There's obviously some validity to it. But I think it also points out that you obviously can do it on your own because people have been doing it long before they had the stuff.
Frank Shorter,"Really, I think that going out and playing with your friends is kind of becoming a lost art, with the kids in the neighborhood."
Frank Shorter,My goal is to break three hours in a marathon.
Frank Shorter,It is not the time spent with the child at their activity that is going to produce the highest level athlete. It is in supporting the child in an organized activity - and Bill alluded to this - so the child can find what they truly like to do and let them go.
Frank Shorter,"A good athlete always mentally replays a competition over and over, even in victory, to see what might be done to improve the performance the next time."
Frank Shorter,I think it is that parents just don't kick their kids out the door as much as they used to. I think the demise of sandlot sports has had a lot to do with it.
Frank Shorter,The weather is perfect. The gods are shining on us.
Buck Showalter,"With guys like Brad, they're going to trust their track record. They're going to get there if you stay with them."
Buck Showalter,I just want someone who I can trust.
Buck Showalter,"I'd be happy if someone said he could come back by May 1. The trouble is, there is nothing in baseball to compare this injury to."
Buck Showalter,"With arm strength and pitch counts, he did a lot of things to get to the next level. He got stronger as he went along today."
Buck Showalter,There's no such thing as a secret in sports. They did a good job against one of the best pitchers in baseball. Ninety-nine percent of the stuff that's talked about doesn't happen.
Buck Showalter,"A lot of things have gone wrong in the last year, ... Some of it we've self-created."
Buck Showalter,"It's always nice to have a safety valve. We'll see where we are at the end of Spring Training. Six, seven weeks here -- a lot can happen."
Buck Showalter,"It just wasn't worth the risk,"
Buck Showalter,"Hopefully, now he'll be ready for the rest of the year."
Buck Showalter,"He pitched as well as we could have hoped for. We took him to his limit on three days' rest. The bullpen picked him up, we just had problems at the end. Rick pitched well. I'm sure there was a lot of anxiety, but he handled it real well."
Buck Showalter,"He could catch in an emergency now, but we'll rest him,"
Buck Showalter,"He was up with some pitches. He had been throwing quality strikes down. He was coming off some good outings. With young pitchers, the more you get out there, the better your track record."
Buck Showalter,I would say there were some unknowns about him. I've been pleased with the progress he's made.
Buck Showalter,We have a lot of different possibilities.
Buck Showalter,There is only one way to find out and we had this opportunity to let him go out there. The biggest thing is to get his bat in the lineup.
Buck Showalter,"By the nature of his injury it would be tough to get him ready to be a starter. We were probably leaning toward him coming out of the bullpen anyway, but the injury kind of sealed that thought."
Buck Showalter,"He's a special young man. He's sharp and has great people skills. He's a quick learner. J.D. will make the decisions, and most of the time he's been right."
Buck Showalter,"We have not been kind to them, ... Between Whittleman and Danks and Teagarden, we have not been kind to the University of Texas. Maybe that's why Augie's here. Hey, maybe we'll sign Augie."
Buck Showalter,"The more return a guy like him gets for the way he approaches things, the more joy you get from it,"
Buck Showalter,I'd like to see him get back down there and get on the horse.
Buck Showalter,"As a team, you just try to survive them because you hate what it does to your pitching staff a lot of times. Eighteen innings in a day with no off days around it are tough."
Buck Showalter,Everybody thinks their future is bright. We love the potential they have. It can just fortify the thinking more than anything else.
Buck Showalter,People looked at us funny when we put Mark at first base and people looked at us funny when we put Mike [Young] at shortstop. How do you find out? I almost look at it as an opportunity that he can take advantage of for his sake.
Buck Showalter,I think we've gone over and beyond the line of caution on our part. I think Chris certainly feels that way.
Buck Showalter,It certainly wasn't a thing of beauty. But the conditions were tough and both teams used a lot of young players.
Buck Showalter,"He's got some anxiety I'm sure, first game. I think he'll get better. He knows he has to be better. Hopefully, he'll get this one behind him and get his feet on the ground."
Buck Showalter,"They're an impatient group, and I say that with admiration. Mentally, our guys are in a great spot and a great frame of mind about what they want to get out of this season as individuals, and more importantly, as a team."
Buck Showalter,"He feels good. He had good arm action, good stuff."
Andrew Shue,"With my new venture, Club Mom, we want to empower moms to feel their value and also build their collective power to make their lives better and easier. We want to bring them together as a community to share experiences and information."
Andrew Shue,We often think the exterior things-being good at sports or really smart -translate to feeling great about yourself.
Andrew Shue,"The dumbest thing I ever did in high school was when a kid challenged me to a fight... I did show up, and it was just a little scuffle."
Andrew Shue,"I think the key to both high school and junior high is everybody is trying to find their way, trying to stand out."
Andrew Shue,"The biggest lesson from Africa was that life's joys come mostly from relationships and friendships, not from material things. I saw time and again how much fun Africans had with their families and friends and on the sports fields; they laughed all the time."
Andrew Shue,"Unfortunately, there are so many people who live their whole life in a place that is safe and protected and simple and they don't really have that strength inside to fly."
Andrew Shue,"It gives them an opportunity to engage with each other, talk about ideas and then figure out creative ways to take their ideas to the next step where they can then take action to make something happen,"
Andrew Shue,"Winning isn't everything, but playing and competing and striving and going through things can be a lot of fun and really important. As long as you're doing it in a way that's healthy, sports can be an incredible opportunity."
Andrew Shue,"We wanted to make it cool and fun and interesting for young people to get involved, and we wanted to figure out what kind of programs would give them the structure to want to get involved,"
Andrew Shue,I have amazing friends who have led inspirational lives.
Andrew Shue,Try to have as diverse group of friends as possible and don't get into the the clique scenario.
Andrew Shue,"Fear is that thing that keeps you up there on that other plateau. Fear is that thing that just keeps you closed down, and quite frankly, alone."
Andrew Shue,"young people have always been the inspiration in our country to move things to a better place, so [they] need that passion, that energy, that idealism that young people bring to it -- so get out there and be part of it."
Andrew Shue,"It's important because young people need to be motivated and inspired and then channeled into community building because they are the ones who have the most energy, the most time, the most to lose,"
Andrew Shue,"It's been quite a battle for my wife to get me to buy clothes, I just wear the same ones all the time, I don't care."
Andrew Shue,"I'm just kind of taking a break now and enjoying the freedom of making my own choices. When you're on a television show for six years, they run your schedule."
Andrew Shue,"We started a movement... to build character, citizenship and confidence in young people."
Andrew Shue,"[He may be getting older, but there's a youthful,] I'll let you in on the joke ... To celebrate (my birthday), my wife said, 'Maybe we'll just have dinner with the kids. You want oatmeal?'"
Andrew Shue,"I found at an early age the times when I learned the most about myself was when I got thrown out there on a stage in front of a microphone when you didn't really want to be out there, where you're kind of afraid."
Andrew Shue,"When you start suppressing feelings at an early age, it hurts you down the road. Full expression of anger and pain is very important."
Andrew Shue,"The most important role models should and could be parents and teachers. But that said, once you're a teenager you've probably gotten as much of an example from your parents as you're going to."
Andrew Shue,There are 80 million moms in the United States. Forty million stay at home with their children.
Andrew Shue,"Life is the most exciting opportunity we have. But we have one shot. You graduate from college once, and that's it. You're going out of that nest. And you have to find that courage that's deep, deep, deep in there. Every step of the way."
Rajiv Shukla,The Home Ministry made a few suggestions and these have been accepted by Pakistan.
Rajiv Shukla,The Home Ministry has advised some security measures for the match in Karachi. A team of BCCI and government officials will visit Pakistan to see these measures are put in place.
Rajiv Shukla,"The tour has been cleared (by the government). Karachi has also been cleared to play a Test, provided certain security conditions are met."
Rajiv Shukla,"UPA chairperson asked the government to write to the Danish government way back in October last year, expressing the deep sense of anguish, asking for an apology."
Rajiv Shukla,Congress is against any confrontation in society over reservations.
Don Shula,"They both had to sacrifice, but they finally understood what I was trying to do."
Don Shula,"He took over a program that was going through a lot of problems and he's trying to get it turned around, ... This would be a big step for him. (A win) would show they are headed in the right direction . . . That's a big job he's got, following Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama, 83,000 people. . . . College football is just very exciting. The fans are so loyal."
Don Shula,"He is (happy). He likes Tuscaloosa. They enjoy it there. He's got two young girls and they've got a third on the way, they just found out it's another girl, so that will be three girls. He likes everything about the job."
Don Shula,"He is (happy), ... He likes Tuscaloosa. They enjoy it there. He's got two young girls and they've got a third on the way, they just found out it's another girl, so that will be three girls. He likes everything about the job."
Don Shula,He didn't walk into a great situation. Mike's worked hard to get the program where it is now. I couldn't be more proud.
Don Shula,"The '85 Bears were a great football team and aside from that one game, they played exceptionally well all year, ... Denver at 13-0 was tremendously strong in all areas, too."
Don Shula,"Then somewhere along the line  and it couldn't have been until late in the season  we realized we had a chance to do something no one else had done: To win all the games. That became important, but if we had to lose, we wanted to make sure that it wasn't in the Super Bowl. If we ended 16-1, the season would have been a failure."
Don Shula,"When we got them together for the first time on the field, ... and had Woodley throwing on one side to a group of receivers and Marino on the other, it was so evident the ability Dan had throwing the football. Woodley was an athlete playing quarterback and Marino was a quarterback playing quarterback. You could just look at it and see, even in the simplest passing drills, that Marino had that great skill."
Don Shula,"It's a special place, and he has an appreciation for the tradition."
Don Shula,I got up and displayed some anger. I was sort of upset. Wouldn't you be?
Don Shula,"You know it's only 50 miles from Grand River to Canton, but it took me 67 years to travel that distance."
Don Shula,"I think what coaching is all about, is taking players and analyzing there ability, put them in a position where they can excel within the framework of the team winning. And I hope that I've done that in my 33 years as a head coach."
Don Shula,"I coached against Dave the last couple of years, and I was very proud to be the first time a father ever coached against his son. He beat me for 30 minutes the first time and 59 and a half minutes the second time."
Don Shula,"Because, they're only thinking about one team when that game's over. Before the game, they're talking about two football teams. When the game's over, there's only one winner."
Don Shula,"And this year is going to be the 25th anniversary of the 17-0 team, the only undefeated season."
Don Shula,"And then to end up with a total of 347 wins, averaging 10 regular season wins for 33 years and the best winning percentage, and I'm very proud of this, of any professional team from 1970 to 1996."
Don Shula,"And my rookie contract, my first rookie contract was for $5,000."
Don Shula,And I coached against Mike when he was an assistant with the Bears and they won that football game.
Don Shula,"What I learned from that loss, and also another loss that I'm going to talk about later, was that when you're there, it's not good enough to be there, when you're there, you better walk away with that ring."
Don Shula,The one thing that I know is that you win with good people.
Don Shula,I don't want a player that's content with not playing... But we wanted to play the guys that got us here.
Don Shula,Peyton Manning is doing things that I think no other quarterback in the history of the league has done at the line of scrimmage... I just think they are a team right now that's got a real chance to run the table.
Don Shula,"No other league has had labor peace for so long. Tagliabue has managed to keep the two sides together, and they've kept playing."
Don Shula,Anybody that's a Dolphins fan feels they're headed in the right direction.
Don Shula,"He wants to be his own man and be recognized for what he's done. He's not asking for anything because of his name. That was a tough situation to go into at Alabama, but he probably wouldn't have been given the job if the situation would have been different."
Don Shula,Success is not forever and failure isn't fatal.
Don Shula,The superior man blames himself. The inferior man blames others.
Don Shula,"Sure, luck means a lot in football. Not having a good quarterback is bad luck."
Don Shula,I don't know any other way to lead but by example.
Don Shula,One thing I never want to be accused of is not working.
Mike Shula,"Between the bull-riding and the two-stepping, our coaches showed their lack of talent."
Mike Shula,The knowledge that his players have of the passing game and making adjustments are things that have always stood out.
Mike Shula,We want guys here we've got guys here who want to have people looking at them and wondering what our football team is about.
Mike Shula,"Pro was excited about the letter, ... Was it unexpected? Probably. When his dad came in the room he said 'Dad, I got a letter from one of my buddies.'"
Mike Shula,"We need to see the improvement and the consistency. I think we've seen some really good things from both guys, and some things that have been average."
David Shulman,"The lawsuit challenges the practice of the Minneapolis School District of using Abraham Lincoln High School as a warehouse for immigrant high school aged students. Students sat in mainstream classrooms for years, not understanding what was being said, or what was being taught."
David Shulman,"For example, 1970, 1974, 1982, 1990 and 2002 were recession years and 1966, 1986 and 1994 were associated with mid-cycle slowdowns."
David Shulman,"[Ultimately investors themselves are to blame, of course.] Normally the last cycle's winners don't win in the next cycle, ... But people want to play them because they look cheap compared to the previous boom."
Brooks Shumake,"He pitched through recreation leagues. He has a good, strong arm. We typically are not real crazy moving our shortstop off of shortstop, but we are looking at him as a closer and how he handles that role."
Brooks Shumake,"I just started asking my kids to go up to the plate and compete, just compete, against the pitcher, and they did. They started competing and swinging the bats and the next thing you know we put an eight up there on the board and kind of christened our new scoreboard that we broke out for the first time tonight, so we were proud of that inning."
Brooks Shumake,"Our guys are ready to go out and play baseball though. I think we're playing with confidence, playing well. The team is coming together. We had a goal to win the region (Region VI), we did that; we had a goal to win the district; we're one win away from that, and we're focused on finishing the district."
Kapil Sibal,There is nothing to worry about at the moment. We are keeping a vigil and there is no rise in the sea to suggest a tsunami is waiting to hit.
Kapil Sibal,"We have now agreed upon the language and the finer points,"
Kapil Sibal,It is our firm belief that either an ordinance or a law should be introduced in Parliament forthwith to stop the sealing and demolition of various premises for a period of six months.
John Sicher,"With innovation and new product plans, it will be pretty intense next year."
John Sicher,"Innovation is absolutely essential to this industry,"
John Sicher,"The diet part of the industry is where the growth is, and these companies are now expanding their offerings of diet sodas."
John Sicher,"The biggest trend last year was the accelerated growth of the diet sodas,"
John Sicher,The energy drink category came out of nowhere. It's been a pleasant surprise for the industry.
John Sicher,Few things this important are easy and the company and the bottlers are going to need to find a way to resolve the challenges of the new retail landscape.
John Sicher,"Consumers are looking for more and more choice, and beverage companies are responding. The macro trend is toward lighter, lower calorie beverages, but consumers still like sweet, creamy, dessert-like beverages."
Jeremy Siegel,I don't think (tech stocks) are cheap. But they are closer to true value.
Jeremy Siegel,"That's very frustrating, but earnings are still what it's all about. Investors look at annual performance, and they're not always patient to sit with a company for a long time."
Jeremy Siegel,"[At 74, Buffett says he is in excellent health and has no plans to retire. Nor has he named a successor. But if he did leave the company, what would happen to it? Buffett is universally viewed as the key to Berkshire's fine performance.] He's obviously a very bright man, ... He looks at things very rationally. He doesn't like to get his emotions involved."
Jeremy Siegel,"[Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School, sees the year-long sell-off as a rational response to fast-weakening corporate profits. And he says the worst may not be over.] I don't think (tech stocks) are cheap, ... But they are closer to true value."
Jeremy Siegel,He's obviously a very bright man. He looks at things very rationally. He doesn't like to get his emotions involved.
Jeremy Siegel,"I think that certainly this preoccupies us today, but I think the economic factors are overriding when considering the direction of the market."
Jeremy Siegel,"[Neither, however, should they expect Buffett's advancing age to have much effect on the share price.] Everyone knows he's not going to live forever, ... That's built into the price.... The market is thinking, maybe he's got five to 10 years.... If we knew that Buffett was going to live forever, maybe the stock would be 10% higher."
Don Siegelman,"I think the people deserve another vote,"
Don Siegelman,"A few obsessed government officials have spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in an attempt to control a governor's election, ... The people of Alabama aren't going to let that happen, and I'm not going to let it happen."
Don Siegelman,"You used reports of a projected surplus in the budget to basically promise everything to everybody. In fact, you took credit for everything except raising our property taxes."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"You're telling the story, creating the sets, doing the lighting, the designing, and establishing the pace."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"Toasters was a really interesting experience for me because it did take a lot out of me. It was wonderful, certainly very liberating, and I loved it."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"To me, the technique was almost irrelevant; it was what was coming across."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"To me, that's one of the things that I love about doing this stuff. One day I can work on this piece in watercolor, and then work on something else on the computer, or work on something else that's a completely different approach."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"To me, I always felt that Elektra was much more of a character that men would put their fantasies into. I felt there was a level of mystery to her."
Bill Sienkiewicz,There is a whole generation of people who are going to see movies or watch TV who don't want to work.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"That was a real learning element for me, because I realized that the more true you are to yourself, the more you will lose people."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"So, when the special effects are at the service of the story and draw you into it, that is really the magic."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"So there's kind of a simultaneous aspect to pushing the boundaries, and being very safe."
Bill Sienkiewicz,So much of Jaws was amazing because the mind filled in what was missing.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"So I look at a lot of stuff now that I did and some of it looks tame to me, but my interest in terms of what I want to say with it is a little different."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"So cartooning, for me, is an honorable thing. It's pushing the envelope. It's the truth of something through exaggeration."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"People who can pull you in and take you on a journey, as opposed to simply adding flash. Again, that feels very clinical, and I don't respond to that the way I used to."
Bill Sienkiewicz,One of the problems I have with a lot of movies these days is that everything is too well lit. In the world of digital creations there is a tendency to show too much.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"Nothing is really media driven or committee driven, so you can actually just produce something."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"Kyle Baker's work is really funny, but it's also got a very clear vision."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"It's interesting, because in the corporate stuff there's a dichotomy there, depending on the creator. Even what, in essence, may be a very safe corporate approach, there is some stuff that is allowed to be pushed."
Bill Sienkiewicz,If you're going to establish a certain level of unreality than you have to deal with it.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"If somebody can inspire me, it feels really special."
Bill Sienkiewicz,I was lucky enough to be given books that weren't top sellers; books that were kind of under the radar.
Bill Sienkiewicz,I wanted to learn how to paint rather than just doing black-and-white work.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"I wanted to be complete, because I figured that, visually, there was an avenue to explore with painted stuff."
Bill Sienkiewicz,I still love a lot of the guys who just paint.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"I didn't want to feel constrained, so I took on the Mutants."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"For a while I felt very alone; sort of out there in the world of comics, especially here in the States."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"Do the story in the way it really demands to be done, which may mean using several different styles or only one style; but it's still about respecting the story."
Bill Sienkiewicz,Comics are really my life blood in a lot of respects.
Bill Sienkiewicz,Cartooning is an honorable thing.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"But with comics you're reading and assimilating an image simultaneously, instead of just reading or watching the tube."
Bill Sienkiewicz,But there's still an avenue for smaller comics and personal expression.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"But if I really want to produce my own work and tell stories, then I will."
Bill Sienkiewicz,But I'm aware of the fact that I'm working in a commercial venue where I'm producing something that I wouldn't normally be approaching the way I'm doing it.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"And within the world that you've created, the physics of that world have to remain constant; they can't be amorphous and changing."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"And that, to me, is the main attraction to comics. It's an avenue to say what you want to say."
Bill Sienkiewicz,And I've never viewed comics as assignments for the client.
Bill Sienkiewicz,"After that I jumped, especially being in art school, to the illustrators."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"Like Godfather, you look at a movie like that, or something that James Gray has directed, a film with minimal or pin lighting as opposed to everything being lit bright and flat, where everything is evident."
Bill Sienkiewicz,"Especially with Elektra, because I'm doing a lot of the covers for the new version of Elektra."
Khalil Sikander,We are a great pressing and running team. But we didn't take advantage of that early in the game.
Khalil Sikander,It was her last night. She wanted it to end on a good note. In the second half she came out more relaxed and let the game come to her.
Khalil Sikander,"I told the girls she's a great player. We focused on her weaknesses, and getting her into foul trouble really helped a lot."
Khalil Sikander,We packed it in down low. We wanted to force them to beat us from the outside.
Khalil Sikander,"I've never been there and the girls have never been there. But I have confidence in these girls. They might be nervous but I think when the ball is tipped, they'll go out and show all of their work has paid off. They believe in themselves."
Igor Sikorsky,"According to the laws of aerodynamics, the bumblebee can't fly either, but the bumblebee doesn't know anything about the laws of aerodynamics, so it goes ahead and flies anyway."
Igor Sikorsky,The work of the individual still remains the spark that moves mankind forward.
Igor Sikorsky,The work of the individual still remains the spark that moves mankind ahead even more than teamwork.
Dr. Siller,"If (the bleeding) was on the left side of the brain, it will undoubtedly involve his speech and comprehension. If it was on the right side of the brain then it's possible he could emerge from this with the ability to converse and make some decisions. At a minimum, he's going to be terribly incapacitated with at least a paralysis on one side of the body."
Dr. Siller,"The doctors were responding to that first stroke properly with the use of blood thinners. That comes with a price. The price is the increased risk of brain hemorrhage, which is what happened in this case. They shouldn't be criticized because it has not been proven what is the best choice of treatment for patients with these holes in their heart."
Dr. Siller,The doctors were responding to that first stroke properly with the use of blood thinners. It is unfair to critique them based on the information we have.
Dr. Siller,If they hadn't given him blood thinners and he had another clot-related stroke â€” which could have happened â€” there would have been outrage and criticism that the doctors had not treated the first stroke aggressively enough.
Dr. Siller,If they hadn't given him blood thinners and he had another clot-related stroke -- which could have happened -- there would have been outrage and criticism that the doctors had not treated the first stroke aggressively enough.
Dr. Siller,If they hadn't given him blood thinners and he had another clot-related stroke - which could have happened - there would have been outrage and criticism that the doctors had not treated the first stroke aggressively enough.
Dr. Siller,"If he's suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage, it means a blood vessel in his brain has burst and the situation is really critical."
Dr. Siller,"We are basically hoping he survives and that he has some kind of ability to get some rehab so he can have some useful function again. But we are talking about the basics, we are talking very basic things. The complexity of this man, and what he did for a living, this is not to even be considered now. This is absolutely unrealistic at this time."
Scott Silliman,I think its got its problems.
Scott Silliman,I want to present what I consider to be the applicable law.
Scott Silliman,You're going to be hard pressed to find somebody who hasn't heard the name Padilla and read somewhere that he was the supposed dirty bomber. Padilla is the government's worst nightmare as far as litigation.
Tom Silva,You want the room that is being heated to keep the heat in that room. You only want the space you're living in to stay controlled.
Tom Silva,That air space becomes insulation. It makes a tremendous difference on the air that falls off that glass. It's a pretty good return on your investment.
Tom Silva,Real golf isn't what you see on TV. This is golf.
Tom Silva,"It's funny, because people do not want to spend money on things they can't see, but if people would spend more money on something that would let them live comfortably and more efficiently, they would be happier homeowners."
Tom Silva,They were all different with their own challenges. The process is about seeing what is going to make a good story that will keep our viewers interested and educated and entertained.
Tom Silva,There's a cancer in the wood. We just don't know how far it goes.
Lee Silver,(Hill's performance) was the best point production by an individual in the conference championships in a long time.
Lee Silver,"In most cases, the kids came through with their best performances of the season. I was very happy with the marks we brought home."
Lee Silver,We're doing a better job of filling events and getting people closer to qualifying.
Lee Silver,Not that much to pay if you want to see how a disease affects a mammal or how a drug is going to work.
Michael Silver,There should be a plan and policy in place to address metadata management before you deploy Windows Vista.
Michael Silver,"It looks like they did, to some extent, what the Department of Justice couldn't. I could see where this could make it harder for Windows and Office groups to work together, and they do need to."
Michael Silver,"Supporting users on two-user interfaces may be too hard, so even if there is a slow roll out of Vista, there may need to be a faster roll out of Office [12]."
Ben Silverman,"Unlike television, where [networks] funded the content, and owned and exploited it, here the distributors aren't funding the content."
Ben Silverman,I remember taking a look at them 18 months ago and not being very impressed. Management has obviously executed very well. It was obviously a mistake to overlook them.
Ben Silverman,"The audience relates immediately with the kind of person a celebrity is. They have some sort of familiarity with the viewers. They know Tony Gonzalez is a football stud. When you're casting real people, you're trying to put them into a type. Here we go out and say this is a jock. The audience gets to know the characters quicker."
David Silverman,"With the increase in broadband penetration further enhancing how messages get delivered, we should continue to see a favorable environment for increased Internet ad spending."
David Silverman,The consistent growth in overall revenues shows marketers may be shifting more of their total advertising budgets to online.
David Silverman,Clearly advertisers are realizing the benefits of shifting more of their total advertising budgets to online.
David Silverman,"The consistent growth in overall revenues shows marketers may be shifting more of their total advertising budgets to online. This is a natural development as research shows more consumers are spending a larger percentage of their media time online, while the flow of advertising dollars follows."
Matt Silverman,Most of that is fueled by the great potential that we have on the field and on our roster.
Matt Silverman,It's our honor to be able to come out here and speak with our troops and learn more about the military operation coming out of Tampa.
Matt Silverman,Our goal is to make the Tampa Bay Devil Rays - or whatever we'll be called in 2007 - a source of pride for this area.
Matt Silverman,"I tend to take a common-sense approach to problem-solving, and oftentimes that involves the use of quantitative analysis. I do have an appreciation for the collection, analysis and application of information, both as it relates to our business operations and to our baseball operations."
Matt Silverman,Our commitment is to keep these players here for many years to come.
Matt Silverman,"We are pleased to begin a relationship with one of our country's premier cancer centers. We are particularly excited because of the community outreach initiatives that are integrated into this partnership. We are not only focused on bringing more marketing partners into the Rays family, but also developing relationships such as this, in which the community benefits as well."
Matt Silverman,"Our twin priorities are reconstituting the baseball department and getting new decision makers in there. Coming up with our own philosophy, which is going to be a blend of a lot of different philosophies on building a winning team, one that's going to be successful [not just] next year, but for years and years to come. And how we deploy our assets to make sure that happens."
Larry Silverstein,What is so spectacular is the opportunity to come together as we have in the last few days for the purpose of rebuilding the World Trade Center. It's of great significance to me and to all New Yorkers.
Larry Silverstein,"I can't tell you why government does what it does. In the private sector, this doesn't happen. If they are sincere about making a deal, there's nothing to prevent us from going right back to the table and getting it done. It's just that simple. And we're ready to do it today."
Larry Silverstein,There is no doubt that he will add yet another remarkable jewel in downtown's skyline.
Larry Silverstein,Norman Foster understands how to design a bold urban icon while simultaneously enhancing the environment and quality of life of the building's occupants.
Larry Silverstein,"We have zero commitments for 7 because it is too early,"
Larry Silverstein,"The city is not dead and can't be allowed to die, ... We owe [rebuilding] to our children and to our grandchildren."
Larry Silverstein,It is inexcusable that the Port Authority abruptly abandoned the talks (Tuesday) night without a plan to move forward. We are not sure where this leaves us now.
Larry Silverstein,"With today's agreement, we can now move forward with rebuilding the World Trade Center."
Shel Silverstein,And the tree was happy
Shel Silverstein,"I know a way to stay friends forever, There's really nothing to it, I tell you what to do, And you do it"
Shel Silverstein,"If you are a dreamer,come in. If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar, a hoper, a prayer, a magic-bean-buyer. If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire, for we have some flax-golden tales to spin. Come in! Come in!"
Shel Silverstein,"This bridge will only take you halfway there, to those mysterious lands you long to see. Through gypsy camps and swirling Arab fair, and moonlit woods where unicorns run free. So come and walk awhile with me and share the twisting trails and wonderous worlds Ive known. But this bridge will only take you halfway there. The last few steps you have to take alone."
Shel Silverstein,"Ricky was L but he's home with the flu,Lizzie, our O, had some homework to do,Mitchell, E prob'ly got lost on the way,So I'm all of the love that could make it today."
Shel Silverstein,"Tell me I'm clever, Tell me I'm kind, Tell me I'm talented, Tell me I'm cute, Tell me I'm sensitive, Graceful and wise, Tell me I'm perfect-- But tell me the truth."
Shel Silverstein,"Rockabye Baby, in the treetopDont you know a treetopis no safe place to rock?And who put you up there,and your cradle too?Baby,I think someone down herehas got it in for you!"
Shel Silverstein,"If the track is tough and the hill is rough, THINKING you can just ain't enough!"
Jon Sim,"We beat ourselves again. We've got a great team, but we have to put our work boots and our work hats on and do the digging in. We're not doing that for 60 minutes."
Jon Sim,"There's something about (playing) this team, I don't know. I'm excited we got the win. The goals are a bonus."
Jon Sim,"Their lack of communication surprised me. I put my head down and was going to start to come back, but the puck was laying there. I just turned quick, and fortunately Gags was there."
Brian Simmons,"Coach told us that it's going to be a good game, so we're going to practice hard. We're not going to just go in like they're sorry, like they're the worst team."
Brian Simmons,"We just let a couple big plays in the passing game hurt us. You can't do that. You have to keep your people in front of you. We didn't do that, and it hurt us."
Brian Simmons,"Not having a winning season, not going to the playoffs -- we've erased that history. Now at this point, we've got time to go and create a new history. We've already erased all of the bad stuff."
Brian Simmons,"It was nothing but fun, having fun out there. You really like to enjoy yourself while you're playing football. I was really enjoying it today."
Dan Simmons,"Writing, I'm convinced, should be a subversive activity - frowned on by the authorities - and not one cooed over and praised beyond common sense by some teacher."
Dan Simmons,"There's a unique bond of trust between readers and authors that I don't believe exists in any other art form; as a reader, I trust a novelist to give me his or her best effort, however flawed."
Dan Simmons,"The truth is, it's not a great career move to create a readership and then, in effect, abandon them."
Dan Simmons,"No one inspired me to write, but writer Harlan Ellison terrified me into getting published."
Dan Simmons,"Movie SF is, by definition, dumbed down - there have only been three or four SF movies in the history of film that aspire to the complexity of literary SF."
Dan Simmons,"It's one of the strangest attributes of this profession that when we writers get exhausted writing one thing, we relax by writing another."
Dan Simmons,"It's odd how violence and humor so often go together, isn't it?"
Dan Simmons,"It started 25 years ago, when I was teaching elementary school in a small town in Missouri."
Dan Simmons,"I really appreciated his theme of life evolving from one race of gods to another, with one power having to give way to another, as Hyperion must."
Dan Simmons,"I loved almost everything about being a teacher, but I was an unusual teacher."
Dan Simmons,I knew that I wanted to be a writer even before I knew exactly what being a writer entailed.
Dan Simmons,"I have more respect for The Iliad now than I've ever had, and I've always thought it was possibly the finest piece of literature there was."
Dan Simmons,"Finally, there's the simple fact that I would be bored silly if I read in only one genre or one type of author - so why write in only one form?"
Dan Simmons,But it's not just a game of finding literary references.
Dan Simmons,"But I think, and hope, that the novels can be understood and enjoyed as science fiction, on their own terms."
Dan Simmons,"As long as my sixth graders showed an average improvement of five years, the principal and district pretty much left me alone to create my own curriculum and teach whatever I wanted."
Gene Simmons,"And in music, it's the great aphrodisiac that says that even though I'm short, fat, ugly, bald, and... and I'm hung like a second-grader, but if I'm in a rock band, I've got a better than average chance of bedding you down than if I was a dentist."
Gene Simmons,My Dad the Rock Star.
Gene Simmons,No. Better research needed. Fire your research person. No fishnet stockings. Never. Not in this band.
Gene Simmons,"I'm forbidden fruit. Once you go to certain households, mommy doesn't want you to see that dirty man who sticks his tongue out and spits out blood and all that stuff."
Gene Simmons,"My mother is probably the wisest person I've ever known. She's not schooled, she's not well read. But she has a philosophy of life that makes well-read people seem like morons."
Gene Simmons,My skin is more beautiful than yours. I would be quite more popular in jail if I so chose.
Gene Simmons,You know why I'm pulling your leg? Because I can't touch it from where I am.
Gene Simmons,Life is too short to have anything but delusional notions about yourself.
Gene Simmons,"When you really think about it, I'm not delusional enough to think that what I do is important to life as we know it on this planet. No. But neither is what you do."
Gene Simmons,I'm in a weird band. We've done very well. The American Dream is alive and well.
Gene Simmons,"I wanted to be in a band that gave bang for the buck. I wanted to be in the band who didn't look like a bunch of guys who, you know, should be in a library studying for their finals."
Gene Simmons,"The makeup is simply an extension of the personality and colors, clothing, makeup all express something."
Gene Simmons,I was never interested in being a rock star. I always wanted to be Boris Karloff.
Gene Simmons,Rock is about finding who you are. You don't necessarily have to play your instrument very well at all. You can just barely get by and you can be in a rock band.
James Simmons,Our job is to get our client a job he wants to be at and where there is potential room for growth.
James Simmons,"I hope it's not a problem, ... We're getting a lot of evacuees at the Cajundome and Blackham Coliseum."
James Simmons,"Once the evaluation and assessment of a client's goals and abilities is complete, MERS Goodwill will physically help them find a job."
James Simmons,"It's a small truncated segment of the electorate, voters who are reasonably informed of the issues. I don't think the candidates have to do very much to win votes from those who share their views."
Michael Simmons,"It meant you were the sort of person who couldn't pay your bills -- that you were living above your means. Taking out an equity line has become common, prudent, easy."
Michael Simmons,Low-income students can come out of here feeling diminished.
Michael Simmons,To go somewhere else for your senior year would be really hard.
Rachel Simmons,"Gossip harms relationships and that's why it's bad. While we all do it at times, there's a point where it crosses the line and becomes bullying if it damages friendships and causes people to dislike someone."
Rachel Simmons,This creates a culture in which girls do not have social permission to express themselves.
Rachel Simmons,"Many girls intentionally perpetrate acts of aggression that go unseen by parents and teachers. Because they are so skilled at being subtle, girls can communicate a thousand words without saying anything. By rolling their eyes or turning their back on another girl, they can shut that other person out without being noticed by anyone else - even a concerned parent or teacher."
Richard Simmons,We trust the Lukens board of directors will recognize its fiduciary duties and accept our clearly superior offer.
Richard Simmons,It's an eerie thing. My childhood is being washed away.
Richard Simmons,"There'll always be some weird thing about eating four grapes before you go to bed, or drinking a special tea, or buying this little bean from El Salvador."
Richard Simmons,"One day I may be meeting you and hearing how you've changed your life by saying, 'Farewell to Fat'."
Richard Simmons,I've been going to shopping malls since I was on General Hospital.
Richard Simmons,"I think at the age of 50, everyone should write their own autobiography, ... There's just something about being half-a-century (old). And there are things I learned about myself that helped me a great deal when I wrote this book."
Russell Simmons,"I am very pleased to be involved with the Daniel Pearl Music Days committee because its message resonates with me on a very personal level. My own career is an example of the universal power of music, especially the power of Hip Hop, to bring people of different backgrounds together for a common purpose. I hope that my commitment to the Daniel Pearl Music Days committee will encourage all music lovers - both amateurs and professionals - to get involved with the Music Days performance network and contribute to the 'Harmony For Humanity' e-Stage."
Russell Simmons,"The commemoration deserves the respect and support of all people of good will who cherish the universal love of humanity, ... The time has come for the Hip-Hop community and all of us to come together and participate in a movement which will have a fundamental influence on the lives of this generation and generations to come."
Russell Simmons,"You'll see a lot of funny stuff, you'll see a lot of daddy-knows-best stuff, you'll see a lot of me and my wife trying to hold the family together."
Russell Simmons,We are excited to honor three individuals who have done so much to support the creativity of so many.
Russell Simmons,College kids go off to school and they get twisted with credit.
Russell Simmons,Seeing these heroes is inspiring. T.I. has authority.
Russell Simmons,"My experiences have been, from the very beginning, cultural and creative. And my business has been a way of exposing the culture, exposing the artists so that the world could hear and see them."
Russell Simmons,"I've been blessed to find people who are smarter than I am, and they help me to execute the vision I have."
Russell Simmons,"I want to promote poetry to the point where you got all the baldhead kids running around doing poetry, getting the music out of the way and having only words, the spoken word, and then see what happens."
Russell Simmons,I want to fight poverty and ignorance and give opportunity to those people who are locked out.
Russell Simmons,"I try to make my life about service, and hope that one day we can all 'see' a little better because God is with everyone and everywhere."
Russell Simmons,Poverty and lack of knowledge must be challenged.
Russell Simmons,Art is a way to express yourself and through that you can escape a bad situation.
Russell Simmons,Last year my wife got a Rolls-Royce.
Russell Simmons,"Look at all the billionaires. If I know 15 billionaires, I know 13 unhappy people."
Russell Simmons,"If you learn late, you pass it on to people so they can learn early. It's a step process."
Russell Simmons,Judgment of the people in the situation is not helpful. How can you help them is the question.
Russell Simmons,"Well, it's the last step of the civil rights movement: You know, wrap your hands around some money, right?"
Russell Simmons,"The thing about hip-hop is that it's from the underground, ideas from the underbelly, from people who have mostly been locked out, who have not been recognized."
Russell Simmons,Art allows people a way to dream their way out of their struggle.
Russell Simmons,Hip hop is from the underground. It's from the underbelly [of America]. The poetry [music] is an expression from people from the trailers to the projects whose stories are not told.
Chris Simms,"With a good season this year, I can strike it rich in the future."
Chris Simms,"When they feel they're blocked, they sit there and read the quarterback's eyes, ... They would just stop rushing, wait until I throw and jump up and knock the ball down. That shows they're a very aware team."
Chris Simms,"I would say our will to win, our belief in ourselves when the game is getting tight. Last year, we were in a lot of close games but for whatever reason we just didn't find ways to win them."
Phil Simms,I'm happy for him. I believe in his talent. I believe it's evident.
Phil Simms,No one else knew him like the Jets did. And it's important that you hire people you know sometimes because it gives everyone in the organization a level of comfort. You know this person has the level of belief in the things you want carried out.
Phil Simms,"I'm not sure, and I've done quite a few of his games. How much is he bluffing? How much is real? I know over the years, a couple of teams have cracked his code. They knew exactly what he was doing. But that's only good for one game. He changes his stuff a lot."
Phil Simms,"What impresses me is the energy it takes, emotionally and physically, to constantly do that. To do that in a game, that means you've got to do it in practice, too. What if he's under the weather a bit one week?"
Phil Simms,I liked the energy I saw in preseason. It had a different feel to it.
Phil Simms,Talk radio has almost ruined the sports fan.
Phil Simms,"Of course it looks bad when you're not executing. When things go bad, it's not going to look good."
Phil Simms,"I criticize a lot of players and coaches. But I back it up with facts. A lot of times guys get mad at me because someone told them what I said. I say, 'You're wrong: Go check the tape.'"
Phil Simms,"Sometimes, it's good to have a tremendous star, because everyone understands he has to get the ball."
Phil Simms,I'm not a guy that believes you've got to have a lot of experience to have success in the playoffs.
Phil Simms,I haven't thought about it. I'm not capable of deep thinking.
Carly Simon,"My father was a classical pianist, and my mother was a singer of just about everything."
Carly Simon,"I used the physical scar of my breast cancer operation, the scar that I have across my chest as a metaphor for all kinds of scars."
Carly Simon,I think that I've got some pretty bad reviews on albums or songs that later proved themselves.
Herbert Simon,"I started off thinking that maybe the social sciences ought to have the kinds of mathematics that the natural sciences had. That works a little bit in economics because they talk about costs, prices and quantities of goods. But it doesn't work a darn for the other social sciences; you lose most of the content when you translate them to numbers."
Herbert Simon,"The simplest scheme of evolution is one that depends on two processes; a generator and a test. The task of the generator is to produce variety, new forms that have not existed previously, whereas the task of the test is to cull out the newly generated forms so that only those that are well fitted to the environment will survive."
Herbert Simon,"What a person cannot do he will not do, no matter how much he wants to do it. Normative economics has shown that exact solutions to the larger optimization problems of the real world are simply not within reach or sight. ... the behavior of an artificial system may be strongly influenced by the limits of its adaptive capacities."
Herbert Simon,Forget about Nobel prizes; they aren't really very important.
Herbert Simon,"In the computer field, the moment of truth is a running program; all else is prophecy."
Herbert Simon,Maybe we ought to have a world in which things are divided between people kind of fairly.
Herbert Simon,Anything that gives us new knowledge gives us an opportunity to be more rational.
Herbert Simon,Behaving like a manager means having command of the whole range of management skills and applying them as they become appropriate.
Herbert Simon,"I don't care how big and fast computers are, they're not as big and fast as the world."
Herbert Simon,"There are no morals about technology at all. Technology expands our ways of thinking about things, expands our ways of doing things. If we're bad people we use technology for bad purposes and if we're good people we use it for good purposes."
Herbert Simon,Learning is any change in a system that produces a more or less permanent change in its capacity for adapting to its environment.
Herbert Simon,Human knowledge has been changing from the word go and people in certain respects behave more rationally than they did when they didn't have it. They spend less time doing rain dances and more time seeding clouds.
Herbert Simon,"Most of us really aren't horribly unique. There are 6 billion of us. Put 'em all in one room and very few would stand out as individuals. So maybe we ought to think of worth in terms of our ability to get along as a part of nature, rather than being the lords over nature."
Herbert Simon,"The world is vast, beautiful, and fascinating, even awe-inspiring - but impersonal. It demands nothing of me, and allows me to demand nothing of it."
Herbert Simon,"One of the first rules of science is if somebody delivers a secret weapon to you, you better use it."
Herbert Simon,"All correct reasoning is a grand system of tautologies, but only God can make direct use of that fact."
Herbert Simon,"The social sciences, I thought, needed the same kind of rigor and the same mathematical underpinnings that had made the hard sciences so brilliantly successful."
Herbert Simon,One finds limits by pushing them.
Herbert Simon,"Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design."
Herbert Simon,No one has characterized market mechanisms better than Friedrich von Hayek.
Herbert Simon,"The engineer, and more generally the designer, is concerned with how things ought to be - how they ought to be in order to attain goals, and to function."
Herbert Simon,"Technology may create a condition, but the questions are what do we do about ourselves. We better understand ourselves pretty clearly and we better find ways to like ourselves."
Herbert Simon,"Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves."
Herbert Simon,The proper study of mankind is the science of design.
Herbert Simon,Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.
Howard Simon,"The truth is, it goes much further than that,"
Howard Simon,What the Registered Traveler achieves is convenience for some but at the expense of security for all. It's a false sense of security.
Howard Simon,"There was harsh, intimidating language that appears to be very subjective and open-ended. ... The club almost has the right to do whatever it wants, at its option. That's how complicated the language is. The other clubs simply have one line that states it is subject to the player passing a physical. That's what Pittsburgh's document has."
Howard Simon,"I can't believe the doctors in Collier County would agree to practice with one hand tied behind their back. I'm not sure (carving out treatment exceptions) is permitted, and it's definitely unethical."
Howard Simon,"What we're dealing with is officers on street patrol, which is more effective and more consistent with the Constitution, ... We'll have to see how it is implemented."
John Simon,"Because it's romantic, it's dashing, it's a spectacle. It's not bad musically. It's not great. But it's good enough. There's even an operatic aspect to it, which might fascinate certain semi-sophisticated audiences."
John Simon,We can draw hypotheses but no definitive conclusions as to why red heads have a greater epidemiological risk than dark-haired groups.
John Simon,It seems this has the potential to be a central artery.
John Simon,"If we do the right things from a policy perspective, the results will speak for themselves."
John Simon,"He doesn't have a lot of box speed, so he tries to rush up and get around the other dogs. He needs a lane to run in."
John Simon,"There's a danger of that. I'd rather deal with that than not do well. Last year, we were done after pool play and went home. I'd rather have the problem of having big heads or peaking too early."
John Simon,We were very interested in determining if there are differences in the ability of the two kinds of human pigments to activate oxygen. Activating oxygen can produce compounds called radicals that put oxidative stress on cells. Such stress could ultimately lead to cancer and other diseases.
Neil Simon,"I am most alive and most fulfilled sitting alone in a room, hoping that those words forming on paper in the Smith Corona will be the first perfect play ever written in a single draft I suspect that I shall keep writing in a vain search for the perfec"
Neil Simon,"Don't listen to those who say, you taking too big a chance. Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor, and it would surely be rubbed out by today. Most important, don't listen when the little voice of fear inside you rears its ugly head and says. they all smarter than you out there. They're more talented, they're taller, blonder, prettier, luckier, and they have connections. I firmly believe that if you follow a path that interests you, not to the exclusion of love, sensitivity, and cooperation with others, but with the strength of conviction that you can move others by your own efforts, and do not make success or failure the criteria by which you live, the chances are you'll be a person worthy of your own respects."
Neil Simon,"No, no, ... It's hard enough just doing one of the parts."
Neil Simon,"Take care of him. And make him feel important. And if you can do that, you'll have a happy and wonderful marriage. Like two out of every ten couples."
Neil Simon,Sudden money is going from zero to two hundred dollars a week. The rest doesn't count.
Neil Simon,"You must realize that honorary degrees are given generally to people whose SAT scores were too low to get them into schools the regular way. As a matter of fact, it was my SAT scores that led me into my present vocation in life, comedy."

Paul Simon,"A man sees what he wants to see, And disregards the rest"
Paul Simon,"Some people never say the words 'I love you'. It's not their style to be so bold. Some people never say those words: 'I love you' But, like a child, they're longing to be told."
Paul Simon,"If you were to pick a role model on the court, living or dead, what role model or composite role model would it be?"
Paul Simon,"Faith is an island in the setting sun, But proof is the bottom line for everyone"
Paul Simon,"Fat Charlie the archangel files for divorce, he says, well this will eat up a year of my life, and there's all that weight to be lost."
Paul Simon,"Some people never say the words 'I love you' It's not their style to be so bold. Some people never say those words: 'I love you' But, like a child, they're longing to be told."
Paul Simon,"Yesterday, it was my birthday I hung one more year on the line I should be depressed My life's a mess But I'm Having A Good Time..."
Paul Simon,"Yesterday, it was my birthday  I hung one more year on the line  I should be depressed  My life's a mess  But I'm Having A Good Time..."
Paul Simon,"If you can get humor and seriousness at the same time, you've created a special little thing, and that's what I'm looking for, because if you get pompous, you lose everything."
Paul Simon,I try to open up my heart as much as I can and keep a real keen eye out that I don't get sentimental. I think we're all afraid to reveal our hearts. It's not at all in fashion.
Paul Simon,I don't like fashion. It's very heartless.
Paul Simon,"One of the things that upset me was some of the criticism leveled at Simon and Garfunkel. I always took exception to it, but actually I agree with a lot of it."
Paul Simon,Having a track record to live up to and the history of successes had become a hindrance. It becomes harder to break out of what people expect you to do.
Paul Simon,Facts can be turned into art if one is artful enough.
Paul Simon,"By the time I was 12 or 13, I felt that I was special, because I could play the guitar and write songs."
Paul Simon,"Between the ages of 15 and 22, I had made only one very minor hit, so I expected everything to be a flop. I was utterly amazed that The Sound of Silence was a big hit."
Paul Simon,"Being an artist doesn't mean that you're a good artist. That was the bargain I first made with myself: I'd say, I'm an artist, but I'm not really very good."
Paul Simon,"It's a big error to think that because you like somebody's work, you're going to like him."
Paul Simon,"Anybody can do bad work, but not everybody does good work."
Paul Simon,"A man sees what he wants to see, And disregards the rest."
Paul Simon,"All lies and jests, still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest."
Paul Simon,Improvisation is too good to leave to chance.
Paul Simon,Who am I to blow against the wind?
Paul Simon,Why am I so soft in the middle when the rest of my life is so hard?

Paul Simon,My life so common it disappears and sometimes even music cannot substitute for tears.
Paul Simon,"You want to be a writer, don't know how or when? Find a quiet place, use a humble pen."
Paul Simon,The thought that life could be better is woven indelibly into our hearts and our brains.
Paul Simon,"Music is forever; music should grow and mature with you, following you right on up until you die."
Nina Simone,How do you explain what it feels like to get on the stage and make poetry that you know sinks into the hearts and souls of people who are unable to express it?
Nina Simone,Desegregation is a joke.
Nina Simone,"When I was studying... there weren't any black concert pianists. My choices were intuitive, and I had the technique to do it. People have heard my music and heard the classic in it, so I have become known as a black classical pianist."
Nina Simone,Greed has driven the world crazy. And I think I'm lucky that I have a place over here that I can call home.
Nina Simone,"This may be a dream, but I'll say it anyway: I was supposed to be married last year, and I bought a gown. When I meet Nelson Mandela, I shall put on this gown and have the train of it removed and put aside, and kiss the ground that he walks on and then kiss his feet."
Nina Simone,"I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important."
Nina Simone,"Once I understood Bach's music, I wanted to be a concert pianist. Bach made me dedicate my life to music, and it was that teacher who introduced me to his world."
Nina Simone,"I think the rich will eventually have to cave in too, because the economic situation around the world is not gonna tolerate the United States being on top forever."
Nina Simone,"From the beginning, it has been a no-no for a black man to touch a white woman."
Nina Simone,There's no excuse for the young people not knowing who the heroes and heroines are or were.
Nina Simone,"I would like a man now who is rich, and who can give me a boat-a sailboat. I want to own it and let him pay for it. My first love is the sea and water, not music. Music is second."
Nina Simone,"The worst thing about that kind of prejudice... is that while you feel hurt and angry and all the rest of it, it feeds you self-doubt. You start thinking, perhaps I am not good enough."
Nina Simone,"To most white people, jazz means black and jazz means dirt, and that's not what I play. I play black classical music."
Nina Simone,I think the rich are too rich and the poor are too poor. I don't think the black people are going to rise at all; I think most of them are going to die.
Nina Simone,"I think if I were over there in America, protest music would be more important. But I'm not going."
Nina Simone,I'm a real rebel with a cause.
Nina Simone,Jazz is a white term to define black people. My music is black classical music.
Nina Simone,I don't like rap music at all. I don't think it's music. It's just a beat and rapping.
Margarita Simonyan,"All too often, the view of Russia does not correspond to reality: information on Russia is either distorted or incomplete or just nonsense."
Margarita Simonyan,"We will mainly have Russian news, but we will also show international events and express them from our point of view here."
Margarita Simonyan,"Today, we're beginning the technical broadcast, but we don't want to give a definite date for the full launch now because of problems we may still encounter."

Ashlee Simpson,"I don't really mind what people say about my love life or anything like that, but the one thing is that, yes, I do sing and write all my own music. That is something that I hold really dear. And yeah, I made a fool of myself in front of the world, but it was also great to pick myself back up and go on tour."
Ashlee Simpson,"We all had a great Thanksgiving, all the family was together and we had a wonderful time,"

Ashlee Simpson,"I felt like the character really didn't care about her appearance and how she looked and whatnot, and I really wanted to feel that way, ... Undiscovered."
Ashlee Simpson,"I felt like the character really didn't care about her appearance and how she looked and whatnot and I really wanted to feel that way,"
Ashlee Simpson,"When you see someone you love with somebody else, your heart kind of falls to the ground."
Ashlee Simpson,"I think you get noticed a lot more as a brunette, but I don't know. People approach me, I think, but maybe it's because of the reality show."
Ashlee Simpson,"Well, I wouldn't let anybody take advantage of me anyway. But my mom had my back."
Homer Simpson,"If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing."
Homer Simpson,Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.

Homer Simpson,"Olive oil ... asparagus ... if your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."
Homer Simpson,"Owww look at me Marge, I'm making people Happy! I'm the magical man, from Happy Land, who lives in a gumdrop house on Lolly Pop Lane!!!!...... By the way I was being sarcastic..."
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no, Lisa. If adults don't like their jobs, they don't go on strike. They just go in every day and do it really half-assed."

Scott Simpson,"I certainly hope we've found our belief to win. When you lose a couple in a row, you lose your belief."
Tom Simpson,I think I could certainly look at that as a school corporation.
Tom Simpson,To (win) three first round matches and really have four extremely quality matches is excellent. Everybody contributed along the way.

Harry Sinden,This didn't have a purpose to it. It was becoming a rather awkward situation with the general manager of the team and myself and ownership. We were contemplating making this move just recently. We knew we were probably going to make it and asking somebody to continue on is just not the right thing to do.
Harry Sinden,Management traded away whatever they felt would improve the team.
Harry Sinden,He was a gentleman as he's always been.

James Sinegal,It's even more important to hire good people and give them good jobs and good wages. They are the people who are going to run your business.
James Sinegal,It doesn't do Costco any good if nobody can afford to buy anything.
James Sinegal,"In the final analysis, you get what you pay for."
James Sinegal,"If we take care of the business and keep our eye on the goal line, the stock price will take care of itself."

Nikki Sixx,"We go to do the Billboard Music Awards to be a presenter, and we walk on stage, and we get a standing ovation from the industry."
Nikki Sixx,I forgive my mom for being a psycho and my dad for being a loser.
Ike Skelton,We were told that everyone's doing OK. We don't have to worry unnecessarily.
Ike Skelton,It's been a long ride ... to get us to this point in the base-closure process. This journey has been more difficult than it needed to be.
Ike Skelton,The Army is stretched thin and there is a potential that we could break the force if we are not careful.
Red Skelton,"A fellow told me he was going to hang-glider school. He said, 'I've been going for three months.' I said, 'How many successful jumps do you need to make before you graduate?' He said, 'All of them.'"
Red Skelton,"Exercise? I get in on the golf course. When I see my friends collapse, I run for the paramedics."
Red Skelton,"If by chance some day you're not feeling well and you should remember some silly thing I've said or done and it brings back a smile to your face or a chuckle to your heart, then my purpose as your clown has been fulfilled."
Red Skelton,I personally believe we were put her to build and not to destroy.
Red Skelton,"I personally believe that each of us was put here for a purpose - to build not to destroy. If I can make people smile, then I have served my purpose for God."
Red Skelton,I left home because I was hungry.
Red Skelton,Congress: Bingo with billions.
Red Skelton,"Any kid will run any errand for you, if you ask at bedtime."
Red Skelton,"No matter what your heartache may be, laughing helps you forget it for a few seconds."
Red Skelton,Live by this credo: have a little laugh at life and look around you for happiness instead of sadness. Laughter has always brought me out of unhappy situations.
Red Skelton,"I'm nuts and I know it. But so long as I make 'em laugh, they ain't going to lock me up."
Red Skelton,God's children and their happiness are my reasons for being.
Red Skelton,"Exercise? I get it on the golf course. When I see my friends collapse, I run for the paramedics."
Red Skelton,"Our principles are the springs of our actions. Our actions, the springs of our happiness or misery. Too much care, therefore, cannot be taken in forming our principles."
Red Skelton,"All men make mistakes, but married men find out about them sooner."
Scott Skiles,"Well, I normally err on the side of telling the truth, so I'm going to tell it. I'm really embarrassed by what happened out there. I thought we came out in the second half, we were pretty much as soft as I've seen. We played with very little heart, very little aggressiveness."
Scott Skiles,"Every game he plays in, he's ... one of the toughest guys on the floor. He's got size, strength, athleticism, and he can play. He gives them one of the best players in the game, and you can see that they've played with a little more pop since he's been with them. He seems to have an effect on their group, the way they get after it a little bit."
Scott Skiles,"We waited too long to start playing. We kind of sleep-walked through 2-1/2 quarters. Then near the end of the third quarter, we finally started getting aggressive. We started driving the ball, and our defense picked up. We clawed ourselves back into the game."
Scott Skiles,"Hopefully, this is something he can put behind him and it won't be a factor the rest of the season."
Scott Skiles,Banks speeds up the tempo a little bit. He can really push it and create a lot of problems. Davis is a great scorer and a great athletic wing player.
Scott Skiles,"It took us a little longer this year for the guys to really start taking a lot of pride in it. But they did and they got it accomplished. I bet if you went back in the recent 20 or 30 years in the league, nobody's ever done it with guys this young. When you think about that, it's a great accomplishment for a young team."
Scott Skiles,"This was a very difficult practice, and they're going to continue to be difficult. We're just not playing at an intensity level that's necessary for us to win. The guys know it. It's something we've got to get corrected."
Scott Skiles,"We just have to watch him -- that's why he's taking days off of practice -- and make sure he's not overdoing it. But if he's able to play, we'll play him and worry about each game one by one. If he has to overplay tonight to win the game, that's what we'll have to do."
Scott Skiles,He was in a lot of pain when he left the building.
Scott Skiles,"In my mind, he's the most improved player in the league."
Scott Skiles,"The name that comes to mind when I played is [Bill] Laimbeer. I mean, they're two totally different players. And then [Dennis] Rodman here. Those are two guys that tended to get on people's nerves, some people thought they were dirty players or whatever."
Scott Skiles,"We need every win. The problem is we started the second half like five blind men. We were not executing, not talking to each other. Maybe one half is good enough for us right now. We have to get that rectified."
Scott Skiles,There are no magic bullets against him.
Scott Skiles,"It means the guys are working very hard at it and it's paying off. There's no magic in that, really. It's just that we have the a system that we teach, and the guys have spent the time getting it down. We've spent an awful lot of time on it."
Scott Skiles,I just sprinkled the magic dust on them and they took off. I don't remember what I said.
Scott Skiles,"I get the impression sometimes that people think there's some sort of magic dust that the coach can sprinkle over the guys to make them aware of everything. We talk to our guys every day about exactly where we are [in the race]. With certain groups, that works really well. With others, it might not."
Scott Skiles,We just waited too long to start playing. We kind of just sleepwalked through 2 1/2 quarters. Then near the end of the third quarter we finally started getting aggressive. We started driving the ball and our defense picked up.
Scott Skiles,"I don't know how badly he was hurt. So no, I wasn't surprised."
Scott Skiles,"Jason Williams, sort of in a quiet manner, hurt us."
Scott Skiles,"We know we're not a title-contending team right now, but in the history of teams winning titles they tend to take their lumps for a little while before they finally get there."
Scott Skiles,"I'm really embarrassed by what happened out there. We played with very little heart and very little aggressiveness. We came out at halftime totally casual, just kind of winging the ball all over the place, acting like they were going to roll over and give us the game."
Scott Skiles,"I would never commit ahead of time that he wasn't going to play. I would hate to tell somebody they're not going to play or their minutes would be limited, then all of a sudden 6 minutes into the game put him out there. That wouldn't be fair. I think it's better that he stayed ready, but unfortunately he didn't get in."
Scott Skiles,I'm happy for Tyson. I'm sure a good amount of grief he's gone through has been self-imposed. He's kind of tortured himself for some of the games he hasn't played well in. He's really broke out the last three games and he was obviously excellent again tonight.
Scott Skiles,"We had a nice rhythm going. We just started fouling. We had about 10 more field goals at the half, yet it was still a game. Usually you are running away with a game like that. It is obviously a big problem."
Scott Skiles,"Fouling him and putting him on the line makes him theoretically shoot less field goals and puts him on the line, but it also puts their team in the penalty earlier every quarter. And then other guys are going to the line. ... So if we're just fouling Shaq sort of indiscriminately, it can be a long night."
Scott Skiles,"At one point we had 11 field goals and eight of them were assisted. I thought our ball movement was good again, we played very unselfishly in general and we did what we had to do. We talked about trying to put them down early at least. It doesn't always work out the way you talk about it, but at least you get a nice lead and see how they react."
Scott Skiles,We're three games down with 17 to go and two tough ones this weekend. That's why it's the NBA ? it's a tough business. We got to respond now.
Scott Skiles,"He could definitely help us by practicing, but I don't know why we would even fool around with that [now]. The only way we could consider that is if the medical people said there was absolutely no chance it would hurt him."
Scott Skiles,"For whatever reason, we are not fighting back when other teams give us a blow."
Scott Skiles,He's setting off a chain of events that we're having a hard time dealing with.
Scott Skiles,We've got to do a better job with that chain of events.
Scott Skiles,"His personality has definitely come out this year, there's no doubt about it. He's much more comfortable around the guys. With the coaches, we could always have a basketball conversation with him last year because he understood the basketball terminology. But just as far as other conversations, it wasn't terribly difficult but it's much more easy now."
Scott Skiles,A.D.'s leadership presence is definitely something we've missed. There's no doubt about that. And Griff was very important to our team. We miss that (veteran leadership).
Scott Skiles,But we've all made spur-of-the-moment decisions that maybe we look back on and wish we hadn't made.
Scott Skiles,I suppose that's a good question. I don't know. Would there be a conflict of interest there because he was in Washington? I really haven't given that a whole lot of thought.
Scott Skiles,"With our group, we've found that this works for us. Nobody's complained. We don't have much of a complaining group."
Scott Skiles,"Luther's been great. I liked watching him in college. I think he's a great all-around player. My feeling is, wherever his career is going, he's probably going to continue to get minutes. He looks like a good pro guard to me."
Scott Skiles,I just read a couple of [Raptors coach] Sam Mitchell quotes that sounded like he was going to be there.
Scott Skiles,"Typical dad stuff, ... Spending time with my two boys, going to their little league games. And following the NBA, like always."
Scott Skiles,"We'd like to come out and win the first quarter. Both games, they've given us a body blow right off the jump and we just haven't been ready enough."
Scott Skiles,He's tougher than he looks. His body is slight still because of his age [21]. And he's mentally tough.
Scott Skiles,"We did a great job of collapsing and a great job on the glass. We had a big advantage on the boards and Tyson was a big part of that, especially on the offensive end. We were all scrappy tonight."
Jeffrey Skilling,"So I told Vince he didn't have to worry, we have plenty of cops in (the group)."
Jeffrey Skilling,I can understand what they need to do. Their families are at risk. Their lives are at risk. I can understand where they're coming from.
Jeffrey Skilling,I'll always regret that I left when I left.
Jeffrey Skilling,I was not aware of the huge problems during most of the first quarter. I was out of town.
Jeffrey Skilling,You can never say everything you want to say. I feel I had a fair opportunity to explain a lot of the questions.
Jeffrey Skilling,He was a good guy. He was very good at what he did. He had a good sense of humor.
Jeffrey Skilling,"It's been a tough six years, it's been a really hard six years."
Jeffrey Skilling,"If we don't do this, the books that will get written will be wrong, like the books that have been written so far. I am innocent of all of these charges and I will fight for that for a long time."

B. F. Skinner,The way positive reinforcement is carried out is more important than the amount.
B. F. Skinner,I did not direct my life. I didn't design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That's what life is.

Todd Skinner,"I say it's a reflection not just on me but the whole program. It's something the whole program should be proud of because not just one person can do it. You have to have the parents, the coaching staff, the students and the support from the community and I really think we are starting to get that."
Todd Skinner,He's only a freshman and for him to go out there and beat someone that had 40-something wins and only three losses that was a big momentum match for us. We were pleased with that.
Todd Skinner,Bobby did an excellent job tonight. He's a clutch guy. He's been wrestling for three years and you have to expect that from your varsity wrestlers. He's been in the clutch before and he helped bring it home tonight.
Todd Skinner,"It's a great feeling. As tough as our conference is, to go 7-0 is a great accomplishment. It's nice to have the seniors win it for you. That's real special and Sam is a special wrestler. All the seniors are special. We had some matches that could have gone either way. Some of them we won, others we lost. We stepped up and rose to the occasion."
Dick Skrinjar,It's a best practice for the taxpayers of Pittsburgh. We want the highest level of service. It makes us more effective and productive.
Dick Skrinjar,"Rest assured, we will maximize the opportunity. This is an international event."
Dick Skrinjar,We were looking for the best people to do the job and put Pittsburgh on the right track. It represents the opening day lineup.
Dick Skrinjar,Humor is my mechanism for dealing with the hard reality of the world.
Dick Skrinjar,Salvation from outside the area for economic development hasn't worked. You've got to grow the companies and people you have here.
Dick Skrinjar,Guy's record of public service and his achievements speak for themselves.
Ken Slappy,That's where the game turned. Just the pressure of us running the ball up the floor every time put the pressure on them to stop us. I think it got to them in the third quarter.
Ken Slappy,We have to be able to take the big men out of the game. But I think the problem was we played at Columbia's tempo.
Ken Slappy,"I understand that (football) is his focus, but he's a good athlete and in basketball you can always use good athletes. He's 6-2 and he's tough. I can put him in the game and he won't be afraid."
Tom Slater,"The talent is there. Some days it shows up and some days it doesn't. When you talk about teams that perform consistently day in and day out, it's usually teams that have a lot of experience."
Tom Slater,"Up and down the lineup, we didn't have enough quality at-bats."
Tom Slater,We feel as he gets back to full strength there's going to be some real potential there.
Tom Slater,What an outstanding pitching performance by Clarence Nicely. He came out and dominated the strike zone and really got us into the game. Clarence came into a very hostile South Alabama environment and pitched his tail off. That was a big-time performance by him.
Tom Slater,He's not felt very good since he threw Saturday. His arm feels great. The problem is he has some pain in his side.
Tom Slater,"I thought our kids really competed and played hard today. Evan did a great job in the start, and Luke did a tremendous job of keeping us in the game."
Tom Slater,Obviously we brought in a large class. We're going to get on the field this fall and determine some roles.
Tom Slater,"As you get older, you become more consistent. With a first-year player, every day is an adventure. You never know which guys are going to show up. I wouldn't say I get frustrated --It's just part of the process."
Tom Slater,"We've shown the ability to win a couple, but we also have the ability to lose to just about anybody."

Mike Slive,"For those who feel you have to go deep into the tournament to validate [your success], this does that. But we've been doing this for a long time."
Mike Slive,"I was very impressed with the culture of the committee. You leave your hat at the door, so to speak, and do the best that you can with the material that's in front of you. There's a lot of information and the data is used in a way that's very efficient in terms of comparing teams. Then you have subjective impressions and the final analysis."
Mike Slive,To make it a BCS issue devalues the conversation. It is not a BCS subject but an issue for the Division I commissioners to address. It has clearly moved from the back burner to the front.
Mike Slive,"We'll evaluate everybody. But in terms of the work ethic and the commitment of our officials, I think it's very strong."
Mike Slive,One of the great things about the Southeastern Conference is our fans and our support -- the importance of college football. On occasion that exuberance goes over the top. What we'd ultimately like to do is channel it on the field.
Mike Slive,"The conference didn't have to take any action of any kind,"
Mike Slive,I can't think that far ahead. Just having two of our teams at the Final Four is quite an accomplishment in itself.
Alfred Sloan,"The greatest real thrill that life offers is to create, to construct, to develop something useful. Too often we fail to recognize and pay tribute to the creative spirit. It is that spirit that creates our jobs."
Alfred Sloan,"There has to be this pioneer, the individual who has the courage, the ambition to overcome the obstacles that always develop when one tries to do something worthwhile, especially when it is new and different."
Alfred Sloan,Bedside manners are no substitute for the right diagnosis.
Alfred Sloan,"In any organization men would move up from the bottom to the top. That develops loyalty, ambition and talent, because there is a chance for promotion."
Alfred Sloan,"Competition is the final price determinant and competitive prices may result in profits which force you to accept a rate of return less than you hoped for, or for that matter to accept temporary losses."
Alfred Sloan,A car for every purse and purpose.
Alfred Sloan,If we are all in agreement on the decision - then I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.
Jerry Sloan,"He's progressed a great deal. The biggest thing was understanding what we're doing. He's a lively guy. A little wild sometimes. But he's becoming more under control, doing more things that really help his teammates."
Jerry Sloan,"He was the one that really wanted to be traded. I mean I wasn't looking to trade the guy. But if a guy wants to get out and is probably not happy here, what else can you do?"
Jerry Sloan,I don't know if you call it leadership or what have you. But he's just got some toughness about him. He's had to work hard and those are the things you can't make someone do. You have to want to do that.
Jerry Sloan,"It looked like we didn't belong. They just waxed us. Our guys looked afraid, and I hate to use that word. This is one of the most disappointing games I've ever been involved in that had some significance."
Jerry Sloan,"We couldn't seem to do too much against their zone, but we kept playing hard."
Jerry Sloan,"Hopefully, this gives us some confidence to try to get better, that's the biggest thing. We've had pretty good success when we run our offense properly. Teams that play playoff-type basketball know what tough execution is and how to do it."
Jerry Sloan,"Our guys kept thinking, 'We have a chance. We have a chance.' That is so huge in this business. I hope we learned something from that tonight."
Jerry Sloan,"When we did go inside, it was kind of like an adventure in there with the way we shot the ball a few times to see if we could get it up on the glass. They did a terrific job standing us up and taking us out of our offense and we settled for that."
Jerry Sloan,"It gives him a tremendous advantage, because good players have the ability to do different things. Teams can scout you, but that scouting report doesn't do you much good if you tend to play (defense) just one way."
Ed Slott,If you've planned a late wedding it may pay to put it off a few days into 2000 because the savings over (both) your lifetimes may pay for a few weddings for the kids.
Ed Slott,"You've got to watch your income this year like no other year, ... Your Tax Questions Answered."
Ed Slott,It's the best motivation to save for retirement that we've seen in America. Everybody should be in the Roth game if they can.
Ed Smart,"My satisfaction will be seeing him behind bars, not back out on the street to hurt anyone again. If he wants to be the way he is, so be it, and let him waste away in a mental hospital."
Ed Smart,I had some strong feelings that she was still out there.
Ed Smart,"Keep your eyes open for her. We still feel as strongly as ever that Elizabeth is out there, that she is still waiting for us to find her."
Elizabeth Smart,"We don't know where the perpetrator went through or went out, and the police are trying to take care of that,"
Elizabeth Smart,"I had no knowledge of his background whatsoever, ... I never, ever would have hired him had I known that."
Elizabeth Smart,"My satisfaction will be seeing him behind bars, not back out on the street to hurt anyone again, ... If he wants to be the way he is so be it, and let him waste away in a mental hospital."
Eleanor Smeal,"In the '60s, to say this obvious fact that women were treated unequally was to make yourself the object of scorn and ridicule."

Eleanor Smeal,"She defined the problem, and then she had the courage to do something about it."
Eleanor Smeal,"Move over a little more gracefully, boys!"
Lewis Smedes,"Forgiving does not erase the bitter past. A healed memory is not a deleted memory. Instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future."
Lewis Smedes,"It takes one person to forgive, it takes two people to be reunited."
Lewis Smedes,You can forgive someone almost anything. But you cannot tolerate everything... We don't have to tolerate what people do just because we forgive them for doing it. Forgiving heals us personally. To tolerate everything only hurts us all in the long run.
Lewis Smedes,Vengeance is having a videotape planted in your soul that cannot be turned off. It plays the painful scene over and over again inside your mind... And each time it plays you feel the clap of pain again... Forgiving turns off the videotape of pained memory. Forgiving sets you free.
Lewis Smedes,"When we forgive evil we do not excuse it, we do not tolerate it, we do not smother it. We look the evil full in the face, call it what it is, let its horror shock and stun and enrage us, and only then do we forgive it."
Tavis Smiley,I'm trying to get to a point here of how much progress we've made in this business. Were you able to find that diverse crew that you wanted?
Tavis Smiley,"I'm delighted. I don't know if he is, but I'm delighted to welcome him back to the show, this time here in person in our studios in L.A."
Tavis Smiley,How do you grow up in the shadow of a guy-I want to talk about the movie in a second-but how do you grow up in the shadow of a guy who really is a legend in his own time?
Tavis Smiley,Give that to me so I can get out of here.
Tavis Smiley,"All kinds of folk, as you can imagine, have had things to say-as you well know-over the last week and a half about what you said."
Tavis Smiley,"12, 13, you still lost your virginity. I don't care how old you were."
Al Smith,"You look at your own individual situation and visualize yourself being trapped in that house with no power and no water, and in the winter time, with no heat."
Al Smith,"Jim and I both believe ... that if there was a reasonable price opportunity to make this buy, that people in Lexington with money would be standing in line to take part."
Al Smith,"The music industry is constantly evolving to find new ways to reach our customer, the music fan. The number of possibilities for this is very exciting, and we look forward to working with Universal to discover the best opportunities for consumers and our businesses."
Al Smith,Not a problem. We feel like we can raise the money.
Al Smith,"You take care of you and your family first. Then you go to your neighborhood, and then you spread it on out within the community."
Al Smith,"I still have the energy to do it. I was asked not to retire and told they might be able to put together the package I'd want. When I told my wife (Bonnie), she said, 'It's like we're divorced now. If you want a divorce?' So then I weighed my options."
Al Smith,"U.S. History, World History, Geography, Law, Economics and Psychology."
Al Smith,He raised the standards of everybody in the business.
Al Smith,Where are the (condo residents) going to eat or shop? The (business) opportunity is there. What happens now is up to us.
Al Smith,"Pulling the plug on the BlackBerry could cost corporate America millions of dollars. The BlackBerry is more than e-mail but a handheld office, and if you shut down the BlackBerry, you shut off the data that powers American business."
Alex Smith,"It's the same type of technology, now just on steroids."
Alex Smith,"I can't say enough for things (Tim) has done and the kind of person he has been, because it would have been very easy for him to have a lot of harsh feelings for me and he hasn't. He has helped me tremendously and this will give me a chance to learn more from him."
Alex Smith,"I think a big thing with me is improvement. I'm young, and willing to do whatever it takes to get better."
Alex Smith,"It was definitely funny. But compared to his other seasons, it wasn't as good. I guess because with the other seasons, everything seemed so new. They really weren't as funny as his older stuff."
Alex Smith,"I think they were reading a rookie quarterback's eyes, and a few times I gave myself away. I've got to learn when to force some things, and when to throw things away. I talked to Peyton (afterward), and he says it's going to get better."
Alex Smith,"I'm excited. My whole family is coming down [from Seattle]. This is something every kid dreams about, and now it's here for me."
Alex Smith,"It was so unusual to deal with something like that. A guy I went to college with, one of the first guys I met when I got to Utah."
Alex Smith,"It's just different. I had a target on me in college, but it's not like the target you have when an NFL quarterback rolls out of the pocket. Everyone's eyes light up, and everybody just turns and reacts to you. It wasn't like that at other levels."
Alex Smith,"It's going to be a great learning experience, no matter what the circumstances are. This is the dream of almost every kid."
Alex Smith,"He has the most remarkable business story that is a model for all of us, whether we're in business or not."
Alex Smith,The running game is a quarterback's best friend.
Alex Smith,"We said at the beginning of the season we wanted to be NFC South champions, and I don't know how many people outside the locker room really believed that. But once we stepped on that field the first day in training camp, nobody here doubted what we could do."
Andrew Smith,I live here because Watterson is close to my classes and Watterson food court is convenient.
Andrew Smith,"You do have a huge wine industry that's developing here, and I think that's an example where I think it's in America's interests to actually define products in terms of the location in which they were grown or made."
Andrew Smith,"Unfortunately, I really don't see much by way of the election in the fall."
Andrew Smith,The only way you really do this is if you love it. It takes dedication.
Andrew Smith,He was truly a very interesting character.
Andrew Smith,Nobody ever gets sick of it there. Especially because of all the Minnesota boys on that team.
Andrew Smith,The first thing that's needed is fatigue awareness training and there are a number of counter-measures available. What's missing is a procedure for employers for selecting from this menu.
Andrew Smith,"As a ?lame duck? president with low approval ratings, he?s not in a good position to sell this budget. The people in Congress can just wait him out."
Andrew Smith,Guidance needs to be more targeted to the specific action rather than general.
Andrew Smith,Superman. Why else would I have his action figure?
Andrew Smith,A good legislator is someone who can get important legislation passed through the ability to marshal coalitions. It?s the ability to get working coalitions formed behind bills.
Barbara Smith,"He's here for the Soldiers. He came in here running. He knew we had some problems, and he jumped on them so we could get a handle."
Barbara Smith,"A major problem for Black women, and all people of color, when we are challenged to oppose anti-Semitism, is our profound scepticism that white people can actually be oppressed."
Barbara Smith,One of the greatest gifts of Black feminism to ourselves has been to make it a little easier simply to be Black and female.
Barbara Smith,"Black women, whose experience is unique, are seldom recognized as a particular social-cultural entity and are seldom thought to be important enough for serious scholarly consideration."
Barbara Smith,"This invisibility, however, means that the opportunities for creative research are infinite."
Barbara Smith,You can only paint through your experience and sub-consciousness.
Barbara Smith,Black women as a group have never been fools. We couldn't afford to be.
Barbara Smith,"Trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living. It is the beginning place, the foundation upon which more can be built. Where trust is, love can flourish."
Ben Smith,There's plenty of miles to go before we sleep. It's just another game in the books.
Ben Smith,It's a symbolic donation. We are having an impact even beyond our graduation.
Ben Smith,This Canadian team is too good for us to make mistakes that turn directly into goals. That was a tough way to start.
Ben Smith,"She had size and strength beyond her years. But I remember being at the training center in Finland, assisting her dialing home so she could talk to her parents."
Ben Smith,I think it's a good thing for them to keep up. It opens your eyes to different aspects of biology.
Ben Smith,We figured we'd get in one last bit of exercise before being cooped up for days.
Ben Smith,"When you don't score on five-on-three, as a coach you feel haunted. That gave the Swedish team another lift and they played with even more determination."
Ben Smith,"We start from the goal out, (and) we've got goaltenders that have both won at the world championships and have both beaten Canada. We're pretty strong and physically savvy on defense, and I think we've got a lot of strength down the middle. We've got a lot of options at the center position, and playmakers on both sides of the puck."
Ben Smith,"With the arrival of new, modern and fuel-efficient aircraft in our North American fleet, Air Canada is now able to implement significant network improvements that will benefit consumers with more point-to-point, non-stop flights and enhanced schedules."
Ben Smith,"Obviously, Canada is the No. 1 team on our hit list. But our team is shaping up quite nicely for a strong run at the (gold) medal."
Ben Smith,"This decision will allow Air Canada, through its regional partner, Air Canada Jazz, to re-instate flights previously cancelled due to the lack of demand caused by inadequate access to the airport under the existing ferry service."
Ben Smith,"It's fun to watch. To see someone grow, not just as an athlete, from a teenager to a mom. She's a great player who continues to be a pivotal player for the team."
Ben Smith,She's one of those show-stopper-type players. There are times in a game where she has the ability to do something like that. I'm glad she's on our team.
Bill Smith,We will probably concentrate more on those people who are on vacation and tailor those offerings to them.
Bill Smith,The whole design is to get them back in school. It's really designed to help kids get back on track.
Bill Smith,"When the city has a good budget, we can plant a lot of trees, but when times are tight, you don't plant anymore than you have to."
Brad Smith,We do feel we are starting to turn the tide against spam. It is far too early to proclaim victory.
Brad Smith,"We shouldn't declare victory, but we are turning the tide."
Brad Smith,"We've shipped a new version of Windows, we've paid an historic fine and we've provided unprecedented access to Microsoft technology to promote interoperability with other industry players. Yet every time we make a change, we find that the Commission moves the goal post and demands another change."
Brad Smith,"We've shipped a new version of Windows, we've paid an historic fine, and we've provided unprecedented access to Microsoft technology to promote interoperability with other industry players. In total, we have now responded to more than 100 requests from the Commission."
Brad Smith,"We have very popular products, and so we're put under this kind of pressure. But security remains our highest priority."
Brad Smith,"Although five European computer science professors have already confirmed that our documentation meets or exceeds industry standards, we are committed to doing everything in our power to address the Commission's concerns. These new documentation projects, together with free and unlimited technical support and access to Windows source code, will ensure that our competitors have all the assistance they need to make this Program effective."
Brad Smith,"We are putting our most valuable intellectual property on the table, so we can put technical compliance issues to rest and move forward with a serious discussion about the substance of this case."
Brad Smith,"The fact that this was able to have an impact on Windows 2000, but not Windows XP, shows the progress we've made in strengthening our software."
Brad Smith,We are putting our most valuable intellectual property on the table.
Brad Smith,Individuals will not take full advantage of the Internet or any commercial medium if they believe that their information or data could be compromised or disclosed in unexpected ways.
Brad Smith,"In our view, a fine isn't the answer. We need clear guidance and consistent direction to find a solution."
Brad Smith,"To continue to foster consistency between both licensing programs, Microsoft has decided to make available for the desktop protocols the same reference license for source code it is offering for server protocols, and the company will provide competition authorities in the United States with information so they can consider the matter."
Brad Smith,We believe we have a set of principles that ensure we comply with all of our legal obligations in China and other countries and ensure we are consistent with the broad principles that the Internet creates and people's desire for free expression.
Brad Smith,"It's truly a benefit to them and no detriment to us. From our standpoint as commissioners, it's nice to be able to help a well-respected medical institution invest back into the community."
Brad Smith,"It brings a lot of awareness to people who historically have not thought about these types of solutions, and that attention and interest is exactly the type of stuff that we love."
Brad Smith,"Microsoft is obligated as a company to continue to move forward to meet our obligations under the agreement, even as we are waiting for a final decision."
Brad Smith,"quite a bit of concern about this type of behavior, but (federal law) really limits the ability of the commission to do much."
Brad Smith,The ability to innovate is important for the success of any company and for the economic success of any country. We think that the facts will show that there is strong competition and consumer choice.
Brian Smith,"Maybe some of our youth came out a little bit in that. But I think they learned their lessons. We were fortunate enough, like I said, to be able to walk out with one even after we blew that lead. It's all a learning experience; it's fun. I mean, a great crowd and the boy were into it -- I told Chris Newsome I thought he was going to give me an early heart attack and I'm too young to get one of those."
Brian Smith,"In the long term, we're going to need something more to work with. This isn't going to handle a lot of growth."
Brian Smith,We played four solid quarters. It's something that we can build on for the rest of the season.
Brian Smith,"I think any way you look at that, for them to lose a player of that quality in their team from that position in their team should have been a huge advantage for us."
Brian Smith,"The goal in Trinidad is to give them an opportunity to supply natural gas to this facility. Trinidad as a government and as a country does not want to be treated as a Third World country and get paid only for their gas supply, but wants to take part in downstream investments."
Brian Smith,"The attorney who put the wheels in motion for the garnished wages, if memory serves me, was Gregory A. Benoit. A letter of profuse apology from Mr. Benoit came to me after I contacted him in writing expressing my displeasure with the turn of events."
Brian Smith,He was always energetic in practice. You never saw him down. He's a real loyal man.
Brian Smith,This one's going to hurt them probably until the first ball gets thrown up next season. We all expected to win and the fact that we didn't gives us something to build on.
Brian Smith,(Home-court advantage) is going to be a huge factor.
Brian Smith,We just wanted to give him some match fitness.
Brian Smith,"We have kept faith with the players that performed so well last Saturday. As in that match against the French we are expecting a tough, forward dominated battle, but if our backs get a chance to run with the ball then we know that we have plenty of pace out wide."
Brian Smith,We have quite a bit of nursing experience. We almost feel like we're kind of the experts in the retirement living area.
Brian Smith,The march helped me with my sense of direction. It showed me I'm not in this alone.
Brian Smith,"Bruce has come in and over the last three years, really changed what debate looks like. It really comes down to who is the adviser. ... If the adviser is good at what they do and promotes it and gets kids out, it thrives."
Brian Smith,We don't feel we are putting that roadway in any significant danger at all and don't feel that this has any significant impact on the city of Eastport in any way other than the visual impact of seeing the ships go by.
Brian Smith,"I thought our team played with great courage and conviction against Wasps so we've decided to reward their efforts and give them another shot this weekend against Saracens,"
Brian Smith,There remains precious little reason to think that Congress really intended for the McCain-Feingold law to regulate the web.
Brian Smith,"These guys had a goal since the beginning of the season to get a banner in the gym. We still have the district tournament, but we know if we finish strong we should get a solid seed in state."
Brian Smith,"At the beginning of the year, nobody was talking about us at all. With the season we've had, we're happy to get a four seed."
Brian Smith,The sooner that tax agreement is signed the better it is for everybody.
Bruton Smith,What we need is to buy a speedway and I hope someday somebody will give me a phone call.
Bruton Smith,"In that world, there was no money. We had food and clothing, but we had no money. I like the world today better. People have money."
Bruton Smith,We are pleased to report strong earnings growth during a period of rising interest rates and a competitive industry environment. Our results reflect the combined effect of our improved brand mix and the successful execution of our key operating initiatives.
Charles Smith,We got off to a great start but just kind of stubbed our toe when they went to that zone defense. They pretty much took care of our inside game the second half and made it kind of rough on us.
Charles Smith,"We're not a rich family, but we're willing to share what we have."
Charles Smith,"They (Falcons) were just so hot. I felt like we didn't come out of there with much enthusiasm. We'll be ready to play our next game, I guarantee you."
Charles Smith,The work is very enjoyable. It is a stress-free environment.
Charles Smith,"If they do strike I?ll have to rely on my girlfriend. She?ll drive me to work. I doubt if they?ll walk because they need the money and SEPTA needs the money, too."
Charles Smith,"I was both thrilled and overjoyed when I heard about the re-discovery of this wonderful manuscript, a true original by an artist for the ages. This wonderful find brings back the excitement of fifteen years ago, when the Seminary celebrated the unearthing of an original score by another musical genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. At that time, we called it the 'Mozart miracle'. It seems appropriate that this time we are thankful for the 'Beethoven blessing.' Through the extraordinary generosity of the Doane family, God has once again blessed us with a gift that is of rare and practical beauty."
Charles Smith,The key right now is that we need to find a comfort zone on offense. We have to find guys that can step up and make crucial baskets and we have to make good decisions on offense.
Charles Smith,"It was a very, very intense crowd (at the volleyball match), and it will only be bigger for basketball and even bigger for football next year."
Charles Smith,I'm getting threats of legal action.
Charlie Smith,I think we need to have the perfect night for us.
Charlie Smith,"To make sure that we show them, even on a down year, we can be pretty good. It's a game we expect to be able to compete in and hopefully win, yearly."
Charlie Smith,We can't leave anybody without fire protection.
Charlie Smith,That is just one example. I tend to think there are a lot of examples like that in other parts of state government.
Charlie Smith,"With these young girls, any experience - good or bad - will certainly benefit the team in future years."
Charlie Smith,"For Jess, getting back to states for the second consecutive year is quite an accomplishment. The girls have had a great season and to make it to states speaks volumes of their abilities."
Charlie Smith,"He has good athletic ability and it shows in both sports. He did a pretty good job becoming a better outfielder last spring. When he gets in the games, he has that little extra for the game that helps him a lot."
Craig Smith,The goal is for this to be a living site.
Craig Smith,"It is kind of funny. We started 0-3 in the ACC, we ended up the No. 3 seed, we're 3-0 in North Carolina, we won this game by three points and now we're in our third game."
Craig Smith,I think that speaks to the diversity and strength of the dining experience downtown.
Craig Smith,There's a need for three lanes in every direction.
Craig Smith,He put us on his back and took control of the game. He was in a rhythm. and we kept giving him the ball and he was making plays.
Craig Smith,"It's pretty exciting. Overall, we've done a fine job, but we've still got business to take care of."
Craig Smith,"We've been practicing and playing for more than five months. We told our guys at the beginning of the year that it was a marathon, not a sprint. Now, it's time to finish it. Our guys have been waiting all year for this."
Craig Smith,"We played hard. I think we showed a lot of toughness and I would like to think we showed America that, 'Hey, don't count us out."
Craig Smith,I hope that we showed America not to count us out in the tournament.
Craig Smith,"He put us on his back and took control. Louis is one of the most underrated guards in America. And today, America found out."
Dean Smith,"If you make every game a life-and-death thing, you're going to have problems. You'll be dead a lot."
Dean Smith,"I always mean what I say, but I don't always say what I'm thinking."
Dean Smith,Basketball is a team game. But that doesn't mean all five players should have the same amount of shots.
Dean Smith,"The presidents of colleges have to have some courage to step forward. You can't limit alcohol in college sports, you have to get rid of it."
Dean Smith,I do believe in praising that which deserves to be praised.
Dean Smith,"We need to understand that children start following athletics at the age of nine or ten. These beer ads are highly appealing to them. When beer companies say their ads aren't directed at young people, I find it hard to believe. Do you think the kids don't like the lizards on the Budweiser spots?"
Doug Smith,He's making good progress. We'd rather wait an extra week to make sure he's OK.
Doug Smith,They did a good job of talking with the neighbors behind there. I think the neighbors were generally satisfied when they finished the process.
Doug Smith,We won't buy anything unless it's land owned.
Doug Smith,"We at Langley Hill will honor Tom's courage by ensuring that the work to which he was dedicated continues and that all the stories of loss, not just Langley Hill's, are told."
Doug Smith,Existing charity cards are more of a niche product while we see this appealing to a larger market. This is for people who are looking for a card that says something about them but also does some good at the end of the day.
Dr. Smith,This is more alive in some ways because we're not talking hypothetical events.
Dr. Smith,"As might be expected by its tremendous diversity and dramatic growth, China presents a remarkable mix of challenges and opportunities for the medical device industry."
Dr. Smith,The cancer was contained within the prostate and has been completely removed. We expect that his cancer is cured.
Dr. Smith,"In the old way, it was as if you were looking through a scrap book, you had a series of images. You would never see the entire organ, you would just see the representative photo."
Elliott Smith,"Haven't laughed this hard in a long time,I better stop now before I start crying.Go off to sleep in the sunshine,I don't want to see the day when it's dying."
Elliott Smith,I've been here all three nights. I kind of like it down here by the river.
Elliott Smith,"Items like televisions and computers are considered hazardous waste. If we have to dispose of an item like that now, it isn't just a matter of putting it in the trash. It requires special handling."
Elliott Smith,"It's just that a lot of songs that are popular right now, they don't have any meaning."
Elliott Smith,"Well, I try not to think about the general public since I have no idea what the general public is and I don't think anybody does."
Elliott Smith,I just wanted to move out of Portland to do something.
Elliott Smith,I don't think that Dreamworks would have signed me expecting to really mess around with whatever it is I do.
Elliott Smith,I don't really like New York better than Portland. It's just a different place.
Elliott Smith,I didn't think I was gonna be playing on the Oscars or anything.
Elliott Smith,"I didn't have a hard time making it, I had a hard time letting it go."
Elliott Smith,I can't think of anything off the top of my head that seems more important than something designed to raise money to keep something going that keeps IV drug users from dying.
Elliott Smith,I actually don't think that I'm gonna sell a lot of records.
Elliott Smith,"But I was also doing odd jobs around Portland, like spreading gravel and transplanting bamboo trees."
Elliott Smith,Because God only knows why people like what they like and don't like something else.
Elliott Smith,And I'm not trying to write heavy songs.
Emmitt Smith,"Always, through my whole life, I've had a thirst for knowledge."
Emmitt Smith,"I'm very confident I'm one of the best to ever play the game, but once you talk about the greatest, how can you define greatest?'"
Emmitt Smith,"It's been a tremendous ride. My 15 years, my 15 minutes of fame, is up."
Emmitt Smith,"For me, winning isn't something that happens suddenly on the field when the whistle blows and the crowds roar. Winning is something that builds physically and mentally every day that you train and every night that you dream."
Emmitt Smith,"I've given everything I can possible to the game, on and off the field."
Frederick Smith,Gary's leadership transformed FedEx Kinko's into a global network offering the industry's broadest range of business services and helped change the way business is done in the digital age. I have the utmost confidence that Ken will take FedEx Kinko's to new heights by building on this outstanding record of innovation and service to our customers.
Frederick Smith,"We cannot be certain right now how the events of last week will ultimately impact the U.S. and global economies, the air transportation industry and FedEx, ... Nonetheless, we see our company well positioned to significantly increase growth, profitability, returns and cash flow as the global economies improve and trading activities increase."
Frederick Smith,"China is changing the world's economic landscape, and FedEx has been part of this great change since we established express operations in China more than 20 years ago. This strategic investment in the long-term growth of China will broaden and deepen our relationship by improving access to important markets, fueling economic development for years to come."
Frederick Smith,Leaders get out in front and stay there by raising the standards by which they judge themselves - and by which they are willing to be judged.

Frederick W. Smith,A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can.
Graeme Smith,He is a bit of a worry at the moment.
Graeme Smith,Incredible. We'd struggle to repeat a match like that. I think it compares with the tied Test between Australia and the West Indies at Adelaide as one of the greatest matches in cricket history.
Graeme Smith,He's a high-risk bowler. There are going to be days when he goes for runs but he does create opportunities and that's what we are looking for. His role is to run in and be quick. I wouldn't like to see him out of the team.
Graeme Smith,The players really long for a rest of only 10 days.
Graeme Smith,"He was unbelievable, he got the ball to move both ways and he was consistent. He has wonderful potential."
Graeme Smith,"He's come through really well in the last two days. He's felt nothing, he's passed his fitness test and we'll make a decision tonight."
Graeme Smith,Everyone in the whole team wanted to be positive this morning and go for a win. Cricket itself needs positive games. It doesn't need teams batting out and drawing games.
Graeme Smith,"The whole team wanted to be positive and wanted to go for a win. Cricket needs positive games. It doesn't need teams batting out and drawing games. For us, as a team moving forward, we're young and we need to be positive. To set a declaration and to try to go for a win was in our minds the only way to play. The negative option never came in."
Graeme Smith,"We've always wanted to play positive, winning cricket, and if we can win this series, it means we can put a tick against this summer."
Graeme Smith,The boys are confident but the feet are still firmly on the ground.
Graeme Smith,"We have come here a little bit more open and enthusiastic, and open to advice and to see things. We have really enjoyed ourselves here. We are as best prepared as we can be."
Harry Smith,"The coat was fine, the tie was fine, the shirt was gone. Certain breeds you don't trust."
Harry Smith,"It's hard looking at it from my perspective,"
Harry Smith,I hate to put a guess on it at this point.
Harry Smith,I've seen dogs with brown noses that end up with black ones.
Harry Smith,We always had a dog. Everyone in the family had dogs.
Harry Smith,"Primarily, someone we believe in, someone who's had an impact that year, and someone who reflects the year in culture."

Jack Smith,"We continue to look at ways to further unleash value from our ownership of Hughes while preserving our strong credit ratings,"
Jack Smith,"These sales shortfalls resulted in higher inventory levels per store and increased markdowns, especially in the footwear category. In addition to the issues resulting from the decline in sales productivity, results in our Japanese operations continue to be negatively impacted by the Asian crisis."
Jack Smith,"We got a good lead on them and the kids played real hard. We had kind of a lull there in the second quarter, which is typical, and let them back in. But we worked hard in the third quarter and built it back up and kept it up."
Jack Smith,"That hurt. In certain situations, shots like that take a lot of steam out of a team."
Jack Smith,It was fun to put them in and it's fun for them. They understand their roles. They know in a game like this they are going to get a little more playing time. In tight games I usually go with the top seven and that's it.
Jack Smith,"If I thought there was any area of conflict, I would never have agreed to serve."
Jack Smith,I want to be a major league baseball player just like him.
Jack Smith,We did get permits to take some of those animals out and retrain the rest of them.
Jack Smith,"Record market demand in North America and Europe was accompanied by unrelenting competitive pressures, while economic conditions continued to affect markets in the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions, ... We're particularly pleased that GM Europe improved its profitability during the period, and that both GM Latin America/Africa/Middle East and GM Asia Pacific were profitable, a significant improvement over the first quarter last year."
James Smith,"Since 2001, Florida has added more payroll jobs than any other state, including California, which is triple its population."
James Smith,"We're going to get to a number like 3.8 percent in the next four months. Jobs are plentiful and easy to get. The economy is strong, no two ways about it."
James Smith,People just don't think poverty exists here. It's a perception that since Howard County is an affluent place . . . low-income people just don't live here. (But) they do.
James Smith,"God was able to keep his finger on it and keep them safe -- and we rejoice, ... I think He answered our prayers."
James Smith,"It could help on the crops and fire situation, but it really depends on how long it hangs around and how much water it puts on us. If it doesn't amount to much, this stuff will dry out pretty quick."
James Smith,"I expect good things from him, as far as leadership, leading by example, knowing what's expected and knowing what it takes to get the job done and being in the right position."
James Smith,"The poor will always be among us. In their mind, as long as they get gas and electricity, they're OK. But what about the next month? And the next? . . . The challenge is helping people to break out of the mentality of poverty."
James Smith,Everybody expects the economy to slow down. But the question is when is it going to slow down.
James Smith,Just wondered if you know the audience figures for the Brilliant 'Trisha Goddard show' on Five? Which show is doing best in that time slot? Also how is Five's 'Wright Stuff' doing against 'this morning'? Look forward to your column every week.
James Smith,"The three black graces, Law, Physic, and Divinity."
James Smith,Those Wall Street gurus have bigger expense accounts than I have total income.
James Smith,The mortality rates among people around age 60 is about the same in both countries. But we don't do a better job at preventing people from getting sick in the first place.
James Smith,"Every kid in the family, besides Marvel, left the house by the age of 16. There was less stress living on our own than trying to survive in the environment we were in. I don't know how Marvel did it. He spent his time playing football, but the cards were stacked against him."
Jared Smith,"It had a nice thud in the back of the net. But to tell you the truth, I didn't know it went in until the ref stepped in and signaled it with his hand."
Jared Smith,"We still have fights, grades are the same and people are still skipping class. The only things that have changed are people's attitudes toward the school, and they've changed for the worse."
Jared Smith,"At the beginning of the year, I never thought this could happen. To tell you the truth, we can't win on talent alone. We have to win on heart and on being a family. (Being trapped on the elevator) gave us more team unity."
Jeffrey Smith,"We like to go to areas that are not typical of American travel, but we do like to find other choirs and have international exchanges with them."
Jeffrey Smith,Well I wasn't drunk (Sunday night).
Jeffrey Smith,"Drunk or sober, that wasn't fun the way the game ended. Izzy scares me, man!"
Jeffrey Smith,"Dyes age differently. Old yarns used natural dyes, like vegetable dyes. Chemical dyes don't loose their color as quickly."
Jim Smith,Area youth groups are welcome to attend the event.
Jim Smith,"Well, I was expecting long before now to tell you the truth about it, but they just let it go and let it go and finally they did something about it."
Jim Smith,It's too early to extend anyone's service because there has been no request from a developer.
Jim Smith,"It's taken a lot of footwork to put this together. As soon as we finish one, we start planning the next one. We can always use some more volunteers."
Jim Smith,I marveled at his intellect.
Jim Smith,"If you don't get to him early, you don't get to him. His competitiveness, his desire to win (are) just tremendous. A lot of times he just threw it by them."
Jim Smith,We can't put the cost of serving the Boys Ranch on the shoulders of existing customers.
Jim Smith,The suit is an action for declaratory relief and not for damages.
Jimmy Smith,There's not a one of these cakes worth less than $100.
Jimmy Smith,We ran the same offensive and defensive plays in the first six minutes as the rest of the game. We just started to play South Lenoir basketball. Tonight was just a good team effort. We showed a lot of heart tonight.
Jimmy Smith,We had our chances. We just would get a run and then make mental mistakes. But (Clinton's) a well-coached basketball team with some good players.
Jimmy Smith,"We are dedicated to making our roads safer for everyone, that's why we've had this program for 19 years now."
Jimmy Smith,"That's the best quarter (of basketball) I've ever coached. It wasn't just the points, but the way we got them. The effort on defense."
John Smith,This transaction creates value for GM shareholders while allowing for an even more competitive Delphi. We wish Delphi and its employees great success as they begin their journey as a fully independent company.

John Smith,Everything I have is here. My family is the most important thing.
John Smith,The events of Jan. 4 were serious. They were atypical of what goes on here and we have taken steps in their aftermath. The expulsions were a result of that.
John Smith,"I think a lot of it is drive. It's the want, it's the hunger, it's the desire all balled up, and not accepting defeat. There have been times when you do come up short and all you can expect out of yourself is to put the right emotions into anything you are doing and you can be willing to accept the results."
John Smith,There were about 40 hours spent with staff about this design.
John Smith,We have enough linemen to run behind and to fill the gaps on defense.
John Smith,That's what it's all about is trying to get to the College World Series.
John Smith,"A lot of players his age are obsessed with making it to the pros. He's not that way, because he's very confident as a person that he can do other things."
John M. Smith,You couldn't have human society without language.
John M. Smith,Societies depend on agreed rules.
John M. Smith,Language changes very fast.
John M. Smith,Information imposes certain criteria on how it can be stored.
John M. Smith,I think we invent jargon because it saves times talking to one-another.
John M. Smith,Genetics is about how information is stored and transmitted between generations.
Ken Smith,We are very much aware of the potential for gang activity here. So far we haven't seen any evidence of gang participation in the juvenile system.
Ken Smith,"Our philosophy is to make you play end-to-end. These guys give me their hearts, but they also know I'll never be pleased."
Ken Smith,"When you start taking money out of consumers' pockets and adding a bit of worry, it has an effect."
Ken Smith,Because we are living longer there is the burden of extra (medical) expenses.
Ken Smith,That's a lot. It was one of the most we've made in my history.
Ken Smith,"But as we have seen the last few years, that growth is not necessarily for everyone."
Ken Smith,"When I think of golf in Southeast Missouri, I think of Jack Connell."
Ken Smith,We were never in this game mentally at all. We just did enough smart things in the end to win.
Ken Smith,There is a new president every two years and the president has a lot to do with the direction of the organization.
Ken Smith,Having to get more than one market pass hasn't been on the same level of complaints as high hotel rates and other hospitality costs.
Ken Smith,The rodeo and music fest is our biggest fund-raiser. Everything we get goes directly to the community.
Ken Smith,"(Charity) has been a part of it, but I think now we are trying to promote it. I think during the last two or three presidents, we have done more."
Ken Smith,We have always believed that what the Salvation Army does is good and right.
Kenny Smith,I just went by the rules.
Kenny Smith,You can't beat a quality team like them if you keep turning it over to them.
Kenny Smith,"In the last two years, we've been a six seed and four seed, so I take it as a compliment (being the No. 1 seed) and that we're making progress."
Kenny Smith,"He has to let everyone know he's the best player on the floor. It could be arrogance, but it sure is fun to watch."
Kenny Smith,We really hadn't gotten any type of rhythm yet. The activity was there but the achievement wasn't. I told the guys we needed to have something to show for what we had done up to that point.
Kyle Smith,"The biggest thing I learned from this is to choose your teammates wisely, because you have to work with them for six months, and to set progress goals and stick to them in order to complete the task at hand in time to review your work and make necessary changes."
Kyle Smith,The biggest thing of all is no one was hurt. Secondary good news was that we didn't have a major fire that totally put us out of business. It's not how we wanted to start Thursday morning but we're grateful it turned out as well as it did.
Kyle Smith,"There were good spots and bad spots. But we picked it up in the second half and got two goals going against the wind. When we decided that we wanted to pass the ball, we played pretty well. But at other times, we were playing kickball."
Kyle Smith,"Our kids, our families are no different than anybody else's. They have the same hopes and dreams. They have people who love them."

Mark E. Smith,"The thing with me, I can't talk about my work. I find it very difficult."
Mark E. Smith,"It's just like music when you reckon it up. It's like listening to Pavement it's just The Fall in 1985, isn't it? They haven't got an original idea in their heads."

Mark E. Smith,"I used to be psychic, but I drank my way out of it."

Ozzie Smith,I don't think anybody ever really just retires where they don't do anything.

Patrick Smith,"As we move forward with significant progress in our Phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and pre-clinical work in various cancers, I am confident that Voyager's expanded board of directors will provide the advice and oversight to sustain our company's success. It is an honor and a privilege to work with such a distinguished group."
Patrick Smith,"We were a little too excited. We have the ability to move up-and-down the floor quickly, but you don?t want to be throwing the ball into the fourth row in the stands.

Scott Smith,"Not everyone is able to donate money to help disaster victims, but almost everyone has items around the house that they aren't using. This is a really great opportunity to help our neighbors in need."
Scott Smith,It would have devastating consequences to the advancements we have made in terms of higher education access.
Scott Smith,Heading into Saturday I was just looking for each individual to battle and improve against tough competition.
Scott Smith,It took me about six months before I could get to where I didn't spill my coffee every time a plane came flying directly overhead.
Scott Smith,This is a little bit of civilization.
Scott Smith,It would be their choice. But we'll provide training for those who choose it.
Scott Smith,His lungs were so bad they couldn't supply the oxygen his body needed. A respiratory therapist told us his lungs were so hard and infected that it was like trying to pump air into a brick.
Scott Smith,He has been just so good there. He felt confident at 130. He is a disciplined athlete. It was kind of a gut feeling from Austin to stick at 130.

Steve Smith,We argue at times. He gets mad at me. I get mad at him. It's almost like two women.
Steve Smith,"Clearly, we want the technology to be adopted, ... we think it's superior. We're not getting royalties from the technology... We're not doing this to make money with the technology. We're doing it to get this market standardized and going."
Steve Smith,"We can support the restriction of sales. We just think we can do it behind the counter without needing a pharmacy. Not all our stores have pharmacies, and there are still some folks that use the drug for its legitimate purpose."
Steve Smith,"Because the sales are so big, surely as a state we can afford to stay out of some unique, sensitive and useful places and still have a big volume of gas leasing."
Steve Smith,"Rodney is a headhunter. He's a free safety. I think he is ... one of those guys who is going to come down and hit the running back in the mouth, knock a tight end out, knock a receiver out. He's one of the guys that, when you are coming across the middle, he's going to hit you, so you have to concentrate."
Steve Smith,"He surprised me with the power he has. He's strong. He's put together well. He really does have some pop, especially for a guy his size."
Steve Smith,They were trying to evade a member of this department that is trained to teach police officers emergency vehicle operation. It was an exercise in stupidity that ended up as an exercise in futility.
Steve Smith,When I came in here he was very instrumental in teaching me patience and understanding the game. He did that constantly and laid back sometimes when I was having a rough day. He had that big-brother mentality.

Steve Smith,You've never made a mistake?
Steve Smith,It was kind of nice.

Steve Smith,The opportunities we missed last season and the run we made contributed to all the hard work the guys put in during the off-season.
Steve Smith,We were much better. The kids worked really hard. They have been playing golf since they could get on a golf course in the spring. I'm about ready to tell some of them to go home.
Steve Smith,"It's funny how we were thinking maybe outfield, this and that. When they talk about first basemen now, Tex is in the first two guys they're talking about."
Steve Smith,"I'm frustrated we weren't doing things right, but that's football."
Steve Smith,I look for every edge I can get. I'll do anything not to be a failure.

Steve Smith,"From our perspective, things are absolutely moving in the right direction."
Steve Smith,"Man, that official overreacted. I've grabbed women in much the same way and ended up dancing with them. Not once was I ejected. And they were all a lot prettier than he was.

Steve Smith,"By making this a weekly must-see 'event', MIDNIGHT MADNESS will carry the tradition to bring live country music and its hit makers closer to its fans."

Terry Smith,He's a playmaker. He averaged 48 yards per touchdown and is a tremendous athlete and has a great work ethic.

Tim Smith,"In the school system, we will always have a captive audience."
Tim Smith,"We've been running load factors that are in the high 80s, and (Sunday) would be no exception. So there's relatively few seats out there for folks to chase. As this goes on, if it does, we might look at something else."

The former winners are a distinguished collection of some of the finest sports writers in American history. To be included in that group is humbling and overwhelming. I hope that my future work will prove that I am indeed worthy. I will strive to live up to the honor.
Tim Smith,"If you were concerned about men's heart health, you would ask couples to find ways to talk about disagreements without trying to control each other. If you were concerned about women's heart health, you would encourage couples to find ways to have disagreements that weren't hostile."
Tim Smith,Certainly a bad fight or a bad week of fights is not going to damage your heart health. We're talking about something that needs to be present over many years.
Tim Smith,"We have a lot of strength in our finance department, and I'm sure we will be looking at all of our possibilities."
Tim Smith,"Physicians are providing a service, so it's up to them to provide an environment that's welcoming and comforting, not dull and depressing."

Tim Smith,People get heart disease for lots of reasons.

Tony Smith,It was tough day with a lot of delays and the gymnasts were losing some momentum. On the last rotation only five hit their routines. I know Nathan can do much better and hopefully he can show what he's been doing in training. He's got the potential to crack the top-five here.
Tony Smith,"Whenever you look at it in its entirety, you could be losing all the land to a developer."
Tony Smith,"But I knew Jerome was destined for greatness if he could hold on to his health. He's a head-on, grind-it-out, make-it-happen back who can also catch the ball."
Tony Smith,He's the sort of teacher that gives you the freedom to express yourself without hovering over you.
Tony Smith,"Fairways and greens were the key to my round today. The long rain delay really didn't hurt me, although I was 3-under when play was stopped. I hated to leave the course."
Tony Smith,"The European regulators thought that open competition would lead banks to develop products that they're now being forced to develop, The regulators forced [banks'] hands."
Troy Smith,This was a huge victory. I hope this win turns around our season.

Troy Smith,We understand each other the whole way around. (He's) like my baby brother in the sense of how we've grown up together.

Tubby Smith,We appreciate the Big Blue faithful. The faith they have in us is remarkable.
Tubby Smith,"In the first few minutes of the second half, we really got rattled. We made some bad decisions during that stretch. When you're playing a talented team like Florida, in a hostile arena, you have you have to play with a lot more poise."

Wayne Smith,Our standing in Latin America has never been so low as it is now.

Robert Smithson,Visiting a museum is a matter of going from void to void.
Robert Smithson,The scenic ideals that surround even our national parks are carriers of a nostalgia for heavenly bliss and eternal calmness.
Robert Smithson,The museums and parks are graveyards above the ground- congealed memories of the past that act as a pretext for reality.
Robert Smithson,"The museum spreads its surfaces everywhere, and becomes an untitled collection of generalizations that mobilize the eye."

Robert Smithson,"Nature does not proceed in a straight line, it is rather a sprawling development."
Robert Smithson,"Museums are tombs, and it looks like everything is turning into a museum."
Robert Smithson,Mistakes and dead-ends often mean more to these artists than any proven problem.

Robert Smithson,"Art history is less explosive than the rest of history, so it sinks faster into the pulverized regions of time."
Robert Smithson,"Artists themselves are not confined, but their output is."
John Smoltz,"I know, if nothing was done differently [to the rules for the game], ... it would have been managed differently [anyway] because of last year."
John Smoltz,"Ultimately, I did what I wanted to do. If I can throw seven innings the rest of the way and we sustain this lead, it's going to help me a lot."
John Smoltz,"After last season, I had to make some changes. I couldn't keep going with the philosophy that I had to pitch no matter what."
John Smoltz,We just have to remember that this thing isn't over until that magic number is at zero. We have to keep our focus.
John Smoltz,It was a game here. One was an inside-the-park home run in which [left fielder] Lonnie Smith had trouble getting the ball out of the little trough down the left-field line.
John Smoltz,It's just a case of giving me a couple extra days off. We're fresh enough in the starting rotation.
John Smoltz,"When you're put in this position, you have either one of two feelings gut-wrenching or ecstasy ... there's nothing else you can feel,"
John Smoltz,I have the ultimate faith in what he's able to do.

John Smoltz,"The good and the bad about my body is that when something happens, it acts adversely, ... But then I can get well real quick. ... I'm still pretty confident I have enough time to do that."
Tommy Smothers,The ultimate censorship is the flick of the dial.
Tommy Smothers,"Red meat is not bad for you. Now blue-green meat, that's bad for you!"
Tommy Smothers,"When you don't know what you're talking about, it's hard to know when you're finished."
Tommy Smothers,The only valid censorship of ideas is the right of people not to listen.
Ryan Smyth,"[The Oilers and Smyth have a one-year deal on the table that is worth slightly more than his qualifying offer of $2.698 million, so there's no chance the veteran left-winger will miss the start of camp.] I'll be there because we've got the one-year deal in place, ... If we can't agree on the long-term, I'll take my qualifying offer and be ready to go. It's one year or whatever we settle on."
Ryan Smyth,Mistakes. I thought we were really assertive at the start of the game. We came out strong. We did everything but score. Kipper made some good saves. Then we started making mistakes. This is playoff hockey. You can't have that right now.
Ryan Smyth,We don't make it easy on ourselves. We talk about killer instinct. Why can't we make it easier on ourselves?I don't know what it is. We have to hope we have it for these last nine games.
Ryan Smyth,"You hate to play against him, but you love to have him on your team,"
Ryan Smyth,It's like their gold medal game and they found a way to uplift their game. It was not a walkover.
Ryan Smyth,We didn't fear them. We can play with them.
Ryan Smyth,I thought all along he's done a pretty good job. I have full faith in him.
Ryan Smyth,"It's loud here, but nothing compared to the playoff environment in Edmonton. That's a whole new level. Maybe the sound doesn't' funnel down here (at Joe Louis) but it's huge in Edmonton."
Sam Snead,Thinking instead of acting is the number-one golf disease.
Sam Snead,"Of the mental hazards, being scared is the worst. When you get scared, you get tense."

Sam Snead,The only reason I played golf was so that I could afford to go hunting and fishing.
Willie Snead,"It just says a lot about the talent out here that we have players that are able to make the most of it despite being under the radar, but they're getting the opportunity to prove they can play."
Willie Snead,We take a lot of pride in doing our job. We're very professional. We just want to come out and put on a good show for our community.
Willie Snead,"We're looking at possibly six months of demolition. That's what's giving the people hope, seeing some activity."
Ed Snider,"If someone walked into the room and said Keith is ready, healthy, beautiful, the doctors think it?s wonderful and he can play, everybody would be all excited around here. No one has said that."
Ed Snider,I'm staying away from it. It's a choice each player has to make for himself.
Ed Snider,"I'm a believer in the Olympics and I think it's good for the NHL to participate in them. Having said that, the people who participate should be the ones who are absolutely healthy."
Ed Snider,"I'm a believer in the Olympics and I think it's good for the NHL to participate in them. Having said that, the people who participate should be the ones who are absolutely healthy. Peter Forsberg, for example, isn't absolutely healthy."

John Snow,"A stronger financial sector, combined with steps like the liberalization of the retail sector and more effective use of technology in the agricultural sector, would jump-start a surge in investments in India throughout the agriculture and food processing sectors that would add jobs and increase productivity,"

John Snow,to make progress on reforming their foreign-exchange regime.
John Snow,I'm not sure exactly what he has in his mind. I think what he had in mind is probably the existence of a broad consensus on the need for flexible exchange rates.
John Snow,"which are the principal competitors of railroads and, in the process, we're going to grow our revenue and operating income."
John Snow,"[Higher energy costs] mean that (an) extraordinary amount of money that would otherwise be disposable income in the pockets of U.S. citizens going to buy U.S. goods and services aren't there, ... It puts headwinds in the way of the recovery."
John Snow,the best single thing we can do to encourage the continuing upward course of the economy.
John Snow,all of those external shocks to the economy.
John Snow,"The most important factor leading to our trade deficit is that the U.S. economy has had much higher rates of economic growth and job creation than our major trading partners over the past decade,"

So when the economy comes back, I think we're going to see a nice pick-up in profitability and cash flows -- and that's always the precursor of expansions in capital spending."
John Snow,"Action on any of the punitive legislative proposals before Congress now would be counterproductive to our efforts at this time,"
John Snow,"There's broad acceptance of the desirability of doing all those things, setting up risk-based management, dealing with fraud, putting place good capital market oversight, ... moving, over time, more of the economy out of the state-run sector in both banking and other sectors and into the private market-directed sector."

David Snowden,We can't compromise the interests of our members by being forced to pay for uncovered losses.

Bill Snyder,"It's so difficult to assess. We've made some improvement, but how much we'll define on Saturday."
Bill Snyder,"I've not been the kind of father that I should have been, and the kind of husband,"
Bill Snyder,"I've not been the kind of father than I should have been, nor the kind of husband, ... I don't know if I can correct that. I'm going to spend some time because they have been so wonderful."
Bill Snyder,"I think that's probably the case. But that's an excuse, and I don't mean it to be."
Bill Snyder,"Penalties and turnovers probably put us in a hole more than anything else. It's a matter of focus and discipline, and penalties and turnovers really created the difference."

Bill Snyder,"[? Put the coffee on now; Kansas State kicks off Saturday at 9:30 a.m. CDT at Marshall. The response on the early hour from coach Bill Snyder was typical of a man who reportedly gets only four or five hours of sleep each night.] Young people are resilient and can get up at early times, ... They just like to play. We're not going to make a major issue of it."
Quin Snyder,We showed our youth in the second half. We didn't have the same intensity.
Quin Snyder,"Who knows, they may can my [expletive], but you know what, I'll feel good about what I've done. I regret the quote-unquote investigation. But you know what? We haven't had a violation in three years. I don't need to talk about that anymore."
Quin Snyder,"We're still learning how to win. If there's one thing I've learned to do the last two years, it's to block stuff out."

Quin Snyder,"The turnovers are still frustrating. It didn't hurt us tonight on the scoreboard, but that's something that will continue to cost us ball games if we're not better."
Quin Snyder,"There's humility all over our program. We've been through a lot coming back from the Illinois game getting beat like we did. We don't need to remind ourselves of that every day, but that's clearly in the back of their minds. And these guys, they're hungry. They want to accomplish something."
Quin Snyder,"I've had seven great years here with a lot of successes and a lot of challenges. When someone tells you it's time to move on, you respect that, take it like a man, and you move forward."
Quin Snyder,"It starts with an attitude, like a desire, kind of an appreciation for the fact that there's a right way to play, ... I think when you don't make the extra pass or you take a bad shot or you are selfish ... you have to hate that about yourself."
Quin Snyder,At that point there was really no confusion in my mind as to what the course of action was. I knew that it was over.
Quin Snyder,"I think he's had to earn that. He's a guy that has some ability, that we felt like if he stepped up could provide us with some scoring punch. We encouraged him to do that, but within the context of our team."

Joseph Sobran,"The most fundamental purpose of government is defense, not empire."
Joseph Sobran,Freedom is coming to mean little more than the right to ask permission.
Joseph Sobran,"Most Americans aren't the sort of citizens the Founding Fathers expected; they are contented serfs. Far from being active critics of government, they assume that its might makes it right."
Ralph Sockman,"We cannot hoard life as we can money. When a person tries to be a miser of his health, he usually makes himself miserable. Mental talents, if buried and not used, tend to deteriorate. Whoever would save his memory by not using it will lose it."

Socrates,"Well I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance. At any rate it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent, that I do not think that I know what I do not know."

Socrates,"Regard your good name as the richest jewel you can possibly be possessed of - for credit is like fire; when once you have kindled it you may easily preserve it, but if you once extinguish it, you will find it an arduous task to rekindle it again.

Socrates,"He is a man of courage who does not run away, but remains at his post and fights against the enemy."
Socrates,"Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty."

Socrates,"I am a citizen, not of Athens or Greece, but of the world"
Socrates,"Whom do I call educated? First, those who manage well the circumstances they encounter day by day. Next, those who are decent and honorable in their intercourse with all men, bearing easily and good naturedly what is offensive in others and being as agreeable and reasonable to their associates as is humanly possible to be... those who hold their pleasures always under control and are not ultimately overcome by their misfortunes... those who are not spoiled by their successes, who do not desert their true selves but hold their ground steadfastly as wise and sober -- minded men."

Socrates,Do not be angry with me if I tell you the truth
Socrates,"Remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs; therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue depression in adversity."

Socrates,"Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued."
Socrates,She soars on her own wings.
Chip Sodemann,We like to make it interesting for our parents and everybody. We like keeping it close.
Chip Sodemann,It was just the release of some emotions. I didn't have much energy left to do anything else. I was pretty excited. It was a pretty big win for us. The win told us a lot about our character.
Chip Sodemann,Those early victories help. We were playing with plenty of confidence entering MIAA play.

Javier Solana,"We still have points on which we are separated, but we are making progress,"
Javier Solana,No more talking of the problems between us. Transatlantic relations are in a good period. The patient is the rest of the world. Global problems would be in a better state if we co-operate.

Javier Solana,"I would like to thank the Western diplomats, especially Mr Solana and Mr Robertson, because their contribution truly benefits humanity and us Albanians as well because we are part of the great European family."
Javier Solana,"It is a cruel irony of history that he left at the moment he was most needed, the very moment he was expected to provide leadership in helping to settle the future status of Kosovo."

Javier Solana,Let me stress that the use of force will require further decisions

Javier Solana,"The French people have expressed their choice. They have ultimately preferred not to support the Treaty establishing the European Constitution. I evidently respect their choice, but I also regret it an equal measure of sincerity. Europe needs its people, but each one of us also needs her. Europe is, above all, a venture of hope."
Javier Solana,"I have no information whatsoever that tells me with certainty that any of the accusations, allegations, rumors, that have taken place are true."
Javier Solana,"We're going to continue working politically ... the behavior (of the Russians) is completely unacceptable,"
Javier Solana,"According to our information, and our information is good, many army and special police units remain in Kosovo, ... These units must be withdrawn immediately."

Javier Solana,"If that agreement is not implemented by force on the ground, it will not be effective."
Javier Solana,"I have been working very hard with your leaders and they have been working very hard to reach an agreement, ... grand government coalition."
Javier Solana,"I very much hope that common sense and intelligence will prevail and an agreement will be reached in the coming days,"
Javier Solana,The peace agreement must be seen as a matter of urgency.
Javier Solana,A new agreement will make it much easier for us to realize the full potential of our partnership and will be a strong signal of our mutual commitment to deepening our relationship.
Javier Solana,Any military action is definitely out of the question for us.
Javier Solana,"This announcement is very bad news, but the timing of action by the international community remains that agreed by the UN Security Council."
Valerie Solanas,"As humans have a prior right to existence over dogs by virtue of being more highly evolved and having a superior consciousness, so women have a prior right to existence over men. The elimination of any male is, therefore, a righteous and good act, an act highly beneficial to women as well as an act of mercy."
Valerie Solanas,The male function is to produce sperm. We now have sperm banks.
Valerie Solanas,"Our society is not a community, but merely a collection of isolated family units."
Paulla Solar,"If I was going to send a tape out, it would be the one from that game."
Paulla Solar,"It was funny. I gave her the sheet and she said, 'Mrs. Solar, I'm sweating.' She was stunned."
Paulla Solar,"I absolutely believe that without that support and without that enthusiasm we would not be where we are. I think it helps to put us, in our tough games, over the edge knowing that you can hear them."
Petter Solberg,"It was better this afternoon. I think maybe I'm taking it too carefully, but I really want points here."
Petter Solberg,"Not perfect, but not bad times. On the second and third stages, the engine was running very warm, so it dropped to three cylinders and cut off the anti-lag from time to time."
Petter Solberg,Nothing really to report. We're going as fast as we can and had no major problems. We tried a few small changes to the set-up on the second section but didn't notice any significant improvement.
Petter Solberg,"I've got a good feeling, ... No problems at all. I've been pushing a little bit but, when I get a good split time through, I back off. The system seems to be working and I think I'm able to judge the pace quite well."
Petter Solberg,"The final leaderboard showed that I won the event, but in my mind I finished second, ... Sebastien deserved the win, but I can understand the reasons why he did what he did. But now we all have to keep going - it's what Beef would have wanted."
Petter Solberg,"I had an advantage this morning (Friday) in my start position, but the specials 5 and 6 were very hard."
Erik Solheim,"In order to keep the violence from escalating further, it is urgent to get the two parties to sit down together to discuss how to ensure that the cease-fire agreement is observed and how the peace process can be advanced."
Erik Solheim,It is of paramount importance that both parties should meet urgently and start talks toward consolidating the cease- fire agreement.
Erik Solheim,The (hoped-for) outcome of this meeting will be some way of strengthening the agreement on the cease-fire and hopefully that parties will meet again.
Frank Solich,I'm very excited about it for several reasons. It's great to be part of the game again and to get a chance to line up a football team. It will be great to get back into the routine of playing games.
Frank Solich,"I thought our kids played well. We did not necessarily play smart football. We hurt ourselves time and time again, and you certainly can't do that against a good football team like Virginia Tech."
Frank Solich,We will come back and get ready to start off on Monday. And hopefully meet the challenges that are ahead for us in the Mid-American Conference.

Suzanne Somers,Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself.
Suzanne Somers,"I started dieting. I dieted, dieted, dieted and tried all the diets and I would lose and then I would go back to normal eating and would put it on and then some."
Stephen Sommers,The best scary movies have great humor in them and a great story.
Stephen Sommers,"I love all of mythology and rules pertaining to all of the monsters, but I like to go the extra step."
Stephen Sommers,"I wanted to make a small movie about a guy and a girl on the beach, but then I thought, wouldn't it be cool if a werewolf was there?"
Marcellus Sommerville,There's no night off in this league.
Marcellus Sommerville,"I don't know who that team was coming out of the gates at home. After the game we had a team meeting, and that's when we decided we wanted to turn it around."
Marcellus Sommerville,We feel like we have a little more desire than to win just one game. We want to show the world what we can do.
Marcellus Sommerville,I'm from Peoria so I've heard about (Bradley basketball). Never have I heard the amount of volume that's been going around Peoria.
Marcellus Sommerville,I thought we did a good job of slowing them down and making them play half-court basketball.
Marcellus Sommerville,I went to Hersey Hawkins and Jim Les basketball camp when I was in grade school. I've heard stories. Never on this level have I heard the amount of volume that's been going around Peoria and the buzz.
Masayoshi Son,"Japan has the infrastructure for this kind of service, so it would be a shame not to use it."
Masayoshi Son,We aim to start mobile phone service by end of 2007.
Masayoshi Son,We hope to expand our online news service on a global basis in the future.
Stephen Sondheim,The concerts you enjoy together neighbors you annoy together children you destroy together that make marriage a joy
Stephen Sondheim,One difference between poetry and lyrics is that lyrics sort of fade into the background. They fade on the page and live on the stage when set to music.
Stephen Sondheim,"I was raised to be charming, not sincere."
Stephen Sondheim,I chose and my world was shaken. So what? The choice may have been mistaken; the choosing was not. You have to move on.
Stephen Sondheim,"Art, in itself, is an attempt to bring order out of chaos."
Barry Sonnenfeld,"There's a series of children's books called A Series of Unfortunate Events, which is like an incredibly dark version of Roald Dahl. I hope to start directing it."
Barry Sonnenfeld,"Will asked me if his two kids could be in the movie, so I put them in a scene towards the end where Will, Tommy, and Rosario are in Manhattan."
Barry Sonnenfeld,Will and Tommy Lee are the only actors I've ever worked with where neither of them want to say any lines.
Barry Sonnenfeld,"When Frank the Pug is singing I Will Survive, the only reason it's funny is that Will is in that shot trying not to get angry. A shot of a dog singing I Will Survive on its own will not get a laugh."
Barry Sonnenfeld,We should all relax about life because you don't have a clue as to what's really going on.
Barry Sonnenfeld,"We live in the country. Occasionally I hear sounds at night, so naturally I send my wife downstairs to check it out whilst I hide in the cupboard."
Barry Sonnenfeld,"We had to retain the sense that no one really knows what's going on, that in New York City, in the world, there are aliens, strange events."
Barry Sonnenfeld,They want to let the audience figure things out and let the reaction shot get the laugh.
Barry Sonnenfeld,"Michael worked one day. Everybody was a little freaked out and nervous because he's a really big star. We were already working with really big stars, but Michael is Michael."
Barry Sonnenfeld,Michael still agreed to be in it as long as he could wear a black suit-that's all that mattered to him. It was very funny and entirely Michael's idea.
Barry Sonnenfeld,Michael Jackson wanted to be in Men in Black II. He told me he had seen the first Men in Black in Paris and had stayed behind and sat there and wept. I had to explain to him that it was a comedy.
Barry Sonnenfeld,"It felt scary because there was no auditioning, no rehearsing."
Barry Sonnenfeld,"I was seeing a lot of really good things about Get Shorty when it came out, and my wife pointed out that if you validate the good reviews, you also have to validate the bad reviews."
Barry Sonnenfeld,"I really wanted Michael Jackson to be in the first Men in Black, but he didn't want to be considered as an alien!"
Barry Sonnenfeld,I play the father in the scene when Will and Tommy go back to Tommy's old apartment. It was a big mistake. I hope not to be in the next movie I direct.
Barry Sonnenfeld,I haven't read a review of one of my films for the best part of 10 years.
Barry Sonnenfeld,I don't think Will does get upstaged because his reaction is always funnier than what is actually happening. That is also the reason Tommy is funnier than Will.
Barry Sonnenfeld,"I don't believe in aliens living on planets as such, but I do believe there's stuff going on in this room that none of us have any idea about."
Barry Sonnenfeld,By definition a sequel can't be original. So you've got to figure out what worked the first time around.
Susan Sontag,The only interesting answers are those that destroy the questions.
Susan Sontag,"Photographs that depict suffering shouldn't be beautiful, as captions shouldn't moralize,"
Susan Sontag,"One set of messages of the society we live in is: Consume. Grow. Do what you want. Amuse yourselves. The very working of this economic system, which has bestowed these unprecedented liberties, most cherished in the form of physical mobility and material prosperity, depends on encouraging people to defy limits."
Susan Sontag,He who despises himself esteems himself as a self-despiser.
Susan Sontag,"Though collecting quotations could be considered as merely an ironic mimetism -- victimless collecting, as it were... in a world that is well on its way to becoming one vast quarry, the collector becomes someone engaged in a pious work of salvage. The course of modern history having already sapped the traditions and shattered the living wholes in which precious objects once found their place, the collector may now in good conscience go about excavating the choicer, more emblematic fragments."
Susan Sontag,It is the nature of aphoristic thinking to be always in a state of concluding; a bid to have the final word is inherent in all powerful phrase-making.
Susan Sontag,"Unfortunately, moral beauty in art -- like physical beauty in a person -- is extremely perishable. It is nowhere so durable as artistic or intellectual beauty. Moral beauty has a tendency to decay very rapidly into sententiousness or untimeliness."
Susan Sontag,"It's a pleasure to share one's memories. Everything remembered is dear, endearing, touching, precious. At least the past is safe --though we didn't know it at the time. We know it now. Because it's in the past; because we have survived."
Susan Sontag,Perversity is the muse of modern literature
Susan Sontag,Perversity is the muse of modern literature.
Susan Sontag,"The writer is either a practicing recluse or a delinquent, guilt-ridden one; or both. Usually both."
Susan Sontag,"The quality of American life is an insult to the possibilities of human growth. . . the pollution of American space, with gadgetry and cars and TV and box architecture, brutalizes the senses, making gray neurotics of most of us. . ."
Susan Sontag,The taste for worst-case scenarios reflects the need to master fear of what is felt to be uncontrollable. It also expresses an imaginative complicity with disaster.
Susan Sontag,"That even an apocalypse can be made to seem part of the ordinary horizon of expectation constitutes an unparalleled violence that is being done to our sense of reality, to our humanity."
Susan Sontag,What pornographic literature does is precisely to drive a wedge between one's existence as a sexual being - while in ordinary life a healthy person is one who prevents such a gap from opening up
Susan Sontag,"Societies need to have one illness which becomes identified with evil, and attaches blame to its victims."
Susan Sontag,"The standard that a society should actually embody its own professed principles is a utopian one, in the sense that moral principles contradict the way things really are --- and always will be. How things really are --- and always will be --- is neither all-evil nor all-good but deficient, inconsistent, inferior. Principles invite us to do something about the morass of contradictions in which we function morally. Principles invite us to clean up our act; to become intolerant of moral laxity and compromise and cowardice and the turning away from what is upsetting: that secret gnawing of the heart that tells us that what we are doing is not right, and so counsels us that we'd be better off just not thinking about it."
Susan Sontag,"I was not looking for my dreams to interpret my life, but rather for my life to interpret my dreams"
Susan Sontag,"The discovery of the good taste of bad taste can be very liberating. The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion."
Susan Sontag,"The hard truth is that what may be acceptable in elite culture may not be acceptable in mass culture, that tastes which pose only innocent ethical issues as the property of a minority become corrupting when they become more established. Taste is context, and the context has changed."
Susan Sontag,"Ours is a culture based on excess, on overproduction; the result is a steady loss of sharpness in our sensory experience. All the conditions of modern life -- its material plenitude, its sheer crowdedness -- conjoin to dull our sensory faculties."
Susan Sontag,"Ours is a culture based on excess, on overproduction; the result is a steady loss of sharpness in our sensory experience. All the conditions of modern life - its material plenitude, its sheer crowdedness - conjoin to dull our sensory faculties."
Susan Sontag,"In most modern instances, interpretation amounts to the philistine refusal to leave the work of art alone. Real art has the capacity to make us nervous. By reducing the work of art to its content and then interpreting that, one tames the work of art. Interpretation makes art manageable, conformable."
Susan Sontag,"Guns have metamorphosed into cameras in this earnest comedy, the ecology safari, because nature has ceased to be what it always had been , what people needed protection from. Now nature tamed, endangered, mortal , needs to be protected from people."
Susan Sontag,"Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick."
Susan Sontag,"With the modern diseases (once TB, now cancer) the romantic idea that the disease expresses the character is invariably extended to assert that the character causes the disease -- because it has not expressed itself. Passion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses."
Susan Sontag,"With the modern diseases (once TB, now cancer) the romantic idea that the disease expresses the character is invariably extended to assert that the character causes the disease - because it has not expressed itself. Passion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses."
Susan Sontag,"American energy. . . is the energy of violence, of free-floating resentment and anxiety unleashed by chronic cultural dislocations which must be, for the most part, ferociously sublimated. This energy has mainly been sublimated into crude materialism."
Susan Sontag,Using a camera appeases the anxiety which the work-driven feel about not working when they are on vacation and supposed to be having fun. They have something to do that is like a friendly imitation of work: they can take pictures.
Susan Sontag,The best emotions to write out of are anger and fear or dread. The least energizing emotion to write out of is admiration. It is very difficult to write out of because the basic feeling that goes with admiration is a passive contemplative mood.
Susan Sontag,What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine.
Susan Sontag,To photograph is to confer importance.
Susan Sontag,"The truth is balance, but the opposite of truth, which is unbalance, may not be a lie."
Susan Sontag,"The truth is always something that is told, not something that is known. If there were no speaking or writing, there would be no truth about anything. There would only be what is."
Susan Sontag,"The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art - and, by analogy, our own experience - more, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than to show what it means."
Susan Sontag,"Societies need to have one illness which becomes identified with evil, and attaches blame to its victims."
Susan Sontag,"So successful has been the camera's role in beautifying the world that photographs, rather than the world, have become the standard of the beautiful."
Susan Sontag,"Pornography is a theatre of types, never of individuals."
Susan Sontag,My idea of a writer: someone interested in everything.
Susan Sontag,Mallarme said that everything in the world exists in order to end in a book. Today everything exists to end in a photograph.
Susan Sontag,Lying is the most simple form of self-defence.
Susan Sontag,"It is not altogether wrong to say that there is no such thing as a bad photograph - only less interesting, less relevant, less mysterious ones."
Susan Sontag,I envy paranoids; they actually feel people are paying attention to them.
Susan Sontag,Camp is a vision of the world in terms of style - but a particular style. It is the love of the exaggerated.
Susan Sontag,"Silence remains, inescapably, a form of speech."
Susan Sontag,"Ambition, if it feeds at all, does so on the ambition of others."
Susan Sontag,Interpretation is the revenge of the intellectual upon art.
Susan Sontag,"I was not looking for my dreams to interpret my life, but rather for my life to interpret my dreams."
Susan Sontag,"The past itself, as historical change continues to accelerate, has become the most surreal of subjects - making it possible... to see a new beauty in what is vanishing."
Susan Sontag,"In the final analysis, style is art. And art is nothing more or less than various modes of stylized, dehumanized representation."
Susan Sontag,"Depression is melancholy minus its charms - the animation, the fits."
Susan Sontag,"As photographs give people an imaginary possession of a past that is unreal, they also help people to take possession of space in which they are insecure."
Susan Sontag,What is the most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine.
Susan Sontag,I do not think white America is committed to granting equality to the American Negro. This is a passionately racist country; it will continue to be so in the foreseeable future.
Susan Sontag,"Any critic is entitled to wrong judgments, of course. But certain lapses of judgment indicate the radical failure of an entire sensibility."
Susan Sontag,The taste for quotations (and for the juxtaposition of incongruous quotations) is a Surrealist taste.
Susan Sontag,A fiction about soft or easy deaths is part of the mythology of most diseases that are not considered shameful or demeaning.
Susan Sontag,The becoming of man is the history of the exhaustion of his possibilities.
Susan Sontag,"Although none of the rules for becoming more alive is valid, it is healthy to keep on formulating them."
Susan Sontag,The problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways: by extinction or duplication.
Susan Sontag,AIDS occupies such a large part in our awareness because of what it has been taken to represent. It seems the very model of all the catastrophes privileged populations feel await them.
Susan Sontag,"The love of the famous, like all strong passions, is quite abstract. Its intensity can be measured mathematically, and it is independent of persons."
Susan Sontag,"A family's photograph album is generally about the extended family and, often, is all that remains of it."
Susan Sontag,Anything in history or nature that can be described as changing steadily can be seen as heading toward catastrophe.
Susan Sontag,"To take a photograph is to participate in another person's mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time's relentless melt."
Susan Sontag,Sanity is a cozy lie.
Susan Sontag,Books are funny little portable pieces of thought.
Susan Sontag,"Existence is no more than the precarious attainment of relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past, present, and future."
Susan Sontag,"Volume depends precisely on the writer's having been able to sit in a room every day, year after year, alone."
Susan Sontag,It is not suffering as such that is most deeply feared but suffering that degrades.
Susan Sontag,"The truth is balance. However the opposite of truth, which is unbalance, may not be a lie."
Susan Sontag,"The camera makes everyone a tourist in other people's reality, and eventually in one's own."
Susan Sontag,"Most people in this society who aren't actively mad are, at best, reformed or potential lunatics."
Susan Sontag,"The life of the creative man is lead, directed and controlled by boredom. Avoiding boredom is one of our most important purposes."
Susan Sontag,"The painter constructs, the photographer discloses."
Susan Sontag,"I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says be serious, be passionate, wake up."
Susan Sontag,"Any important disease whose causality is murky, and for which treatment is ineffectual, tends to be awash in significance."
Susan Sontag,Surrealism is a bourgeois disaffection; that its militants thought it universal is only one of the signs that it is typically bourgeois.
Susan Sontag,Lying is an elementary means of self-defense.
Susan Sontag,"Victims suggest innocence. And innocence, by the inexorable logic that governs all relational terms, suggests guilt."
Susan Sontag,"Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art."
Susan Sontag,"The quality of American life is an insult to the possibilities of human growth... the pollution of American space, with gadgetry and cars and TV and box architecture, brutalizes the senses, making gray neurotics of most of us, and perverse spiritual athletes and strident self-transcenders of the best of us."
Susan Sontag,"In America, the photographer is not simply the person who records the past, but the one who invents it."
Susan Sontag,"Nature in America has always been suspect, on the defensive, cannibalized by progress. In America, every specimen becomes a relic."
Susan Sontag,"Life is not significant details, illuminated by a flash, fixed forever. Photographs are."
Susan Sontag,What we need is to use what we have.
Susan Sontag,Travel becomes a strategy for accumulating photographs.
Susan Sontag,Intelligence is really a kind of taste: taste in ideas.
Greg Sorbara,"We must remain focused and disciplined in searching for efficiencies and delivering better service to Ontarians, ... It is important to remember that there are always risks beyond our control, like the pace of recovery in the U.S economy, volatile oil prices and the strength of the Canadian dollar, that could affect our financial performance."
Greg Sorbara,"It's part of an MPP's job,"
Greg Sorbara,"I am therefore stepping aside as Minister of Finance and Chair of Management Board of Cabinet pending a resolution of this issue,"
Greg Sorbara,"The truth is, though, that while I'm away from my responsibilities at Finance, I get more opportunities to talk to students."
Greg Sorbara,"These results demonstrate a strong economy in Ontario and our commitment to strong financial management. As we stated in the 2005 budget, the deficit will be eliminated no later than 2008-09, or a year earlier, in 2007-08, if the reserve is not required,"
Kevin Sorbo,"You have to persevere. You have to do it. I have insecurities. But whatever I'm insecure about I don't dissect it, but I'll go after it and say, ''What am I afraid of?'' I bet the average successful person can tell you they've failed so much more than they've had success. I've had far more failures than I've had successes. With every commercial I've gotten, there were 200 I didn't get. You have to go after what you're afraid of."
Kevin Sorbo,The funny thing about television is that once you start to do it you never get time to watch it.
Kevin Sorbo,"This is just great fun, I really appreciate all the time and kind words all these people spend just to say hello to me, not something I'm ever even tempted to take for granted."
Kevin Sorbo,It's pretty cool. It's like an out-of-body experience.
Annika Sorenstam,This has been another great season and this victory caps it off.
Annika Sorenstam,"I come from a little town just like she does, ... So for her to travel all the way from Sweden and live your dream, when I saw that headline, I said, 'That's what I want to do.'"
Annika Sorenstam,She's got talent. She can really hit the ball.
Annika Sorenstam,She's got talent. She can really hit the ball. She's got a great head on her shoulders. She's really strong and her attitude is really something great.
Annika Sorenstam,"I had a lot of chances. I'm just not converting anything and when you don't, then you're making mistakes and walking away with bogey. So it's very frustrating and that's kind of how I feel like it's been the last month or so."
Annika Sorenstam,"I learned a lot from seeing the guys and how they practiced, how they approach it and just learning from them,"
Annika Sorenstam,"That was local knowledge. If I had never seen that putt before, I wouldn't have played enough break."
Annika Sorenstam,I'm just going to keep on grinding. I've had success at the Office Depot tournament and hope to defend my title there.
Annika Sorenstam,I'm excited to be here. It's great to be back as a defending champion. I think the golf course is in as good shape as I've ever seen it. I think that makes it even more special. I think I'm as ready as I can be.
Annika Sorenstam,"I think I've become friendly with the golf course. I think with the rain, it totally softened the greens. And it seems like I play well when I can be more aggressive. ... It's kind of a ball-striking type of golf course, which I say is one of my strengths as well."
Annika Sorenstam,"A lot of things have happened since [2001]. I'm happy to be back, and I've not played this golf course before. This is kind of close to my home in Tahoe, so it's about time I came back."
Annika Sorenstam,"A lot of things have happened since [2001], ... I'm happy to be back, and I've not played this golf course before. This is kind of close to my home in Tahoe, so it's about time I came back."
Annika Sorenstam,"I think Michelle is a great asset to the LPGA Tour and great for golf,"
Annika Sorenstam,"Obviously I'm very happy with my position. It was good steady golf, hitting a lot of fairways and greens and I'm putting very well."
Annika Sorenstam,Golf has definitely been my savior during this period and I'm very proud of the way I have performed again this season.
Annika Sorenstam,"I like this golf course, ... I shoot under par here because I'm making my putts. I feel confident when I come here and I think that's important."
Annika Sorenstam,Obviously I'm in a position that I want to be. I like this golf course. I had a good (round) last year on Sunday. I'm going to keep that in my mind.
Annika Sorenstam,This is a tough golf course. You really have to strike it well.
Annika Sorenstam,"Michelle is very, very talented, ... She is a great asset to golf. I welcome her. The bottom line is, I'm a competitor. I will have my game do the talking. I think it has for the last 10 years, and I will continue to do it that way."
Annika Sorenstam,I played four solid rounds of golf and I want to try to finish the season as hot as the way I started it (three wins in a row).
Annika Sorenstam,"I'm very proud of the way I played and I played four solid rounds of golf,"
Annika Sorenstam,"My caddie told me not to get too cute. He told me, 'Just get it on the green. You're putting well.' That's what I did."
Annika Sorenstam,It shows a lot of consistency. It's tough to rate this against some of my other accomplishments because they're all so different. But to do something nobody has ever done is going to rank right up there.
Annika Sorenstam,It was brutal out there. I just wanted to go into the clubhouse for a coffee.
Guillaume Soro,We think we are on the right track. We mustn't be impatient. We have made progress and we will continue to make progress until peace arrives.
Guillaume Soro,We discussed the peace process. We had a fruitful exchange and I leave here convinced that we are on the right track to achieve peace quickly in Ivory Coast.
Guillaume Soro,As for peace we subscribe to the UN resolution... although it contains some contractions. We shall together achieve peace if the major and essential challenge of identification of our population and our combatants are taken up.
Guillaume Soro,"Here, in our territory, the elections will not take place on October 30."
Guillaume Soro,"Our people ask for nothing more than the recognition of citizenship, nothing more than the right to live on the land where their ancestors were born. Nothing more than their identity cards."
George Soros,"You have the potential of a breakdown of the entire system if you have a slowdown of economic activity in the center even as inflationary pressures mount, ... We're on the edge of it, yes."
George Soros,"President Bush is endangering our safety, hurting our vital interests, and undermining American values."
George Soros,"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception."
George Soros,"I'm not doing my philanthropic work, out of any kind of guilt, or any need to create good public relations. I'm doing it because I can afford to do it, and I believe in it."
George Soros,"This is unrelated to last week's events,"
George Soros,"Most of the poverty and misery in the world is due to bad government, lack of democracy, weak states, internal strife, and so on."
George Soros,The conference is remarkable for its complacency -- it's a bit like dancing on the Titanic. They're having a very good time and there's a very cheerful atmosphere.
George Soros,"My foundations support people in the country who care about an open society. It's their work that I'm supporting. So it's not me doing it. But I can empower them. I can support them, and I can help them."
George Soros,"This would enable the authority to set a ceiling on the amounts it is willing to insure,"
Martin Sorrell,"The television ratings were, I think, a little bit disappointing, but NBC said they made a good return on it."
Martin Sorrell,result in limited pricing power.
Martin Sorrell,"I have never heard such optimism, and such positive noise about growth and development in India,"
Martin Sorrell,"Primarily our strategy is organic growth, buttressed by acquisitions."
Martin Sorrell,a terribly invidious position by people giving him an earache about this.
Martin Sorrell,There are very few events that have significant reach anymore. That's the paradox of Super Bowl advertising -- why does a 30-second spot cost $2.5 million? There is a pool of money which has remained pretty much the same that is willing to bid for those programs.
Sammy Sosa,"I'm real happy my name is in the record book, but it means nothing because we lost."
Sammy Sosa,"My situation is different from Mark's. I'm not looking for home runs, I'm looking for the playoffs."
Sammy Sosa,"I've always swung the same way. The difference is when I swing and miss, people say, 'He's swinging for the fences.' But when I swing and make contact people say, 'That's a nice swing.' But there's no difference, it's the same swing."
Sammy Sosa,"It's going to be unbelievable, you know. There's going to be a lot of people cheering for Mark McGwire and me. And, hey, we'll see how it goes."
Sammy Sosa,"I can't do it every day. They're not going to give me much to hit right now. They're pitching me real well. If I get there, fine."
Sammy Sosa,"When you're in the middle of a pennant race, you can't go up there thinking about home runs."
Sammy Sosa,"To tell the truth, I never think about a homer. I'm just thinking of the situation and what I've got to do when I go to the plate."
Sammy Sosa,"Don't compare me to Babe Ruth. God gave me the opportunity and the ability to be here at the right time, at the right moment, just like he gave Babe Ruth when he was playing. I just hope I can keep doing what I've been doing - keep taking care of business."
Sammy Sosa,"Everyone knows that what happened to me is great, but at the other side I care about winning. I care about the team and the situation right now."
Sammy Sosa,"I'm not keeping track, but the record is there for someone to break."
Sammy Sosa,"You have to enjoy it. It is not going to happen every year, so this is the year that it is happening and we have got to go out there and enjoy it."
Sammy Sosa,"I'm seeing the ball well. I'm not trying for home runs. I'm trying to hit to right field more. When I do that, the home run comes."
Sammy Sosa,I said to myself I've got to go up there and do it because the New York Mets keep winning every day. The game was on the line and I wanted to go out there and come through for my team. That win tonight means a lot for us.
Soundarya,"Not at all, I wanted to go into medicine. I took science in college. But my dad was a Producer - Director in Kannada films, and someone saw me, and one thing led to another."
Soundarya,"Luckily I have a brother who looks after my administration and my money, because I'm a total spendthrift."
Soundarya,"If I have to do something, I feel I should do it perfectly, and ofcourse, Hindi language is a problem."
Soundarya,I'd like to be known for my character.
Soundarya,"I love hats, shoes, outfits, handbags, and ethnic jewelery."
Soundarya,"I like cooking but I don't know much and whenever I enter the kitchen, my mother sends me out! Because whenever I try a dish from a book, it comes out bad."
Soundarya,"I hardly have any spare time! But when I do, I garden a lot - I love plants and flowers."
Soundarya,Everyone tells me that I have a very sweet face! I'd like to change that. I wish I had a more flexible face!
Soundarya,"But if I had to do it, handle money, then I think I could be responsible, yes."
Soundarya,"As far as I'm concerned I've never had a problem with anybody, no rivalry."
Soundarya,"Although working with Amitabh Bacchan was a different experience altogether, I just enjoyed it."
Graeme Souness,"When you raise both feet off the ground in a tackle these days, you are facing trouble. I think, especially away from home, when you lift your feet and launch yourself at someone you are risking everything. That's the game today."
Graeme Souness,"We are not going to risk Michael for the game at Grimsby but we fully expect him to be back in action for the league game at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday,"
Graeme Souness,"We have had a week where we have tried to sign a couple of quality players and it has not happened but we have still a bit of time left in the transfer window,"
Graeme Souness,He's [Alan Shearer] the mother hen. He's got to look after them all out on there on the pitch.
Graeme Souness,"My intention is to have a word with the chairman and extend Lee's contract until the end of this season,"
Graeme Souness,This is a mighty blow. It is an absolute disaster for Michael Owen and an absolute disaster for the club.
Graeme Souness,It's a mighty blow. It's an absolute disaster for him and an absolute disaster for the club. It's a dark day for us.
Graeme Souness,"This was the first game since last November where I've had decisions to make about who to leave out. The team has picked itself up until this day,"
Graeme Souness,"It certainly wasn't confrontational, we went for a cup of coffee and discussed general things about the playing side."
Souza,Dance as though no one is watchingLove as though you've never been hurtSing as though no one can hear youLive as though heaven is on earth.
Souza,"I have that fear (of West Nile) - I step out at dusk and I'm slapping my arms and legs because you just don't know which one is the viral carrier, ... I spoke to one of my doctor friends this morning. I asked him what concerns does he have, as a doctor, about the spray. And he says he has none at all."
Souza,"It sets up sort of a three-company race toward who's going to control the environment where software plays out,"
Souza,"People who get this cancer are those who have GERD and, in the U.S., probably 60 million people have reflux and about 20 percent of those have reflux on a weekly basis, and those are the ones who'd be most at risk to get this cancer, ... If you have chronic reflux, you need to pay attention, and if you have reflux and you have trouble swallowing, weight loss or bleeding, you should see a doctor. Those are alarm or early-warning signs."
Souza,"Even though it's increased, it's still not as prevalent as colon cancer,"
Souza,"[Obesity may also play a role in the disease.] No one is really sure, ... In the West, body mass index is increasing, and it's thought that by becoming obese, people are more predisposed to getting heartburn."
Thomas Sowell,Unbounded morality ultimately becomes counterproductive even in terms of the same moral principles being sought. The law of diminishing returns applies to morality.
Thomas Sowell,"Morality, like other inputs into the social process, follows the law of diminishing returns- meaning ultimately, negative returns. People can be too moral."
Thomas Sowell,"Considering the enormous range of human knowledge, from intimate personal knowledge of specific individuals to the complexities of organizations and the subtleties of feelings, it is remarkable that one speck in this firmament should be the sole determinant of whether someone is considered knowledgeable or ignorant in general. Yet it is a fact of life that an unlettered person is considered ignorant, however much he may know about nature and man, and a Ph.D. is never considered ignorant, however barren his mind might be outside his narrow specialty and however little he grasps about human feeling or social complexities."
Thomas Sowell,"Physicists have determined that even the most solid and heavy mass of matter we see is mostly empty space. But at the submicroscopic level, specks of matter scattered through a vast emptiness have such incredible density and weight, and are linked to one another by such powerful forces, that together they produce all the properties of concrete, cast iron and solid rock. In much the same way, specks of knowledge are scattered through a vast emptiness of ignorance, and everything depends upon how solid the individual specks of knowledge are, and on how powerfully linked and coordinated they are with one another."
Thomas Sowell,With various people complaining about price gouging... economist Walter Williams has coined a new term: Tax gouging. But government is never accused of either greed or gouging  not even when they bulldoze people's homes in order to turn the land over to businesses that will pay more taxes.
Thomas Sowell,"One of the common failings among honorable people is a failure to appreciate how thoroughly dishonorable some other people can be, and how dangerous it is to trust them"
Thomas Sowell,"Social values in general are incrementally variable: neither safety, diversity, rational articulation, nor morality is categorically a good thing to have more of, without limits. All are subject to diminishing returns, and ultimately negative returns."
Thomas Sowell,What multiculturalism boils down to is that you can praise any culture in the world except Western culture - and you cannot blame any culture in the world except Western culture
Thomas Sowell,"One of the consequences of such notions as entitlements is that people who have contributed nothing to society feel that society owes them something, apparently just for being nice enough to grace us with their presence."
Thomas Sowell,"If you are not prepared to use force to defend civilization, then be prepared to accept barbarism"
Thomas Sowell,Civilization is an enormous device for economizing knowledge.
Thomas Sowell,"Cultures contain many cues and inducements to dissuade the individual from approaching ultimate limits, in much the same way that a special warning strip of land around the edge of a baseball field lets a player know that he is about to run into a concrete wall when he is preoccupied with catching the ball. The wider that strip of land and the more sensitive the player is to the changing composition of the ground under his feet as he pursues the ball, the more effective the warning. Romanticizing or lionizing as individualistic those people who disregard social cues and inducements increases the danger of head-on collisions with inherent social limits. Decrying various forms of social disapproval is in effect narrowing the warning strip."
Thomas Sowell,"Given that some social processes must convey inherent constraints, the choice is among various mixtures of persuasion, force, and cultural inducement. The less of one, the more of the others. The degree of freedom that is possible is therefore tied to the extent to which people respond to persuasion or inducement."
Thomas Sowell,"While rationalism at the individual level is a plea for more personal autonomy from cultural norms, at the social level it is often a claim- or arrogation- of power to stifle the autonomy of others."
Thomas Sowell,"It is amazing that people who think we cannot afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, and medication somehow think that we can afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, medication and a government bureaucracy to administer it."
Thomas Sowell,The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite.
Wole Soyinka,"Obasanjo has openly endorsed violence as a means of governance, embraced and empowered individuals whose avowed declarations, confessions and acts are cynically contrary to the mandate that alone upholds the legitimacy and dignity of his office."
Wole Soyinka,"[Soyinka and some of the others now charged fled Nigeria after Abacha seized power.] Abacha is a psychopath, and a pathological liar, ... He knows he doesn't have one shred of proof connecting me to these bombings."
Wole Soyinka,Obasanjo has acted sufficiently against the constitution to warrant his impeachment. There is more than enough evidence to warrant his impeachment.
Wole Soyinka,The greatest threat to freedom is the absence of criticism.
Kevin Spacey,"Lester goes through not only a spiritual and emotional reawakening, but he gets pumped up, ... I had to work with a trainer for about four months and then every day on the set, twice a day."
Kevin Spacey,"Lester goes through not only a spiritual and emotional reawakening, but he gets pumped up. I had to work with a trainer for about four months and then every day on the set, twice a day."
Kevin Spacey,If you haven't turned rebel by twenty you've got no heart; if you haven't turned establishment by thirty you've got no brains!
Kevin Spacey,"It's a remarkable play, very funny and provocative and challenging, and to have a new work is a double whammy for us,"
Kevin Spacey,"I'm not handsome in the classical sense. The eyes droop, the mouth is crooked, the teeth aren't straight, the voice sounds like a Mafioso pallbearer, but somehow it all works."
Kevin Spacey,"I'm aware that, from the outside, this looks like I've got quite an ego."
Kevin Spacey,"makes people think ... and have a healthy debate and an open debate, rather than being so fiercely on one side or the other."
Kevin Spacey,The Life of David Gale.
Glenn Sparks,"This is a great form of entertainment, but it can be harmful when people are unable to sort out what is real and what isn't. For example, watching these shows could encourage people who can least afford it to start spending money on psychics. ... The networks should consider posting disclaimers about the reality of the shows."
Glenn Sparks,"This is a great form of entertainment, but it can be harmful when people are unable to sort out what is real and what isn't,"
Glenn Sparks,"Also, teenagers' belief systems are still forming, so they are more susceptible to being influenced by these shows. Parents should talk to their children about what they are watching, and the networks should consider posting disclaimers about the reality of the shows."
Glenn Sparks,This genre may be appealing in this scientific age because people are interested in belief beyond the scientific way of knowing.
Burning Spear,"Our music/they think that we lose it,"
Burning Spear,"It's a good thing and it's actually the second time that I'll be there. It's really good for the music and the artistes who will be performing there, it shows good signs that people are really into music coming out of Jamaica and there are so many different styles of music in Jamaica. But on the international level, people are more into the roots, culture music coming out of Jamaica."
Burning Spear,Music is more than just listening to it. People use the music for them protection at times.
Burning Spear,Students have to be taught about everything. So therefore the knowledge of the students would develop around and about everything.
Britney Spears,"Look, there's another kid hiding from his parents,"
Britney Spears,"I'll be like, 'Epidural, please!' ... I don't want to go through the pain."
Britney Spears,I need to sing and I love to travel.
Britney Spears,"I think I'm more grounded, you know, and I know what I want out of life and I'm, you know, my morals are really, you know, strong and I have major beliefs about certain things and I think that has helped me, you know, from being, you know, coming from a really small town."
Britney Spears,I went to a psychoanalyst. He explained things about my love life that I found very impressive... almost scary. He said I had a problem with closeness and intimacy... that I was afraid of letting myself fall for someone and of being hurt.
Britney Spears,There's no master plan! I'm just gonna be me and hope it all works out!
Britney Spears,I always listen to 'NSYNC's Tearin' Up My Heart. It reminds me to wear a bra.
Britney Spears,"Justin [Timberlake] is everything, and what more could you want in a person? He's funny. He's cute. He's great. He just understands. I get him and he gets me, and that's cool."
Britney Spears,"Britney has been horrified by what has happened in New Orleans. She's not particularly keen on filming the birth, but with all this talk of money she had to stop and think about what she could do with it. All she's concerned about is that the program is tastefully done and she gets her privacy."
Britney Spears,I don't want to go through the pain. My mom said giving birth was the most excruciating thing she's ever gone through in her life.
Britney Spears,"I had a horrifying, frightful encounter with the paparazzi while I was with my baby."
Britney Spears,"Justin Timberlake is everything, and what more could you want in a person? He's funny. He's cute. He's great. He just understands. I get him and he gets me, and that's cool."
Britney Spears,"I know not everyone will like me, but this is who I am so if you don't like it, tough!"
Britney Spears,Christina Aguilera and I are friends no matter what the media makes up.
Britney Spears,"I go out with friends, but I don't have time to get in trouble."
Britney Spears,"I want to be an artist that everyone can relate to, that's young, happy and fun."
Britney Spears,"I don't want to pierce anything. I think it's outdated. Belly rings and all are, like, old."
Britney Spears,"Every night, I have to read a book, so that my mind will stop thinking about things that I stress about."
Britney Spears,I'm so happy to be able to give kids the opportunity to learn about amazing world of dance and music that I've have been lucky enough to make such a big part of my own life.
Britney Spears,I don't like defining myself. I just am.
Britney Spears,"I like meeting all my fans and signing autographs, although it can all get a bit crazy. Yesterday, for example, a boy just came over and planted a big kiss on my face! I was like, 'Hello?'"
Britney Spears,"I'm rich, freakin' rich. It's crazy."
Britney Spears,Don't treat me like a little girl.
Britney Spears,"I always wanted to be a singer, it's what I wanted to do since I was little. I'm doing it now and I couldn't be happier."
Britney Spears,"I did not have implants, I just had a growth spurt."
Britney Spears,"I wish my hair was thicker, and I wish my feet were prettier. My toes are really ugly. I wish my ears were smaller. And my nose could be smaller too."
Britney Spears,"I remember I read this harsh review about my show, and one of my friends told me that this was the exact same stuff people said about Madonna. And it's like, she didn't care. Madonna just came out and was herself. I respect that a lot."
Britney Spears,"When you're comfortable with someone you love, the silence is the best. And, that's how me and J. are. When we're in a room together, we don't have to say anything. It's for real."
Britney Spears,"With love, you should go ahead and take the risk of getting hurt... because love is an amazing feeling."
Britney Spears,"I don't want people kissing my butt. If I had a bad show and I know it, don't tell me I had a good show. I hate that. I guess because I'm 17, people think I don't see stuff like that."
Britney Spears,"I'm not at the point where I'd feel safe in a house alone. I would be really scared. I'm the kind of person that when I get up to go use the bathroom I have this big long hallway, and I just know someone's going to jump out and get me."
Britney Spears,Marry Prince William? I'd love that. Who wouldn't want to be a princess?
Britney Spears,Onstage I'm the happiest person in the world.
Britney Spears,"I don't really have time to sit down and write. But when I think of a melody, I call up my answering machine and sing it, so I won't forget it."
Britney Spears,"I would like to be called an inspiration to people, not a role model - because I make mistakes like everybody else. When I'm offstage, I'm just like everybody else."
Britney Spears,"The cool thing about being famous is traveling. I have always wanted to travel across seas, like to Canada and stuff."
Britney Spears,I'm attracted to guys who are really confident and make conversation.
Britney Spears,England is one of my favorite places. The fans are just so crazy.
Britney Spears,"I would really, really, really like to be a legend like Madonna. Madonna knows what to do next, and when she's performing, the audience is just in awe of her."
Britney Spears,Her vocal range is very powerful. I couldn't sing that strong at her age.
Britney Spears,"I don't understand the whole dating thing. I know right off the bat if I'm interested in someone, and I don't want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I'm not interested in that person."
Arlen Specter,I worry that these acquisitions and these mergers can only spell higher costs for the consumer and in the long run problems for the employees of these companies.
Arlen Specter,"I think that we ought to have more women on the court. Two is a bare minimum. We really ought to have more,"
Arlen Specter,I don't like it much. I have to have a large clothespin over my nose but I'm voting for it.
Arlen Specter,"I believe there is value in rolling up the score,"
Arlen Specter,"I want to know what the truth is,"
Arlen Specter,"And I think he may have a little different view about television, something that I have advocated for more than a decade in the court, ... He's a new generation."
Arlen Specter,"He comes across as very strong, and strength is contagious. It's good to see him and how confident he is."
Arlen Specter,"In our free society, anyone can speak out as they choose on any subject. I am concerned that the Roberts nomination, or others to follow, may provide an occasion for such advertising to get out of hand, ... The NARAL television advertisement is blatantly untrue and unfair. ..."
Arlen Specter,I must say I am not pleased to have to arrange the Senate schedule around the availability of Senators who are running for President.
Arlen Specter,"Regrettably, you need homeland security, and I think you are going to need it if not forever, for the foreseeable future,"
Arlen Specter,"It would be quite a sacrifice for her, but she's prepared to do it if she is asked, ... By next June we'll know a lot more about Judge Roberts ... than we do today."
Arlen Specter,"I do not believe, personally, that it is appropriate to punish him (by forcing him to sit out the rest of the season). He's not committed a crime, he's committed a breach of contract. And what they're doing against him is vindictive."
Arlen Specter,We all have a responsibility to ask probing questions to determine qualification beyond academic and professional standing.
Arlen Specter,I'm concerned that it has potential. It may.
Arlen Specter,"We are proceeding in a matter of the utmost, utmost gravity -- the potential for impeachment of the president of the United States -- and I think American people will demand and are entitled to that kind of bipartisanship,"
Arlen Specter,"These decisions pose two major problems, ... A lack of stability or predictability in the law because the two cases, decided three years apart, are virtually indistinguishable; and, two, the court's judicial activism in functioning as a super legislature."
Arlen Specter,"There is a little different approach in confirmation of the chief justice, ... I'm concerned about the conferences, about bringing the court together."
Arlen Specter,The new chief justice will have his work cut out.
Arlen Specter,"The new chief justice will have his work cut out to try and bring consensus to the court, ... There is much to be done to move away from the 5-4 decisions of the court."
Arlen Specter,"The word is that the justices very much applaud his nomination to be chief justice, ... He has the potential, almost from a running start, to bring a new day and a new era to the Supreme Court."
Arlen Specter,a stampede to justice.
Arlen Specter,"She's intelligent, she's hard-working, unquestioned integrity. She fought her way up, couldn't get a job when she graduated from law school because she was a woman."
Arlen Specter,"Because of enormous public importance of the upcoming mayoral election, the Department of Justice should release all information concerning the issue related to the bugging of Mayor Street's office, so long as no potential defendant's rights are compromised and no harm will come to any pending investigation,"
Arlen Specter,"Judge Roberts has projected a very unique persona as he has talked about modesty and humility,"
Arlen Specter,"It is my hope that the president will now send us a nominee for Justice O'Connor's spot in the mold of Judge Roberts,"
Arlen Specter,the expectation is that [an announcement] is very imminent.
Arlen Specter,"If you have a sharp turn in the court you undercut reliance, expectation, and, as Roberts would say, stability,"
Arlen Specter,"A lot of people have shifted their views, ... People do shift, so there may be an evolution of his thinking."
Arlen Specter,"If you are going to have to play defense all the time, you cannot have the kind of ingenuity, assertiveness, independence, and intelligence which is what has made our country strong."
Arlen Specter,There's going to be a great national debate on this subject.
Arlen Specter,[Noting that Bush said during the third campaign debate that he would] not impose a litmus test ... would expect the president to be mindful of the considerations I've mentioned.
Arlen Specter,"It naturally raises cynicism when you have so many 5-4 decisions from our Supreme Court and 4-3 decisions out of the Florida Supreme Court and that is not healthy, ... But our republic will survive."
Arlen Specter,"I suggest it may be very helpful to U.S. efforts to secure Venezuela's cooperation in our joint attack on drug interdiction if the rhetoric would be reduced,"
Arlen Specter,But not on this conversation. We've had it. I've had it.
Arlen Specter,open and honest public conversation with the nominee...is an important part of this process.
Arlen Specter,"[But Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), a member of Hatch's committee, took issue with that view.] I rechecked the Constitution. I do not believe that ignoring a subpoena would be grounds for impeachment, ... Late Edition."
Arlen Specter,"She said she believes there's a right to privacy (in the Constitution), ... And she believes Griswold was rightly decided."
Arlen Specter,Do you believe today that the right to privacy does exist in the Constitution?
Arlen Specter,"As a matter of traditional and sound constitutional doctrine, an amendment to the Constitution should be the last resort when all other measures have proved inadequate."
Arlen Specter,"But I think that it is important to elevate the public consciousness as to what is going on. The four hearings we have had and the way the matter is drifting, in my view, is insufficient to safeguard civil liberties."
Arlen Specter,The president's [fiscal year] '07 budget proposal is going to require substantial modifications by the Congress.
Arlen Specter,"[The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision rejected Congress' findings and its] method of reasoning, ... Is there any real justification for the court's denigrating Congress' 'method of reasoning'?"
Arlen Specter,"At any rate, Congress hasn't acted, and that's really what the focus of our hearing is today as to what ought to be done."
Arlen Specter,"I don't want to rule out a compromise,"
Arlen Specter,a very heavy commitment to legal interpretation which might differ from his own personal views.
Arlen Specter,"[Specter said afterward that he had urged Bush to delay naming a choice to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.] The president was noncommittal, ... The body language was not very positive."
Arlen Specter,"When we take a look at the budget for the National Institutes of Health at $28 billion, it is, candidly, scandalous that with our resources, our resource capability, research capability in biomedical science, that people are still dying of breast cancer or colon cancer or heart disease."
Arlen Specter,"I do hope that when we in the Congress, both in this body -- when responsibilities come to the Senate -- and the other body, in the House of Representatives, there will be an approach which is bipartisan and nonpartisan in nature,"
Arlen Specter,"I believe it is important and timely for you to make a full public response on the propriety of your ruling on cases involving Vanguard and Smith Barney, Inc., at times when you had money invested in Vanguard Mutual Funds and Smith Barney, Inc., was your brokerage firm."
Arlen Specter,"I believe the next nomination is going to be a great deal more contentious than the Roberts nomination. I say that because, bubbling just below the surface was a lot of frustration in the hearing that we just concluded."
Arlen Specter,"I have raised a certain cautionary signal, that I believe the next nomination is going to be a great deal more contentious than the Roberts nomination,"
Arlen Specter,"I found it was easier to get out of bed than to stay in bed, so I got out of bed and went about my business,"
Arlen Specter,"The balance of power is not being maintained in America today, ... The Supreme Court is interpreting the Constitution in derogation of congressional authority."
Arlen Specter,I have seen virtually no agreement on anything when it comes to this immigration bill. Emotions are running at an all-time high.
Arlen Specter,"[But that is Bush's call, Specter said.] Taking advice is not too hard as long as you get to make the final decision, ... And the Constitution doesn't say the president should do more than take advice."
Phil Spector,I've always had a problem within myself of feeling that people didn't really see me as a musician and I'm out to get a bit of musical credibility.
Phil Spector,"I'm dealing in rock'n'roll. I'm, like, I'm not a bona fide human being."
Phil Spector,The gun went off accidentally.
Malcolm Speed,"For the past three years at least, we've been asked that players be allowed not to comply with their agreements with Zimbabwe, or that cricket not be played in Zimbabwe,"
Malcolm Speed,"We have worked through initial drafts and all of the countries will now be given an opportunity to comment on a revised six-year plan,"
Malcolm Speed,"Australia, Bermuda, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, UAE and the West Indies have indicated their intention to be considered as hosts for an inaugural Twenty20 event while England, Hong Kong, Nepal and Scotland have also expressed an interest in hosting future events."
Malcolm Speed,We started the event with 12 teams but reduced it to a 10-team event following criticism there was too much disparity between the top 10 and the 11th and 12th teams.
Malcolm Speed,Racism in any form is abhorrent and everyone in cricket is unhappy with the way in which players from international teams have been subjected to racist abuse in Australia.
Malcolm Speed,Respect for each other is a key component of the game and racist comments have no place in cricket. That this is an isolated incident by a small number of people in one country does not lessen the game's resolve to address the issue.
Malcolm Speed,Cricket is an international game which is played by a diverse range of cultures and communities. Respect for each other is a key component of the game and racist comments have no place in cricket.
Malcolm Speed,"We believe that's the best way that cricket can show it's remorse, can show the people of the countries that have been affected that we're thinking of them and we're concerned to do whatever we can to ease the suffering at this terrible time."
Malcolm Speed,"We need to see whether it can add value to international cricket or take value away from it. We need to be careful to preserve 50-over and, particularly, test cricket."
Malcolm Speed,"For 18 months the ICC have been consistently reviewing the role that Twenty20 cricket could play internationally, and this response indicates there is strong interest from many parts of the cricket world in this type of event."
Malcolm Speed,"This FTP protects the status of Test cricket, ensures that prestigious historical Test series can continue to be contested over four or five matches and provides certainty of planning for our members."
Malcolm Speed,It is now an established part of the global cricket calendar taking place every two years and when the ICC comes to sell television rights for all its events up to 2015 later this year it will form part of the package available to broadcasters.
Malcolm Speed,"The passion that India has for the game is greater than any other country has for any sport. Factor in the billion-plus population and an economy growing by 7 to 8%?and what that means for the value of TV rights, advertising and sponsorship?and you understand the commercial power of India."
Malcolm Speed,"We do not normally comment on the operational activities of the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but in light of the volume of utterly unfounded reports relating to the recent tri-series in Zimbabwe it is important to make it clear that there is no investigation being undertaken into this series,"
Malcolm Speed,You will appreciate that BCCI and ICC are on a collision course and that the consequences for world cricket are of great significance.
Malcolm Speed,"You will appreciate that BCCI and ICC are on a collision course and that the consequences for world cricket are of great significance,"
Malcolm Speed,"Rod Marsh was on top of the list of the possible candidates, ... Rod's rich experience as a top-class international player and highly respected academy coach in Australia and England will be an invaluable asset."
Malcolm Speed,Rod Marsh was on top of the list of the possible candidates. Rod's rich experience as a top-class international player and highly respected academy coach in Australia and England will be an invaluable asset.
Malcolm Speed,Graeme Smith and Shaun Pollock have been given an enviable number of options to cover all match circumstances.
Malcolm Speed,I firmly believe that Sunil and his co-selectors have chosen wisely in making their choices and have given Graeme Smith and Shaun Pollock an enviable number of options to cover all match circumstances.
Malcolm Speed,"With greater certainty regarding the place of ICC events in the calendar, the ICC and its members are now in a position to continue their discussions over the introduction of a six-year program."
Malcolm Speed,The ICC requires clean cricket venues free of advertising signage to protect the rights of our sponsors.
Albert Speer,Temporarily in 1934 I became a department head in the German Labor Front and dealt with the improvement of labor conditions in German factories. Then I was in charge of public works on the staff of Hess. I gave up both these activities in 1941.
Albert Speer,It is certain that concentration camps had a bad reputation with us.
Albert Speer,"In all my activities as Armament Minister I never once visited a labor camp, and cannot, therefore, give any information about them."
Albert Speer,I would rather not tell you here things which every German has at heart.
Albert Speer,"It is clear that a worker who has not enough food cannot achieve a good work output. I already said yesterday that every head of a plant, and I too at the top, was naturally interested in having well-fed and satisfied workers, because badly fed, dissatisfied workers make more mistakes and produce poor results."
Albert Speer,"No doubt concentration camps were a means, a menace used to keep order."
Albert Speer,One seldom recognizes the devil when he has his hand on your shoulder.
Albert Speer,"All sensible Army people turned gas warfare down as being utterly insane since, in view of your superiority in the air, it would not be long before it would bring the most terrible catastrophe upon German cities, which were completely unprotected."
Margaret Spellings,"I see lots of support for it in the states. I think smart governors know, all governors know, that if you don't have an educated work force you're not going to have a strong and thriving state economy."
Margaret Spellings,It does show us that we're going to need to accelerate our progress at all grade levels and with all kids if we're to meet our goal
Margaret Spellings,implement this law in a sensible and workable way.
Margaret Spellings,"The result does show us we need to accelerate progress at all grade levels, with all kids, if we are to meet those goals,"
Margaret Spellings,"We don't want to write off this school year academically for these kids, and shouldn't, at least not yet."
Margaret Spellings,"We're open to new ideas, but we're not taking our eye off the ball,"
Margaret Spellings,"A growth model is not a way around accountability standards,"
Margaret Spellings,"The federal government is doing something it has never done before, ... Our 9 percent investment is going to 90 percent. That's my big news."
Margaret Spellings,m working with the White House Task Force on Hurricane Katrina Response in order to find ways that we can help these children in any way we can. We will stick with these communities for as long as it takes to get them back on their feet.
Margaret Spellings,"These Blue Ribbon Schools are an example of what teachers and students can achieve, ... For the first time, we are insisting on results and accountability in return for our federal investment in education."
Margaret Spellings,"We must not penalize any school of any kind for its commitment to these students,"
Margaret Spellings,"Also, make sure your children are challenged â€“ make sure they are bringing more and more rigorous work home."
Margaret Spellings,"This is a national commitment to you all here in the Gulf Coast, ... We owe each of these precious children, particularly after all they have been through, a high quality education."
Margaret Spellings,"This is a victory for children and parents all across the country. Chief Judge Friedman's decision validates our partnership with states to close the achievement gap, hold schools accountable and to ensure all students are reading and doing math at grade-level by 2014."
Margaret Spellings,"There are things in the Department of Education's budget and the federal government's general (budget) that the president has called for either trimming or eliminating, (and) those things I'm sure will be on the table as we negotiate with"
Margaret Spellings,"As children across America get ready to start classes, our thoughts and prayers are with the children who are living along the Gulf Coast and who may not be able to return to their schools for weeks or months. I'm working with the White House Task Force on Hurricane Katrina Response in order to find ways that we can help these children in any way we can. We will stick with these communities for as long as it takes to get them back on their feet."
Margaret Spellings,"The achievement gap is closing and that is great news for every student, ... These Blue Ribbon Schools are an example of what teachers and students can achieve."
Margaret Spellings,"My top priority is raising student achievement, and I'm going to be as flexible as I possibly can to help all students, ... This is about children's futures and ensuring that New York City's parents have as many options as possible for their children. In exchange for more flexibility, New York City has committed to being accountable for making high-quality academic help available to more students, which will lead to increased achievement."
Margaret Spellings,"The absence of good, sound data makes it difficult to set policy at the federal, state and institutional levels, ... It's time to examine how we can maximize our investment in higher education."
John Spencer,When we met up in 1996 the league was just forming. I fancied going over and trying it.
John Spencer,"Obviously, there are going to be ups and downs in professional sports,"
John Spencer,"For me to come into this situation, it offers a great opportunity. We want to aim high, and we have the team to do it."
John Spencer,There are more jobs and more opportunities than ever before.
John Spencer,It's a sensitive issue and some see it as a growth-inducing issue. But I have to say by not making 49 wider there are also impacts and those impacts of late have been deaths.
John Spencer,The research rat of the future allows experimentation without manipulation of the real world. This is the cutting edge of modeling technology.
Stephen Spender,There is a certain justice in criticism. The critic is like a midwife - a tyrannical midwife.
Stephen Spender,"I think of those who were truly great. The names of those who in their lives fought for life, Who wore at their hearts the fire's center."
Stephen Spender,Great poetry is always written by somebody straining to go beyond what he can do.
Stephen Spender,"When a child, my dreams rode on your wishes, / I was your son, high on your horse, / My mind a top whipped by the lashes / Of your rhetoric, windy of course."
Stephen Spender,"When you read and understand a poem, comprehending its rich and formal meanings, then you master chaos a little."
Stephen Spender,"I'm struggling at the end to get out of the valley of hectoring youth, journalistic middle age, imposture, moneymaking, public relations, bad writing, mental confusion."
Gene Sperling,"There's unquestionably been some very real differences of opinion on areas that we think are critical to regaining economic strength in the region, and we'll speak candidly and frankly to those individual matters."
Gene Sperling,"President Bush takes the credit for a 'shallow recession,' he denies any responsibility for an even 'more shallow' economic recovery."
Gene Sperling,"If you care about progress in market opening, you are going to have to have more ambitious compacts for sharing the downside costs as well as the benefits of open trade, ... As economists, we talk about how the benefits of lower prices are broadly shared. But the costs are very heavily concentrated."
Gene Sperling,"The president is saying through his plan that by saving instead of squandering the surpluses brought on by our discipline and prosperity, we can address much of our long-term retirement challenge in a way that lifts that burden off our children and grandchildren."
Gene Sperling,"This is about fiscal discipline and first things first,"
Gene Sperling,"We're in a very deep hole on job market, ... We've had a couple of steps in the right direction, but we have a lot farther to dig ourselves out."
Gene Sperling,"It would be better to do nothing and pay down $100 billion of our national debt than to sign a large and irresponsible tax cut that would signal to the world that the era of fiscal discipline in the United States is over, ... Meet The Press."
Gene Sperling,"In the last three months, the economic performance was disappointing for middle-class families and below expectations -- the results that have become the norm for the economy under President Bush."
Gene Sperling,but I'm actually quite confident that we will iron it out and ? that we will have a more formal agreement quite soon.
Gene Sperling,"A tax cut that is $800 billion or $500 billion is an irresponsible tax cut that would threaten our ability to pay down the debt, secure Medicare, Social Security and education, ... Fox News Sunday."
Jason Spezza,"I think with the talent we have, we knew we were a deep team, we knew we were a favorite coming into the year, we had high expectations for ourselves and we still do. We expect to keep this pace going. We know in order to be a team that wins the Stanley Cup, you have to be consistent."
Jason Spezza,"I don't know what is going to happen or where we would stay or if we could practice. Hopefully, we're at least going to get to practice with the team. I guess we could go to the games and sit in the stands. If that's the case, maybe (Staal) and I will be just there having beers, watching the games."
Jason Spezza,"Last night everything we touched went in the net, and tonight it was tougher to put them in, but you can't make any excuses, we took too many penalties, we weren't skating as much and they took the play to us early on."
Jason Spezza,You're going to get down in games and you have to learn to battle back to win them and we did.
Jason Spezza,Special teams are big. That's how you're going to win games down the stretch.
Jason Spezza,We know how important the game is for them.
Jason Spezza,"I was disappointed not being one of the initial 23 guys getting dressed, but it's a good experience to go over there and be around these guys."
Jason Spezza,I was disappointed not to be one of the initial 23 guys but it'll be a good experience just to go over there. You never know if there'll be injuries so you've got to stay ready.
Jason Spezza,"The only way you get experience is by playing in these things. I haven't had any experience because I haven't had a chance to play in any of these. We've always made the playoffs, so I never had a chance to go to the (men's) world championships."
Jason Spezza,"It's out of your control, so it won't be crushing (if not picked)."
David Spiegel,"My patients joke with me. They ask me, 'Doctor, am I living longer yet?' I say, 'I don't know, but you're living better.' The goal in our groups is not to pretend you're going to make your cancer go away but to live well in the face of cancer."
David Spiegel,If you get breast cancer it is because you're biologically vulnerable.
David Spiegel,Thinking happy thoughts is not the way to cope with the stress of having cancer.
Steven Spielberg,All I have to do is pose for a picture and I'm getting married to the person standing next to me.
Steven Spielberg,I hate that people think it's wrong to say you're inspired by Jaws or by Raiders Of The Lost Ark. You're allowed to be.
Steven Spielberg,"I hate to ask you, but would you read this and tell if you'd be interested?"
Steven Spielberg,"The most expensive habit in the world is celluloid, not heroin, and I need a fix every few years."
Steven Spielberg,"[Next year he has plans to play eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes in a Scorsese-directed biopic. Fame] forced him to go away longer than he ever wanted to, ... Hopefully he'll make up for the lost time."
Steven Spielberg,"I personally feel this embargo should be lifted, ... I don't see any reason for its existence beyond grudges carrying into the 21st century."
Steven Spielberg,I will never make a movie about any of the events of 9/11.
Steven Spielberg,"You know, I don't really do that much looking inside me when I'm working on a project. Whatever I am becomes what that film is. But I change; you change."
Steven Spielberg,The public has an appetite for anything about imagination - anything that is as far away from reality as is creatively possible.
Steven Spielberg,I'm not really interested in making money.
Steven Spielberg,I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world. I wanted to do something else that could make us smile. This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.
Steven Spielberg,I want to be the Cecil B. DeMille of science fiction.
Steven Spielberg,"Every time I go to a movie, it's magic, no matter what the movie's about."
Steven Spielberg,"All of us every single year, we're a different person. I don't think we're the same person all our lives."
Steven Spielberg,You have many years ahead of you to create the dreams that we can't even imagine dreaming. You have done more for the collective unconscious of this planet than you will ever know.
Steven Spielberg,I don't think any movie or any book or any work of art can solve the stalemate in the Middle East today. But it's certainly worth a try.
Steven Spielberg,I like the smell of film. I just like knowing there's film going through the camera.
Steven Spielberg,People have forgotten how to tell a story. Stories don't have a middle or an end any more. They usually have a beginning that never stops beginning.
Steven Spielberg,There is a fine line between censorship and good taste and moral responsibility.
Steven Spielberg,I've discovered I've got this preoccupation with ordinary people pursued by large forces.
Steven Spielberg,I'd rather direct than produce. Any day. And twice on Sunday.
Steven Spielberg,I dream for a living.
Steven Spielberg,"When I grow up, I still want to be a director."
Steven Spielberg,"If Bush, as I believe, has reliable information on the fact that Saddam Hussein is making weapons of mass destruction, I cannot not support the policies of his government."
Steven Spielberg,Why pay a dollar for a bookmark? Why not use the dollar for a bookmark?
Steven Spielberg,"A lot of the films I've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because I have a lot of old-fashion values."
Steven Spielberg,The last few years in scouting have deeply saddened me to see the Boy Scouts of America actively and publicly participating in discrimination. It's a real shame.
Johnny Spillane,"When I was younger, I would wake up 15 times the night before an event. But I think it's a little bit of a comfort level, too. I'm comfortable with how I'm skiing and how we are doing right now. But I'm definitely really excited about tomorrow, and it will probably be hard to get to sleep tonight."
Johnny Spillane,"To create that kind of competitive environment within the team is what we are going to have to do compete and be successful. That, and maybe a few more trips to Europe in the summer."
Johnny Spillane,"They tried to force a competition at the Olympics. The conditions were not fair. It's disappointing because we have time to have a fair competition, but they are just trying to get it out of the way."
Brent Spiner,"But, I think Star Trek is a very honorable show and there is allot of television that one could be doing and feel embarrassed about and certainly not proud of, which I feel very proud to be part of Star Trek."
Brent Spiner,"Generally, I have to be able to get the lines out of my mouth without making a mistake before I go to sleep."
Brent Spiner,"Hollywood has more than its share of harsh and crewel stories. In fact, it's probably more the norm than the exception."
Brent Spiner,Any job you can go to and have a laugh everyday has got to be a good job.
Brent Spiner,Well my family and friends where delighted that I was going to be working on a regular basis and that they could turn on their TV every week and see me.
Brent Spiner,"Everyone I've ever known in my life, or seen, or met, or loved, or hated, is at risk of being destroyed. That's a pretty big chunk of fear, and I think that's what we are all dealing with, if we don't save the day."
Brent Spiner,I do prefer comedy.
Brent Spiner,"My character has a distrust of government as Big Brother, ... He doesn't see why this should be kept secret from the public."
Brent Spiner,If you look around at the people in show business today they are basically the people who didn't give up.
Brent Spiner,"We're going to discover as time goes on that there is some adversity ... They are not in love with each other. These three guys were essentially shanghaied and made to do this job, whether they want to or not. And they're geniuses, so they have egos. I play a doctor, and I never met a doctor without an ego."
Brent Spiner,"We're going to discover as time goes on that there is some adversity ... They are not in love with each other. These three guys were essentially . . . made to do this job, whether they want to or not."
Mark Spitz,"It really changed how we do things in sports. Certainly, nothing happened to preplan or expect what was going to happen that day, as opposed to today, when extreme logistics go into planning."
Mark Spitz,"Yes, I believe that the art of winning is through intimidation, and not necessarily do you have to speak about it."
Mark Spitz,"When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the mustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it - and everybody was talking about it - that I decided to keep it."
Mark Spitz,What it is saying is that someone who was a world champion and who takes care of himself with a 17-year rest and applies the proper training techniques and perseverance could be successful.
Mark Spitz,"Well my thoughts on American swimming are that our prospects look favorable, but we may not have as strong a showing in the gold medal count as in previous Olympics. But I am not coaching."
Mark Spitz,"To be recognized as great is the culmination of a career, not a specific event. So we will have to wait and see, for Ian Thorpe."
Mark Spitz,There are times I might coach one or two workouts a year when the regular coach gets caught in traffic.
Mark Spitz,"The pool is terrible, but that doesn't have much to do with my record swims. That's all mental attitude."
Mark Spitz,The only side effect of too much training is that you get into better shape. There is nothing wrong with that.
Mark Spitz,"Swimming isn't everything, winning is."
Mark Spitz,So in my mind I own a lot of house records still.
Mark Spitz,Past performance speaks a tremendous amount about one's ability and likelihood for success.
Mark Spitz,"In my day, at 12 years old, which was 38 years ago, we worked out in summer months for two and a half hours. Today someone in that age group might work out for four hours, two hours in the morning and two at night."
Mark Spitz,"I'm at the depot, and I'm not going anywhere. That's better to deal with than having to deal with the unknown. And the unknown is they don't want to fail. They don't want to pay the price unless there's a guarantee they're going to get there."
Mark Spitz,I wasn't able to lower my cholesterol so they put me on a statin drug. It is called lipitor. I was able to lower my level in about 30 days from above 300 to below 200.
Mark Spitz,"Goggles were not allowed. A cap was allowed, but I chose not to wear one. I grew the mustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one."
Mark Spitz,"Did I take it all in on the awards stand? The only time I would have done that was my last event, because I was always thinking about the next one."
Mark Spitz,"By making a comeback, I'm changing the attitude of people toward me. If I'd known that people would react so enthusiastically, I'd have done it years ago."
Mark Spitz,Because a known fact is better than an unknown fact.
Mark Spitz,"And if you have high cholesterol, you would feel the same as if you had low cholesterol because there are no side effects, no symptoms of having high cholesterol."
Mark Spitz,"All things being equal, if we could simulate the same scenario, he has a lot more difficult task. He's elected to swim six individual events, as opposed to what I elected to do, which was four."
Mark Spitz,"I walked away from the sport for 17 years, then started swimming again recently in a master's program."
Mark Spitz,"If he wins seven golds and ties what I did, then it would be like I was the first man on the moon and he became the second. If he wins more than seven, then he becomes the first man on Mars. We'd both be unique."
Mark Spitz,I swam my brains out.
Mark Spitz,I just tried to keep my cool and continue with my race plan: to win.
Mark Spitz,One of the most difficult things for people who have been successful in sports is adapting to the daily world where you can't get an answer from someone until 5 o'clock tomorrow. There is always an excuse. Living 40 or 50 years like that doesn't get too exciting after a while.
Mark Spitz,My biggest loss was the Olympics. I just can't forget losing. I never will.
Mark Spitz,It has nothing to do with swimming. That happens to be my sport. I'm trying to see how far I can go.
Mark Spitz,"In my case, when my lifestyle was pretty good - I ate foods low in cholesterol and fat and exercised three or four times a week."
Mark Spitz,In everyday life there is always manana. There is no urgency.
Mark Spitz,"I have a pool at my home that is 12.5 m long, so that if I swim eight laps, I can look at the time and say, that's my time for 100 m."
Mark Spitz,"I got beat real hard and heavy in the Olympic Games in 1968 by a guy who swam an incredible race one time in his whole life, but he did it right at the right time. I'd like to be that guy now. Maybe that's what I'm going to have to pull out of my hat to make the Olympic team."
Mark Spitz,I am not qualified to talk about the diet. Simply because I am not a dietician.
Mark Spitz,"I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities."
Mark Spitz,Everyone loves to be loved.
Mark Spitz,"I'm trying to do the best I can. I'm not concerned with tomorrow, but with what goes on today."
Mark Spitz,Life is true to form; records are meant to be broken.
Mark Spitz,The memories of the Munich games for me are of triumph and tragedy.
Mark Spitz,"If you fail to prepare, you're prepared to fail."
Latrell Sprewell,"You guys know the way I play. And what's so ironic is, KG is the same way. I'm looking at him in practice and going, 'Wow, I'm always that guy,' you know?"
Latrell Sprewell,"When I was put in a situation where I'm going there, you have to look at the team and the possibility that hey, we can probably do some good things over there."
Latrell Sprewell,"Well I forgot how different it was because I've been here for about four or five years. It's a big load off my shoulders now. Now that I'm there, I'm like, man, I can breathe a little bit, you know?"
Latrell Sprewell,"They got all the size over there, and the teams are really good, so, I think night after night you're just going to have to be ready to lace them up and be ready to play. The teams out there are really good."
Latrell Sprewell,Sometimes change is good. Although I didn't want to leave.
Latrell Sprewell,So much tension around here in New York. They want to fine you for every little thing you do.
Latrell Sprewell,"Sam is there, Sam has been playing well, he has been doing great in camp."
Latrell Sprewell,"Over there, Kevin McHale, I feel like I'm talking to someone I know. It's just a total different atmosphere."
Latrell Sprewell,It always feels good to come back here. I love New York... it's just nice to see a lot of familiar faces.
Latrell Sprewell,"I'm still going to have to go out and score, but defensively hopefully I can make them a little bit better."
Latrell Sprewell,"I'm just happy to be a part of the Timberwolves organization. From top to bottom, facility and the management now, like I said, Kevin McHale is great."
Latrell Sprewell,I'm 33 years old now. I really want that ring. I got a taste of it here.
Latrell Sprewell,I think was able to do a lot of things here.
Latrell Sprewell,"I think that was one thing I definitely brought to the table, my aggressiveness and my style of play, and I think that's one of the reasons why the fans here really appreciated the way that I went out and played, just because I think they kind of liked that."
Latrell Sprewell,"I think it'll be an emotional day. It'll be exciting for me, mostly it'll be exciting for them. I'm not going to get to come here a lot, so, it'll be a special day, hopefully."
Latrell Sprewell,"I think it was one of the better meetings that I've had with those guys, because I was honestly able to say everything I wanted to say, and I pretty much aired out the dirty laundry. So from that point on, I thought all of that was behind us."
Latrell Sprewell,I love New York. A part of me will always be here. What can I say.
Latrell Sprewell,"I know just one thing is those guys, KG and everyone, they're hungry. They want it bad. Sam's the only one that's had that, has the ring. Other than him, everybody else over there, we want it bad."
Latrell Sprewell,I just want to do the same things there that I was able to do here - be a team player and go out and help the team in any way I can.
Latrell Sprewell,"I just meant as far as coming to the games on time; it was just like I was under the microscope, every little thing, it was like they were looking for me to come in here with my shoes untied."
Latrell Sprewell,I definitely think that myself and Sam will help the Timberwolves.
Latrell Sprewell,"Fortunately for me I was able to do well here, and it really did great things for my career and now hopefully I can go out there and continue to do what I did."
Latrell Sprewell,"And for the first time in a long time, I'm playing along somebody that has that same energy and fire and plays pretty much the same way I do. So, that was just nice to say."
Jerry Springer,Let's see what happens after the election.
Jerry Springer,Somebody once said I had a face for radio and a voice for newspapers.
Jerry Springer,"With a face like mine, I do better in print."
Jerry Springer,It's just a show. It's not the end of Western Civilization. It's chewing gum.
Jerry Springer,"All of us, whether or not we're celebrities, every one ought to spend part of their life making someone else's life better."
Jerry Springer,"We can't just have mainstream behavior on television in a free society, we have to make sure we see the whole panorama of human behavior."
Dusty Springfield,"I reacted very well to all the treatment, and I got a clean bill of health,"
Dusty Springfield,"It's marvellous to be popular, but foolish to think it will last."
Dusty Springfield,I'd love to retouch my whole life.
Dusty Springfield,I find it an effort to keep up appearances.
Dusty Springfield,I couldn't stand to be thought of as a big butch lady. But I know that I'm as perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy.
Dusty Springfield,I was a nothing kid. Not particularly good. Not particularly bad.
Dusty Springfield,"Sometimes you have to let people down in order to get on, particularly in showbusiness."
Dusty Springfield,Somehow I took whatever criticism there was very much to heart.
Dusty Springfield,I just decided I wanted to become someone else... So I became someone else.
Dusty Springfield,"A lot of people say I'm bent, and I've heard it so many times that I've almost learned to accept it."
Dusty Springfield,I wouldn't know how to handle serenity if somebody handed it to me on a plate.
Dusty Springfield,"I'm the most misunderstood, misquoted person I know, honestly."
Dusty Springfield,My sexuality has never been a problem to me but I think it has been for other people.
Dusty Springfield,My affections are easily swayed and I can be very unfaithful.
Shawn Springs,"We kind of laughed when we saw that they were going to open it up like that. You can't come out with four wide receivers all the time on us, not with Gregg. No one can block Gregg all game like that."
Shawn Springs,"Both are fun, they're just different. It's like having an angel and a devil - I ain't saying which one is which."
Shawn Springs,"You don't have any choice if your dad plays for the Cowboys,"
Shawn Springs,"The way they're using me, you never know where I'm at, ... Tell the boys I might just drop out of the sky, so they'd better be prepared for anything."
Bruce Springsteen,"People deserve... the truth. They deserve honesty. The best music, you can seek some shelter in it momentarily, but it's essentially there to provide you something to face the world with."
Bruce Springsteen,"I have no rules left. I don't have to get on the radio. It's wide open for me. The singer-songwriters I admire - Dylan, Neil Young, Woody Guthrie - move forward all the time."
Bruce Springsteen,"We're here tonight with a mission, we're here tonight with a purpose,"
Bruce Springsteen,"When you make more than $500 a night, you get more than $500 problems."
Bruce Springsteen,Music was my way of keeping people from looking through and around me. I wanted the heavies to know I was around.
Bruce Springsteen,"Poor men wanna be rich, rich men wanna be kings,And a king ainâ€™t satisfied till he rules everything."
Bruce Springsteen,"It's kind of an iffy proposition,"
Bruce Springsteen,It was just playing music. I didn't have any intention for it. I knew that I enjoyed making this kind of music. ... It was really just purely for the joy of doing it. It was a lot of fun.
Bruce Springsteen,"We remain a land of great promise, but we must move on, ... humility in exercising our power around the world."
Bruce Springsteen,"People deserve. . . the truth. They deserve honesty. The best music, you can seek some shelter in it momentarily, but it's essentially there to provide you something to face the world with."
Bruce Springsteen,"We're a long, long way from home. Home's a long, long way from us."
Bruce Springsteen,"My god man, you sound like you should be singing in some bar in a backwater town in New Jersey!"
Bruce Springsteen,"You've always got to remember, rock and roll's never been about giving up. For me, for a lot of kids, it was a totally positive force. . . not optimistic all the time, but positive. It was never--never--about surrender."
Bruce Springsteen,"You can't start a fire, worryin about your little world fallin apart, this gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark"
Bruce Springsteen,"Had a brother at Khe Sahn fighting off the Viet Cong, they're still there, he's all gone."
Bruce Springsteen,"When i look in your eyes is that you baby, or just a brilliant disguise."
Bruce Springsteen,"Everyone remembers the experience quite truly, ... And everyone was centered around this thing, that we suffered. No one forgot that. Everyone had that in common."
Bruce Springsteen,"Some guys they just give up living, others start dying little by little piece by piece, some guys come home from work and wash up, and go racing in the streets."
Bruce Springsteen,Our American government has strayed too far from American values. It is time to move forward. The country we carry in our hearts is waiting.
Bruce Springsteen,"There were ghosts of the eyes of all the boys you sent away, ... They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets."
Bruce Springsteen,"You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright."
Bruce Springsteen,I'm in search of how to take the stuff I've written and make sure the audience hears it fresh again. It's been a lot of fun. I've enjoyed it.
Bruce Springsteen,"In the early years, I found a voice that was my voice and also partly my father's voice. But isn't that what you always do? Why do kids at 5 years old go into the closet and put their daddy's shoes on? Hey, my kids do it."
Bruce Springsteen,It's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin and can't stand the company.
Bruce Springsteen,"If they had told me I was the janitor and would have to mop up and clean the toilets after the show in order to play, I probably would have done it."
Bruce Springsteen,"When it comes to luck, you make your own."
Bruce Springsteen,The best music is essentially there to provide you something to face the world with.
Bruce Springsteen,"The release date is just one day, but the record is forever."
Bruce Springsteen,"Blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed."
Bruce Springsteen,"This music is forever for me. It's the stage thing, that rush moment that you live for. It never lasts, but that's what you live for."
Bruce Springsteen,"Talk about a dream, try to make it real."
Bruce Springsteen,In America everything's about who's number one today.
Harry Sprouse,It poses a lot of problems. You have to be ready to defend vertically and horizontally. It makes it tougher.
Harry Sprouse,"We made way too many mistakes. We got down really fast, and that was not Hilton Head Prep. That was us. But, they have a better football team than we do right now."
Harry Sprouse,Discipline takes a part in that. You try to prepare them the best you can.
Harry Sprouse,I have some serious concerns about defense this week against Hilton Head Prep. They've got a lot of offensive weapons that are going to be real tough to cover.
Harry Sprouse,We're not going to make any great changes in our offensive game plan. We're going to try to take advantage of what they give us.
Charles Spurgeon,"Trust in the person's promise, who dares to refuse what they fear they cannot perform."
Charles Spurgeon,Economy is half the battle of life. It is not so hard to earn money as to spend it well.
Charles Spurgeon,A man who does nothing never has time to do anything
Charles Spurgeon,"Luck generally comes to those who look for it, and my notion is that it taps, once in a lifetime, at everybody's door, but if industry does not open it luck goes away."
Charles Spurgeon,The doorstep to the temple of wisdom is the knowledge of our own ignorance.
Charles Spurgeon,It is a great pity when the one who should be the head figure is a mere figure head.
Charles Spurgeon,It is said that if Noah's ark had to be built by a company; they would not have laid the keel yet; and it may be so. What is many men's business is nobody's business. The greatest things are accomplished by individual men.
Charles Spurgeon,You cannot slander human nature; it is worse than words can paint it.
Charles Spurgeon,Friendship is one of the sweetest joys of life. Many might have failed beneath the bitterness of their trial had they not found a friend.
Charles Spurgeon,You must be in fashion is the utterance of weak headed mortals.
Charles Spurgeon,Nobody ever outgrows scripture; the Book widens and deepens with our years
Charles Spurgeon,No one is so miserable as the poor person who maintains the appearance of wealth.
Charles Spurgeon,"Our anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, but only empties today of its strength"
Charles Spurgeon,It is not well to make great changes in old age.
Charles Spurgeon,A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
Charles Spurgeon,Many men owe the grandeur of their lives to their tremendous difficulties.
Charles Spurgeon,"It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness."
Charles Spurgeon,"It's not the having, it's the getting."
Steve Spurrier,"We just try to improve and improve and improve. We don't worry about how we look so much. We stayed healthy and that's always, I think, the number-one priority."
Steve Spurrier,You check my track record what we did with guys who got in serious trouble and embarrassed our university.
Steve Spurrier,"We were fortunate ... their safety, Lynn Hughes, fell down,"
Steve Spurrier,It's called keeping up. We just need to be in line with the rest of the schools.
Steve Spurrier,"Not necessarily regret. He sort of helped bring Tyrone in. I think Tyrone's an excellent coach. It just didn't work out, I guess, is the easier way to say it when we had to make a change there in the middle of the year."
Steve Spurrier,He's taken his punishment and didn't whimper or complain. He served his time and is ready to go.
Steve Spurrier,I don't want to praise our guys too much for beating this team. Had a few good plays here and there. Still a long way off.
Steve Spurrier,Y'all never had a coach apologize for the performance around here? Is that what you're saying? Huh? Really?
Steve Spurrier,"I thought Blake played very well for his first performance, and, really, for any performance,"
Steve Spurrier,"I've got to have patience,"
Steve Spurrier,"Sidney Rice is doing some good things. He is still learning how to play out there,"
Steve Spurrier,Blake felt a little pressure and held it too long. He's learning. He's hanging in there.
Steve Spurrier,I have always thought the Vandy kids played pretty hard and I just thought they were a little short on talent. They have really improved their talent level and they are playing well. They are an extremely good team.
Steve Spurrier,Hopefully everyone here will know where to send our money as soon as the information comes on that. It is a tragedy that all of us are thinking about.
Steve Spurrier,"I tried to get the Redskins to hire him as the general manager, ... Shows you how much influence I had."
Steve Spurrier,"Thank goodness for John Hall. Thank goodness Mr. Snyder went out and got us a heck of a kicker. Without John Hall, I don't think we win this game."
Steve Spurrier,"You can only play so much golf and lay around the beach,"
Steve Spurrier,"The first key is pass protection -- giving the quarterback enough time. After that, it's getting guys open. The QB has to know where the receivers are going, how the defenses cover them. You need a smart guy who will make smart decisions 95 percent of the time."
Steve Spurrier,"It was an unusual game, but the Gamecocks won, and that's what we came here to find out. I'm not going to feel too bad, because a few plays here and there, they beat us."
Steve Spurrier,"The time I went there, they weren't near the team they are now. A different environment, completely different, different team, different head coach."
Steve Spurrier,"The time I went there, they weren't near the team they are now, ... A different environment, completely different. A different team. A different head coach. The fans, probably their enthusiasm is about 10 times greater than it was that day."
Steve Spurrier,Everybody assumed that was the greatest college football down there. I think college football is excellent all over the country right now.
Steve Spurrier,"I guess you guys have to be a coach to understand. Once you spend a year with your guys, that's your team. That's just your team. I try to live in the present."
Steve Spurrier,Welcome Coach Spurrier. He was always a little cocky.
Steve Spurrier,We're not getting rid of anybody. We are readjusting the defensive coach and we are going to hire a defensive line coach.
Steve Spurrier,"You all think I'm the first guy to ever coach against his alma mater, ... This happens a lot around the country."
Steve Spurrier,We got Pops a catch for the record book.
Steve Spurrier,"Nothing hardly ever rattles Danny Wuerffel. He has such a sincere faith and belief in God that things are going to work out. He's definitely a good person to have helping to lead that school and those kids, the inner-city kids in New Orleans."
Steve Spurrier,"It was exciting to catch all those balls and make all that yardage,'' Coles said."
Steve Spurrier,"Oh, that's a secret, a little secret, ... Nah, we're breaking the balls in. They're all brand new and slippery as can be. Like a watermelon seed when they bring them out of the box. So you try rubbing them in the dirt, the grass, put a little sweat on them. You try everything to get where you can handle them."
Steve Spurrier,"We'll have to see how it all plays out. Certainly Blake is our starter. He threw some errant balls out there today. Blake didn't play his best; he knows that. He's still the starter, but it was encouraging that Cade sort of proved that if something happens he can go play. We thought he would be. We'll try to get Cade as ready as possible. He's definitely second right now."
Steve Spurrier,I think today gave him a little more confidence. He threw the ball with authority most of the day.
Steve Spurrier,"Their styles are very similar, ... He's learned a lot, he has a wonderful attitude and has tried to learn as much as he can. For a first-year quarterback in a brand new offense, he had a good night the other night."
Steve Spurrier,"The only thing I think I got was a little humility to the fact that you have a greater appreciation for all coaches. Sometimes you can coach your heart out, hard as you can, and the other guy just may have a better team and better players."
Steve Spurrier,"The first few years, throwing was very easy. The defenses weren't geared up for it. Then later the defenses got a lot better toward stooping the pass."
Steve Spurrier,"So, we were able to throw, and run, the ball successfully, and play defense. And well, we won the conference six in my first seven years there."
Steve Spurrier,"So, I didn't say we are going to win a lot, but we are going to play like winners, and we've got a plan in place to teach our guys how to play like winners and play like a champion."
Steve Spurrier,"So you get two good hours on the field about every day, you get about an hour and a half in the meeting room and that's pretty much all you need to thoroughly coach your team."
Steve Spurrier,So I don't really believe that how many years you've had in the league determines how well your players play... Coaching is coaching.
Steve Spurrier,"Our stadium seats over 80,000, and we sell all of our tickets."
Steve Spurrier,"Our coaches want to be a part of South Carolina football when they win it for the first time. When they win the division, when they win the SEC, win a major bowl game, etc. The opportunities to do it all for the first time here make it extra special."
Steve Spurrier,Obviously my last two years in the NFL were not much fun at all.
Steve Spurrier,"Number two, we're going to play with a lot of effort. Our guys are going to be in such good shape that fatigue is not going to be a problem. We're going to play with full effort from snap to whistle on every play the entire game."
Steve Spurrier,"Number three, we're going to play very smart and we're not going to beat ourselves. If the other team is better than us and they just out execute us and play better then we can live with that, but we're going to play smart and give ourselves every opportunity to win the game."
Steve Spurrier,"Number four, we're going to play like winners, play the game the way it's meant to be played. Don't get full of yourself if something good happens. Don't get too depressed when something bad happens."
Steve Spurrier,"If the play goes bad, it was a bad call - even though it might have been a pretty good call. That's just the way it is, and we accept it and move on."
Steve Spurrier,"I think I've got an outstanding defensive assistant staff that's really going to help us have consistent, strong defenses. And offensively, we have an excellent staff. We've got some younger guys on offense, but that's what I coach and have my entire coaching career."
Steve Spurrier,I really believe everything is here for us to be very successful.
Steve Spurrier,"I do have some young coaches, but I don't really believe that is the biggest problem we have here."
Steve Spurrier,"But at some point, we've got to have disciplined play and have got to coach better. I'm not putting it on the players. We've got to coach them to tackle and block better. It's as simple as that. If we can do those things, we'll have a chance."
Steve Spurrier,"But as coaches, we need to get a little more fire and passion and be more demanding that our guys get the job done. I think players will respond to that, and we'll see."
Steve Spurrier,"All I can say is that I'm going to try to coach the way I've coached in the past. And if it ends up not being good enough, then so be it."
Steve Spurrier,"We've got a support system that gives our players a wonderful opportunity to graduate. If they go to class and give good effort, they can graduate from this school, and I believe that's important when you go out recruiting."
Steve Spurrier,"Being a bowl team is a wonderful achievement for so many teams, and if you look at the history of the University of South Carolina, a bowl game is pretty good."
Steve Spurrier,"He's an excellent athlete with his ability to run, just like the Texas quarterback, Vince Young. You hope to try to make him throw the ball and not beat you running. We're going to try to contain him and try to cover their guys and try to get pressure on him."
Steve Spurrier,"If he touches it, he's going to come down with it, ... He has tremendous leaping ability. When in trouble, we say throw it high to Sidney."
Jerry Stackhouse,We don't worry about what San Antonio is doing. We know we're a playoff team and we'll see how things fall.
Jerry Stackhouse,"We're just focused on achieving our goals, and that's to continue to get better for the playoffs."
Jerry Stackhouse,"Whenever you're fighting for those top spots, it's always good to be able to beat those top teams. And after the break, we haven't done that. We beat these teams before the break, [but] everybody is better in the second half than they are the first half."
Dawn Staley,"I expect that this level will be the most challenging for me, being on the other side of the whistle. I'm going to approach this challenge the same way that I did as a player, helping Anne in any way that I can and doing whatever it takes to come away with nothing less than the gold."
Dawn Staley,"I'm treating it as an Olympic experience where for the most part we were going to beat teams, ... I knew I'd be needed somewhere between the quarterfinals and gold medal. With this Houston team, their core is intact. I'm here for plays, certain situations. It's easy for me because I understand it. I don't think any other veteran that has played this long or won as many gold medals, I don't think their ego could stand playing maybe 15, 20 minutes a night. I relish the fact that I get to compete for a championship. I just got to do my part."
Dawn Staley,"She's taking care of the basketball. She's knocking down threes. The only thing she could do is just be a little more vocal. And if we can get that out of her, we'll probably be a better basketball team."
Dawn Staley,"You can look in every direction and find a competition or an event going on. Even if you're not involved in playing one of the sports being offered, you can find anything you want to do. There's shopping, entertainment, all different types of people ... it's really a great atmosphere."

Joseph Stalin,You cannot make a revolution with silk gloves.
Joseph Stalin,The only real power comes out of a long rifle.
Joseph Stalin,We don't let them have ideas. Why would we let them have guns?

Joseph Stalin,Sincere diplomacy is no more possible than dry water or wooden iron
Joseph Stalin,In the Soviet army it takes more courage to retreat than advance.
Joseph Stalin,Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can reach.
Kevin Stallings,We have three rules. Rule No. 3 is 'Do your best.' [Moore] didn't do his best. That can apply to any place.
Kevin Stallings,"As we continue to elevate the status of our program, we need to elevate the quality of our schedule."
Kevin Stallings,Eventually the foul problems and the discrepancy in free throws just got us. It was too much for us to overcome.
Kevin Stallings,We've certainly enjoyed the bye week and having the opportunity to try to get our legs back under us a little bit.
Kevin Stallings,"I was fine with how we ran our offense, and I was fine with how we played defense. We turned it over a few more than our average. Tennessee is good at making you do that."
Kevin Stallings,We are in a tough spot. We'll have a character check and hopefully bounce back.
Kevin Stallings,It is important to note this is not a suspension and not basketball related. This is a temporary leave of absence for medical reasons.
Kevin Stallings,I've been saying our team has been playing good basketball. We just don't have a lot to show for it.
Sylvester Stallone,"there was a reluctance to go forward until everyone felt there was a script that echoed the kind of sincerity and values the first one had, and had some poignancy like the first one had."
Sylvester Stallone,"That's what Rocky is all about : pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood."
Sylvester Stallone,Playing polo is like trying to play golf during an earthquake.
Sylvester Stallone,I am drawing on a lot of my feelings that are in sync with many people's feelings about facing the last chapter of their lives and how they want it to be written.
Sylvester Stallone,Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure.
Sylvester Stallone,"I'm not handsome in the classical sense. The eyes droop, the mouth is crooked, the teeth aren't straight, the voice sounds like a mafioso pallbearer."
Sylvester Stallone,"I expect it (criticism). I would do the same thing. My wife is the most critical. She said, 'This is ridiculous...' But you have two choices - not to do it or do it."
Sylvester Stallone,"The champion's management says let's do this for real, for charity. Rocky says no but decides to be true to himself even though he's going to be berated by everyone. Just to compete, not to win,"
Sylvester Stallone,"The champion's management says let's do this for real, for charity. Rocky says no but decides to be true to himself even though he's going to be berated by everyone. Just to compete, not to win."
Sylvester Stallone,"It would be great to be able to pass on to someone all of the successes, the failures, and the knowledge that one has had. To help someone, avoid all the fire, pain and anxiety would be wonderful."
Terence Stamp,What I wanted more than anything was a long career.
Terence Stamp,"Unless I try, I'm never really going to be at ease with myself."
Terence Stamp,"To work with a guy like Wyler early in your career was just an incredible thing, because he gave me an amazing amount of confidence."
Terence Stamp,"Physically, I couldn't fold myself into a gray, invisible bank clerk. I just thought, It's the most amazing part. It's a pity that I'm wrong for it."
Terence Stamp,"Peter Ustinov was the first really positive influence in my career. He was real and he bore witness to it. The things he said to you, he lived them."
Terence Stamp,"My star was kind of fading towards the end of the '60s and suddenly I got this call from Fellini, who just appeared to kind of love me!"
Terence Stamp,My favorite film is Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge.
Terence Stamp,It's such a performance to bring stuff into America. It's a great luxury when I am in England.
Terence Stamp,It wasn't until I saw James Dean that I began to think that maybe I could actually do this. Movies didn't have to be just this fantasy with this impossibly handsome guy.
Terence Stamp,"In the case of Elektra I really wasn't sure I could pull it off. There were so many intellectual leaps. My character, Stick, is blind, but he can see better than most people. So I had trouble kind of finding the logic."
Terence Stamp,In my youth I dreamed of being an illustrator.
Terence Stamp,I've been doing Tai Chi on and off for 20 years. The fundamentals of all martial arts are the same.
Terence Stamp,I'm still tap dancing. I'm still going.
Terence Stamp,"I work primarily for the camera-it's not something I really talk about a lot, but it's part of the way I am as a movie actor. The camera is my girl, as it were."
Terence Stamp,I wasn't at all sure I could make that sort of leap into that sort of comic book reality.
Terence Stamp,I was very disappointed that so much of the work I did on The Haunted Mansion didn't arrive in the final cut.
Terence Stamp,"I just had the feeling that by the time all these kids grow up, as many of them who love Superman will love Zod. And I think that's come to pass!"
Terence Stamp,I have to know what would've happened if I tried to get into show business. The last thing I was expecting was to have the kind of career I've had.

Terence Stamp,"I have always had this energy, which I think of as overdrive."
Terence Stamp,"He's Soderbergh, we're working for him. It doesn't matter what he's doing; we'll see it at the premiere."
Terence Stamp,"From the very first movie I ever made to the current time, there have been times between action and cut when I've sensed some kind of new dimension that I haven't been familiar with before."
Terence Stamp,"At this point, it's either for fun or it's for money. I don't take movies that I don't really like."
Terence Stamp,"At the beginning, it was tough for me to actually become an actor. I was so thrilled that I was able to earn my living doing something I truly loved."
Terence Stamp,"As a boy I believed I could make myself invisible. I'm not sure that I ever could, but I certainly had the ability to pass unnoticed."
Terence Stamp,"Although you have some films that are a real bummer, there's always a film that comes up where it's just heaven."
Terence Stamp,All actors are incredibly insecure.
Terence Stamp,"A lot of young directors, they're not confident; they're not open to the emotional level of the scene."
Terence Stamp,A lot of people only see me as villains.
Terence Stamp,"A lot of newspapers say, Terence Stamp is playing himself and we're as bored as he is."
Terence Stamp,"With Fellini, the fear dropped out of my work because it was such a happy experience... hanging out with Fellini, having pasta on the set with Fellini, and going out with Fellini!"
Terence Stamp,"When I tested for Billy Budd, I had that kind of confidence that comes with the certainty that you're not going to get something. I was very rough around the edges."
Terence Stamp,"I'm very pleased with myself. I did The Collector immediately after Billy Budd, because I thought, Well, I'll let everybody know: This is my range."
Norm Stamper,That won a standing ovation from the police. It made me appreciate that I'm going into a number of venues where I'll be talking to police officers.
Norm Stamper,"They have also not been shy about chucking rocks and bottles at our police officers,"
Norm Stamper,but we will maintain a very comprehensive coverage of the entire area through the night.
Lionel Stander,"I'm in a television program that is always among the top 20, that's shown in 67 countries in the world, helping lobotomize the entire world."
Lionel Stander,Anyone who lives within his means suffers from a lack of imagination
Lionel Stander,"I am a professional performer and I only appear on TV for entertainment or for philanthropic organizations, and I consider this a very serious matter that doesn't fit into either category."
Leland Stanford,When money is controlled by a few it gives that few an undue power and control over labor and the resources of the country. Labor will have its best return when the laborer can control its disposal.
Leland Stanford,There is no reason why the women of the country should not greatly advance themselves.
Leland Stanford,The seeming antagonism between capital and labor is the result of deceptive appearance.
Leland Stanford,"The right of each individual in any relation to secure to himself the full benefits of his intelligence, his capacity, his industry and skill are among the inalienable inheritances of humanity."
Leland Stanford,"The real conflict, if any exists, is between two industrial systems."
Leland Stanford,"The production of wealth is the result of agreement between labor and capital, between employer and employed. Its distribution, therefore, will follow the law of its creation, or great injustice will be done."
Leland Stanford,"The only distribution of wealth which is the product of labor, which will be honest, will come through a more equal distribution of the productive capacity of men."
Leland Stanford,The great advantage to labor arising out of co-operative effort has been apparent to me for many years.
Leland Stanford,"Legislation has been and is still directed towards the protection of wealth, rather than towards the far more important interests of labor on which everything of value to mankind depends."
Leland Stanford,Labor can and will become its own employer through co-operative association.
Leland Stanford,"In a condition of society and under an industrial organization which places labor completely at the mercy of capital, the accumulations of capital will necessarily be rapid, and an unequal distribution of wealth is at once to be observed."
Leland Stanford,I never saw a woman to come into one of our mining camps in California but her mere presence effected a change in the conduct of all the men there.
Leland Stanford,"I have always been fully persuaded that, through co-operation, labor could become its own employer."
Leland Stanford,I am in favor of carrying out the Declaration of Independence to women as well as men. Women having to suffer the burdens of society and government should have their equal rights in it. They do not receive their rights in full proportion.
Leland Stanford,"Government itself is founded upon the great doctrine of the consent of the governed, and has its cornerstone in the memorable principle that men are endowed with inalienable rights."
Leland Stanford,A co-operative association designed to furnish labor for farming operations is clearly within the realm of practical achievement.
Leland Stanford,"We deem it of the first importance that the education of both sexes shall be equally full and complete, varied only as nature dictates."
Leland Stanford,The employee is regarded by the employer merely in the light of his value as an operative. His productive capacity alone is taken into account.
Leland Stanford,"Every thoughtful and kind-hearted person must regard with interest any device or plan which promises to enable at least the more intelligent, enterprising, and determined part of those who are not capitalists to cease to labor for hire."
Leland Stanford,All legislative experiments in the way of making forcible distribution of the wealth produced in any country have failed.
Leland Stanford,"A man's sentiments are generally just and right, while it is second selfish thought which makes him trim and adopt some other view. The best reforms are worked out when sentiment operates, as it does in women, with the indignation of righteousness."
Leland Stanford,"There would be no idling in a co-operative workshop. Each workman, being an employer, has a spur to his own industry, and has a pecuniary reason for being watchful of the industry of his fellow workmen."
Leland Stanford,The employer class is less indispensable in the modern organization of industries because the laboring men themselves possess sufficient intelligence to organize into co-operative relation and enjoy the entire benefits of their own labor.
Leland Stanford,Money is the great tool through whose means labor and skill become universally co-operative.
Leland Stanford,Laboring men can perform for themselves the office of becoming their own employers.
Leland Stanford,"It is probable that for a long time to come the mass of mankind in civilized countries will find it both necessary and advantageous to labor for wages, and to accept the condition of hired laborers."
Leland Stanford,In the unrest of the masses I augur great good. It is by their realizing that their condition of life is not what it ought to be that vast improvements may be accomplished.
Leland Stanford,"In a very alert and bright state of society people learn co-operation by themselves, but in older and quieter conditions of laboring enterprise, such a bill as I propose will point out the way to mutual exertion."
Leland Stanford,Each individual member of a co-operative society works with that interest which is inseparable from the new position he enjoys. Each has an interest in the other.
Leland Stanford,Each co-operative institution will become a school of business in which each member will acquire a knowledge of the laws of trade and commerce.
Leland Stanford,"The country blacksmith who employs no journeyman is never conscious of any conflict between the capital invested in his anvil, hammer and bellows, and the labor he performs with them, because in fact, there is none."
Paul Stanley,"The financial reward is great and I love the life I have, but all money makes possible is for you to stop worrying about money. Then you have freedom to live your life."
Paul Stanley,"Gene sometimes... well, he has his dream list."

He's in Miami and sort of taking a break, doing an easy job as a favor for a friend. But as soon as the old trouble knocks on his door, he's back to what he does best -- even though he's reluctant, as he always is, to get stuck in and be involved in all these messy situations.

Jason Statham,"People say, be wary of sequels, but I was gung ho to do this as much as you possibly could be, ... The Transporter was an amazing turn in my career -- my first leading role. I got to do a lot of action, which I'd always wanted to do as a very physical person, especially with my background as an athlete for years, and so to incorporate all that into a movie role was like a dream come true for me. And then to do it for a second time? It's a real privilege. There's a ton of actors out there who'd give their right leg to do it, so to go, `No, I'm too good for a sequel' is a little bit out of my mindset."

Roger Staubach,Confidence comes from hours and days and weeks and years of constant work and dedication.

There, she'd follow her mother to the fabric store and her mom would let her choose her own buttons, zippers, and threads and encouraged her to make her own clothes. Gwen's taste evolved, and she went from wearing tomboyish overalls, jumpers, and baseball caps to finding pegged men's pajama bottoms and making corset-style drop-waist dresses with cheerleader skirts, which she'd pair with boxer shorts, fishnets and Doc Martens.] That was it, ...

But at the end of the day I don't need to raise my hand and say, 'Look at me; I did this part, I did that.'"
Gwen Stefani,"Music and fashion, it all comes from the same place of creativity, ... I don't see why any musician who has style or pays attention to style couldn't do it [fashion].

Karrine Steffans,"We know what happens to little black boys that have no dads, we've heard that, we get it, ... But no one is really saying that young women who are born without fathers have real serious issues, especially when their mother had no father and the mother has issues. ... When I talk about it, people are actually listening."
Karrine Steffans,"We have to change our behavior, ... We are the mother, the first teacher, and we have to start our own revolution.

When years described me as mature, the remedy prescribed was middle age. In middle age I was assured that greater age would calm my fever and now that I am fifty-eight perhaps senility will do the job. Nothing has worked. In other words, I don't improve, in further words, once a bum always a bum. I fear the disease is incurable."
John Steinbeck,Texas is not a state -- it's a state of mind.
John Steinbeck,"Texas is a state of mind.  Texas is an obsession.  Above all, Texas is a nation in every sense of the word.  And there's an opening convey of generalities.  A Texan outside of Texas is a foreigner."

And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, aquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and selfinterest are the traits of sucess. And while men admire the quality of the first, they love the produce of the second."
John Steinbeck,"Somewhere in the world there is defeat for everyone. Some are destroyed by defeat, and some made small and mean by victory. Greatness lives in one who triumphs equally over defeat add victory."

George Steinbrenner,Owning the Yankees is like owning the Mona Lisa.
George Steinbrenner,Let's not talk punishment.

George Steinbrenner,"As I've always said, the way New Yorkers back us we have to produce for them."
George Steinbrenner,"It's an incredible achievement, particularly when I remember that when I bought the Yankees, we had trouble drawing 1 million to the stadium. We have the greatest fans in the world."

Frank Stella,"I was worried in the '80s that the best abstract painting had become obsessed with materiality, and painterly gestures and materiality were up against the wall."

Frank Stella,"No art is any good unless you can feel how it's put together. By and large it's the eye, the hand and if it's any good, you feel the body. Most of the best stuff seems to be a complete gesture, the totality of the artist's body; you can really lean on it."
Frank Stella,"When I'm painting the picture, I'm really painting a picture. I may have a flat-footed technique, or something like that, but still, to me, the thrill, or the meat of the thing, is the actual painting. I don't get any thrill out of laying it out."
Frank Stella,"I don't like a lot of the stuff that goes on in the art world, but it's hard to be old and like what goes on around you."
Frank Stella,I don't like to say I have given my life to art. I prefer to say art has given me my life.
Frank Stella,One learns about painting by looking at and imitating other painters.
Frank Stella,"Architecture can't fully represent the chaos and turmoil that are part of the human personality, but you need to put some of that turmoil into the architecture, or it isn't real."
Frank Stella,"But, after all, the aim of art is to create space - space that is not compromised by decoration or illustration, space within which the subjects of painting can live."

George Stephanopoulos,"For the president to resign now would be wrong. President Clinton may have debased himself with his behavior, but we shouldn't debase the office with an impulsive overreaction."

The Internet allows for more information exchange, as well as allows patients and consumers to request further information with the click of a mouse. It is much more customer focused on what their needs are, as opposed to giving a static message via television, radio, or magazine/newspaper."

Howard Stern,I think I'm probably a little too desperate to be successful.
Howard Stern,It's no treat being in bed with me.

Ken Stern,"On the one hand, the cost of raw materials and energy are going up, and on the other hand customers like Wal-Mart and GE ... are reluctant to accept price increases."
Ken Stern,That's where you'll get the inside dirt of a community. Are they too militant? Do they not allow you to put a wreath on the door?

Robert Sternberg,"In other words, the better they did on the IQ test, the worse they did on the practical test and the better they did on the practical tests, the worse they did on the IQ test."

All those things we've been writing about and talking about and doing - this is my life and this is a really great way to spend time."
Martha Stewart,"It's a how-to show with entertainment and a live audience, ... It's not a talk show ? I don't see a couch anywhere."
Martha Stewart,"He's a great guy. He's very interesting, incredibly entertaining,"
Martha Stewart,"[No doubt, she will continue to drive her comeback the only way she knows how: full speed ahead. She even holds out the possibility that she could return to the chairman post of her company someday.] I have learned, ... that I really cannot be destroyed."
Martha Stewart,"So much violence in the world seems beyond our control, but this is one cruelty we can stop by being informed consumers."
Martha Stewart,"There's a conundrum, ... My company needs me. I would like to get back to work. I would like this to be over."
Martha Stewart,"I had hoped for, at the most, some confinement, community service, ... And instead I have five months of incarceration, and five months of house arrest that's monitored. ... But it could have been worse. ... Five months versus 10 months or 16 months ... That's a good thing."
Martha Stewart,Dear Friends: I am obviously distressed by the jury's verdict but I take comfort in knowing that I have done nothing wrong and that I have the enduring support of my family and friends.

Martha Stewart,"If you would be so kind to write such a letter, please include your opinion of my character, my work ethic, my integrity and my probity,"
Martha Stewart,to seek out new challenges.
Martha Stewart,Without a sense of teamwork I think it's really hard to build a great business.
Martha Stewart,"I'm not a sponge exactly, but I find that something I look at is a great opportunity for ideas."
Martha Stewart,"Without an open-minded mind, you can never be a great success."
Martha Stewart,"It's totally out of desire and totally out of belief that - not that I am essential, but that I am still a vibrant, wise human being with great dreams for the future, great hopes for the future, a great team to work with and a really great company to be involved with, ... I mean, this is my life."
Martha Stewart,Many of my executives have worked with me since the beginning. I can be fair and decisive and encouraging as well as demanding.
Martha Stewart,"We met financial expectations for the quarter in a difficult economic environment. We also signed a two-year programming agreement with Home & Garden Television to launch two new cable television series, and [launched] the Martha Stewart Kids magazine, ... These initiatives provide future revenue and earnings growth for the brand and build long-term value for shareholders."
Martha Stewart,"[The bummer of it all is that Dowd is right about the female need to use aggression only as a stealth weapon. The hazard of hitting the big five-oh and beyond is an erroneous sense that you've earned the right not to play by the same rules. Once the hormonal brakes come off, it's easy to crash.] I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, ... I fell in a hole."
Martha Stewart,"(The contestants are) going to get real business lessons, real business advice and, day in and day out, tasks that are difficult and challenging and they're going to be aware of what it takes to be an apprentice at Martha Stewart Living."

There can be no doubt that the last three years have certainly been an adventure for me and for all of you. Though it was stressful -- very stressful -- I can say that I don't regret everything."
Martha Stewart,"I am taking this action today because it is in the best interests of MSO and because I think it's the right thing to do,"
Mary Stewart,"Have you ever thought, when something dreadful happens, a moment ago things were not like this, let it be then, not now....? And then you try to remake then, but you know you can't. So you try to hold the moment quite still and not let it move on..."
Mary Stewart,The mills of God work like lightning compared with the law
Mary Stewart,"But I have noticed this about ambitious men, or men in powerâ€”they fear even the slightest and least likely threat to it."
Mary Stewart,The mills of God work like lightning compared with the law.
Mary Stewart,The best way of forgetting how you think you feel is to concentrate on what you know you know.
Mary Stewart,I can say 'reduce your stress level' until I'm blue in the face.

Payne Stewart,It's the stupidest rule in golf.
Payne Stewart,Where I was with my faith last year and where I am now is leaps and bounds.
Payne Stewart,"Yes, I'm a patriotic person. For these people who disgrace the American way and burn our flag and do all of these things... I say, don't live here and disgrace my country. Go live in the Middle East and see how you like it."
Payne Stewart,"With the media, I could be quick and ugly and critical. I tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve."
Payne Stewart,"We live in such a sheltered environment in the United States. I've been fortunate enough to have traveled all over the world, and I've seen things you only read about and see on the news."

Payne Stewart,"Then I would have an occasional cigarette and then I started back dipping. I started dipping last year. My family has asked me again to stop, and I'm trying my best to do that."
Payne Stewart,"The two-piece ball I switched to spun too much. One shot would go the distance I thought it should, then the next one would fall short, and then the next one would go long."
Payne Stewart,"The cast clubs were a big part of it, too. I found I wasn't getting that instant feedback I was used to with a forged blade. The sweet spot is a shade bigger, and when I didn't hit the ball dead center, I didn't know it, because it still felt great."
Payne Stewart,"That's why I'm very proud of being American. I'm proud to pay taxes. I pay a lot of taxes, but it sure beats the alternative."
Payne Stewart,"Raymond Floyd. The man knows how to control situations. He was experienced. He didn't let me get overly excited; he kept me in check. It allowed me to free myself up, and I played really well with him."
Payne Stewart,People who have never had an addiction don't understand how hard it can be.

Payne Stewart,"If you can't laugh at yourself, then how can you laugh at anybody else? I think people see the human side of you when you do that."
Payne Stewart,"If somebody asks for my opinion, I tell them my opinion, whether it's what they want to hear or not."
Payne Stewart,I've just become more conscious about how much I do drink and how often I want to have a drink and things like that. I think being conscious of it will help me to control the urges.
Payne Stewart,"I'm 42 now, what I would consider prime time."
Payne Stewart,"I went over before the British Open and played Valderrama thinking that I might make the team, might be a captain's pick. I made the effort to go over there."
Payne Stewart,I was wearing a back brace for a while. It started in '91 at the Open. It got to where I was using the back brace as a crutch instead of working out.
Payne Stewart,"I very rarely saw Tom Kite around. I've talked to Tom about it. I don't think Michael Jordan needed to be on the captain's cart with Kite; he needed to be walking in the gallery, supporting them from outside the ropes."
Payne Stewart,"I sometimes got distracted easily and allowed my mind to wander when I needed to be focused. It's quite subtle, really, and just being aware of it helps."
Payne Stewart,"I mean, at the time I would rather come here and sit on the lake than go practice and work on my golf game. Today I have a different philosophy."

Payne Stewart,For sure I would be a very emotional captain. A very hands-on captain.
Payne Stewart,"For one thing, when you're playing as well as I was at the time, you think you can play with anything. That isn't true, of course, but I didn't know it then."
Payne Stewart,"For example, I wouldn't hesitate to sit somebody down if he wasn't performing, even if he was the No. 1 player in the world. I've been sat down before."
Payne Stewart,"For a while, I think in 1994, it got to where I didn't want to practice."
Payne Stewart,"But in the end it's still a game of golf, and if at the end of the day you can't shake hands with your opponents and still be friends, then you've missed the point."
Payne Stewart,"But I'll tell you something: We had a big family discussion about it recently, my two sisters and I, and I pointed out that we all have the same genes as our mother and we're all susceptible to becoming alcoholics."
Payne Stewart,ADD is much more apparent in children; a lot of teachers can spot it right away. But it isn't just a problem for kids. I probably still have this ADD.
Payne Stewart,The '92 U.S. Open at Pebble got out of control. I have never played on a harder golf course in harder conditions than that last round at Pebble.
Payne Stewart,Tiger is the greatest thing that's happened to the tour in a long time. He has brought incredible attention to golf at a time of year when football and the World Series always take precedence. Everything I've heard about him seems to be true.

Rod Stewart,"I trust them, ... I just OK the schedules and I turn up to sing, basically."
Rod Stewart,There was nothing there. No strength. I was petrified. I was scared. This was my livelihood.
Rod Stewart,"There was no power, no range whatsoever,"
Rod Stewart,"I'm not sure of what the potential power of the Web is, but it is something that is here to stay, so it needs to be dealt with, ... It's kinda cool, though, for the fans â€¦ because it makes what is basically a huge worldwide venue into an intimate one-on-one. I don't know of many concert halls that can do that."
Rod Stewart,"Half the battle is selling music, not singing it. It's the image, not what you sing."
Rod Stewart,Thanks for the Memory . . . The Great American Songbook Volume IV
Rod Stewart,"I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger. I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was stronger"
Rod Stewart,"I still love Rachel very, very much indeed and I hope and pray that she will eventually come back. There has been no bitter bust-up and no one else is involved. It is not about something I've done and it's not about something she has done."

Rod Stewart,I've never been more in love with anyone nearly half my age than I am today. I'd get married in a minute if I weren't still married to somebody else.

Ben Stiller,There's always an element of fear that you need to work a lot until people get sick and tired of you or finally figure out that you're a fraud after all!

Ben Stiller,The cliches are that it's the most generic Starsky and Hutch plot you can find.

Ben Stiller,"Jim Carrey, a comic genius, has a harder time overcoming the public's desire for him to be funny simply because he's so good at it."

Ben Stiller,I enjoy the work I do in comedies. It's a valid test of your creative abilities.
Ben Stiller,I don't think the public is dying to see me necessarily be funny all the time.

Jerry Stiller,Some of the routines come back very easily. We do it off the top of our heads.

Jerry Stiller,I loved the idea of touching base with an audience.
Jerry Stiller,I don't think my judgment is that good. I don't know what is funny.

Jerry Stiller,"I ask myself why I do it. Maybe it's to prove I'm still around. It takes a lot out of my body. I'm not an NBA player anymore. At my age, very few people can handle it."

John Stocco,"I didn't see it coming at all, to tell you the truth. As far as how everything went last year, everything was normal. He had a lot of other responsibilities, but nothing changed in terms of when he was around, him dealing with us. Nothing changed, so I had no reason to expect this."
John Stocco,"It's all about developing that trust, so I know that I can take my drop and pitch it and they're coming out of their break and going to get it. It's like anything else, it's getting reps and reps and doing it over and over until it gets..."
John Stocco,"But, in past summers, when we'd go 7-on-7, I'd drop back, make a read and throw to one receiver,"
John Stocco,"He's a little out there. I love the guy, though."
John Stocco,All I know is our competition is going to get better in a hurry.

James Stockdale,"I'm a grown man. You know, I've been in a lot of scrapes, but I never felt like I got so - there are probably a lot of things I should have done that I didn't do."
James Stockdale,"This idea, as you know, that I have firm convictions that the idea of issues being a big deal where our mutual friend went back and he felt so strongly that the determining factor in electoral success should be a proven character."

James Stockdale,"Half the issues they - are so polished they're talking about - are dead by the time they get into the office, and into the midst of their tour where they're really productive."
James Stockdale,"But there were highs as well as lows, it was as though they said everybody was picking on the man who had more practical real life experiences than the whole batch of them put together."
James Stockdale,"And we had our own laws. I mean, I wrote them. And we had our own customs, and traditions, and proprieties."
James Stockdale,"Yeah. I mean, it just seemed to me that it was - I felt so helpless to this business of not having any papers. That seems like a throwback to a schoolboy."

James Stockdale,"They were heading out to the middle of the bay - the Gulf - that's another thing that became kind of standard practice, we didn't hurry the destroyers around the beach any more, when it got dark, we'd take 'em out thirty or forty miles out in the middle of the Tonkin Gulf."

Peja Stojakovic,It kind of wakes you up. We'll probably be more prepared physically and mentally for this game.
Peja Stojakovic,"We came out aggressive tonight. We moved the ball well and took control of the boards. I think our team did a pretty good job on defense. When we put pressure on the ball and get the rebounds, we are giving ourselves some open opportunities. We have to keep playing well and see what happens."
Clifford Stoll,"Spending an evening on the World Wide Web is much like sitting down to a dinner of Cheetos, two hours later your fingers are yellow and you're no longer hungry, but you haven't been nourished."

You can build chemistry."

Lisa Stone,"These children have been through so much, and they're doing the best they can with what they have. I've been here just a short time, but it seems the kids are doing OK. They need time to be kids. So we let them."

Bob Stoops,"This shows the youth that we have and the way that we have grown throughout the year. We have a number of young guys who are capable of being really good, and I think they'll get better and better."
Bob Stoops,"Once, he was a little mad that we only gave him one yard on a run. I said, 'Don't' worry about it. You'll get plenty of yards.' I guess that was a way to keep his pride a little bit while wearing blue."
Bob Stoops,"UCLA has made improvements, and talent-wise they have always been good. They continue to have sound schemes and are disciplined."
Bob Stoops,"This is a guy who, when he's healthy, has been phenomenal. Once he regained the strength in his ankle this year, he was right back to running with power and making the same kind of cuts before he was injured. He really came on once he was over the injury and he has been sensational in every game since."
Bob Stoops,"He's still a few weeks away from what the book says, but strength-wise he appears to be solid. What's the magical day is hard to determine. I think the doctors will evaluate him on (today) and see if he can't start doing some work."
Bob Stoops,"Now, it's more building their confidence. That's where we're at, ... We have to just do our job, do it as hard as we can do it and just play smarter. If we do that alone, we've got a chance to improve. Just not making mistakes and take care of the ball."
Bob Stoops,"We had no intention of bringing Dusty back when he was let go a year ago. I figured he'd enter the NFL draft, and that would be it."
Bob Stoops,I feel like we're making good improvement up there. The good thing is that those guys are out there everyday. They're getting a ton of snaps and that will make them better.
Bob Stoops,"I don't think so, ... He remembers those other 12 games. They didn't fade from his memory."
Bob Stoops,"You guys probably forgot how he played those first 12 games,"
Bob Stoops,"There's a very fine margin in winning and losing, ... The way we've played in so many games, the point production, the great defense -- there's a lot more to deal with that's positive than negative."
Bob Stoops,"We've got an opportunity with six more [games] to win nine. We're going to do our best to win as many as we can. I mean, we can all add, right?"
Bob Stoops,"What we were doing at the end of the game, we've never done before. The other side of it is, if we don't do it, for instance when we did take a knee against Texas Tech, does that then come back and haunt you? Is that the reason that maybe kept you out of something, and how do you live with that as well? Its really a rotten position to play in."
Bob Stoops,"Congratulations to Texas, they played an excellent football game. The team, coaches and players really executed well and made big plays. Our compliments go out to them. They are an excellent football team, which we knew coming in, and they showed it again today."
Bob Stoops,It kind of just typifies our whole year. We've been fighting all year. I'm proud of our guys for competing the way they did.
Bob Stoops,"This typifies our whole year. We've been fighting and clawing this way all season. Fortunately, our ball magnet came up with the big interception."
Bob Stoops,It maybe typifies our whole year. We've been fighting and scratching and clawing through it all. I appreciate the guys for that.
Bob Stoops,"We were fighting, scratching and clawing all year. At the end of the game, you had that feeling of 'Here we go again,' but we made the plays we needed to win the game."
Bob Stoops,"I know what will be written, but we're a work in progress, ... We're fighting that. We're going to keep pushing and making improvements each week, and if we do that, we have a chance to have a good team."
Bob Stoops,"I think you're always looking for guys, especially in the offensive line, that are just tough, hard-working, fighting guys. That's what you look for. It's not always the easiest thing to find."
Bob Stoops,"On both sides of the ball I see strong discipline, very good schemes, and players that play in a physical way. They play hard. That's why they win so often."
Bob Stoops,"We're one of those teams that gets criticized even when we win. In the end, though, I'm smart enough to recognize all that we overcame down here in this atmosphere and still came away with a victory."
Bob Stoops,"It's easy to jump on one guy when something goes wrong. Hey, that's fine. We deserve the criticism, but track records over time also stand for something."
Bob Stoops,"I just felt overall that there was a little more, maybe, consistency there to some degree, ... but it's still very close when you look at them overall."
Bob Stoops,"I have total confidence in Chuck, and I think his track record speaks for him. The proof is in what they've done."
Bob Stoops,"Defensively, it was kind of frustrating. I have to compliment their quarterback. He did such a good job. What an excellent competitor."
Bob Stoops,We came out of spring believing that they each had a scrimmage or two that they were good at and one or two that they made some mistakes at. Each of them did that and in our mind there was not a separation going into (Thursday's) practice. I feel it's unfortunate that so many of you in the media have ranked them and have put them in place so that players have to hear that the entire summer. It's really not fair.
Bob Stoops,We (coaches) believe that Rhett has played well enough and is close enough that we do intend to get him snaps early in games as well as late in games.
Bob Stoops,He's got another year after this one to contribute and play. He's an excellent athlete who works hard. We just want to give him more opportunities to get on the field. I think he will give us more production.
Bob Stoops,"I know everybody thinks I've got the final veto and/or approval of somebody, and I guess I do, ... But he and (linebacker) Clint Ingram by far and away had all the votes. That tells you that guys who are working with him every day believe in him, too."
Bob Stoops,obtained professional advice to ensure that we followed applicable laws.
Bob Stoops,"They all have skill ability. They are all guys who work hard and they have the respect of their teammates. They are all bright guys, and you put that all together and you have a group of great quarterbacks."
Bob Stoops,"We have speed, â€“ the ability to close, the ability to play in space. We get good pressure."
Bob Stoops,Those guys all have ability .... I believe they've got a chance to really be a great group.
Mason Storm,"I think we'll have a strong showing in sectionals. We have some strong swimmers, they swim hard and smart, and I think we'll be ready."
Mason Storm,"We've been getting ready for sectionals, so the scores here aren't a big deal. In this meet, we have fun. We like swimming against Bloomington North."
Mason Storm,"Jacob Coburn is a sophomore, and he set personal bests in both events. He swam really well."

John Stossel,Give me a break.
John Stossel,"I never wanted to be an anchor for 25 years, and suddenly I wanted to be one."
Terry Stotts,"We need March to be a good month for us. Between home games and everything else, we need March to be a good month. We were one game under .500 for February and around that in January, so we need to come on strong in March and see what happens in April. But this is the time that we should be able to separate a little bit."
Terry Stotts,"Two games in a row (against Washington). At their place the first time we played them, T.J. made a big defensive play - he got an offensive foul. He made the steal this time."
Terry Stotts,Washington has won a lot of games with Arenas at the end. For T.J. to get that steal was just a huge play.
Terry Stotts,"Right now he doesn't need to be an offensive force for us. He made some good plays, was available on penetration. We don't need him to score every time he touches the ball. He's very mature with his approach. That showed."
Terry Stotts,"They're an explosive team, but their style of play allows you to get back into games too. We kept fighting. We kept trying to make things happen and it seemed like every time we got close, we'd miss an easy one and they'd come down and make one."
Terry Stotts,It's up to us. You want to be in position to control your own destiny. You can't ask for anything more than that.
Terry Stotts,They complement each other well. I think it's a benefit to Mo and to T.J. that they're there for each other and they're able to play with each other.
Terry Stotts,"I'm very pleased with their attention to aggression on defense,"
Terry Stotts,"We wanted to take advantage of both those guys inside, they finished around the basket. They did a nice job of fighting when they were open."
Amare Stoudemire,"as far as understanding the game of baskedball, opening up and just wor{yng on different skills on the offensive end and being more focused on defense."
Amare Stoudemire,"Once I get back to the motion of jogging and running, we're getting close. My thing is I just want to make sure I'm not feeling any pain regardless of what the MRI says. It's still up to me on how I feel and the pain tolerance."
Amare Stoudemire,"It hit me personally because I've been in that type of situation when I was a kid (living in a number of different homes in Florida), when I really didn't have a household to go to. When I see those families and kids down there, I see myself."
Amare Stoudemire,"It's just a matter of being an NBA superstar, ... You can love it or hate it. You get a lot of things that come with it: magazine covers, cover of a video game, mega-deals, fancy cars, expensive clothes, jewelry. You've got everything at your disposal."
Amare Stoudemire,"I have to be 100 percent, no doubt. But I'm itching to get out there. I can't wait to play with this team and see how much better we can be with myself in the equation. If everything keeps moving at this pace and there are no setbacks, I should be out there before long."
Jeff Stoughton,I hope Glenn wins it. We're good buddies. They played well. He's never won it as a skip and the team has never won it.
Jeff Stoughton,"You hate to lose any game, but I don't mind getting blown out because it's a little easier. You're more relaxed, at least when you know the end should be near."
Jeff Stoughton,"It's obviously tough to get back into the groove again after a tough loss and (Christmas) holidays. We've been throwing rocks for a week now, trying to get back into the mood for playing and, once we get out there in front of the fans and a good atmosphere here, it will get the juices going and we'll try to do our best."

Michael Strahan,"It's incredible to watch those guys move the ball, control the clock and put up points."
Michael Strahan,"He is going to be a great head coach. I'll be really surprised if he doesn't get a job somewhere. He's done a great job with this unit and he's made it exciting.

Michael Strahan,"At first, I didn't know what to expect but I do say that I love our defensive coordinator, Tim Lewis."

Martin Straka,He's definitely playing with a lot more passion than a couple years ago.

Martin Straka,I hope that it's going to be a wake-up call.
Martin Straka,I hope this will be a wake up call for the us.

Mark Strand,"Pain is filtered in a poem so that it becomes finally, in the end, pleasure."
Lee Strasberg,An actors' tribute to me is in his work.
Lee Strasberg,"A great actor is independent of the poet, because the supreme essence of feeling does not reside in prose or in verse, but in the accent with which it is delivered."
Lee Strasberg,Art is longer than life.
Lee Strasberg,"If we cannot see the possibility of greatness, how can we dream it?"
Lee Strasberg,"Acting is the most personal of our crafts. The make-up of a human being - his physical, mental and emotional habits - influence his acting to a much greater extent than commonly recognized."
Lee Strasberg,The actor creates with his own flesh and blood all those things which all the arts try in some way to describe.
Lee Strasberg,Work for the actor lies in two areas: the ability to consistently create reality and the ability to express that reality.
Trish Stratus,"Yeah, the record for most titles was previously held by the Fabulous Moolah, she won it four times. And a few weeks ago, I won the title for the sixth time, which has never been done before."
Trish Stratus,"Well, actually, the Second City thing came about because I was taking a few improv classes there. I thought that the improv classes would help with my wrestling career, which it has."
Trish Stratus,"We got great ratings and fan interest, and that's what management wanted."
Trish Stratus,There really isn't a day when I wake up and DON'T have to be someplace.
Trish Stratus,"Royal Canadian Air Farce, and I was in three sketches there. And they wrote some really great stuff for me."
Trish Stratus,"Recently, I went up to Casino Rama to see Martin Short's show, just to see how he put it all together. And after the show, I went backstage and picked his brain to find out why he did certain things."
Trish Stratus,"Oh, gosh, okay... well, my biggest injury was probably a bone chip in my ankle that required surgery."
Trish Stratus,"Now, at this point, I can wrestle, I can go out there and cut an entertaining promo, I can also do the backstage stuff... and if you can contribute more to the show, you have more staying power."
Trish Stratus,"I'm missing a knuckle, it's crushed inside my hand at the moment."
Trish Stratus,"I'm good friends with The Rock, and I talk to him all the time. And he says that, even though his movie career has taken off, he misses the instant gratification of wrestling, and the live crowds, and I could see being that way myself."
Trish Stratus,"I think people get too comfortable, in just doing what they do every week. And I'm all about challenge and change, and I like to read the audience."
Trish Stratus,"I think I can finally say I am at my most confident and comfortable out there, physically."
Trish Stratus,Each championship is unique and special.
Trish Stratus,"But as much as I am personally proud for winning five championships, I'm equally proud just being part of a women's division that has gotten so much better with all these great athletes here."
Trish Stratus,"As far as luxury goes, about the only thing I do is... I go first class all the way. I live on the road, so when I'm out there, I'm getting the nice hotel suite, I'm getting the luxury car, I'm eating the good food, and I make sure I take care of myself on the road."
Trish Stratus,And that's what I've learned too: writing is key.
Trish Stratus,"And in the future, you know, maybe there's kids in the future for me, I don't really know. The interesting thing with me is that there has never been a woman doing what I'm doing at this level for this long. So, it's like, would Vince give me maternity leave?"
Trish Stratus,And I'm so thankful that I've been allowed to show another side of Trish.
Trish Stratus,And I wouldn't take on such a big thing if I didn't think I could nail it.
Trish Stratus,"And I have the support of the writers: I have a great relationship with the creative team, and they have a good hold of my character and my personality, and they come up with some great stuff, and I'm forever trying to change it up, keep it fresh."
Trish Stratus,"As far as wrestling goes, as long as my body is able to withstand the physical beating, I will keep wrestling."
Andrew Strauss,"We've got to learn from our mistakes and rectify them,"
Andrew Strauss,That's not a panic situation we just have to keep working hard.
Andrew Strauss,To make a century against Australia under any circumstances is always special. It will be hard work but there is definitely ten Australian wickets for us.
Andrew Strauss,"Situations like this bring people together and we are 100% per cent behind Freddie, who is a great character and a fantastic cricketer."
David Strauss,"This race, between Conrad and Hoeven, would have been Armageddon. I think that we've averted a race here that would have involved the expenditure of millions of dollars, and the people of North Dakota will be better off not having to be subjected to it."
David Strauss,"At this point there's nothing Ken Starr can do to force him to answer a question. Now if he refuses to answer a question Mr. Starr could bring the subpoena against him again, subpoena him and then force him to answer the questions, but that would take another course of legal proceedings."
David Strauss,"At this point there's nothing Ken Starr can do to force him to answer a question. Now if he refuses to answer a question Mr. Starr could bring the subpoena against him again, subpoena him and then force him to answer the questions, but that would take another course of legal proceedings,"
Richard Strauss,"The human voice is the most beautiful instrument of all, but it is the most difficult to play."
Richard Strauss,"I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer."
Richard Strauss,Never look at the trombones. You'll only encourage them.
Richard Strauss,"Building brand name is key. That's what America is all about,"
Robert Strauss,If you increase the sales tax ... everybody would be taxed.
Robert Strauss,"At the other end of this, who's going to be taking as serious any commitments that are made? The reality is nobody is going to sign up for anything that will serve the public's interest until afterwards."
Robert Strauss,"What we saw Tuesday night is nothing to be proud of -- it was embarrassing. Nobody talked about the numbers, ... County council was being asked to vote on something they didn't understand the words about, let alone the empirical effects."
Robert Strauss,"What we've been subjected to is the assessment law of the month, and it really is troubling."
Robert Strauss,It's a little like wrestling a gorilla. You don't quit when you're tired - you quit when the gorilla is tired.
Robert Strauss,If you increase the sales tax... everybody would be taxed.
Igor Stravinsky,"I was born out of due time in the sense that by temperament and talent I should have been more suited for the life of a small Bach, living in anonymity and composing regularly for an established service and for God"
Igor Stravinsky,"The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self. And the arbitrariness of the constraint serves only to obtain precision of execution."

Igor Stravinsky,What force is more potent than love?
Igor Stravinsky,"In order to create there must be a dynamic force, and what force is more potent than love?"
Igor Stravinsky,The trouble with music appreciation in general is that people are taught to have too much respect for music they should be taught to love it instead.
Igor Stravinsky,"Just as appetite comes by eating, so work brings inspiration, if inspiration is not discernible at the beginning."
Igor Stravinsky,My music is best understood by children and animals.
Igor Stravinsky,"I remember being handed a score composed by Mozart at the age of eleven. What could I say? I felt like de Kooning, who was asked to comment on a certain abstract painting, and answered in the negative. He was then told it was the work of a celebrated monk"
Igor Stravinsky,"Just as appetite comes from eating, so work brings inspiration, if inspiration is not discernible at the beginning"
Igor Stravinsky,"Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal."

Jack Straw,"This was a disappointing and unhelpful speech,"
Jack Straw,"Mr. Wiesenthal has been untiring in his service to the Jewish communities in the U.K. and elsewhere by helping to right at least some of the awful wrongs of the Holocaust, ... If there is one name which symbolizes this vital coming to terms with the past, it is Simon Wiesenthal's."
Jack Straw,"We can't get into a situation of bargaining with terrorists because this would put many more people's lives at risk, not only in Iraq but around the world,"

Jack Straw,"There has to come a moment when our patience must run out, and we are now near that point with Iraq,"
Jack Straw,"What is important is that the region, the people of Serbia, now draw a line across Milosevic's past and his life, which was a malign influence on the people of Serbia and the whole region."
Jack Straw,"There is a general sense of guarded optimism. There have been too many false dawns over the last 60 years. There have been more tears than smiles, but I sense there is a commitment from Abbas and Sharon, a new determination to make a reality of the goal of two states living side by side."
Jack Straw,"(It's) very shocking, with what seems to be a large loss of life. Our hearts and our prayers go out to those who have lost loved ones."
Jack Straw,it is standing up for justice.
Jack Straw,"The demands they have made could not be met without great damage to jobs and industry, to essential services ... to pensioners and children,"
Jack Straw,"While the Taliban connives with foreign terrorists, the Afghan people suffer from poverty, drought and hunger,"
Jack Straw,putting the government of Syria on notice that our patience has limits.
Jack Straw,"The government of Iraq has to be from the people of Iraq and by the people of Iraq, of course with the support of the coalition and with the support of the United Nations and of the international community."
Jack Straw,"Robin and I had been good friends for nearly 30 years and that friendship survived our policy disagreements over Iraq, ... He was the greatest parliamentarian of his generation and a very fine foreign secretary. I deeply mourn his loss."

Jack Straw,"In the event of failure to uphold international standards, the draft conclusions make it clear that measures such as asset freezes or visa bans could be taken against those responsible."

Jack Straw,"It is a further illustration of the evil that we are dealing with,"
Jack Straw,"Coming just days before the presidential elections, it looks like yet another attempt by the Mugabe regime to obstruct the conduct of the election and the ability of the people of Zimbabwe to choose, freely and fairly, who should lead them."
Jack Straw,a disgusting assault on the very principle of European democracy.
Jack Straw,"They are not, and almost everybody accepts this, entitled to engage in seeking to disrupt the way our democracy operates by violence or threats of violence."
Jack Straw,"Everyone knows that the Arab peoples want prosperity, freedom and democracy every bit as much as anyone in Europe or America,"
Jack Straw,Iraq has no history of democracy.
Jack Straw,"Delay would give Saddam the clearest possible signal that his strategy is succeeding, ... It would tell him that the international community lacks the will to disarm him."
Jack Straw,Kofi Annan has already been instrumental in pushing forward that debate in the United Nations. I firmly support his efforts. A successful United Nations Summit next week presents the international community with a real opportunity to secure the necessary change.
Jack Straw,"I look forward to the full cooperation of Syria in form as well as substance, ... but I have to say after what I've heard I'm not holding my breath."
Jack Straw,I know too that the only reason we have got any cooperation at all out of Iraq is because of the credible threat of force.
Jack Straw,"Let there be no doubt that any failure by Iraq to comply with its obligations will lead to serious consequences, ... For it is only the credible threat of force which has brought Iraq this far today."
Jack Straw,"Saddam's weapons pose a grave threat to international peace and security, ... We must not shrink from our commitment."
Jack Straw,I really don't think it would be wise to speculate in an abstract way about the circumstances in which it might be on the agenda.
Jack Straw,"Normally, you get agreement in the end,"
Jack Straw,"I'm very pleased to announce that agreement has now been reached that negotiations on Turkey's accession into the European Union can and will begin in the very near future,"
Jack Straw,"Agreement has now been reached that negotiations on Turkey's accession to the European Union can and will begin in the very near future,"
Jack Straw,Agreement has now been reached that negotiations on Turkey's accession to the European Union can and will begin in the very near future.
Jack Straw,targeting was very careful and that action was proportionate.
Jack Straw,"What we need is action. The problem for the European Union is that we can only go at the pace of the slowest. Therefore, there is a special responsibility on the countries which have failed so far implementing measures to get moving,"
Meryl Streep,"I once read that in any good marriage, one partner is the gardener and the other is the garden. We take it in turns to be either."
Meryl Streep,"This creation is not really like his show. It is an imagined last show, and so it's in the context of being taken over by a radio conglomerate, which is happening to a lot of radio shows at home."
Meryl Streep,Expensive clothes are a waste of money
Meryl Streep,"The interesting thing about being a mother is that everyone wants pets, but no one but me cleans the kitty litter."
Huston Street,"It feels good, but it still feels weak. I had to shut it down. I feel confident in the progress I'm making. But if you can't throw off a mound, you can't throw in a game."
Huston Street,Empty. Just empty. I don't know how to feel listening to them cheer right now. I completely understand what it means to be at a loss for words. I was totally expecting us to go to San Diego.
Huston Street,"He's like our silent leader. He leads by example. So when he did step up and say something, it meant a whole lot to everybody because they knew that it came from his heart."
Huston Street,"It feels like it's responding, like it's heading in the right direction."
Huston Street,"This has probably been the most fun baseball total experience as I have had in my life, ... I've never been around a group of guys that jelled like we did. I'll cherish these six weeks forever."
John Street,"I think they've been unfairly treated, ... You don't need to be in the Superdome, you look at the television and you can see it."
John Street,very concerned that all of his years of public service are going to be compromised by the current situation.
John Street,This could be the greatest natural disaster in our country's history. We need a response commensurate with that.
Picabo Street,I only hope I get to watch the women's downhill. I think I'll still be able to grasp the sensation even if I'm only living it vicariously.
Picabo Street,"This is going to light a fire under them. They need to find that fire, to use this for the races coming up."
Picabo Street,"When someone tells me, this is only one way to do things, it always lights a fire under my butt. My instant reaction is, I'm gonna prove you wrong."
Picabo Street,"I spoke to her and she is full of energy and she is going to go in the combined, and in the super-G if her back is not too sore."
Picabo Street,"There were mornings when I just didn't want to get out of bed. But once again, I'm in an adverse situation and having to deal with something new and learn how to do it."
Picabo Street,There are times everyone needs to be together for me and we all just work together; making sure that my energy is good and right when I go do what I'm going to do. That means the family needs to spend time together.
Picabo Street,The whole image thing gets in the way. Then there are the guys that it excites them and it's what draws them to me. But I don't know whether they would care for me if I didn't have this image.
Picabo Street,"That fat speed that I love, that sensation, that's what I want."
Picabo Street,One of my dreams in life is to do fund-raising for the youth.
Picabo Street,"Nobody needs to prove to anybody what they're worthy of, just the person that they look at in the mirror. That's the only person you need to answer to."
Picabo Street,"My knee is as strong as it was before, if not stronger, and it's a matter of getting my leg strong. I lost six years of strength in about six month's time, so it's going to take another year or two to get that leg back up to full strength, but I'm good to go so far."
Picabo Street,"My brother and Lauren are very close with me and they are in Sun Valley, so sometimes I need to go there and feel their presence. And there are times I need to see my bro' alone."
Picabo Street,"It is an everlasting desire to make my dreams come true. And it's getting to the point now where it's like, come on I want my dreams to come true so that I can get on with the rest of my life. Sometimes I think about the rest of my life when I'm done."
Picabo Street,"I've had to do that all my life because my energy is way, way overwhelming."
Picabo Street,I'm social and I meet people and talk to people but I'm not looking for the ideal person to fit my mold and to raise my family with yet. I'm just kind of doing my thing and learning from the people I'm around and who I cross paths with.
Picabo Street,"I'm not following anybody's tracks, I'm making my own baby."
Picabo Street,"I'm looking forward to free skiing the most. Just groomers, big wide groomers making nice big turns."
Picabo Street,"I'm hoping that maybe everyone on the Olympic team thinks that I'm worthy to carry the flag. That's my next goal, to carry the flag during the opening ceremonies, if everyone chooses me."
Picabo Street,"I wasn't losing my focus but I was getting tired of focusing. What I was focusing on was becoming too routine, too ritual, not something that was interesting, new and exciting."
Picabo Street,"I want kids to have a chance to dream of becoming something like I did in my life, and when you're living in a home that's dysfunctional and unhealthy that way, you don't dream like that."
Picabo Street,I have a fund-raiser that I do every Christmas in Sun Valley to raise money.
Picabo Street,I get my inspiration from everyone when I need it and how I need it.
Picabo Street,I donate money to the existing foundation that funds the US Ski Team kids.
Picabo Street,"I don't look at it like that's my rival and I have to beat her. It's more like, I have to ski this as fast as I can and the fastest of everyone out here and that's what I expect."
Picabo Street,"I don't know if it's just me or everyone, but the whole vibe with skiing is not so much thriving on competition against others as it is against myself and the clock."
Picabo Street,"Here at the house, I've been decorating it and getting it organized. My best friend moved in in October so I've been getting her settled. She's my personal assistant now."
Picabo Street,Every once in a while I run the Olympic downhill in Japan in my head. I think of how the energy is going to flow and then I make it all work for myself.
Picabo Street,A lot of women don't know how to vent and deal with emotions.
Picabo Street,"We weren't built to fly. We can do it, but we shouldn't be surprised if it feels a little unnatural."
Picabo Street,I have my gold forever and no one can ever take it away from me.
Picabo Street,"But to personally satisfy my own adrenalin needs, I've been racing cars a little bit, which has been fun."
Picabo Street,I've made a promise to myself to be a 100% healthy person if nothing else.
Barbra Streisand,"I knew that with a mouth like mine, I just hadda be a star or something."
Barbra Streisand,I don't care what you say about me. Just be sure to spell my name wrong.
Barbra Streisand,I've considered having my nose fixed. But I didn't trust anyone enough. If I could do it myself with a mirror.
Barbra Streisand,I'm very grateful to the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association who have been so supportive of me throughout my career.
Barbra Streisand,Al Gore has won the election.
Barbra Streisand,"Men are allowed to have passion and commitment for their work ... a woman is allowed that feeling for a man, but not her work."
Barbra Streisand,"The result [Republicans winning the Senate] would be devastating for reproductive choice, the environment, civil liberties, Social Security and health care, as well as corporate accountability."
Barbra Streisand,The audience is the best judge of anything. They cannot be lied to. Truth brings them closer. A moment that lags - they're gonna cough.
Barbra Streisand,"Why is it men are permitted to be obsessed about their work, but women are only permitted to be obsessed about men?"
Barbra Streisand,"Men are allowed to have passion and commitment for their work... a woman is allowed that feeling for a man, but not her work."
Barbra Streisand,"A man who graduated high in his class at Yale Law School and made partnership in a top law firm would be celebrated. A man who invested wisely would be admired, but a woman who accomplishes this is treated with suspicion."
Barbra Streisand,"You have got to discover you, what you do, and trust it."
Barbra Streisand,Success to me is having ten honeydew melons and eating only the top half of each slice.
Barbra Streisand,Why does a woman work ten years to change a man's habits and then complain that he's not the man she married?
Barbra Streisand,"I've been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good."
Vivian Stringer,Essence takes great pleasure in creating zeros on anybody that she plays.
Vivian Stringer,We needed something dramatic. Maybe you have a different perspective when you're seeing it from the bench. It's kind of interesting how you can see things a whole lot easier from the bench than from when you're on the floor.
Vivian Stringer,I'm not going to tell you now while everyone is listening.
Vivian Stringer,Essence's job was to keep Duffy quiet. When Duffy scored it was against somebody else.
Vivian Stringer,"It's about that killer instinct, the great teams have that and we need to look for it. We need to teach our team that killer instinct."
Vivian Stringer,That girl is shooting over 50 percent from the floor. ... Anyone who has watched greatness has to know this girl is getting it done.
Vivian Stringer,"She and I are personal friends, but as it relates to the game itself, she can see like I can see. She can tell what our strengths and weaknesses are just like I can with them, but I'm not necessarily worried about that. We just have to go out and play."
Vivian Stringer,They knew. I have clothes I want to wear.
Vivian Stringer,"I thought we sputtered and I thought we did not make the extra pass. We played selfish basketball today, and I thought we played not smart."
Peter Stringfellow,You're only as old as the woman you feel.
Peter Stringfellow,"The City guys are a very large part of my market. The ladies are just as welcome as the men. The American way of handling these things is probably more politically correct, but we just have to hope we don't go down that road."
Peter Stringfellow,"I am wonderful, with a perfect physique, very charming, rich and look like Jude Law."
Peter Stringfellow,"If a man with a business brain like Richard Branson's felt the girls should take their clothes off, I knew it must be a winner [on the success of his nightclub]"
Charlie Strong,"We knew that if we could stop them from running the football, we would be successful."
Charlie Strong,"I think that because of the new era and because of the success coach Meyer has had, the expectations are going to be higher. Then you start to look at our team and what we have coming back. You've got so many players that played when they were young and now they're back, that's why the expectations are so much higher. But this is the University of Florida. That's why we're here and that's why the program is the way it is."
Charlie Strong,"He's always harping on that; he's always talking about the behavior of the team. Now he's where he trusts this football team. The guys, they know how to act, they understand how to act. No one has gotten into any trouble, and I think they understand. Nobody wants to be the first one to get in trouble."
Charlie Strong,"We kind of call Jarvis our miracle baby because in the spring we didn't have him. And then he came on for us and has done a great job as a pass rusher. He's played through the injuries and really come on for us. He has a chance to be really good, a special player."
Mack Strong,"You know, we've been an underdog all year long. And that's fine. I don't worry about the odds-makers and all that stuff. Nobody even gave us a chance near the end of the season, after we ran off 11 straight games, that we would even play for the NFC Championship, let alone the Super Bowl."
Mack Strong,"I think not having to worry about contract talks and all that stuff has helped him because he can really focus all of his efforts on coaching. Obviously, you see the benefit it's had for our team."
Mack Strong,We are not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do.
Mack Strong,"I'm just trying to soak up every moment that I can and just really savor it. Just writing in a little journal that I have -- for myself, for the future and for my kids. Just so that I will remember this incredible experience."
Mack Strong,"They do a great job of bringing them. They corner blitz, they bring the safety, they bring linebackers. So you have to be ready on almost every play that they're going to bring somebody."
Mack Strong,"We knew what we had to get done. We knew the things that had plagued us in the past were turnovers, penalties and not making the plays when we had the opportunity. We were a lot more focused today. That starts with Mike and Matt."
Mack Strong,"I think a lot of things that plagued us in the past, where we definitely had some off-the-field issues ... I think the fact that we eliminated a lot of that stuff, and we don't worry about who gets the credit, that's made all the difference in the world."
Mack Strong,"It is kind of comical. It's kind of like a sitcom. I know in years past whenever I've seen things like this happen I feel like someone staged this, somebody put these guys up to do this."
Mack Strong,It seems to be our year. We have an opportunity to do something very special in this city.
Mack Strong,"There have been a lot of tough years, a lot of challenging times and obstacles to overcome. But we're here."
Mack Strong,"There is nobody else in the game who does the things Walter does. He's just a freak of nature. But for the rest of us humans, we still get our jobs done. I mean, the quality of the players that we have playing on that front five is just amazing."
Mack Strong,"He sure deserves it. He's had a very impressive year. In my mind, no one has been more deserving of MVP."
Mack Strong,"He's been running like a man on a mission this year. Every week, he's performed. He's a big reason why we have the bye this week and are moving on to the second round of the playoffs."
Mack Strong,Just things that I've never experienced in my life.
Mack Strong,We were all excited. This is the playoffs. We're at home in front of our crowd and the whole city is alive and buzzing with enthusiasm. We all had to take a deep breath and just relax and get into our groove and start playing the game.
Mack Strong,They [the NFL] implemented the injunction ... and the rest is history. It was a very weird time. I've fortunately been around for a lot of awkward moments in the history of this team for the last 13 years.
Mack Strong,The winning makes it a lot more fun. I've been through some lean seasons. Winning makes it a lot easier. You can see it in practice.
Mack Strong,"It's fun. I know those guys are good at what they do, so I look forward to Sunday. Hopefully, I'll be able to open up some holes for them."
Mack Strong,He's active and has a nose for the football. He seems to always be in the right place at the right time.
Mack Strong,"This will probably be one of the most physical football games that has ever been. Pittsburgh's reputation speaks for itself, and people seemingly don't know a whole lot about us, but we're a pretty physical team as well."
Mack Strong,This is a great football team. I love the guys in this locker room.
Mack Strong,"No doubt, we have to get No. 37 back. Whatever we have to do, (we have) to find a way to get him back and healthy in the lineup and ready to play next week."
Mack Strong,I can't wait until next week. I just feel like we're a team of destiny. This is a year of destiny and we knew if we came out here and played together as a team we would find a way to win.
Mack Strong,I believe it's a real thing. It encourages you. It fires you up.
Mack Strong,"Nobody gave us a chance at the beginning of the season to make it to the Super Bowl. Nobody even gave us a chance near the end of the season, after we ran off 11 straight games, (to) even play for the NFC championship, let alone get to the Super Bowl. I feel like that's a sentiment we've had to overcome all year. Each time we've overcome that challenge, and I feel like we'll do the same this time."
Mack Strong,His ability to get into the end zone is what impresses me most. He has a rare knack for that. Few players in history have gotten into the end zone as much as he does.
Maurice Strong,Isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse? Isn't it our responsibility to bring about?
Maurice Strong,The United Nations has concentrated on helping the international community to prepare an economic package [for the North] that could help resolve the nuclear issue.
Maurice Strong,"After all, sustainability means running the global environment - Earth Inc. - like a corporation: with depreciation, amortization and maintenance accounts. In other words, keeping the asset whole, rather than undermining your natural capital."
Joe Strummer,The future is unwritten.
Joe Strummer,"Yeah, all those things, responsibility, pressure. It's a bit stressful. I try and come to terms with it by not thinking about it."
Joe Strummer,With The Simpsons you can go back to work with a keen heart.
Joe Strummer,"I have a weird life because I live on songwriting royalties, which are a strange income. Sometimes it rains, sometimes it doesn't."
Joe Strummer,"I began thinking there should be an American phrase book, 'cause I've got an Italian phrase book, and an Arabic one... now a British one. I think it'd be pretty good to have an American phrase book."
Joe Strummer,I think we're going to have to forget about the radio and just go back to word of mouth.
Joe Strummer,What I like about playing America is you can be pretty sure you're not going to get hit with a full can of beer when you're singing and I really enjoy that!
Joe Strummer,"Anyway, it's good to be sent back to the underground. There's always a good side to bad things and the good side to this is that at least everyone has to go back down."
Joe Strummer,"When you blame yourself, you learn from it. If you blame someone else, you don't learn nothing, cause hey, it's not your fault, it's his fault, over there."
Patrick Stump,"[Much has been made of Wentz's scathing words. On the single] Sugar, We're Going Down ... I'm just a notch in your bedpost/But you're just a line in a song."
Patrick Stump,"(Wentz) just gives me lyrics and phrases and sentences and ideas that are just kind of disembodies from any song, ... I'm his word editor and he's my music editor."
Patrick Stump,"I have a girlfriend and she hasn't minded, ... She thinks it's funny I have to sing about that stuff."
Patrick Stump,"I'm really glad I put aside whatever ego I had and just let (Wentz) be free,"
Patrick Stump,"Our fans are pretty loyal. In the beginning, we had to play a lot of shows to, like, one kid at a time. Those kids stuck with us and have been incredibly supportive. They have a lot more ownership of us than other bands, they can have Fall Out Boy. That's how we feel."
Jock Sturges,"When I started doing my work years ago, I had doubts as to whether the informed-consent question was answerable."
Jock Sturges,"What pedophiles and people who have sexual desires on children lose sight of to a terrible, terrible degree - a devastating degree - is that their victims are real people who will suffer forever whatever abuses are perpetrated on them."
Jock Sturges,What I'm good at is making art.
Jock Sturges,We live in an age where anonymity is growing in magnitude like a bomb going off.
Jock Sturges,Virtually always I get my best pictures when everybody thinks the shoot's done.
Jock Sturges,"They were without clothes before I got there, and they were without clothes when I left."
Jock Sturges,"There's no particular evidence that any of the lower mammals or any of the other animals have any interest in aesthetics at all. But Homo sapiens does, always has and always will."
Jock Sturges,There isn't a person alive who doesn't like being caressed.
Jock Sturges,There are photographs that I don't take now that I previously would have taken without any thought at all as to any misinterpretations.
Jock Sturges,"The world is shrinking as we see more and more of it in the media, and the more we see of the world, the smaller we are, the more aware we are of how insignificant any one of us is."
Jock Sturges,"The truth is that from birth on we are, to one extent or another, a fairly sensual species."
Jock Sturges,"The transactions between me and the people that I photograph are very, very collaborative."
Jock Sturges,The kids really enjoy what they do. I check with them constantly to make sure that they're really happy to be there.
Jock Sturges,"The images I like best are parts of series that I've started, in some cases, with the pregnancies of the mothers of the children in question, and I continue that series right on through the birth of children to the child that resulted from that first pregnancy."
Jock Sturges,"That's my ambition: that you look at the pictures and realize what complex, fascinating, interesting people every single one of my subjects is."
Jock Sturges,"That dichotomy between the public consumption of the work and my intent and practice in making it is an uneasy one for me, on occasion."
Jock Sturges,"Some of the people that I photographed as sticks became much more voluptuous, much rounder, in some cases dramatically so, and I think they're even more beautiful."
Jock Sturges,Physical beauty is such a strange thing.
Jock Sturges,"Now, I recognize that there are certain postures and angles that make people see red, which are evidence of original sin or something, and I avoid that. I don't shoot that any more."
Jock Sturges,No two people take on the information of being admirable and being admired in the same way.
Jock Sturges,"It's really, really hard to make it as a fine-art photographer exclusively."
Jock Sturges,It's no small irony that the government inevitably and invariably ends up promoting precisely that which they would most like to repress.
Jock Sturges,"In fact, I don't believe I'm guilty of any crimes, but I've always been drawn to and fascinated by physical, sexual and psychological change, and there's an erotic aspect to that."
Jock Sturges,"If somebody's pointing a trembling finger at your pants and saying you shouldn't be doing that, follow that finger back, go up the arm and look at the head that's behind it, because there's almost always something fairly woolly in there."
Jock Sturges,"If it gets to the Supreme Court, I'll have the directors of every museum in the country as expert testimony that my work is legitimate art."
Jock Sturges,I've had to relearn how I work with people so that if and when I do avoid different things I don't send any messages in doing so.
Jock Sturges,I'm the last person who has any desire to instruct anybody in shame. That's no errand for me.
Jock Sturges,"I'm guilty of extraordinary naivete, I suppose. But it's a naivete that I really don't want to abandon, not even now."
Jock Sturges,I'm an artist that's attracted to a specific way of seeing and a way of being.
Jock Sturges,I'd rather get back to making art than talk about it.
Jock Sturges,"I will always admit immediately to what's obvious, which is that Homo sapiens is inherently erotic or inherently sensual from birth."
Jock Sturges,"I know the families that I photograph extremely well, and I've known them for a very long time."
Jock Sturges,I just yesterday returned from a trip where I photographed a woman with two children whom I photographed first when she was the age of the older of the two children.
Jock Sturges,I found myself serving a sentence of public denial from the very second the raid on my apartment happened.
Jock Sturges,I don't photograph any two people who are remotely the same.
Jock Sturges,"I didn't think there was anything more or less obscene about any part of the body. Now, I recognize that there are certain postures and angles that make people see red, which are evidence of original sin or something, and I avoid that."
Jock Sturges,"I became good at defending myself, but as far as I was concerned, that was a transient skill."
Jock Sturges,I am fascinated by the human body and all its evolutions.
Jock Sturges,Every child is going to grow up. You can see it happen in the books: They get older and older and belong to themselves to a greater and greater extent.
Jock Sturges,Different members of different cultures will think that some things are beautiful.
Jock Sturges,"But the truth is that Homo sapiens is a sensual species. I think all species are, to one degree or another."
Jock Sturges,But empirically I've come to understand that my photographs really don't do any harm.
Jock Sturges,"Before, I'd photograph anything. I didn't think there was anything more or less obscene about any part of the body."
Jock Sturges,"As soon as you forbid something, you make it extraordinarily appealing. You also bring shame in as a phenomenon."
Jock Sturges,Any artist that's involved in their work is inevitably going to have a focus in what they do.
Jock Sturges,All my life I've taken photographs of people who are completely at peace being what they were in the situations I photographed them in.
Jock Sturges,"A virulent, aggressive minority has decided that Americans don't know themselves what it is they should see, and need to be protected by people who are wiser than they are, even if they are only a tiny sliver of the population."
Luis Suarez,He was removed from the national team because he didn't comply with some rules that are followed around here.
Luis Suarez,"We can only progress by beating historic rivals, gaining respect, rising step-by-step."
Luis Suarez,"As a minimum we have to get to the second round. After that, a ton of other goals will open up. This is what we want the people to understand."
Adam Sullivan,I really think we worked them on the offensive end and we really wanted to work them on defense. Then we went inside and out to try and get a two or a three instead of in the first half where we relied on threes.
Adam Sullivan,"We let a couple guys get some confidence and they did a nice job capitalizing, but we have got to get that killer instinct and close the game."
Adam Sullivan,We really focused on controlling the basketball and making them work on defense. To make the separation we had to do the grunt work.
Danny Sullivan,It would jeopardize Goggle's position with its competitors and compromise relations with users.
Danny Sullivan,"They have a sizable amount of traffic. Advertisers will want to reach that audience, and buying through MSN is going to be the only way to do that."
Danny Sullivan,"I think MSN has some features advertisers will gobble up, but it's too early to say whether it will be a superior experience. They have a sizable amount of traffic. Advertisers will want to reach that audience, and buying through MSN is going to be the only way to do that."
Ed Sullivan,"If you set the rate at 68 cents, it will damage the quality of education in Stafford. However, if it drops any lower, it will be devastating."
Ed Sullivan,"Tell me, Connie, is your mother still dead?"
Ed Sullivan,"If you do a good job for others, you heal yourself at the same time, because a dose of joy is a spiritual cure. It transcends all barriers."
Greg Sullivan,"Windows makes it really easy to pick whatever software you want to use and whatever service you want to use, ... We're really focused on addressing the needs of our customers and developing a platform that all of our partners can build on, and add value to, to provide the greatest customer choice."
Greg Sullivan,It's a tough one. One thing you've got to put in perspective for the team is that you've got to finish the game. I don't think [our guys] really gripped how fast a game can change. It's a tough learning experience to go through.
Greg Sullivan,I think we're starting to get it. We're living in a different world than five or 10 years ago. And there's incredible value in the feedback we get from the broad developer community.
Greg Sullivan,We'll never be done fighting the security fight. But we've made a lot of significant changes underneath the covers in terms of security.
Greg Sullivan,"This has been an ongoing design goal of ours,"
Greg Sullivan,"This is an incredibly oil-rich country, and eventually money and resources are not going to be a problem. The long-term goals we're pretty confidant Iraq can meet as long as it gets enough of a head start."
Jim Sullivan,There's a lot of value coming out this machine.
Jim Sullivan,The voracious demand for space demand continues to make Midtown the place to be.
Jim Sullivan,"We're thrilled for Jamie to have found a school that is a great fit for her both academically and athletically. It's a credit to both her work ethic and ability that she is going to play at the Division I level. Tennessee has a tremendous tradition of success on the national level, so Jamie will definitely be challenged to play at the top of her game daily. That can only make her an even better collegiate player."
Jim Sullivan,I hope to soon be in contact with the man who is searching for Noah's ark.
Jim Sullivan,"[Dancy] is a tremendously fast runner, but he's still working on his pacing and endurance,"
Jim Sullivan,Gaylord has a lot of returning players off a team that was solid last season. They're great competition.
Mark Sullivan,"They came right at us, ... We needed a rest, fortunately we set the precedence right off the bat."
Mark Sullivan,"To find a career to which you are adapted by nature, and then to work hard at it, is about as near to a formula for success and happiness as the world provides. One of the fortunate aspects of this formula is that, granted the right career has been found, the hard work takes care of itself. Then hard work is not hard work at all."
Mark Sullivan,"They are getting the funding we got four years ago. It was always the intention of the pentagon they would fund a primary supplier and a secondary. It's been part of the JSF program since the beginning,"
Mark Sullivan,"The more characteristic American hero in the earlier day, and the more beloved type at all times, was not the hustler but the whittler."
Mark Sullivan,"That?s being reviewed by the U.S. government, and we?re confident in that process, whatever the outcome may be."
Mark Sullivan,"People think that because they're away they can't keep up their regular fitness regimen and sometimes people give themselves permission not to do their regular regimen, ... Travel Fit & Healthy."
Mark Sullivan,"We're playing well right now, ... I was pleased. We finished our opportunities and I think as long as we control the center of the field, we will be all right."
Mark Sullivan,"The first game's like Christmas. You never know what your going to get. In Division III, teams are always different from year to year and it's hard to scout early in the season. We're trying to prepare for everything."
Mark Sullivan,"In other years, those proceeds have gone to a variety of sports programs. The seventh-grade boys gave us a lot of help during this tournament."
Mike Sullivan,I think it is terrific. I'm so happy for him because he has worked so hard to get himself back into a condition where he can compete at this level. That is a testament to the type of guy that he is. We are ecstatic that he is participating in our camp.
Mike Sullivan,"I think it's terrific. I'm so happy for him that he's worked so hard to get himself back into a condition to play and compete at this level. That, in and of itself, is a testament to the type of guy that he is. So we're ecstatic that's he's participating."
Mike Sullivan,I thought we controlled the play for a certain amount of time. We just weren't able to score any goals.
Mike Sullivan,"I thought he did pretty well to be thrown into the fire like that, and against Ottawa who is one of the hottest teams in the league. He's certainly a competitive guy and he battles every minute he's out there,"
Mike Sullivan,"We are obviously going through a tough time, but we are going in the right direction. We really competed down the stretch and fought our way back. I thought we deserved a better fate."
Mike Sullivan,"I thought he had a tremendous year [in Providence]. I thought he matured physically right in front of our eyes. He got better and better every game that he played. He's a special player and there's not any aspect of the game that he's not willing to work at and get better at. Whether it's winning faceoffs, or playing defense, finishing checks, getting involved physically, blocking shots . . . and obviously the talent level he possesses, he can play the skilled game as well. His game has evolved and I think he'll continue to do so. He's a young kid who is really coming into his own."
Mike Sullivan,"I think it's a credit to the players themselves. And I think (coach) Scott Gordon does a terrific job with the team in Providence. We play similar ways, so from a tactical standpoint there's not a lot of difference. I think all of those things kind of make the transition a little more seamless."
Mike Sullivan,Children are more susceptible to opening themselves up to crimes via the internet.
Mike Sullivan,He has made huge strides in a tremendous rookie season. He has taken advantage of our personnel changes and is a big piece of our nucleus going forward.
Mike Sullivan,"From my experience, when a team is faced with adversity, the best course of action is to simplify things. Our play away from the puck has to be a priority. We have a talented group of players here, but we have to make more of a commitment to team defense."
Pat Sullivan,"We have no way right now to determine how badly we've been hurt,"
Pat Sullivan,The key to the first half was their offensive rebounding and what hurt us all night was that they got all the effort points. We were just behind the play all night.
Pat Sullivan,"That was my biggest fear coming into the game, that we wouldn't be sharp offensively after the long layoff."
Pat Sullivan,"I have great admiration for IIT and their coaches. They don't get the type of players that the rest of the conference gets, but they came back to take the lead against us in the second half. There is no quit in those kids, and I admire them for that."
Scott Sullivan,"I wouldn't get confused on the lack of superstar names. That doesn't mean they lack in talent. It doesn't mean they lack in heart. When I look around, instead of being suspect, I think the pitching is plentiful. I've seen a lot of good arms in camp."
Scott Sullivan,"I worked at Sullivan's through high school. At least 10 of my cousins did, too. We would spend hours cleaning bottles in the basement, running bottles through shoots. I don't know if it was good times, but it was what we did."
Scott Sullivan,But it's about the safety of our members.
Scott Sullivan,"I knew it was wrong, but my intentions were not to hurt people."
Tom Sullivan,We saw great items come through that we knew we would not get full value for through the store.
Tom Sullivan,"It's kind of a sleeper proposal, and I think they kind of want it that way."
Tom Sullivan,"One of the complaints I used to hear is that the players (in recent years) were retreads. They talked about what it was like when Curt Schilling pitched here. Now, you're going to see players on the way up. It will be quality baseball."
Tom Sullivan,"The rules have changed. Internet merchants now have the ability to say, 'Hey, this person accepted the terms and conditions explicitly, and as a result, shouldn't be able to charge this back."
Shaukat Sultan,to beef up security and curtail activities of miscreants.
Shaukat Sultan,We had information about the presence of foreign militants. It was a sting operation and the target was knocked out.
Shaukat Sultan,"Our men returned fire after being attacked by the miscreants, and according to our information between 15 to 20 terrorists have been killed in the retaliatory fire."
Shaukat Sultan,"The blast was huge enough to kick up dust which the pilot probably misunderstood as rocket fire,"
Shaukat Sultan,"Fighting is still going on and we are facing quite a resistance from the other side,"
Shaukat Sultan,"Our fighting bunkers are completely intact because their construction is very robust,"
Shaukat Sultan,"It is a big example of survival,"
Shaukat Sultan,"The step has been taken to enhance security measures on the border before the Afghan elections,"
Shaukat Sultan,We are handling the worst disaster in Pakistan's history.
Shaukat Sultan,"We are handling the worst disaster in Pakistan's history,"
Shaukat Sultan,"It is the biggest-ever disaster in the history of Pakistan,"
Shaukat Sultan,"This is a disaster of enormous scale and we have to understand that,"
Shaukat Sultan,There is no danger to our nuclear installations and weapons from earthquakes. They are fully safe.
Shaukat Sultan,There is no question of Indian army crossing LoC to help rebuild bunkers. All our bunkers are safe and built to withstand artillery shells.
Shaukat Sultan,"Induction process of females in signals, electrical and mechanical engineering, inter services public relations, computer and legal branch of army would be completed by June 1."
Tipu Sultan,"We see export potentials of leather products to Indian market, but India's cumbersome rules may deter us."
Tipu Sultan,What we need is 10 per cent cash incentive for finished leather manufacturers and duty free import of shoe accessories.
Tipu Sultan,Footwear market of Thailand is too little and no exporter will go there to use the duty-free facility there.
Tipu Sultan,Footwear market of Thailand is too little and no exporter will go there to use the duty-free facility.

Donna Summer,I don't care if I'm beautiful; I don't care what I am on the outside. It isn't about the outside.
Donna Summer,God had to create disco music so I could be born and be successful.
Donna Summer,My life was changed in one breath from God.
Donna Summer,"I don't really try to predict what can and will happen with things. Sometimes you think something's gonna be a huge success, and it isn't. And sometimes you pay no attention to something whatsoever, and God just makes it into everything."
Donna Summer,When I'm not working I try to stay out of the public eye as much as possible.
Donna Summer,"Nobody wants you to stop, obviously because you're a moneymaking machine. But you have to make the decision and you have to move forward. So I took time off to have babies and do all that."
Donna Summer,It would be nice if you have a hit. But I don't think it's necessary to continue with my career at this point.
Donna Summer,"I'm ready to work and if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it's fine."
Donna Summer,"I haven't really been recording in the last several years. I haven't wanted to. And even though I had to deal with Sony and now I'm on Universal again, I will probably put out a new record soon."
Donna Summer,"But I like to know that someone is stronger than I am. I want to be able to know that if I get tired, somebody is there to hold up the fort. I like knowing that I can't pick a refrigerator alone. God did not make me strong enough to do that."
Pat Summerall,I didn't have any idea what I was gonna say...couldn't come up with the correct words... enough gratitude... enough to tell the Shelbys how I felt.
Pat Summerall,"Well, I know how the system works. I know that there's something called the MELD system, which is nationwide. There are zones as far as evaluation of need for liver transplants."
Pat Summerall,"There were a couple of things in the intervention that made me know I needed help. One was a letter from my daughter saying that she was ashamed she had the same last name as I did, which will shock you a little bit."
Pat Summerall,"So, I didn't get moved up because of celebrity status or anything like that. I got in line, and I passed the test. And they realized that I was sick enough, and as soon as the liver became available, I got one."
Pat Summerall,Seemed like everything I tried to do in broadcasting and as a player before that turned out successfully. I was succeeding. I got to the top of the heap in every facet of broadcasting.
Pat Summerall,"My MELD score was pretty high. And the worse you get on that scale, the sooner you get a transplant. It's based on how sick you are. And believe me, I was pretty sick."
Pat Summerall,"In football, there were drinks available everywhere you looked. On a golf tournament, you could find one free anywhere you wanted it. In tennis and NBA basketball, everybody had a hospitality suite, and so you could go there and load up if you wanted to."
Pat Summerall,"I've done a lot of Super Bowls and appeared in a lot of big, big events and places and the Masters and what have you, but there was nothing as intimidating as speaking with Billy Graham."
Pat Summerall,"I know I had been successful in football. I had been successful in broadcasting. I didn't think that anything could touch me. I thought, I can beat anything."
Pat Summerall,"But like Mrs. Ford, I think that the more people realize what a difficult and what an insidious disease it is, the sooner people will start to correct that situation."
Pat Summerall,"When someone saves your life and gives you life, there's gratitude, humility; there's a time you've been so blessed you realize you've been given another chance at life that maybe you did or didn't deserve."
Larry Summers,"I know the coaches that went (to Norfolk State) have good work ethic and they don't accept anything but perfection. They've had two weeks to prepare for this game, so we're looking for anything they can throw at us, trick plays and all."
Larry Summers,Hopefully we can talk the school board into taking that money and putting it into technology.
Larry Summers,The dramatic modernization of the Asian economies ranks alongside the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution as one of the most important developments in economic history.
Larry Summers,"Global capital markets pose the same kinds of problems that jet planes do. They are faster, more comfortable, and they get you where you are going better. But the crashes are much more spectacular."
Larry Summers,Start with the idea that you can't repeal the laws of economics. Even if they are inconvenient.
Larry Summers,It says something about this new global economy that USA Today now reports every morning on the day's events in Asian markets.
Larry Summers,"In this age of electronic money, investors are no longer seduced by a financial 'dance of a thousand veils.' Only hard and accurate information on reserves, current accounts, and monetary and fiscal conditions will keep capital from fleeing precipitously at the first sign of trouble."
Pat Summitt,"You're going to have a huge audience in Thompson-Boling (Arena), plus national television coverage. It's a big game, and yet a lot of people say, 'Is the rivalry still what it used to be?' I don't think it's going to be any different. Both teams are going to be excited to play."
Pat Summitt,"I think for the most part in our program, we've had a lot of success just through how we've gone about recruiting and making decisions not to recruit kids on the front end that we didn't think would be a good fit. But obviously, we've had our mistakes, too."
Pat Summitt,I don't know what we did wrong. You have to look at the strength of schedule. We're No. 1 and if I'm not mistaken Ohio State is No. 21. And their conference is No. 7. Those two things don't add up.
Pat Summitt,"Parker has been handling the ball and bringing it up the floor, running some point as well. Ideally we'd like her closer to the basket, but it's not like she has to stay on the perimeter."
Pat Summitt,It's just a matter of everyone stepping up and taking responsibility and ownership on the offensive end. We executed very well.
Pat Summitt,"She responded maybe even better than I had anticipated. I thought it was important for her to get some quality minutes and as things played out, I wanted to give her more. I had gone in thinking maybe 12 minutes, and she played 17 minutes."
Pat Summitt,"They are very familiar with our program and our philosophy, ... but when you have been in the game as long as I have and been on television as much as we have, I think everyone knows pretty much every move we make."
Pat Summitt,"Our philosophy has always been you better pack your defense and your board work on the road. Because those ugly nights and those poor shooting nights  you just have to grind games out. Today, we just had to grind it out."
Pat Summitt,I've talked to her about our team. (I talked to her) when I wasn't really happy with them and she's talked to me about her team and we probably figured we'd see each other in the end.
Pat Summitt,This team should not have lost back-to-back games. Kentucky was better tonight. This team has to understand that they just can't go out there and play. They have to execute a game plan and be mindful of one possession at a time on offense and defense.
Pat Summitt,"We know it's going to be a pretty hostile environment, but our team has been exposed to that. All the players that have played here understand that we go on the road."
Pat Summitt,"Obviously I'm very pleased with the intensity, the enthusiasm on the bench and everyone who got on the court. We played well together."
Pat Summitt,Management wanted to go into a different direction.
Pat Summitt,"The ladies had great energy today. The communication was key, and I could definitely see an improvement in their physical condition. They had an incredible off-season in the weight room."
Pat Summitt,First was our lack of commitment to making stops on the defensive end. I think they (UT players) had another lesson handed to them on defense.
Pat Summitt,"She gives our basketball team a lot of energy. She helps us improve our early offense, our transition, with her ability to push tempo. From that standpoint, it was good. I thought she tried to do a little too much (Tuesday) night. I think she?s still trying to get back in the groove."
Pat Summitt,There is no question that (Army is) very well-coached and Maggie has done a great job.
Pat Summitt,We're facing a new opponent and trying to learn as much as we can about Army at this time and get ready for March Madness.
Pat Summitt,I'm really proud of what this team has accomplished this year. They have faced tremendous adversity and come through it. They have great character and have been a great group to coach.
Pat Summitt,"She made playing basketball fun due to her ability to connect with her players. Personally, I am going to miss her tremendously and I know the game is going to miss her."
William Sumner,"All history is only one long story to this effect: men have struggled for power over their fellowmen in order that they might win the joys of earth at the expense of others, and might shift the burden of life from their own shoulders upon those of ot"
William Sumner,The men who start out with the notion that the world owes them a living generally find that the world pays its debt in the penitentiary or the poor house
William Sumner,"[I]t is taught that willing and voluntary service to others is the highest duty and glory in human life. The men of talent are constantly forced to serve the rest. They make the discoveries and inventions, order the battles, write the books, and produce the works of art. The benefit and enjoyment go to the whole. There are those who joyfully order their own lives so that they may serve the welfare of mankind."
William Sumner,"If you ever live in a country run by a committee, be on the committee."
William Sumner,What we prepare for is what we shall get.
William Sumner,"If I want to be free from any other man's dictation, I must understand that I can have no other man under my control."
William Sumner,"Men never cling to their dreams with such tenacity as at the moment when they are losing faith in them, and know it, but do not dare yet to confess it to themselves."
William Sumner,Civil liberty is the status of the man who is guaranteed by law and civil institutions the exclusive employment of all his own powers for his own welfare.
William Sumner,"We throw all our attention on the utterly idle question whether A has done as well as B, when the only question is whether A has done as well as he could."
William Sumner,"It is the tendency of the social burdens to crush out the middle class, and to force society into an organization of only two classes, one at each social extreme."
Mats Sundin,"We can't worry about what the end result is going to be on Monday, we have to make sure that we come out and work hard and just worry about the next shift we're on the ice. We can't look further ahead than that."
Mats Sundin,You are begging for trouble when you give up 3-on-2s and 2-on-1s to a speedy team like this.
Mats Sundin,You are begging for trouble when you give up three on two (breaks) and two on one (breaks) to a speedy team like this.
Mats Sundin,I think we made some progress tonight. If we can keep playing like we did tonight we can turn this thing around.
Mats Sundin,We're still alive. We have another game (Sunday) night and we'll have to bounce back. There's not much left to talk about when it comes to what we've got to do and what we're looking for and how we're going to do it.
Mats Sundin,We just have to get away from that - doing the mistakes that we're doing. We've got to simplify our game and get back on track.
Mats Sundin,"I don't mind (playing head-to-head). Usually, when you play the other team's top lines, there are more chances going the other way, too. That's fine with me."
Mats Sundin,There's bigger issues right now. That other stuff hasn't crossed my mind.
Mats Sundin,I believe in my heart that we have a good enough team to make the playoffs and a good enough team to beat Ottawa.
Mats Sundin,"I've been back and forth, traveling a lot, nothing too exciting. I played too much golf, I'm sick of that. . . . I missed playing hockey."
Mats Sundin,I thought we beat ourselves tonight. All five of their goals came when we had the puck and turned it over.
Mats Sundin,"As a team we are scoring some goals, but there's still a lot of work to do,"
Mats Sundin,Almost all five goals we had the puck and misplayed. I thought we beat ourselves tonight.
Mats Sundin,We're not generating enough chances to score goals but I couldn't tell you why.
Mats Sundin,"As a team, we are scoring some goals but we still have a lot of work to do. If we want to compete with Ottawa and the other top teams in our conference, we have to do better in our own end."
Mats Sundin,"It's tough, things aren't going our way. In important parts of the game we're giving up goals. We're not getting them where we should be. You can tell the whole group is tentative. We're making small mistakes out there. When things aren't going your way, every time we make a mistake we're paying the price."
Mats Sundin,"If we want to make the playoffs, we can't have too many more games like that."
Mats Sundin,We're doing the small things well and we're getting better every time out. I thought we played two good games this weekend and came away with three points.
Mats Sundin,It was a tough way to start a game. We put ourselves in a hole and it was tough to get out.
Mats Sundin,"I was a little worried before the game about how it was going to go, but it went better than I thought,"
Mats Sundin,You can see why they're doing well in Detroit. They're a force out there for us.
Mats Sundin,"I think they're on top of the game, they're on the cutting edge of technology in terms of our fitness."
Mats Sundin,"When I look with both my eyes it's not far from what it was before, ... My left vision isn't as good as my right eye but it's not where it's going to make a difference on the ice."
Mats Sundin,"There's no excuses. Whatever you're putting in to your system, you're responsible."
Mats Sundin,"They capitalized on the 5-on-3 and it gave them the energy back, ... We made some mental errors and took too many penalties."
Mats Sundin,"They capitalized on the five-on-three and it gave them the energy back, ... We made some mental errors and took too many penalties."
Mats Sundin,They capitalized on the 5-on-3 and it gave them the energy back. We made some mental errors and took too many penalties.
Mats Sundin,They capitalized on the five-on-three and it gave them the energy back. We made some mental errors and took too many penalties.
Mats Sundin,"We were ready to play, there's no doubt about that. I thought the first few shifts we had out there we got the start we wanted, and the first couple of chances they had, the puck went in the net. Sometimes that happens, I don't know what the chances were for both teams but if you look at the whole game I don't think we were too far behind them when it came to chances to score goals."
Mats Sundin,"It's not his fault. We can turn this thing around, there's no doubt about it. I believe in this team. We're facing adversity, but every team does that."
Mats Sundin,This is a two-week direction (the losing skid) and we still have a long season to go. I believe we have a good enough hockey team to make it to the playoffs and I believe we're going to make it.
Mats Sundin,I feel a lot better this week. I think [the healing process] is heading in the right direction.
Mats Sundin,"My vision is definitely better, I feel we're going in the right direction, but we'll find out more [today]."
Mats Sundin,"We have to look at what we can control, and we had a lot of chances at the net. ... We can't do any more than we have been, we just have to keep coming with this kind of effort and the wins will come."
Mats Sundin,"At times, we kind of dipped (team conditioning) after Christmas, so this should help us as players so that we don't have to struggle with something like that in the future."
Mats Sundin,It definitely deserves something. That shot goes into the history books.
Mats Sundin,That shot is going into the history books and it's fitting he scored it because he's probably been our best player through the whole tournament.
Mats Sundin,We have no one to blame but ourselves. It shouldn't have come down to this late in the season. It's our own fault.
Siti Supari,It's a testament of our seriousness in fighting bird flu. We do not want Indonesia to become the world's source of bird flu.
Siti Supari,"This goes to show the problem is not just about a lack of doctors or geographical location, ... It's also about ignorance. Some parents, even rich ones, don't want to bring their children to clinics to get immunized."
Siti Supari,We will carry out intensive rapid diagnosis of patients suspected of having the disease.
John Surma,"So we have no problem with imports. Our position is what it's always been, we're in favor of free trade as long as it's fair trade, whether it involves our NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) colleagues or any others around the world. So we're committed to maintaining full trade law enforcement."
John Surma,We benefited from a positive global economic market and there is a positive environment at least through mid-year. We intend to operate as near to full capacity as we can in the second quarter.
John Surma,"Typically in a developing economy, the demand for steel goes up exponentially."
Roberto Suro,"The extremely high (immigration) flows at the end of the past decade were not the norm, nor part of a long-term trend, but rather the peak of a momentary increase that lasted for only a few years."
Roberto Suro,"You've got a very large share of the population living not in stereotypical neighborhoods where all the signs are in Spanish. There are still a lot living in densely Hispanic neighborhoods, but there are more who are scattered all over the landscape."
Roberto Suro,"There are signs, on both sides, of a failure to engage."
Roberto Suro,The U.S. economy was obviously a very important factor in these flows.
Roberto Suro,"Much of their future lies there, ... The high school dropout rates are all going in the right direction and are improving. They have gotten better for the second generation."
Roberto Suro,"Contrary to what people might expect, the desire to immigrate is not restricted to the poor."
Roberto Suro,"The desire to migrate is not a phenomenon of the poor and poorly educated, ... The inclination to migrate is powerful in the middle class in Mexico, even those with college educations say they would go to the United States if they could."
Roberto Suro,desire to migrate is strong.
Roberto Suro,"There's a Hispanic middle class, no doubt, but it just doesn't spend as much as other groups. And Oscar De La Hoya is by no means alone, or even early."
Roberto Suro,The unknown here is the extent to which someone retains an ethnic identity that influences their choices of entertainment. It's a large enough population that marketers are spreading their bets.
Roberto Suro,"a beginning, middle and an end."
Donald Sutherland,"To them though, not to us, we were just a catalyst for their imagination."
Donald Sutherland,The only thing I feel passionate about is my wife.
Donald Sutherland,"Not too much, though there's a certain amount of rancour and bitterness when someone tries to fire you."
Donald Sutherland,"No, I'm not rich. I had a tax problem in this country, curiously enough, and my accountant said the British government was patently wrong in taxing me, and they were, but we couldn't persuade them and it cost me everything I had."
Donald Sutherland,"Joe Wright called me and I also had some trepidation along those lines but he said no, it would work. He had a very clear and specific idea of what he wanted to do."
Donald Sutherland,I would look a little silly playing Casanova now.
Donald Sutherland,I love grabbing my wife and going to a distant location to film.
Donald Sutherland,"I have never planned anything. I have been doing this job for over 50 years. I have been paid to work with some wonderful people and it has been a huge gift, to me."
Donald Sutherland,I have been able to play a lot of guys and they have kept me working.
Donald Sutherland,"I had no money at all back then. I was later paid $600 a week for The Dirty Dozen, which was lovely, after having no money for years."
Donald Sutherland,I don't think I have one iota of cynicism about acting.
Donald Sutherland,I am so glad my wife tolerates me. And we have three wonderful sons.
Donald Sutherland,"Everything was my fault. I was so dumb. But if I hadn't made the mistakes I made, I wouldn't have met the wonderful woman I've been married to for over 30 years, so I guess that makes the mistakes OK."
Donald Sutherland,"But no, I love acting, it's a wonderful job."
Donald Sutherland,"But even with no money you could still go to places like the Scotch Club and, you know, John Lennon might be sitting right over there, but I was certainly not a part of any of that circle. I was truly peripheral."
Donald Sutherland,"What the nation's built on is discussion, contradiction and growth, and at the moment you can't discuss anything. If you do start to discuss it, you get criticized. If people hate us, you have to find out why and try to solve that problem."
Donald Sutherland,"You have a little bit of talent, a certain amount of good fortune and a lot of hard work in pursuit of whatever truth you can find in it, and if you are really lucky, a terrific partner and I have that and those four things worked out for me."
Donald Sutherland,"I had a kind of meandering little career, and then I was given a chance to play one of the bottom six in The Dirty Dozen."
Kiefer Sutherland,I don't have to follow your orders. I don't work here anymore.
Kiefer Sutherland,"I turned to the only guy I could trust, Tony."
Kiefer Sutherland,"Carlos [ Bernard , Tony] is your guy. He had two police officers arrest Mia Kirshner [then playing Mandy] for allegedly smoking marijuana outside her dressing room. And as they went to take her away, Carlos got into a fight with the officers about [how they really should be] protecting the city."
Kiefer Sutherland,"It's been an honor working with you, Mr. President."
Kiefer Sutherland,"The graphics are the really freaky thing. I have two stepsons who are really good at the games, and they saw the likenesses. They had a gleam in their eyes, and I could see that the reason they liked it was because they could play to a point and then just stop, and I would get wasted. I think there's a certain amount of joy in, like, 'Let's watch him get shot again! Do it again!' You can make him really get riddled."
Kiefer Sutherland,"For me to have an opportunity to work with someone like that, it's a fantastic learning experience."
Kiefer Sutherland,"First, there was darkness, then came the Strangers,"
Kiefer Sutherland,"I think the show is working. I think the character is growing on many levels. I think one thing that we're all discovering is that every season has impacted another, and the character has grown, and the character is allowed to carry with him what he has suffered the year before."
Kiefer Sutherland,"Youth is an amazing thing: I think back on when we did The Lost Boys, and I didn't think I could do anything wrong."
Kiefer Sutherland,"When we shoot 24, there are so many things I have to worry about, from the script to technical things to my performance, that I don't have a second to be bored or take anything for granted. We produce 24 hours of film a season, which is like making 12 movies."
Kiefer Sutherland,"When I wasn't the flavor of the week or month or day, those were hard times."
Kiefer Sutherland,"When I saw Virginia Woolf, somewhere between the first and second acts, someone I had known as my mother became somebody else."
Kiefer Sutherland,"There's a confidence that comes from youth and not knowing better. But there comes a point, as an actor, when you do know better, and that is when the fear starts."
Kiefer Sutherland,"My parents not only did it for a living, but they were really good at it."
Kiefer Sutherland,I didn't realize that television has gone through immense changes and has become very progressive.
Kiefer Sutherland,"I did a play called Throne of Straw when I was 11, at the Odyssey Theatre in Los Angeles. It became really clear to me at that point that I enjoyed acting more than any other experience I was having."
Kiefer Sutherland,I couldn't see my father's films because they were restricted and we didn't have videos or DVDs back then.
Kiefer Sutherland,There are three things we need to do for a band. We need to make a great record; we need to get the record played; and we need to find an audience for the live shows.
Kiefer Sutherland,"The writers keep managing to turn the show in on itself, coming up with something that's well thought-out and miraculous."
Kiefer Sutherland,"There are two things that Jack Bauer never does. Show mercy, and go to the bathroom."
Kiefer Sutherland,"That'll be up to an audience when they start to feel that someone else should come in and do it. Personally, I'm hoping that's a long way off."
Brent Sutter,"I'm not always going to be the nicest guy in the world, but I do care very deeply about my players. As a coach, your job is to provide guidance. Sometimes that involves a pat on the back and sometimes that involves a kick in the behind."
Brent Sutter,"If you get too caught up in what the opposition is going to do, it really affects the way you play. We're not going to change as far as our philosophy and the way we need to play. We play a certain way and we're going to play that way. We'll make some adjustments, but we have to stick to our game plan and our identity and the way we need to play. It has gotten us this far ? we're not going to go a different route."
Brent Sutter,"It's an instinct, sometimes as a player when you get up a few goals you can get a little too fancy and get away from your game plan, but for the most part it was very brief tonight. We kept the puck going ahead tonight. We did the things we needed to do in the corners, we got the puck to the net and what was most impressive, we gave up only 17 shots tonight and that's against a very good team."
Brent Sutter,"He's played on two world junior teams already, ... I certainly would expect if Sidney Crosby was here at Christmas we would be bringing him on our hockey team."
Brent Sutter,"We all know (Malkin) is a very good player. Well, we believe we have 22 good players."
Eddie Sutton,I am humbled by the support I continue to receive and appreciate more than you will know the words of encouragement. This remains a difficult period. The surgery is the first step in addressing my physical pain and my problem with alcohol. I ask that you continue to pray for my recovery.
Eddie Sutton,I was convinced high school was the place for me.
Eddie Sutton,"I can think back when I was coaching high school,"
Eddie Sutton,"I know what has happened since Friday has caused a great deal of sorrow. I regret what has happened more than anyone will ever know. I sincerely apologize to my family, to my university, to my players past and present and the great student body and all of our great fans."
Eddie Sutton,"My back and hip situation is well-documented. Last Friday, the pain was so bad that I took a lot of pain pills. But that didn't seem to work, so I succumbed to temptation and went and bought a bottle. ... I have a problem with alcohol."
Eddie Sutton,"After Friday's events, I know it is best to go on medical leave the remainder of the season to address my future health."
Hal Sutton,"I don't have any regrets. I hate we got beat and I hate we got beat as badly as we got beat. My dad called me after it was over and said there weren't any four, five decisions I could have made that would have changed the outcome."
Hal Sutton,God shined on us today with this good weather. He knows this is a good cause.
Hal Sutton,"He's kind of like the Rock of Gibraltar. We depend on his consistency,"
Hal Sutton,"Put Mickelson and Toms out there. You know, they had the morning off. They rested. Knowing them and the competitors that they are, they are probably a little angry that they weren't out there in the morning."
Hal Sutton,"Oh, yeah, the guys played great today. I felt their energy. And when I made the telephone call and I didn't get the answering machine; I got them."
Hal Sutton,"Jim played - he had a great stretch in the middle of the round there, and Chad made that long putt on 16. Almost got that match. We ended up losing, but we almost won it, too."
Hal Sutton,"I thought we had energy out there. I thought the guys were, they played good, they were excited. We were almost dynamite out there today. Just a flicker away from being dynamite."
Hal Sutton,I hope we've got a lot of fairways and greens. We'll go from there.
Hal Sutton,"I had a really good feeling about that match. You know, they are good friends, and Chris had to feel really relaxed because of being out there with Tiger."
Hal Sutton,I feel good. I think everything went good.
Hal Sutton,I don't feel badly about that. There's a lot of energy on the golf course. The guys are playing great. I like the pairings in the afternoon. I'm going to take what we've got.
Hal Sutton,"I am excited about this. We've got half of our goal. I'd love to see us get a little bit more than half our goal and not be so deeply into this thing going into Sunday, but I feel good about everything."
Hal Sutton,Chad was in the right spot. He got a little aggressive with the third shot there. He probably didn't want that putt he had there for the par. And you don't want to put it back there where Casey and Sergio did because you have 20 feet of break there.
Hal Sutton,"That's the $64,000 question. And I would love to tell you there was an answer."
Hal Sutton,"We are reminded how short life really is, and how we are just passing through. So, all the people you haven't told you love lately, tell them, and live your days like you mean it."
Hal Sutton,We've got great players in America but we just got beat up this week.
David Suzuki,"It's time we stopped ignoring the environment, ... Let's not let another election go by without making this a high priority."
David Suzuki,Education has failed in a very serious way to convey the most important lesson science can teach: skepticism
David Suzuki,"They wouldn't run away when dogs were attacking them. They literally were hanging around the houses, and around the school, right in the downtown part of the community,"
David Suzuki,The voluntary approach to corporate social responsibility has failed in many cases.
David Suzuki,"Our personal consumer choices have ecological, social, and spiritual consequences. It is time to re-examine some of our deeply held notions that underlie our lifestyles."
David Suzuki,"The Canada we see in this report does not reflect the one we hold in our hearts, ... Canadians expect more and they expect better. We should be outraged that we are among the worst in the industrialized world."
David Suzuki,"The Canada we see in this report does not reflect the one we hold in our hearts,"
Shinichi Suzuki,I am mentally preparing myself for the five-year-old mind. I want to come down to their physical limitations and up to their sense of wonder and awe.

Shinichi Suzuki,Man is a child of his environment

Shunryu Suzuki,Preparing food is not just about yourself and others. It is about everything!
Shunryu Suzuki,"Without accepting the fact that everything changes, we cannot find perfect composure. But unfortunately, although it is true, it is difficult for us to accept it. Because we cannot accept the truth of transience, we suffer."
Carl-Henric Svanberg,We have come down a percentage point or so (in operating margins). That is a reflection of stronger competition.
Carl-Henric Svanberg,Our customers will benefit substantially.
Carl-Henric Svanberg,It doesn't mean that every single contract immediately has [no impact]. As we expand services we believe we will [also] hold up margins at that end.
Carl-Henric Svanberg,"If GSM was the beginning of a mass market for mobile telephony, then HSDPA marks the beginning of a mass market for high-speed mobile broadband."
Carl-Henric Svanberg,"If GSM was the beginning of a mass market for mobile telephony, HSDPA marks the beginning of a mass market for high-speed mobile broadband."
Carl-Henric Svanberg,"The little problem is that the authorities plan to give out three licenses for four operators. Since each operator does not know what its future is, they are probably also holding back on 2G demand,"
Hilary Swank,I was a trouble maker.
Hilary Swank,"I ended up dropping out of high school. I'm a high school dropout, which I'm not proud to say, ... I had some teachers that I still think of fondly and were amazing to me. But I had other teachers who said, 'You know what? This dream of yours is a hobby. When are you going to give it up?' I had teachers who I could tell didn't want to be there. And I just couldn't get inspired by someone who didn't want to be there."
Hilary Swank,"I think it's unfortunate that things are seen as winners or losers because in the end, it's the performance that matters."
Hilary Swank,"The truth is, after Boys Don't Cry, I realized how few and far between the great roles are. I am beyond thankful for finding Million Dollar Baby."
Hilary Swank,"Not to put down any of these other movies I've done (since 'Boys Don't Cry,') but they weren't meaty like this. I feel really lucky to have found two amazing roles before I hit 30."
Lynn Swann,"I spent 29 years at ABC Sports. Ed Rendell has spent the last three years as governor, and he wants to be a broadcaster. Let's give Ed Rendell what he wants."
Lynn Swann,"I think certainly he's concerned that he's not going to get the endorsement, but we understood what the rules were from the beginning and we ought to stick to the rules."
Lynn Swann,It's a great opportunity for me and hopefully a great opportunity for the state of Pennsylvania to make some changes.
Lynn Swann,"We do not want to lose the Penguins. Mario Lemieux has worked hard to keep the team in Pittsburgh, and we want to try do what it necessary to make sure that happens."
Lynn Swann,God knows Ed Rendell can't pay for everything he promised. We're going to have to make some tough decisions.
Lynn Swann,Coach Noll is not a great one for speeches. He's not the rah-rah type trying to fire us up in the locker room. He gets us ready to play and gives us a game plan that we've grown to believe is going to work. Usually it does.
Lynn Swann,I haven't cried this much since I was inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Lynn Swann,"I'm not doing this because I want to be famous and not because I want any power. In this country, the power is always with the people; the people we govern on borrowed time. I want to serve. My parents taught me to give back to the community."
Lynn Swann,Bill's competition for this nomination has contributed a great deal to the debate about making the Commonwealth a better place for all Pennsylvanians.
Lynn Swann,It is important this campaign be waged on a higher level of dignity and character. We will continue to move forward with our positive message for Pennsylvania.
Lynn Swann,"It's the beginning, we hope, of a new dynasty for the Pittsburgh Steelers."

Lynn Swann,"We talk about freedoms for African-Americans but unless you have more than one option politically, how free are you?"
Lynn Swann,"Very often we see coaches who have not been successful being recycled, instead of looking to a new face or a new name who has demonstrated the ability to handle the job."
Lynn Swann,Professional sports is a business.
Lynn Swann,"Players today are concerned about the money, but the large dollars only go to those players who are the best."
Lynn Swann,"Now, I'm not here because I was that good. I'm here because of the people around me made me that good."
Lynn Swann,"If a player demonstrated that he is the best, and a team decides, even so, we don't want to pay him, as in any other business, he should be able to play elsewhere."
Lynn Swann,I was not a very good football player when I started out.
Lynn Swann,"I took several years of dance lessons that included ballet, tap and jazz. They helped a great deal with body control, balance, a sense of rhythm, and timing."
Lynn Swann,I think that most minorities have experienced some form of racial abuse.
Lynn Swann,I feel like there should be more black head coaches.
Lynn Swann,"I enjoy playing the game. It's hard for me to just watch it, even while broadcasting."
Lynn Swann,And historically the owners have used loyalty to a team or a city to hold players as opposed to always paying their worth.
Lynn Swann,"Sports and entertainment have always been windows of opportunity for African Americans, when other doors were closed."
Lynn Swann,"Some people play very, very well just so they won't get embarrassed."
Steve Swanson,This latest victory once again confirms what every objective observer knows. Canadian lumber is heavily and unfairly subsidized and dumped into the U.S. market.
Steve Swanson,This new determination should put to rest any questions about whether duties are justified in this case.
Steve Swanson,She's making better decisions on the field. I think she's been doing a great job on the defensive side of things. I'm excited to see her progress.
Steve Swanson,The Constitution does not permit these panels to be the final arbiter of whether U.S. law provides for relief from unfair subsidies and dumping for U.S. producers and workers.
Steve Swanson,Timber values across Canada on average are 70 percent less than the comparable values in the free market economy that exists in the United States.
Steve Swanson,"The United States has the most efficient sawmills in North America but we cannot, and should not, be expected to compete with companies that are getting up to a 75 percent discount on the single largest cost component in producing lumber."
Steve Swanson,"Until Canada ends its unfair practices, the U.S. lumber industry will never stop insisting that action be taken under U.S. trade laws to fully offset the subsidies and dumping."
Mark Swartzberg,"I think it's worth noting, but our initial take is that it's more about fine tuning than about a major change in opinion. He's known as a long-term value investor."
Mark Swartzberg,Our upgrade is prompted by an assessment of free cash flow power that concludes the shares are below fair value. We expect the company to consistently meet or beat consensus EPS estimates in 2006.
Mark Swartzberg,"I think we see the power of some of the decisions they've made to be a total liquid-refreshment company,"
Mark Swartzberg,The company missed by a lot.
Mark Swartzberg,We are beginning to see early signs of an execution-focused turnaround that is working.
Keith Sweat,"Everything I was feeling, all the hurt and the pain and the emotion I was going through, I put into my music."

Keith Sweat,"My strategy has always been to give people just enough of me, then pull back. That way, they'll want more."

Emanuel Swedenborg,"What is true is true, and what is false is false..."
Emanuel Swedenborg,"Kindness is an inner desire that makes us want to do good things even if we do not get anything in return. It is the joy of our life to do them. When we do good things from this inner desire, there is kindness in everything we think, say, want and do."
Emanuel Swedenborg,True charity is the desire to be useful to others without thought of recompense
Emanuel Swedenborg,"To will and not to do when there is opportunity is in reality not to will; and to love what is good and not to do it, when it is possible, is in reality not to love it"
Jim Sweeney,Tony is our go-to guy. He's a very physical player who makes our running game meaningful. It's a big difference in our success when he is pounding hard inside.
Jim Sweeney,"We're extremely glad to get the win, ... but we're still making too many mistakes. We have a lot of critical work ahead."
Jim Sweeney,"We're extremely glad to get the win, ... but we're still making too many mistakes."
Jim Sweeney,That is huge. We're not in any way in the risky situation we were in before the crisis.
Julia Sweeney,"You had to get out of them occasionally, those Illinois towns with funny names: Paris. Oblong. Normal. Once, when the Dow Jones hit 200 points, the paper's banner headline read: 'Normal Man Marries Oblong Woman.'"
Julia Sweeney,I'm not a standup. I don't really have jokes. I don't have 10 minutes. It took a while for me to realize this.
Julia Sweeney,"I was on stage and I was like I will pay someone to do my time, not only will I expect NOT to be paid, but I will pay someone if I can run off stage right now. It was so bad."
Julia Sweeney,"I used to think no one should go into show biz, but now I feel differently. I now feel like it's a great career. If you can do it and make money at it and still not be so famous that you can have a normal life - then I think it's a great career."
Julia Sweeney,I like going back and writing fiction.
Julia Sweeney,I have lots of energy.
Julia Sweeney,"I get mad at people who talk about traumatic job interviews, about going on one and getting rejected. I get rejected all the time and not only do I get rejected, but people have no problem being really specific about why I was rejected."
Mike Sweeney,That was probably the most touching moment of silence I've stood through.

Charles Swindoll,"When I think of vision, I have in mind the ability to see above and beyond the majority."
Charles Swindoll,"I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let's face it, friends make life a lot more fun."
Charles Swindoll,"The secret of living a life of excellence is merely a matter of thinking thoughts of excellence. Really, it's a matter of programming our minds with the kind of information that will set us free."
Charles Swindoll,"Courage is not limited to the battlefield or the Indianapolis 500 or bravely catching a thief in your house. The real tests of courage are much quieter. They are the inner tests, like remaining faithful when nobody's looking, like enduring pain when the room is empty, like standing alone when you're misunderstood."
Charles Swindoll,The swift wind of compromise is a lot more devastating than the sudden jolt of misfortune.
Charles Swindoll,Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.
Charles Swindoll,"The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day."
Charles Swindoll,"The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes."
Charles Swindoll,Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it.
Charles Swindoll,"I believe the single most significant decision I can make on a day-to-day basis is my choice of attitude. It is more important than my past, my education, my bankroll, my successes or failures, fame or pain, what other people think of me or say about me, my circumstances, or my position. Attitude keeps me going or cripples my progress. It alone fuels my fire or assaults my hope. When my attitudes are right, there is no barrier too high, no valley too deep, no dream too extreme, no challenge too great for me."
Charles Swindoll,"We cannot change our past. We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way. We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude."
Charles Swindoll,"When I think of vision, I have in mind the ability to see above and beyond the majority"
Tilda Swinton,Faith is in the eye of the beholder.
Tilda Swinton,What he's done is recognise the cinematic nature of the book. It's beautifully realised - it's a beat film.
Tilda Swinton,"So we had this moment with the fly, and we all thought: 'Well, you can't hope to direct a fly. If it walks around a bit, that will be enough.'"
Tilda Swinton,"She's not a talker, or an intellectual, and she's a woman at a certain stage of her life who's already made a certain amount of choices."
Tilda Swinton,"It's pretty much the best original screenplay I've ever read, for a start. Then there's the team - they're a fantastic group of people."
Tilda Swinton,"It was an amazing performer. Very temperamental, it spent a lot of time in its trailer."
Tilda Swinton,It may be unfair of me but I do feel I know it.
Tilda Swinton,"I've been on the other side of the table many times, trying to get people to be sympathetic to projects, and I've been the victim of that kind of intense kindness masking extreme stupidity."
Tilda Swinton,I wasn't around when Nic was playing Donald. I was around with Charlie.
Tilda Swinton,I knew Spike Jonze would do something really interesting with it.
Tilda Swinton,"I felt clearly that the atmosphere of the film is about loneliness, and existentialist loneliness - in all the characters, including my own."
Tilda Swinton,I always think of the word 'abandonment' when I think of the character.
Tilda Swinton,Nic's Charlie is something very particular. You can't really put them together. It's a phantasm.
Nick Swisher,"I'm being a lot more consistent, trying to make every swing look the same. I'm doing what the situation calls for and trying not to do too much."
Nick Swisher,You can't really look at what other teams are doing. The rest of the season's in our hands.
Nick Swisher,"It's gonna be awesome to see him out there. He's just looked incredible in batting practice, so it's gonna be fun to see him take that out onto the field."
Nick Swisher,You tip your hat. That was an unbelievable pitch. All I can say is it wasn't our night.
Nick Swisher,"Last year, I was horrible with the bases loaded. I was like, 'Oh, man, oh, man,' I'd get jittery. Now, I'm not the guy who's in trouble, it's the guy on the mound who's in trouble."
Nick Swisher,"First one, man, but it's hard to enjoy it when you lose the game. It got us back in the game and I thought there was some momentum shift. I know I was excited."
Nick Swisher,Just call me the Glove Man.
Nick Swisher,I don't think I saw it land.
Nick Swisher,"I don't know if his leg was hurt or not, ... All of a sudden, we were like, 'What's going on here?' But that's just typical A's baseball, you know?"
Nick Swisher,"That was really neat, ... I never imagined that it would end up that way when the game started."
Nick Swisher,"I think it's going to be awesome. I don't think there's any other way to put it. Emotions will be running high. All the guys in this clubhouse know what we have, and other people are starting to pay attention, so we'll just have to go out and prove it."
Nick Swisher,"The way things have been going, to pull off a win like this gives us momentum and confidence. The way it happened was cool."
Nick Swisher,"Let's get those left-field bleacher boys ready to go. I had a great time in right last year, but left field is where it's always been."
Nick Swisher,"If you didn't love that game, you don't love baseball,"
Nick Swisher,All you have to do is look at the back of his baseball card and know he'll be all right.
Nick Swisher,It's disappointing. We've been playing good baseball.
Nick Swisher,It's been like that all spring. It's just that balls decided to hang up there. It's hard to catch it when you can't see it. But that's how it's going to be in Oakland in the afternoon anyway.
Barry Switzer,"Lovely? Well, thank you. That's kind of nice of you to say."
Barry Switzer,"In pro football you're a number. If you don't play well, you're gone and no one cares. But in college, coaches recruit young men and ask them to become a part of their family and help you become a productive citizen for the next 30, 40, 50 years of your life. Your coaches help you develop into something you can be proud of and they are there for life."
Barry Switzer,"It was a horrible, terrible, atrocious, offensive football game."
Barry Switzer,It was like a heart transplant. We tried to implant college in him but his head rejected it.
Barry Switzer,Some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple.
Sheryl Swoopes,"I think there's always been great talent in the WNBA, ... I think there are so many players this year that had incredible seasons and fortunately, or unfortunately, there's only one MVP."
Sheryl Swoopes,"My purpose for doing it has nothing to do with throwing it in anybody's face,"
Sheryl Swoopes,"Every practice and every game that we have, Tina is getting better and better and better,"
Sheryl Swoopes,"If I feel anywhere close to the way I felt this year, health-wise, I definitely know I'll be back next year and maybe another 10, ... I got the hunger back for it. I found the fun in it again."
Sheryl Swoopes,"She is still one of our prominent players, and she's a great player. We would like Sheryl to be happy."
Sheryl Swoopes,"I'm tired of having to hide my feelings about the person I care about. About the person I love. Male athletes of my caliber probably feel like they have a lot more to lose than gain (by coming out). I don't agree with that. To me, the most important thing is happiness."
Sheryl Swoopes,"I'm at a place in my life right now where I'm very happy, very content. I'm finally OK with the idea of who I love, who I want to be with."
Sheryl Swoopes,"No matter how far life pushes you down, no matter how much you hurt, you can always bounce back."
Sheryl Swoopes,"We've got to try to take advantage of what their weaknesses are, and one of those is not having the experience we have."
Herbert Swope,"I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure-which is: Try to please everybody"
Herbert Swope,"I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure-which is:  Try to please everybody"
Herbert Swope,"The first duty of a newspaper is to be accurate. If it be accurate, it follows that it is fair."
Wanda Sykes,"There is a double standard out there. Comedy is a male business; it's not ladylike what we're doing. But at the end of the day, if it's funny, it's funny, and funny tends to quiet the criticisms."
Wanda Sykes,What drives the creative person is that we see it all.
Wanda Sykes,"Usually, there's nothing being thrown toward the stage or at me. Then I feel pretty good about it."
Wanda Sykes,Then you had people who wanted to get into comedy just to get a TV deal.
Wanda Sykes,"Some government workers are dedicated and work hard, but most of them are just waiting to retire."
Wanda Sykes,Men don't hear women.
Wanda Sykes,It's easier to rip somebody to shreds while you're making them laugh.
Wanda Sykes,It wasn't until I became more confident with myself and I put myself forward instead of the jokes; at first it was put the jokes out there and I'm just behind the jokes.
Wanda Sykes,"It seems like when I first started, people got into comedy because they wanted to be good comedians."
Wanda Sykes,"In '87, I used to do this awful, awful James Brown impression."
Wanda Sykes,"If you're passionate about your work, it makes the people around you want to be involved too."
Wanda Sykes,"If you feel like there's something out there that you're supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it."
Wanda Sykes,"If something stinks, I say it stinks. But I try to massage it a little and not be as cutting, come behind it with a joke: Hey, I cut you deep, but now let me put a couple of stitches in you."
Wanda Sykes,I'm really funny now.
Wanda Sykes,I'm here today because I refused to be unhappy. I took a chance.
Wanda Sykes,I'm here today because I hated everything else.
Wanda Sykes,I'm a big Cosby fan. I respect the man.
Wanda Sykes,"I work hard. The staff and crew see how much energy I put into this project, and it makes them step up."
Wanda Sykes,"I was really gifted at being able to construct a joke, but it's like they weren't even memorable, my first jokes, because they were so about nothing."
Wanda Sykes,"I think it's because my comedy is in your face, and it comes from a place that's real."
Wanda Sykes,"I noticed recently, in the last few shows I did, that I'm starting to get people - not a large group, but quite a few people - who come to see me because they love Curb Your Enthusiasm."
Wanda Sykes,"I love Costas. He's knows too much, but he's a good guy."
Wanda Sykes,"I like doing a bunch of different things, being all over the place."
Wanda Sykes,"I have a funny family, but none of them are remotely in show business."
Wanda Sykes,"I guess because of my act, people think that I say things they want to say, and that they can just come up and say anything to me."
Wanda Sykes,"I don't know if it's a woman's tone of voice or training. Maybe guys are like, When I go home, I have to hear it. Right now I'm at work."
Wanda Sykes,I always want to go back and do stand-up; I like the freedom.
Wanda Sykes,"Don't bother me while I'm eating, or when I'm coming out of the crackhouse or something. Just let me get going."
Wanda Sykes,"But sometimes the women writers will pitch something and I'll hear it, but the men will keep talking."
Wanda Sykes,"But I understand that relationship; I understand how the mother-in-law, daughter-in-law relationship has so many conflicts because it's so forced."
Wanda Sykes,"But I think funny and talent will always win out; I mean, of course there are hurdles, but I think if you're funny you will get over all of that."
Wanda Sykes,"Back then, I was doing more of my impression of what a comic is supposed to do."
Wanda Sykes,And then also I think it's harder for women because comedy is so opposite of being ladylike.
Wanda Sykes,"Also, Def Jam came along, and everybody was doing it without really practicing or trying to be better comics, just trying to get on TV."
Wanda Sykes,"Actually, I majored in marketing and I have a bachelor of science."
Wanda Sykes,A woman would pitch a joke. Nothing. Then a guy would pitch it and everybody would laugh.
Arthur Sylvester,I think the inherent right of the Government to lie to save itself when facing a nuclear disaster is basic
Arthur Sylvester,I think the inherent right of the Government to lie to save itself when facing a nuclear disaster is basic.
Arthur Sylvester,Material farmed out for comments to interested agencies and people meant they would be in touch later.

John Millington Synge,"The freedom of the sand seemed to give a stronger spirit of revolt, and some of the animals were only caught after a dangerous struggle."
John Millington Synge,"The absence of the heavy boot of Europe has preserved to these people the agile walk of the wild animal, while the general simplicity of their lives has given them many other points of physical perfection."
John Millington Synge,"Suppression, if it is deserved, will come rapidly enough from the same causes that suppress the unworthy members of a man's family."
John Millington Synge,It gave me a moment of exquisite satisfaction to find myself moving away from civilisation in this rude canvas canoe of a model that has served primitive races since men first went to sea.
John Millington Synge,"In this cry of pain the inner consciousness of the people seems to lay itself bare for an instant, and to reveal the mood of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and seas."
John Millington Synge,In a good play every speech should be as fully flavoured as a nut or apple.
John Millington Synge,"Foreign languages are another favourite topic, and as these men are bilingual they have a fair notion of what it means to speak and think in many different idioms."
John Millington Synge,"Every article on these islands has an almost personal character, which gives this simple life, where all art is unknown, something of the artistic beauty of medieval life."
John Millington Synge,"At first I threw my weight upon my heels, as one does naturally in a boot, and was a good deal bruised, but after a few hours I learned the natural walk of man, and could follow my guide in any portion of the island."
John Millington Synge,"A week of sweeping fogs has passed over and given me a strange sense of exile and desolation. I walk round the island nearly every day, yet I can see nothing anywhere but a mass of wet rock, a strip of surf, and then a tumult of waves."
John Millington Synge,"A translation is no translation, he said, unless it will give you the music of a poem along with the words of it."
John Millington Synge,"A man who is not afraid of the sea will soon be drowned, he said, for he will be going out on a day he shouldn't. But we do be afraid of the sea, and we do only be drownded now and again."
John Millington Synge,"A low line of shore was visible at first on the right between the movement of the waves and fog, but when we came further it was lost sight of, and nothing could be seen but the mist curling in the rigging, and a small circle of foam."
