It's already great, but this ability to have digital and entertainment content interfacing with the PC will give it a burst of adrenaline. The second thing is that the category you [developers in the audience] can develop for can be expanded to the areas of digital televisions, digital recorders, set top boxes."
Norm Macdonald,"Scientists believe they may have discovered a primitive form of life on Jupiter's moon Europa. That primitive form of life? You guessed it, Frank Stallone."

Norm Macdonald,I would love to stay at SNL forever. But you can't stay in the same place. People think you're a loser.

Seth MacFarlane,"When you are in a room and your job is to write jokes 10 hours a day, your mind starts going to strange places."

Pete Mackanin,"You don't win one-run games, the other team loses them. And we lost this one."
Pete Mackanin,"I'm looking at their lineup card, and they've got a football team. I'm looking at mine, and I've got three guys on the bench due to attrition."
Pete Mackanin,"That's a lot of pitches in five innings. He's fighting to get on track. Sometimes you just have to go out there and forget about the corners. He's got that kind of stuff where if he just keeps the ball down in the zone, he'll be OK."
Pete Mackanin,"I thought we had everything under control. But that error just killed us. We've had trouble in the sixth and seventh innings all season, and that certainly was the case tonight."
Pete Mackanin,"I think Latin America is more beneficial than the fall league. There's a lot more pressure on you to perform. The conditions aren't the greatest, and it does toughen your skin a bit."

Peter MacKay,It's not as if our party has a leadership campaign underway.
Peter MacKay,"If the United States leads a multinational force into Iraq without United Nations backing, Canada should fight beside its neighbour. We've gone from being a middle power to a muddle power on this one."
Peter MacKay,"What Canada has to do is to have a government connected to the priorities of the people of which it is elected to serve. Those priorities include ensuring medicare is sustainable, support for the military, and tax and justice systems that work."
Peter MacKay,There needs to be a balance between privacy rights and security issues. The government wants more ability to cover up its own activities but expand their ability to intrude into the lives of Canadians. It is perverse logic and a double standard.
Shirley MacLaine,"This isn't about female relationship really. It is about familial relationship in which there are real problems: a suicide, and a hidden grandmother. So that's not really exploring female relationships. It's about, 'Why did my son-in-law do that?' And the girls' lives are out of control and (my character helps) bring their lives together with some kind of stability."
Shirley MacLaine,"I was fearful of casting Shirley because of her power as an actress and how that would mesh with a character who is literally shut down. But the fact is, Shirley is an actor and a working actor. She was excited by the challenge."
Shirley MacLaine,Dwelling on the negative simply contributes to its power
Shirley MacLaine,The person who knows how to laugh at himself will never cease to be amused.
Shirley MacLaine,"To prove it, I'm going to kiss your [bleep] - literally."
Shirley MacLaine,I hoped that the trip would be the best of all journeys: a journey into ourselves
Shirley MacLaine,"He's very happily married, thank goodness, and we are friends."
Shirley MacLaine,"People come in here and say, 'Why can't we get Jamaican food where we live in Ohio or California?'  ... I'd like to make that happen. Even in Paris and Tokyo."
Shirley MacLaine,"I know they are important movie people, ... but here they were at my kitchen table waiting for food they had just discovered."
Shirley MacLaine,"I've never cared whether a picture makes money or not. Now I care, because it's all about whether they'll finance the next one. And we've got to start making better pictures in Hollywood."
Shirley MacLaine,The more I traveled the more I realized that fear makes strangers of people who should be friends.
Shirley MacLaine,I don't need anyone to rectify my existence. The most profound relationship we will ever have is the one with ourselves.
Shirley MacLaine,"It's exciting for a character in the movie to say he knows all the best places to eat and this is a good one,"
Shirley MacLaine,I loved the examination of old money in Pasadena (California) and I loved that this woman (Jennifer Aniston's character) from a background that was sculpted in Pasadena has been in New York she is about to get married she comes back looks at what she came from and is so appalled and astonished and I am the grandmother who is the only one she can talk to and the only one in Pasadena who is basically talking the truth.
Shirley MacLaine,"(At a certain age) if you don't know who you are, there is a serious problem, as we can see by some of our leaders,"
Shirley MacLaine,"It's useless to hold a person to anything he says while he's in love, drunk, or running for office."
Shirley MacLaine,Fear makes strangers of people who would be friends.
Mary MacLane,"One kind of man I impatiently scorn is the kind that looks bored if I mention Ibsen or ceramics or Aztec civilization but is interested instantly, alertly, if I mention my garters"
Mary MacLane,Are there many things in this cool-hearted world so utterly exquisiteas the pure love of one woman for another?
Mary MacLane,"The book, you understand, was not written for publication. It was the portrayal of my emotions, the analysis of my own soul life during three months of my nineteenth year. I wrote then all the time, just as I do now, but, though the book is in diary form, it is not a diary."
Mary MacLane,"You may think me crude, and probably I am crude, but I am not so crude as I was, for I am clever enough to see that the girl of nineteen who thought herself a genius was only an unusual girl writing her heart out."
Mary MacLane,When I wrote my book I wanted to love someone. I wanted to be in love. Now I know that I shall never be in love - and I no longer wish to be.
Mary MacLane,"When I was three years old I was taken with my family to a little town in Western Minnesota, where I lived a more or less vapid and ordinary life until I was ten."
Mary MacLane,"Well, if I am not vulgar, neither is my book. I wrote myself. Suggestiveness is always vulgar. But truth never. My book is not even remotely suggestive. I call things by their names. That is all."
Mary MacLane,There is really no right and wrong. I recognize no right and wrong.
Mary MacLane,The world is like a little marsh filled with mint and white hawthorn.
Mary MacLane,The only joy I had was writing what was. That book was. It no longer amuses me to be all the things I was when I wrote that. But it is my story as I was then.
Mary MacLane,"One must always say things that aim to interest, because in the world one must after all pay for one's keep."
Mary MacLane,Of poets I put Virgil first - he was greatest.
Mary MacLane,"My intention to lecture is as vague as my intention is to go on the stage. I will never consider an offer to lecture, not because I despise the vocation, but because I have no desire to appear on the public rostrum."
Mary MacLane,"Let me but make a beginning, let me but strike the world in a vulnerable spot, and I can take it by storm."
Mary MacLane,"Just why I sent it to the publishers would be hard to say, but when I had finished it I felt that it was literature, because it is real and because it was well written. And I know that the world wants such things."
Mary MacLane,It is with pain that I read of the dire effects of my book upon the minds of young girls.
Mary MacLane,I've never made plans for more than a day ahead.
Mary MacLane,I would rather be a fairly happy wife and mother.
Mary MacLane,"I was born to be alone, and I always shall be; but now I want to be."
Mary MacLane,"I want to write such things as compel the admiring acclamation of the world at large, such things as are written but once in years, things subtle but distinctly different from the books written every day."
Mary MacLane,I want to live quietly.
Mary MacLane,I want fame more than I can tell. But more than I want fame I want happiness.
Mary MacLane,"I read of the Kalamazoo girl who killed herself after reading the book. I am not at all surprised. She lived in Kalamazoo, for one thing, and then she read the book."
Mary MacLane,"I never give my real self. I have a hundred sides, and I turn first one way and then the other. I am playing a deep game. I have a number of strong cards up my sleeve. I have never been myself, excepting to two friends."
Mary MacLane,I love devils.
Mary MacLane,I have never read a line of Walt Whitman.
Mary MacLane,"I do not sing nor play, but I adore music, particularly Chopin. I like him because I cannot understand him."
Mary MacLane,I do not see any beauty in self-restraint.
Mary MacLane,"I am a genius. Then it amused me to keep saying so, but now it does not. I expected to be happy sometime. Now I know I shall never be."
Mary MacLane,"Genius of a kind has always been with me; an empty heart that has taken on a certain wooden quality; an excellent, strong woman's body and a pitiably starved soul."
Mary MacLane,"Fame is indeed beautiful and benign and gentle and satisfying, but happiness is something at once tender and brilliant beyond all things."
Ron Maclean,He's called a self-promoter for being a guy who earns his pay.
Ron Maclean,"Sorry Janet, it struck me as funny."
Ron Maclean,There's no other way to paint this. It killed Canada.
Ron Maclean,Hockey Day in Canada has become an unofficial holiday for Canadian hockey fans everywhere. It is important that we take one day to gather our friends and family together to pay tribute to our wonderful game.
Norman Macleod,Writing a children's book means you cannot spin out long narratives or have complex character development.
Norman Macleod,Palaeontologists use fiction all the time.
Norman Macleod,As adults feign disinterest in science - children can grab hold of it to distinguish themselves.
Norman Macleod,"Courage brother, do not stumble, though thy path be dark as night: There is a star to guide the humble, Trust in God, and do the right. Let the road be dark and dreary and its end far out of sight. Face it bravely, strong or weary. Trust in God, and do the right."
Norman Macleod,"Courage, brother! do not stumble,Though thy path be dark as night."
Edward MacMahon,"Your honor ... he was given a slide show. In August of 2001, Tenet was given a presentation called 'Islamic Extremist' or 'Islamic Fundamentalist Learns to Fly."
Edward MacMahon,"Your honor ... he was given a slide show,"
Edward MacMahon,I won't discuss it under any circumstances.
Patrick Macnee,"They call it The New Avengers but it's really the old Avengers with new people except for me, looking rather fat and rather old."
Patrick Macnee,Television has some lovely aspects to it - and some ghastly aspects - but the theater itself was a wonderful invention.
Patrick Macnee,"No, I was working in Canada. In fact, the man who asked me to be in The Avengers, I told him, what do I need to be in that, I'm a producer now."
Patrick Macnee,"It doesn't work that way, you know, because most parts that you think you'd do well, most other people don't. So they offer you something - The Avengers is a good example... I fitted into that because I came from that sort of background. It's not even acting."
Patrick Macnee,"We were the first people in popular television to make the woman an equal partner with the man. You won't believe that, but I promise you it's true."
Patrick Macnee,"These things don't just come, arrive and settle like a bird picking up a few bits of crumbs. They develop. I think the best word for these things is develop. They develop because of the human beings who just happen to be there at the time."
Patrick Macnee,"The radio even weren't allowed to say there was a Holocaust and people were being killed right, left and center in these terrible camps."
Patrick Macnee,"The only danger about websites, you know, is people who remember something you did or said thirty or forty years ago, and bring it up against you, so you're going for a job and you don't get it."
Patrick Macnee,"So I find the fascination, the love, the incredible skill and everything to do with acting, writing plays, and doing them, just darling. Lovely. I love actors."
Patrick Macnee,"It was male chauvinism, as you must realize, in the 1960s, particularly in the entertainment business, which was pretty repulsive."
Patrick Macnee,"I went to acting school, but only for nine months. If you're an actor, you know, don't really need to learn how to do it."
Patrick Macnee,"I was producing a series about Sir Winston Churchill, about which I was extremely proud, and earning a lot of money as a producer."
Patrick Macnee,I was absolutely delighted that those shows have been preserved.
Patrick Macnee,"I mean, everyone says Citizen Kane. It isn't that great, anyway. And Orson Welles I knew well, of course. He made other incredible films that no one would let him make, which were much better than Citizen Kane, really."
Patrick Macnee,"I like most of the Humphrey Bogart movies because they had to act then, and they acted very well. Edward G. Robinson is probably the best actor I've ever seen on the movies."
Patrick Macnee,"But I did an awful lot of work in Hollywood, and in New York for that matter."
Patrick Macnee,"And there was a very famous man called Michael Powell, who probably is the greatest director all round, except possibly a couple of men."
Patrick Macnee,"And that's what happened to that show. It started ordinary, it started really rather bad. As I said, there was a review that said, really, we think the commercials are better than the show. And then it gradually developed."
Patrick Macnee,"Accomplishment is such a patronizing, dangerous word, isn't it? I haven't really accomplished anything. The most accomplished thing I've done is to have lived this long - 81."
Agnes Macphail,"When I first came to the House of Commons and walked out into the lobby, men sprang to their feet. I asked them to sit down since I'd come to walk around. I didn't want them doing me favours."
Agnes Macphail,"Whatever is dirty, it is women's job to clean up, or drive some man to clean up, and that goes for everything from cellar to senate."
Agnes Macphail,"Most of the women who have offered themselves for public office over the years have done so, I believe, more because of the 'dirt' than in spite of it."
Agnes Macphail,"It is a fact that all women contribute more to marriage than men; for the most part they have to change their place of living, their method of work, a great many women today changing their occupation entirely on marriage; and they must even change their name."
Agnes Macphail,"If they are willing to give women economic freedom in that home, if they are willing to live by the standard they wish women to live by, then homes will be preserves."
Agnes Macphail,"If the preservation of the home means the enslavement of women, economically or morally, then we had better break it."
Agnes Macphail,I believe the preservation of the home in the future lies almost entirely in the hands of men.
Agnes Macphail,"Never apologize. Never explain. Just get the thing done, and let them howl."
Agnes Macphail,"I owed it to my father that I was elected to Parliament in the first place, but I owed it to my mother that I stuck it out once I got there."
Agnes Macphail,"I do not want to be the angel of any home: I want for myself what I want for other women, absolute equality. After that is secured, then men and women can take turns being angels."
Agnes Macphail,"Do not rely completely on any other human being, however dear. We meet all life's greatest tests alone."
Agnes Macphail,"I want for myself what I want for other women, absolute equality."
Elle Macpherson,I thank my mother. It's the genes. I don't think too much about it.
Elle Macpherson,"I see myself as the consumer. I'm a working mother and I don't get a lot of time to myself. I create products that I need in my life, and which make me feel good."
Elle Macpherson,"I wanted so badly to study ballet, but it was really all about wearing the tutu. [On the subject of her early aspirations]"
Elle Macpherson,"For 15 years, I've been playing the same character - which is myself - and I'm bored with 'myself'."
Rod Macqueen,"No, I see my role as very much being a support. But I won't have any formal role with the side."
Rod Macqueen,It will be a controlled environment. We'll look at stats and medical reports. We'll monitor it and look at the cause and effect. I don't think the game would be different. There would just be more good rugby.
Rod Macqueen,The ultimate aim of these experimental laws is to allow for more creativity.
Craig MacTavish,"I like an even-keel team, a team that doesn't get seduced by any success you have or disabled by any of your disappointments along the way."
Craig MacTavish,"Against a team like Detroit, they'll make you pay when you give up those high-quality scoring chances."
Craig MacTavish,"That just confirms my philosophy that the less you want something, the more likelihood of it occurring. This was a game that we really didn't care all that much about, so automatic win."
Craig MacTavish,I think it lends a sense of perspective for both guys because they've been all over the place to get here.
Craig MacTavish,"The guys are starting to play well in front of him, and we're getting the consistent performance we were looking for from the position."
Craig MacTavish,It was a great opportunity for us. We knew what this one meant. If we won it would effectively be a five team race.
Craig MacTavish,There are a lot of teams looking for one more save a night. We're one of them.
Craig MacTavish,"(Chris) Chelios got a couple penalties in the second period, but there's no question that they willed the influence over the officials. Part of that is the inexperience. I'm not saying we didn't deserve a number of those penalties, but there were a number that I thought were poor calls."
Craig MacTavish,You hate to have the whole season riding on something like that. But welcome to the new NHL. That's got to be a record for the amount of shooters.
Craig MacTavish,"It's a huge cop-out to talk about a goalie when you only score two goals. Playing goal for our team, the way we're putting the puck in the net lately, is very difficult."
Craig MacTavish,We've got to answer back and it's in a much tougher building now. It's well documented how important these games are for both teams. We've got to bounce back.
Craig MacTavish,We had lots of opportunities to win the game ourselves.
Craig MacTavish,We have to play a much more intelligent game then what we played the last three games. We've been sloppy for three straight games now and you can't hope to win at this level making those types of mistakes.
Craig MacTavish,"He gives us experience. He can play center, he can play the wing and he's a penalty killer."
Craig MacTavish,"Even a guy with as much experience as Dwayne, it takes a while to get comfortable. You get out of your routine. Having been traded at about the same age as he is now, I know it's a little unsettling."
Craig MacTavish,"You miss a guy with that intensity. He sets a great example for everybody, in terms of work ethic and selflessness."
Craig MacTavish,"It's another example of how you have to lock down every last detail, or you don't win. We played a very good third period, only allowed them four shots on goal and they scored on two of them because they were quality chances that came as a direct result of our mistakes."
Craig MacTavish,It's another example that you have to take care of every aspect of our game. Otherwise it ends up being a loss.
Craig MacTavish,"It's going to be very entertaining, very pressure-filled hockey from here till the end. When you find yourself five points out of the division lead and three points out of ninth, there's a lot at stake."
Craig MacTavish,We haven't had too many trips this year below .500. Three points out of four games isn't a total disaster.
Craig MacTavish,It's a different standard with those two. It seems like you get credited for having the courage to call everything.
Craig MacTavish,"(The loss is) hard to slough off. It's going to linger for a while. Given any other circumstances, this would be a game we could quickly get over and start focusing on San Jose Friday. It was one of those games where we deserved better."
Craig MacTavish,Hockey moulds and reveals character. The root of it is really built into the character of the person.
Craig MacTavish,"Players like him are seldom available. He's just good all-around. Reading the rush, good stick, use of his body, making the outlet pass, reading plays."
Craig MacTavish,"When that happens, it's a tactical mistake on our part. We can't blame the goalie on that one."
Craig MacTavish,I'm really happy about the way we've responded to adversity. They showed some composure by not throwing in the towel after the two quick ones in the third.
Craig MacTavish,"He'll get the opportunity. The rest will be up to him. He showed the ability at his first rookie camp, but he was inconsistent. I guess you expect that out of a young kid."
Craig MacTavish,You have to give them credit for their ability to check and they knocked us off the puck and they turned over a lot of pucks. But at the same time we were turning the pucks over and it just seems like we never settled into our game even from the outset we didn't settle into out game. But I think you give them credit for giving us a little bit of a lesson.
John Madden,"Don't worry bout' the mule being blind, just load the wagon!"
John Madden,But I wouldn't be surprised if there was a trade. There are a number of teams that could use him.. .. There are a lot of moving parts in this that could include the draft and could maybe include Brett Favre.
John Madden,"The three dumbest things in sports--artificial turf, domed stadiums and the wave."
John Madden,"With all his tumid boasts, he's like the sword-fish, who only wears his weapon in his mouth."
John Madden,learned as much as I can about being a good running back.
John Madden,"It's a good feeling. It's comforting to know that with all these new rules and the season layoff, that we have a coach who has a very open mind when it comes to the new rules changes. Obviously he's going to bounce a lot of stuff off us and we're going to give him a lot of feedback."
John Madden,"As players, we've got to accept some of the responsibility of making our own decisions. I think (the league does) plenty."
John Madden,"This research suggests a whole new way of making robots, motors or other devices in a much more distributed way. Instead of electric energy and wires hooked up to each motor, you have a circulation system carrying fuel to each engine."
John Madden,A team should never practice on a field that is not lined. Your players have to become aware of the field's boundaries.
John Madden,I think anybody would like something like that. It would be an unbelievable honor for any number of guys. It's something I'm not going to be thinking about on a daily basis.
John Madden,the best analyst of any kind in sports television history.
John Madden,I think she's inevitably more confident and in control of what she's doing.
John Madden,"These muscles won't propel our cars yet, but they could operate the windows and door locks in fuel cell vehicles, or could serve as replaceable artificial muscles in lifelike robots."
John Madden,"Every time I go to the theater, there's something about the atmosphere, seeing something unfold live in front of an audience, that you can't get out of your system."
John Madden,"When your arm gets hit, the ball is not going to go where you want it to."
John Madden,The only yardstick for success our society has is being a champion. No one remembers anything else.
John Madden,The road to Easy Street goes through the sewer.
John Madden,If you see a defense team with dirt and mud on their backs they've had a bad day.
John Madden,I think comparisons are odious.
John Madden,"Don't worry about the horse being blind, just load the wagon."
John Madden,Coaches have to watch for what they don't want to see and listen to what they don't want to hear.
John Madden,"Self-praise is for losers. Be a winner. Stand for something. Always have class, and be humble."
John Madden,"The fewer rules a coach has, the fewer rules there are for players to break."
Joe Maddon,We're not going to worry about it -- it happens. We'll put it back together and move on.
Joe Maddon,"What is conventional wisdom? Who created conventional wisdom in the first place? It's just something we've been doing for a long period of time, and while the game is the same, the game has changed in other ways. If you have enough information, you might be able to take some chance based on the information."
Joe Maddon,I think the outfield is a strength.
Joe Maddon,"Nothing hurts. Nothing's sore, but I don't think he's built up enough arm strength."
Joe Maddon,"It's part of the strategy of this team. Our strength is going to be speed, and I want them to see what we can do."
Joe Maddon,"It's one of the funniest plays in all of sports. He runs hard, and he runs fast. He's intense."
Joe Maddon,The wasting of good pitching is a mortal sin. It's actually the 11th commandment.
Joe Maddon,"When I first got here, the first thing I said was that we have to build relationships. That's how you turn negatives into positives."
Joe Maddon,He's making more quality pitches down in the strike zone.
Joe Maddon,"He's getting there. He's started to show more quality pitches down in the zone and as he really becomes more proficient with that, that's when he's really going to be able to take off."
Joe Maddon,"I want the players to play that way, so I'd better manage that way. The philosophy has been thrown out there. We've been talking about it. We've been working on it, so let's see how it works. Let's see if theory and reality can come together."
Joe Maddon,He's throwing the ball well. There's been no negative impact. No setbacks. There's no pain. I think he's fine. But we still have to monitor it. We're not just going to throw him out there. We want to stick to the plan. Once we get to the season we'll determine how many days in a row he can play and when he needs a day off.
Joe Maddon,"You probably need a seven- to nine-man pitching staff among starters to really get through a season. I would say seven, maybe eight. You're always looking for what's going to happen, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, in case of a breakdown."
Joe Maddon,I would just love to hang it on one guy. I would love to build the game up to one guy at the end. I think that's the better way to do it. I just haven't been able to decide on one guy yet.
Joe Maddon,I love everything he does. He is everything they said he is.
Joe Maddon,"I think they're turning it up in tight situations and I like it. Our guys, as the game gets later, it just seems like their focus gets better at the plate."
Joe Maddon,"Joey can be a force, an absolute force."
Joe Maddon,"He's got good face. That means that he's strong, he's attentive. He's a great listener. He has an enthusiasm about him. He has got this way about him that I think other people respond to."
Joe Maddon,He has the mentality of a closer. He has an easy delivery which is part of the deception to the hitters. He is like an old-time Bryan Harvey.
Joe Maddon,I like the concentration. This team is not known for that.
Joe Maddon,I was in the company of royalty.
Joe Maddon,"I've seen guys like him with that kind of body build, and I like it, because I see a lot of limberness and looseness, and yet there's still a lot of strength involved. Actually, he's in a good position, I think, to grow into that, and with the training we have, you're going to see him develop into a pretty well-developed [strong player]."
Joe Maddon,They believe we are still in the game as it gets tight and late. There's a good feeling in the dugout.
Joe Maddon,"Yes, he'll start the second game of the season, and I really believe he's ready for that. He was very happy about it."
Joe Maddon,"This guy has been swinging at strikes and taking balls. That's been the most impressive thing he's done at the plate. The obvious thing was the home run, but he moves really well in the outfield."
Joe Maddon,He busts on any authority figure. He's been really nice to me so far. I'm waiting for him to break it out.
Joe Maddon,"I think that may require a suspension, absolutely. That kind of action cannot be tolerated. I don?t want any of our guys ever doing anything like that."
Joe Maddon,I think that may. Absolutely. That kind of action can not be tolerated.
Joe Maddon,"He's on a level with Barry Bonds, as far as hitting ability. He's just so hard to pitch to. ... We're just going to keep trying."
Greg Maddux,"It's OK to be wild, but when you're wild in tight, you run the risk of hitting the guy."
Greg Maddux,"But having been in the National League for 20 years, it's just kind of tradition."
Greg Maddux,"This has always been a special place for me, ... It's an honor for me to come here and play every day here, and I want to thank my teammates because starting pitchers, we all need a lot of help and I have been lucky enough to play on a lot of good teams."
Greg Maddux,"Whatever happens, happens. I'd let the boys in Vegas know if I knew."
Greg Maddux,"The dirt was OK, but once you hit the grass... Wet grass is slippery."
Greg Maddux,"I would love to try to win another game. Obviously, it's more fun when you win. I'd rather try and not win than not try at all."
Greg Maddux,"I was still able to throw my slider, change-up, curveball. But my location was terrible. I was making too many mistakes over the middle of the plate."
Greg Maddux,The reason I think I'm a good pitcher is I locate my fastball and I change speeds. Period. That's what you do to pitch. That's what pitchers have to do to win games.
Greg Maddux,"I don't care if we're out of it or not, if I've got a chance to pitch, I want to."
Greg Maddux,"If they want me I'd love to come back. I'm not going to play because I can, I'm going to play because I deserve it."
Greg Maddux,You have to locate your fastball and change your speeds. There was nothing wrong with my fastball. I had movement. I had the velocity.
Greg Maddux,"I look forward to another good year next year. It would be nice to win, too."
Greg Maddux,I don't believe for one second that the eye surgery has helped me on the mound.
Greg Maddux,"I didn't think I was done. Because my stuff was OK. I really believed and I've always believed that when I get hit 9 out of 10 times, it's location."
Greg Maddux,I was under the impression I had signed a three-year contract. I want to be back. I expect to be back. I will be back.
Greg Maddux,"Age is just a number. I heard Julio Franco say it a million times. I used to laugh at him, but now I know what he means."
Greg Maddux,"I heard Julio Franco say a million times that age is just a number. I'm finally starting to understand what he meant by that. I used to laugh at him 10 years ago, but I know what he means now."
Dolley Madison,"I am accordingly ready; I have pressed as many Cabinet papers into trunks as to fill one carriage; our private property must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to procure wagons for its transportation."
Dolley Madison,Disaffection stalks around us.
Dolley Madison,"At this late hour a wagon has been procured, and I have had it filled with plate and the most valuable portable articles, belonging to the house."
Dolley Madison,"And now, dear sister, I must leave this house or the retreating army will make me a prisoner in it by filling up the road I am directed to take."
Dolley Madison,"When I shall again write to you, or where I shall be tomorrow, I cannot tell."
Dolley Madison,Our private property must be sacrificed.
Dolley Madison,It is one of my sources of happiness never to desire a knowledge of other people's business.
Dolley Madison,"Two messengers covered with dust come to bid me fly, but I wait for him."
Dolley Madison,It is done... the precious portrait placed in the hands of the gentlemen for safe keeping.
James Madison,"Experience is the oracle of truth; and where its responses are unequivocal, they ought to be conclusive and sacred"
James Madison,"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny"
James Madison,"If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy"
James Madison,The American people are too well schooled in the duty and practice of submitting to the will of the majority to permit any serious uneasiness on that account
James Madison,"In Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority"
James Madison,the father of the U.S. Constitution.
James Madison,"The proposed Constitution is, in strictness, neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both."
James Madison,"Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign body, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if established, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution."
James Madison,"But ambitious encroachments of the federal government, on the authority of the State governments, would not excite the opposition of a single State, or of a few States only. They would be signals of general alarm... But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity."
James Madison,The number of individuals employed under the Constitution of the United States will be much smaller than the number employed under the particular states. There will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the former than of the latter.
James Madison,The happy Union of these States is a wonder; their Constitution a miracle; their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world
James Madison,A standing army is one of the greatest mischief that can possibly happen
James Madison,"As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed."
James Madison,"What is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?"
James Madison,What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed?
James Madison,No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.
James Madison,We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.
James Madison,The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.
James Madison,"The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government."
James Madison,The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe with blood for centuries.
James Madison,"It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad."
James Madison,"To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression."
James Madison,"To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea."

Jamaal Magloire,Portland has a lot of talent on their team. Their talent speaks more than their record.
Jamaal Magloire,"I think the whole reason why they traded for me was to become a playoff-contending team and to take a lot of pressure off the rookie. I've done so thus far.

Tobey Maguire,"I've been pretty fortunate; everybody I've worked with has been pretty ego-free and they're just there to do the work and they're famous because they do good work. And the people I've run into have generally been pretty giving, caring people. It's easy to connect with that."

Hunter Mahan,"[With the improvement in his game, Hunter Mahan is ready to continue his learning process in his second year on Tour.] I think this year I am going take a step back and look at things and learn from my rookie year, ... I think every year out here is a learning experience. No matter if it is your second year on tour or your 15th. This is definitely a big year, though."

Bill Maher,Let's face it; God has a big ego problem. Why do we always have to worship him?
Bill Maher,"I was watching Ashlee Simpson on Jay's show last night... She was really singing, and I was saying, 'Bring back the lip synch.' ...And it struck me that Ashlee Simpson is a lot like George Bush-because she wouldn't even really be in the big leagues if it wasn't for family connections, and she's in way over her head. And she doesn't know what to do. And she blamed her band."
Bill Maher,"And to answer the question that people have about this conspiracy theory that he has a pack in his back, my answer is, if someone was feeding him answers, couldn't they be able to feed him better ones than he came up with?"
Bill Maher,"Doctors said that the test most commonly used to screen for colon cancer doesn't go far enough. They're recommending a procedure that involves photographing the entire colon. I say, don't vie CBS an idea for another reality show."

Gustav Mahler,If a composer could say what he had to say in words he would not bother trying to say it in music.

Michael Mahoney,"If Microsoft was not in the monopoly position that it is in, the increasing frequency of security concerns would cause more anxiety in the marketplace."

Michael Mahoney,"With all that cash, if they bought software that enhances their services business, that could be an interesting strategy,"
Hermann Maier,"I should have been more relaxed. I was very tight. I was very, very close to the victory and this makes me a little sad."

Hermann Maier,"Bronze is not bad, but luck has not been with me. Others have been super fit while I had the flu."

Paul Mainieri,Lopez is a little sore and we want to rest him a little bit. I always felt that [Barnes] was a starting player and had the capability to be one of our best hitters and all-around players. The problem is that we had a full starting infield coming back and they're all good players.
Paul Mainieri,I've never seen a guy more thorough and organized. He was really serious about developing as a coach and progressing in the profession.

Paolo Maldini,"There is so much enthusiasm among us and around us,"
Paolo Maldini,"He enjoys the game and that is the only thing that you can know about him at the moment, ... If he really wants to be a footballer than he will know how to handle all the pressures there will be for him."
Matt Maldre,Giving thanks are the concrete steps to happiness
Matt Maldre,"With large umbrellas, come large responsibilities"
Matt Maldre,"Walking backwards is a lot like life. You can't really see where you going, only where you've been. You can kinda know where you are going, but you never know exactly what's ahead."
Matt Maldre,"If there was a wikipedia page about you, what would it say?"
Matt Maldre,"Age is not how old you are, but how many years of fun youâ€™ve had."
Nicolas Malebranche,"You will not dishonor the divine perfections by judgments unworthy of them, provided you never judge of Him by yourself, provided you do not ascribe to the Creator the imperfections and limitations of created beings."
Nicolas Malebranche,"You cannot of yourself move your arm or alter your position, situation, posture, do to other men good or evil, or effect the least change in the world."
Nicolas Malebranche,"We see things in this material world, wherein our bodies dwell, only because our mind through its attention lives in another world, only because it contemplates the beauties of the archetypal and intelligible world which Reason contains."
Nicolas Malebranche,We are made to know and love God.
Nicolas Malebranche,Prejudices are not easily got rid of as an old coat which is no longer thought of.
Nicolas Malebranche,Our soul is not united to our body in the ordinary sense of these terms. It is immediately and directly united to God alone.
Nicolas Malebranche,"In this connection, faith and experience teach us many truths by means of the short-cut of authority and by the proofs of very pleasant and agreeable feelings."
Nicolas Malebranche,"I derive nothing whatever from my own nature, nothing from the nature imagined by the philosophers - all comes from God and His decrees."
Nicolas Malebranche,"I beg of you always to dwell upon the necessity of a thorough understanding of principles, in order to stop the vivacity of his mind, and please do not forget to meditate upon the subject of our discussion."
Nicolas Malebranche,He has willed - He wills incessantly - that the modifications of the mind and those of the body shall be reciprocal. This is the conjunction and the natural dependence of the two parts of which we are constituted.
Nicolas Malebranche,"God transforms, so to speak, this air into words, into various sounds. He makes you understand these various sounds through the modifications by which you are affected."
Nicolas Malebranche,"God joins us together by means of the body, in consequence of the laws of the communication of movements. He affects us with the same feelings in consequence of the laws of the conjunction of body and soul."
Nicolas Malebranche,"God has linked together all His works, though He has not on that account produced in them entities charged with the function of union."
Nicolas Malebranche,"Do not fear lest you should meditate too much upon Him and speak of Him in an unworthy way, providing you are led by faith. Do not fear lest you should entertain false opinions of Him so long as they are in conformity with the notion of the infinitely perfect Being."
Nicolas Malebranche,"As our bodies live upon the earth and find sustenance in the fruits which it produces, so our minds feed on the same truths as the intelligible and immutable substance of the divine Word contains."
Nicolas Malebranche,"All creatures are united to God alone in an immediate union. They depend essentially and directly upon Him. Being all alike equally impotent, they cannot be in reciprocal dependence upon one another."
Nicolas Malebranche,"I love good and pleasure, I hate evil and pain, I want to be happy and I am not mistaken in believing, that people, angels and even demons have those same inclinations."
Tom Malinowski,"It doesn't fix the problem that there isn't a single clear standard consistent with the law and our values, ... Even if all these documents end up establishing appropriate standards, we need to remember that what the secretary of defense does today he can undo tomorrow."
Tom Malinowski,"This exception contains code language that could give the CIA a green light to treat prisoners inhumanely. If allowed to stand, it will render President Bush 's past pledges about humane treatment meaningless."
Tom Malinowski,"There's a lot of public pressure to retain the language intact. At the same time, there's pressure from the vice president's office to modify it."
Tom Malinowski,"It is illogical for companies to say they are expanding the boundaries of freedom in China if they strip their product of the very qualities that make it a force for greater freedom. These companies must protect the integrity of the product they are providing, or that product will no longer be the Internet as we know it, and will no longer have the impact on society we all wish to see."
Tom Malinowski,The administration is setting a dangerous example for the world when it claims that spy agencies are above the law.
Tom Malinowski,It's pathetic that they're still shuttling cash to this dictatorship after it has violated every commitment it made to the United States.
Tom Malinowski,They've never before explicitly asserted that they need the authority to treat prisoners inhumanely. We can't think of any country in the world that has.
Tom Malinowski,"They've never before explicitly asserted that they need the authority to treat prisoners inhumanely. We can't think of any country in the world that has,"
Tom Malinowski,This was somebody who worked very hard to make sure the advice of senior military officials and national security professionals on the question of interrogation policies was ignored. The result was an unmitigated disaster for the United States.
Tom Malinowski,"This was somebody who worked very hard to make sure the advice of senior military officials and national security professionals on the question of interrogation policies was ignored, ... The result was an unmitigated disaster for the United States."
Tom Malinowski,"They are explicitly saying, for the first time, that the intelligence community should have the ability to treat prisoners inhumanely. You can't tell soldiers that inhumane treatment is always morally wrong if they see with their own eyes that C.I.A. personnel are allowed to engage in it."
Tom Malinowski,"They are explicitly saying, for the first time, that the intelligence community should have the ability to treat prisoners inhumanely, ...

John Malkovich,"Where women are concerned, the rule is never to go out with anyone better dressed than you."
John Malkovich,I don't think my parents know what I do.
John Malkovich,She has this Jayne Mansfield body and a horrifyingly great brain.
John Malkovich,I'm more comfortable with whatever's wrong with me than my father was whenever he felt he failed or didn't measure up to the standard he set.
Stephane Mallarme,"There is only beauty -- and it has only one perfect expression -- poetry. All the rest is a lie --except for those who live by the body, love, and, that love of the mind, friendship. For me, Poetry takes the place of love, because it is enamored of itself, and because its sensual delight falls back deliciously in my soul."
Stephane Mallarme,To give a purer sense to the language of the tribe.
Stephane Mallarme,"The pure work implies the disappearance of the poet as speaker, who hands over to the words."
Stephane Mallarme,"There is only beauty / and it has only one perfect expression / poetry. All the rest is a lie /except for those who live by the body, love, and, that love of the mind, friendship. For me, Poetry takes the place of love, because it is enamored of itself, and because its sensual delight falls back deliciously in my soul."
Stephane Mallarme,Dreams have as much influence as actions
Stephane Mallarme,"You don't make a poem with ideas, but with words."
Seamus Mallon,"Those who did it, those who organized it and those who give it any support or credence should know what they are doing is driving the entire community to the brink of more and more and more suffering."
Seamus Mallon,It is time to shed them now and raise our eyes into the future.
Seamus Mallon,"Permutation after permutation has been tried. We have tried, and I have tried every move -- in the book and outside it -- to make sure this agreement worked."

Karl Malone,"I'll be there, and then you bring it on. If I'm living, I'll be there. You have my word."
Karl Malone,He's fun to watch and listen to and I am thrilled about finally getting the opportunity to meet him personally.
Karl Malone,This was a great team win. We scored just 12 points in the fourth and coach wasn't too happy with that.
Karl Malone,"I think we're a deeper team, a better team, we still have work to do... nothing is guaranteed, but hopefully we got the mentality to play on the road, and we're starting to get our home thing back in order now-if we can do that we'll be just fine."
Karl Malone,"I just think we want to stay healthy, and I don't think we think about a sense of urgency. We realize how old we are, we realize we've been playing this game for a long time, but you know what? We're not done yet."
George Maloof,"Exposure for the city. It's the first time any one of the four major sports has ever done anything like this. So you start with that, and I think it's going to blow up from there."
George Maloof,I told them from my experience [that] to put a victim and a perpetrator together in a very loose environment is completely unsupportable.
George Maloof,He had paranoid delusions. But I have no doubt that Father Chevedden was accurate in what he described. He was very precise in detailing and documenting what transpired.
Andre Malraux,What is man? A miserable little pile of secrets
Andre Malraux,Some pictures are in the gallery because they belong to humanity and others because they belong to the United States.

Andre Malraux,"Always, however brutal an age may actually have been, its style transmits its music only."
Andre Malraux,All art is a revolt against man's fate.
Andre Malraux,"The crucial discovery was made that, in order to become painting, the universe seen by the artist had to become a private one created by himself."
Andre Malraux,"Opium teaches only one thing, which is that aside from physical suffering, there is nothing real."
Andre Malraux,"Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."
Andre Malraux,An art book is a museum without walls.

Andre Malraux,"To the humblest among them, who may be listening to me now, I want to say that the masterpiece to which you are paying historic homage this evening is a painting which he has saved."
Andre Malraux,Man knows that the world is not made on a human scale; and he wishes that it were.

Andre Malraux,"And when man faces destiny, destiny ends and man comes into his own."
Andre Malraux,"Always, however brutal an age may actually have been, its style transmits its music only"
Andre Malraux,"Culture is the sum of all the forms of art, of love, and of thought, which, in the coarse or centuries, have enabled man to be less enslaved"

Andre Malraux,"To command is to serve, nothing more and nothing less."
Andre Malraux,Art is a revolt against fate.
Leonard Maltin,She's quite wonderful in that role. She's totally convincing as the mother who has to walk a fine line in raising that little boy. She's a terrific actress; there's never any sense that she's acting. She commits to any character she plays.
Leonard Maltin,"The movie is in some uncharted waters, because it shows what it's like for two men to feel that kind of longing and passion for each other, and people aren't used to that. No one movie is going to turn things around, but they can be building blocks. That could be this movie's legacy."
Leonard Maltin,The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang.
Leonard Maltin,"A good story is a good story, and I think kids relate well to good stories about identifiable characters. I have parents and grandparents stop me all the time to tell me kids watch these Disney Treasures all the time â€“ I can tell you from the feedback I'm getting, they are still great children's and family entertainment."
Leonard Maltin,"Anyone who says that someone is a sure bet for an Oscar is a fool. There's no such thing as a sure thing, least of all in a five-way vote."
Leonard Maltin,Most other world-shattering events have not been depicted so soon.
Leonard Maltin,"He apparently had a Svengali-like approach or control over her and set out to mold and shape her every performance and appearance on screen, ... Those instances are rare, I think."
Leonard Maltin,You want to make an impression. Being clever helps.
Leonard Maltin,He's a great choice. He's both smart and funny. He can be serious when the case demands. He can be silly. Knowing when to push those buttons is the key to being a good host.
Leonard Maltin,"He's got it all. He's got charm, he's got looks, he's got brains, he's got a conscience. He has everything any movie star could want to have, any director or producer, and then some."
Leonard Maltin,"She was one of these character actresses who could fill any number of roles. She played a lot of 'earth mother' types, especially in later years."
Leonard Maltin,"He created an indelible character in Chester. Chester is a good hearted, simple-minded guy. That's why he's such a likable character."
Leonard Maltin,"While it was occasionally done here or there, nobody else had a figurehead like Walt doing it. Jack Warner wasn't on TV. Walt was the boss, but he had a real public profile and he used it to his advantage. And he became a household face."
Leonard Maltin,Timing in life is everything.
Leonard Maltin,Television is what made It's a Wonderful Life the classic it is today.
Leonard Maltin,Shakespeare wrote great plays that we're still watching all these years later. Charlie Chaplin made great comedies and they are still as funny today as they ever were.
Leonard Maltin,Quality survives.
Leonard Maltin,Polar Express is not an attempt to do animation. It is a technology-based film.
Leonard Maltin,NBC anchor Brian Williams is a standup comic in disguise.

Leonard Maltin,"If I were less than honest as a critic, I think people would spot that right away, and it would destroy my credibility."
Leonard Maltin,I'm a lifelong Disney nut.
Leonard Maltin,I think the people who are making Christmas-themed movies today feel that people are more cynical about Christmas. There's more of an edge.
Leonard Maltin,I think people in Hollywood are afraid of sentiment because they think audiences will reject it.
Leonard Maltin,"I teach at USC. I have a big class of 360 kids, only about a fifth of whom are film majors. I don't just show the Hollywood blockbusters. I show independent films, foreign films, documentaries."
Leonard Maltin,I had the great good fortune to interview Peggy Lee. Her memories of working with Walt Disney and his team were warm and upbeat.
Leonard Maltin,Hollywood executives believe that money is both the be-all and end-all to the moviemaking process.
Leonard Maltin,"Everyone is looking for the sure thing. They are looking to hedge their bet. They think the way to do that is to go with a proven quantity, a remake of something you have already seen. That is their mindset."
Leonard Maltin,Beauty and the Beast became the first animated feature ever nominated for best picture.
Leonard Maltin,Audiences deserve better.
Leonard Maltin,The last person to stand still and repeat himself was Walt Disney. He refused to repeat himself. So to think that he'd be making the same kind of film in the year 2001 that he made in 1941 is absurd.
Leonard Maltin,A Christmas Carol is such a fool-proof story you can't louse it up.
Leonard Maltin,"Movie theaters still exist in spite of all of the alternatives that are available, video and video-on-demand and DVD and streaming video and all of these things."
Leonard Maltin,Dumbo... makes me cry. Every single time and in the exact same spot. I just have a special affection for Dumbo.
Leonard Maltin,"When Tim Allen made The Santa Clause, I thought that was a delightful film. It took a modern sensibility but layered onto it a kind of sentiment."
Leonard Maltin,"The man responsible for the original 'King Kong,' Willis O'Brien, started experimenting with stop-action animated films for Thomas Edison in 1916 and 1917. A whole generation of special effects people grew up on these films."
Maxwell Maltz,"Emptiness is a symptom that you are not living creatively. You either have no goal that is important enough to you, or you are not using your talents and efforts in a striving toward an important goal."
Maxwell Maltz,"One of the reasons it has seemed so difficult for a person to change his habits, his personality, or his way of life, has been that heretofore nearly all efforts at change have been directed to the circumference of the self, so to speak, rather than to the center."
Maxwell Maltz,"When you see a thing clearly in your mind, your creative success mechanism within you takes over and does the job much better than you could do it by conscious effort or willpower"
Maxwell Maltz,This is where you will win the battle / in the playhouse of your mind.
Maxwell Maltz,"What is opportunity, and when does it knock? It never knocks. You can wait a whole lifetime, listening, hoping, and you will hear no knocking. None at all. You are opportunity, and you must knock on the door leading to your destiny. You prepare yourself to recognize opportunity, to pursue and seize opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality, and build a self-image with which you are able to live / with your self-respect alive and growing."
Maxwell Maltz,"Of all the traps and pitfalls in life, self-disesteem is the deadliest, and the hardest to overcome, for it is a pit designed and dug by our own hands, summed up in the phrase, It's no use - I can't do it"
Maxwell Maltz,"Self-improvement is the name of the game, and your primary objective is to strengthen yourself, not to destroy an opponent"
Maxwell Maltz,"When you see a thing clearly in your mind, your creative ''success mechanism'' within you takes over and does the job much better than you could do it by conscious effort or ''willpower.''"
Maxwell Maltz,"Thus man of all creatures is more than a creature, he is also a creator. Man alone can direct his success mechanism by the use of imagination, or imaging ability."
Maxwell Maltz,Begin to imagine what the desirable outcome would be like. Go over these mental pictures and delineate details and refinements. Play them over and over to yourself.
Maxwell Maltz,"People who say that life is not worthwhile are really saying that they themselves have no personal goals which are worthwhile. Get yourself a goal worth working for. Better still, get yourself a project. Always have something ahead of you to ''look forward to'' / to work for and hope for."
Maxwell Maltz,It is an old psychological axiom that constant exposure to the object of fear immunizes against the fear.
Maxwell Maltz,"Close scrutiny will show that most ''crisis situations'' are opportunities to either advance, or stay where you are."
Maxwell Maltz,"Stand up to crises. Don't let them throw you! Fight to stay calm... even surmount the crisis completely and turn it into an opportunity. Refuse to renounce your self-image. No matter what happens, you must keep your good opinion of yourself. No matter what happens, you must hold your past successes in your imagination, ready for showing in the motion picture screen of your mind. No matter what happens, no matter what you lose, no matter what failures you must endure, you must keep faith in yourself. Then you can stand up to crises, with calm and courage, refusing to buckle; then you will not fall through the floor. You will be able to support yourself."
Maxwell Maltz,You can do only one thing at a time. I simply tackle one problem and concentrate all efforts on what I am doing at the moment.
Maxwell Maltz,The ''self-image'' is the key to human personality and human behavior. Change the self image and you change the personality and the behavior.
Maxwell Maltz,"Close scrutiny will show that most crisis situations are opportunities to either advance, or stay where you are."
Maxwell Maltz,"Remember you will not always win. Some days, the most resourceful individual will taste defeat. But there is, in this case, always tomorrow - after you have done your best to achieve success today."
Maxwell Maltz,"Self-improvement is the name of the game, and your primary objective is to strengthen yourself, not to destroy an opponent."
Maxwell Maltz,Self-image sets the boundaries of individual accomplishment.
Maxwell Maltz,Low self-esteem is like driving through life with your hand-break on.
Maxwell Maltz,"For imagination sets the goal picture which our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or fail to act, not because of will, as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination."
Maxwell Maltz,The self-image is the key to human personality and human behavior. Change the self image and you change the personality and the behavior.
Maxwell Maltz,"We must have courage to bet on our ideas, to take the calculated risk, and to act."
Maxwell Maltz,"Take the trouble to stop and think of the other person's feelings, his viewpoints, his desires and needs. Think more of what the other fellow wants, and how he must feel."
Maxwell Maltz,"Man maintains his balance, poise, and sense of security only as he is moving forward."
Maxwell Maltz,"We are built to conquer environment, solve problems, achieve goals, and we find no real satisfaction or happiness in life without obstacles to conquer and goals to achieve."
Maxwell Maltz,"Often the difference between a successful man and a failure is not one's better abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has to bet on his ideas, to take a calculated risk, and to act."
Maxwell Maltz,Accept yourself as you are. Otherwise you will never see opportunity. You will not feel free to move toward it; you will feel you are not deserving.
Maxwell Maltz,You may live in an imperfect world but the frontiers are not closed and the doors are not all shut.
Maxwell Maltz,You can always find the sun within yourself if you will only search.
Maxwell Maltz,You make mistakes. Mistakes don't make you.
Maxwell Maltz,Your most important sale in life is to sell yourself to yourself.
Maxwell Maltz,If you make friends with yourself you will never be alone.
Maxwell Maltz,"To change a habit, make a conscious decision, then act out the new behavior."
Maxwell Maltz,"We are injured and hurt emotionally, Not so much by other people or what they say and don't say, But by our own attitude and our own response."
Maxwell Maltz,"To think, when one is no longer young, when one is not yet old, that one is no longer young, that one is not yet old, that is perhaps something."
Maxwell Maltz,"You are embarking on the greatest adventure of your life -- to improve your self-image, to create more meaning in your life and in the lives of others. This is your responsibility. Accept it, now!"
Maxwell Maltz,"Study the situation thoroughly, go over in your imagination the various courses of action possible to you and the consequences which can and may follow from each course. Pick out the course which gives the most promise and go ahead."
Maxwell Maltz,"Realizing that our actions, feelings and behaviour are the result of our own images and beliefs gives us the level that psychology has always needed for changing personality."
Gus Malzahn,"It was awkward at times, especially at first. But I think the reality is they actually saw me with a Razorback on my shirt, and it kind of hit home that, hey, he is over there, he's not at Springdale anymore."
Gus Malzahn,It's a true honor for me to be here. I love the Razorbacks.
Gus Malzahn,He has all the tools and can throw with zip or touch. He makes great decisions.
Gus Malzahn,"I totally believe that God has blessed me with a unique ability to know offense, to call offense. I'm truly excited to be here. I can't wait to get started."
David Mamet,"The proclamation and repetition of first principles is a constant feature of life in our democracy. Active adherence to these principles, however, has always been considered un-American. We recipients of the boon of liberty have always been ready, when faced with discomfort, to discard any and all first principles of liberty, and, further, to indict those who do not freely join with us in happily arrogating those principles."
David Mamet,"We Americans have always considered Hollywood, at best, a sinkhole of depraved venality. And, of course, it is. It is not a Protective Monastery of Aesthetic Truth. It is a place where everything is incredibly expensive."
David Mamet,"The pursuit of Fashion is the attempt of the middle class to co-opt tragedy. In adopting the clothing, speech, and personal habits of those in straitened, dangerous, or pitiful circumstances, the middle class seeks to have what it feels to be the exigent and nonequivocal experiences had by those it emulates."
David Mamet,"The popularity of disaster movies expresses a collective perception of a world threatened by irresistible and unforeseen forces which nevertheless are thwarted at the last moment. Their thinly veiled symbolic meaning might be translated thus: We are innocent of wrongdoing. We are attacked by unforeseeable forces come to harm us. We are, thus, innocent even of negligence. Though those forces are insuperable, chance will come to our aid and we shall emerge victorious."
David Mamet,I hate vacations. There's nothing to do.
David Mamet,I always thought the real violence in Hollywood isn't what's on the screen. It's what you have to do to raise the money.
Method Man,"So to make those checks better, I used to steal lollipops and sell them at school - but I got caught."
Method Man,Now we just showin' and provin' that there's a ghetto everywhere you go.
Method Man,It's been so long since I was in a real fight.
Method Man,"After a while, you can't get any higher. It's like your head is in a wind tunnel - everything is vibrating."
Method Man,"Yeah, the next Wu album should be out by late '95."
Method Man,"Yeah I'm telling real stories, but if you pick up a documentary on strippers, you're going to want to see some stripping, so we definitely got that in there."
Method Man,We smoked a lot of cloves.
Method Man,We just wanna see where we stand at right now with our fans.
Method Man,There's probably a bunch of Power Stripe floating through the Def Jam offices right now.
Method Man,"The most I've smoked in a day was over an ounce, in Germany."
Method Man,"Somebody wrote a script around us, but Dustin Abraham came with the best one."
Method Man,"Regardless of how me or this man right here or anybody else in this business get, when we walk on an airplane in first-class looking like this, we're gonna get searched."
Method Man,"Rap is a gimmick, but I'm for the hip-hop, the culture."
Method Man,People know when you're frontin'.
Method Man,"No matter where you from, there's ghettos all over the place."
Method Man,"I'm in between homes right now, but my last house was dope."
Method Man,I'm a peaceful dude.
Method Man,I wanna sit behind the scenes and see nothin' but the greens.
Method Man,I smoke because I like to get high.
Method Man,"I have 15,000 comics in a warehouse, all bagged individually."

Marketing Manager,The club was created to thank our loyal clients for their support over the years and forge new relationships with the ongoing stream of visitors to our cellar tasting room and our two restaurants in the Cape Peninsula.
Marketing Manager,We are proud of our 40 year history in Australia and our commitment in the 1960s to begin manufacturing in Australia which we continue here today.
Roberto Mancini,"[Mancini, however, will not be going to Turin just to defend. With the season still in its infancy, victory would have a significant psychological impact.] A win would be important because it would give us peace of mind going forward, ... After all, we don't just think about the domestic league. I hold the Champions League very dear and it's something Inter haven't won in a long time."
Roberto Mancini,"The race for the Ballon d'Or is on and Kaka is a great player for Milan, while Ronaldinho and Steven Gerrard are also candidates. Clearly, I'd give the award to Adriano,"
Roberto Mancini,Anderlecht are a good team but Inter had a great game and did not permit Anderlecht to express their potential.
Roberto Mancini,"A win would be important because it would give us peace of mind going forward. After all, we don't just think about the domestic league. I hold the Champions League very dear and it's something Inter haven't won in a long time."
Roberto Mancini,I hope whoever plays tomorrow does well and gives me a reason to believe in them.
Roberto Mancini,"The team can win without Adriano, but it can't do without him if it wants to attain its big goals,"
Roberto Mancini,Not conceding a goal at home is always important in a Cup tie. But despite that there is no doubt that this tie is still wide open.
Roberto Mancini,"Adriano can do better, but he's not the cause of our defeat in Florence."
Roberto Mancini,"In the second half, scoring so quickly again put us at ease. We just had to control the game from then on."
Roberto Mancini,We paid for a lapse in concentration and it could have been disastrous. The players deserve credit for the way they came back immediately.
Roberto Mancini,Sometimes the choices you make are good and other times it goes the other way. I take full responsibility as coach.
Roberto Mancini,"He played a good game, he tried hard at the beginning."
Roberto Mancini,What I am most happy about is the fact that we have extended our advantage with the teams that follow us.
Roberto Mancini,"Even though we start with an advantage, we'll have to stay attentive because if we give up a goal at the beginning of the game, everything could change."
Roberto Mancini,"A great goal, a beautiful action by Adriano and Cruz. We could have tried to score a second goal to close out the game in the first half."
Julia Mancuso,She's got a lot of tape. We have not reviewed it yet or seen if it's boring or worth seeing.
Julia Mancuso,I know she was in a lot of pain. She did a really good job.
Julia Mancuso,"I was lightheaded in the start. I had two fine runs, didn't make any big mistakes..."
Julia Mancuso,"I just felt I couldn't make any mistakes in the second run because there were so many big turns on the bottom. I wasn't thinking of gold, I was thinking of the podium. I was excited and nervous. It was a difficult second run."
Julia Mancuso,"Gold medals are my goal, I'm just making my way."
Julia Mancuso,"It's cool when people ask me about my gold medal and they say it will last forever. I will try to promote skiing and show everyone it's not just about competition. It's about having fun with your friends in the snow. I want to bring people with less opportunities to the snow, try to use my gold medal to support programs to bring more people to the snow."
Julia Mancuso,"Our team was disappointed after the speed events, but everyone was proud of how we performed. We didn't have any regrets. We did our best and that's what it's all about."
Julia Mancuso,"The lesson you learn is that it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is believing in yourself, kicking out of the start gate and leaving everything else behind."
Howie Mandel,"I've been chased, ... I've been pushed. I've been screamed at. I've been verbally abused. I've been afraid for my safety. But I did it all in the name of entertainment."
Howie Mandel,"If my mom came here today, she'd probably join this red-hat brigade, ... My mother got my sense of humor, even when I was a kid. I would just do things that tickled my fancy in the moment, and she would ask me who I was entertaining. I'd say, 'Well, me.' And she would tell me that nobody knew that and they thought I was psychotic. Well, I don't ever want people to think I'm psychotic, but I can't help myself from doing these things."
Howie Mandel,"She was so helpful and so sweet and so giving, ... I call it the food-poisoning effect. Everybody knows where they got food poisoning. We take that first bite and there's kind of an awful taste or a bad smell. You knew it was a little off, but you just kept going."
Nelson Mandela,"As a leader... I have always endeavored to listen to what each and every person in a discussion had to say before venturing my own opinion. Oftentimes, my own opinion will simply represent a con-sensus of what I heard in the discussion. I always remember the axiom: a leader is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind."
Nelson Mandela,"I am accusing the truth commission of being abused and not performing the task which it was supposed to perform,"
Nelson Mandela,reaching the end of a long and heroic struggle.
Nelson Mandela,"It is said that no-one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones,” Mr Mandela has said."

Nelson Mandela,"As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

Nelson Mandela,"A good head and good heart are always a formidable combination. But when you add to that a literate tongue or pen, then you have something very special."
Nelson Mandela,"Those South Africans who berate me for being loyal to our friends, literally they can go and throw themselves into a pool. I am not going to betray the trust of those who helped us."
Nelson Mandela,The time comes in the life of any nation when there remains only two choices - submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defense of our people...
Nelson Mandela,"I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment."
Nelson Mandela,There is no such thing as part freedom
Nelson Mandela,"Of all the observations I have made on the strike, none has brought forth so much heat and emotion as the stress and emphasis we put on non- violence. Our most loyal supporters, whose courage and devotion has never been doubted, unanimously and stren"
Nelson Mandela,"Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that a son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president..."
Nelson Mandela,"I regard it as a duty which I owed, not just to my people, but also to my profession, to the practice of law, and to the justice for all mankind, to cry out against this discrimination which is essentially unjust and opposed to the whole basis of the attitude towards justice which is part of the tradition of legal training in this country. I believed that in taking up a stand against this injustice I was upholding the dignity of what should be an honorable profession."
Nelson Mandela,"Our continent must be allowed to do its own things, charting its course and destiny."
Nelson Mandela,"We need to exert ourselves that much more, and break out of the vicious cycle of dependence imposed on us by the financially powerful: those in command of immense market power and those who dare to fashion the world in their own image"
Nelson Mandela,truly non-racist and non-sexist democracy.
Nelson Mandela,There was much in such a society that was primitive and insecure and it certainly could never measure up to the demands of the present epoch. But in such a society are contained the seeds of revolutionary democracy in which none will be held in slave
Nelson Mandela,a man of extraordinary vision and deep principled commitment to the cause of peace.
Nelson Mandela,"You know you are famous when you discover you have become a comic book character,"
Nelson Mandela,"You know you are really famous when becoming a comic character,"
Nelson Mandela,"Where poverty exists, there is not true freedom, ... The world is hungry for action, not words. I am proud to wear the symbol of this global cause to action."
Nelson Mandela,"And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same."
Og Mandino,"Build this day on a foundation of pleasant thoughts. Never fret at any imperfections that you fear may impede your progress. Remind yourself, as often as necessary, that you are a creature of God and have the power to achieve any dream by lifting up your thoughts. You can fly when you decide that you can. Never consider yourself defeated again. Let the vision in your heart be in your life's blueprint. Smile!"
Og Mandino,"Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another special gift from your Creator, another golden opportunity to complete what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self-starter. Let your first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Don't waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to fail."
Og Mandino,"The only certain means of is to render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what your task may be."
Og Mandino,"Never again clutter your days or nights with so many menial and unimportant things that you have no time to accept a real challenge when it comes along. This applies to play as well as work. A day merely survived is no cause for celebration. You are not here to fritter away your precious hours when you have the ability to accomplish so much by making a slight change in your routine. No more busy work. No more hiding from success. Leave time, leave space, to grow. Now. Now! Not tomorrow!"
Og Mandino,"Opportunities, many times, are so small that we glimpse them not and yet they are often the seeds of great enterprises. Opportunities are also everywhere and so you must always let your hook be hanging. When you least expect it, a great fish will swim by."
Og Mandino,"Whenever you make a mistake or get knocked down by life, don't look back at it too long. Mistakes are life's way of teaching you. Your capacity for occasional blunders is inseparable from your capacity to reach your goals. No one wins them all, and your failures, when they happen, are just part of your growth. Shake off your blunders. How will you know your limits without an occasional failure? Never quit. Your turn will come."
Og Mandino,"Live this day as if it will be your last. Remember that you will only find ''tomorrow'' on the calendars of fools. Forget yesterday's defeats and ignore the problems of tomorrow. This is it. Doomsday. All you have. Make it the best day of your year. The saddest words you can ever utter are, ''If I had my life to live over again. ''Take the baton, now. Run with it! This is your day! Beginning today, treat everyone you meet, friend or foe, loved one or stranger, as if they were going to be dead at midnight. Extend to each person, no matter how trivial the contact, all the care and kindness and understanding and love that you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again."
Og Mandino,"Laugh at yourself and at life. Not in the spirit of derision or whining self-pity, but as a remedy, a miracle drug, that will ease your pain, cure your depression, and help you to put in perspective that seemingly terrible defeat and worry with laughter at your predicaments, thus freeing your mind to think clearly toward the solution that is certain to come. Never take yourself too seriously."
Og Mandino,"One of the great undiscovered joys of life comes from doing everything one attempts to the best of one's ability. There is a special sense of satisfaction, a pride in surveying such a work, a work which is rounded, full, exact, complete in its parts, which the superficial person who leaves his or her work in a slovenly, slipshod, half-finished condition, can never know. It is this conscientious completeness which turns any work into art. The smallest task, well done, becomes a miracle of achievement."
Og Mandino,Deliver more than you are getting paid to do. The victory of success will be half won when you learn the secret of putting out more than is expected in all that you do. Make yourself so valuable in your work that eventually you will become indispensable.
Og Mandino,"Today, and every day, deliver more than you are getting paid to do. The victory of success will be half won when you learn the secret of putting out more than is expected in all that you do. Make yourself so valuable in your work that eventually you will become indispensable. Exercise your privilege to go the extra mile, and enjoy all the rewards you receive. You deserve them!"
Og Mandino,"Every memorable act in the history of the world is a triumph of enthusiasm. Nothing great was ever achieved without it because it gives any challenge or any occupation, no mater how frightening or difficult, a new meaning. Without enthusiasm you are doomed to a life of mediocrity but with it you can accomplish miracles."
Og Mandino,If I feel depressed I will sing. If I feel sad I will laugh. If I feel ill I will double my labor. If I feel fear I will plunge ahead. If I feel inferior I will wear new garments. If I feel uncertain I will raise my voice. If I feel poverty I will think of wealth to come. If I feel incompetent I will think of past success. If I feel insignificant I will remember my goals. Today I will be the master of my emotions.
Og Mandino,"You will achieve grand dream, a day at a time, so set goals for each day -- not long and difficult projects, but chores that will take you, step by step, toward your rainbow. Write them down, if you must, but limit your list so that you won't have to drag today's undone matters into tomorrow. Remember that you cannot build your pyramid in twenty-four hours. Be patient. Never allow your day to become so cluttered that you neglect your most important goal -- to do the best you can, enjoy this day, and rest satisfied with what you have accomplished."
Og Mandino,"The victory of success is half won when one gains the habit of setting goals and achieving them. Even the most tedious chore will become endurable as you parade through each day convinced that every task, no matter how menial or boring, brings you closer to fulfilling your dreams."
Og Mandino,"Never allow anyone to rain on your parade and thus cast a pall of gloom and defeat on the entire day. Remember that no talent, no self-denial, no brains, no character, are required to set up in the fault-finding business. Nothing external can have any power over you unless you permit it. Your time is too precious to be sacrificed in wasted days combating the menial forces of hate, jealously, and envy. Guard your fragile life carefully. Only God can shape a flower, but any foolish child can pull it to pieces."
Og Mandino,"Realize that true happiness lies within you. Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside. Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself."
Og Mandino,"The great difference between those who succeed and those who fail does not consist in the amount of work done by each but in the amount of intelligent work. Many of those who fail most ignominiously do enough to achieve grand success but they labor haphazardly at whatever they are assigned, building up with one hand to tear down with the other. They do not grasp circumstances and change them into opportunities. They have no faculty for turning honest defeats into telling victories. With ability enough and ample time, the major ingredients of success, they are forever throwing back and forth an empty shuttle and the real web of their life is never woven."
Og Mandino,"The weakest living creature, by concentrating his powers on a single object, can accomplish good results while the strongest, by dispersing his effort over many chores, may fail to accomplish anything. Drops of water, by continually falling, hone their passage through the hardest of rocks but the hasty torrent rushes over it with hideous uproar and leaves no trace behind."
Og Mandino,The master of a single trade can support a family. The master of seven trades cannot support himself. The wind is never for the sailor who knows not to what port he is bound.
Og Mandino,"Count your blessings. Once you realize how valuable you are and how much you have going for you, the smiles will return, the sun will break out, the music will play, and you will finally be able to move forward the life that God intended for you with grace, strength, courage, and confidence."
Og Mandino,"Always render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what your task may be."
Og Mandino,It is those who concentrates on but one thing at a time who advance in this world. The great man or woman is the one who never steps outside his or her specialty or foolishly dissipates his or her individuality.
Og Mandino,To be always intending to make a new and better life but never to find time to set about it is as to put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day to the next until you're dead.
Og Mandino,"Beginning today, treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again."
Og Mandino,"Love doesn't sit there like a stone, it has to be made, like bread: remade all the time, made new."
Og Mandino,"I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted."
Og Mandino,"I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand. Henceforth will I apply ALL my efforts to become the highest mountain of all and I will strain my potential until it cries for mercy."
Og Mandino,Sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is... the highway to success.
Og Mandino,"The person who knows one thing and does it better than anyone else, even if it only be the art of raising lentils, receives the crown he merits. If he raises all his energy to that end, he is a benefactor of mankind and its rewarded as such."
Og Mandino,"To do anything truly worth doing, I must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger, but jump in with gusto and scramble through as well as I can."
Og Mandino,"Work as though you would live forever, and live as though you would die today. Go another mile!"
Og Mandino,Tomorrow is only found in the calendar of fools.
Og Mandino,Treasure the love you receive above all. It will survive long after your good health has vanished.
Og Mandino,There is an immeasurable distance between late and too late.
Og Mandino,"Obstacles are necessary for success because in selling, as in all careers of importance, victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats."
Og Mandino,"Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new."
Og Mandino,Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
Og Mandino,"I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars."
Og Mandino,Always seek out the seed of triumph in every adversity.
Og Mandino,"Search for the seed of good in every adversity. Master that principle and you will own a precious shield that will guard you well through all the darkest valleys you must traverse. Stars may be seen from the bottom of a deep well, when they cannot be discerned from the mountaintop. So will you learn things in adversity that you would never have discovered without trouble. There is always a seed of good. Find it and prosper."
Og Mandino,"I will act now. I will act now. I will act now. Henceforth, I will repeat these words each hour, each day, everyday, until the words become as much a habit as my breathing, and the action which follows becomes as instinctive as the blinking of my eyelids. With these words I can condition my mind to perform every action necessary for my success. I will act now. I will repeat these words again and again and again. I will walk where failures fear to walk. I will work when failures seek rest. I will act now for now is all I have. Tomorrow is the day reserved for the labor of the lazy. I am not lazy. Tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed. I am not a failure. I will act now. Success will not wait. If I delay, success will become wed to another and lost to me forever. This is the time. This is the place. I am the person."
Og Mandino,"Let your actions always speak for you, but be forever on guard against the terrible traps of false pride and conceit that can halt your progress. The next time you are tempted to boast, just place your fist in a full pail of water, and when you remove it, the hole remaining will give you a correct measure of your importance."
Og Mandino,"Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later."
Og Mandino,Do all things with love.
Og Mandino,You never know what events are going to transpire to get you home.
Rob Manfred,"We have our regular crews. If somebody gets injured and they're unwilling to work, we'll find somebody willing to work."
Rob Manfred,We are awaiting a formal response from the union. We expect that in the very near future.
Rob Manfred,We've worked very hard on our relationship with the players association. The economics of the sport are strong and the current agreement has worked very well. Those three things are good reason to be optimistic we can get a new agreement without a dispute.
Rob Manfred,"Tip of the iceberg, ... I really do believe this topic is resolvable."
Rob Manfred,The tax mechanism in the last basic agreement would not be acceptable to us this time around.
Mark Mangino,He is absolutely fine. He's going to be back practicing and back to normal. There's nothing to worry about.
Mark Mangino,"You do it in drill work, you do it in team period, you do it in seven-on-seven. You have to create turnovers and address that nearly every day. It's a mind-set that you'll get them in, but it's also a technique."
Mark Mangino,"I think the offensive line will be a strength. We did lose a very good center, and once we get that position solidified, we should be in good shape."
Mark Mangino,Any pressure I have is self-induced. It's just the way I am. I don't feel any extra pressure.
Mark Mangino,"When Charles is running the pass routes, our quarterbacks look better. He's just a phenomenal athlete."
Mark Mangino,"The groups are running better routes and blocking better,"
Mark Mangino,We're going to get in that horse race.
Mark Mangino,Todd has the most to learn about our system. But he will get repetitions. He won't stand around in practice.
Mark Mangino,"I informed him it's in his best interests, and ours, to look for another opportunity and we're assisting him and helping him with a Division II opportunity. He's a good kid. We really like Bruce, but feel like it was in our best interests, and his, to part company."
Mark Mangino,He's going to win a job at one of the guard spots. There is no question in my mind.
Mark Mangino,Our young men have a lot at stake. They want to finish with a winning record. We want to play well for the seniors. We want them to go out in style.
Mark Mangino,"Our kids are ready to play. We've had some very good practices. It's great to be in a bowl game, but it's even better to win a bowl. We're a much more mature team now then when we started four years ago."
Mark Mangino,Normally I give credit to our opponents. But I'm not going to do that today because our kids outplayed them.
Mark Mangino,"Normally I give credit to our opponents, ... But I'm not going to do that today because our kids outplayed them."
Mark Mangino,"Charlton has a lot of heart. I was concerned he couldn't play tonight, and despite all that, he put pressure on the quarterback, he made plays in the running game, he hustled around. It's a real tribute to him because he was very, very ill."
Mark Mangino,"We're still keeping an eye Swanson's health,"
Mark Mangino,"He's what we call a package player. He's not an every-down player for us, but he's a force for us."
Mark Mangino,"Give Tech credit for playing inspired football,"
Mark Mangino,"Let me give you an example. He'll start the winter program like he's suffering from some terrible disease. Then after about three weeks, he'll be fit and get it going. But that's his personality. When he has pressure on him, he gets it done."
Mark Mangino,"We're moving in the right direction and when I feel like, and the coaches feel like, we have the guy who's going to be the starter, we'll make that decision. We don't feel we're under any pressure to do it quickly. We like to set-up we have now and we'll see how it turns out."
Mark Mangino,"Charles is fine. He's doing well, and he's a key guy for us on defense."
Mark Mangino,"We're going to play defense the way that we play defense all the time. They execute well so we have to play sound, fundamental football. That's what we plan to do."
Mark Mangino,"We had an opportunity for our senior class to leave in great fashion. They led us to a winning season for the first time at KU in 10 years, a bowl victory, and you all know all the great things these kids have done leading up to this game."
Mark Mangino,"Collectively, the coaching staff and I agree that this is a class that really meets our needs. I thought our assistant coaches did an outstanding job in evaluating and getting the right kind of kids in front of me."
Mark Mangino,"I'm disturbed that one of our players would be involved in something like this, ... This behavior goes against everything we stand for."
Mark Mangino,"I'm sure you sensed the poise he has. The physical ability he has is hard to overlook. He made some mistakes, a couple of checks he missed. But he was poised."
Joy Maniscalco,"When you do find love--real love, it's the most wonderful, awful feeling in the world. There's nothing like it. Love can make you feel invincible and vulnerable all at the same time. You're trusting someone with the most precious part of you...your heart"
Joy Maniscalco,"I don't need a man to make me happy. I want a man who adds to my happiness in a way that is so indescribable, not even Webster could find written word to explain it."
Joy Maniscalco,"Have you looked around lately? There are more muffin-top, camel-toe, wedgie-assed women on the street than hotdog stands! These women need to take a hard look in the mirror, and be honest with themselves. No one knows what size is labeled on the inside of your clothes. Please, for the love of God, buy the bigger size, because we're all a bit tired of looking at the outline of your labia!"
Joy Maniscalco,"Some day you'll have someone worth holding on to... Someone who won't ever want to let you go...Someone who won't make you wonder if they were the one who got away, because that someone will be right there beside you, thanking the other someone who let you get away."
Joy Maniscalco,"The common misconception is that women who like to be treated a certain way are high maintenance. It's not being high maintenance, it's called having class"
Joy Maniscalco,"Don't be anyone's side dish. If you're in this kind of situation and I'm offending you that's just too bad, because you need to hear it. Reality Check- A man doesn't want a side of broccoli when he has a giant steak in front of him. FYI- You're not the steak."
Wilma Mankiller,Growth is a painful process.
Wilma Mankiller,"If we're ever going to collectively begin to grapple with the problems that we have collectively, we're going to have to move back the veil and deal with each other on a more human level."
Wilma Mankiller,"We've had daunting problems in many critical areas, but I believe in the old Cherokee injunction to be of a good mind. Today it's called positive thinking."
Wilma Mankiller,"One of the things my parents taught me, and I'll always be grateful as a gift, is to not ever let anybody else define me; that for me to define myself . . . and I think that helped me a lot in assuming a leadership position."
Wilma Mankiller,"Prior to my election, young Cherokee girls would never have thought that they might grow up and become chief."
Wilma Mankiller,I want to be remembered as the person who helped us restore faith in ourselves.
Wilma Mankiller,America would be a better place if leaders would do more long-term thinking.
Wilma Mankiller,"Individually and collectively, Cherokee people possess an extraordinary ability to face down adversity and continue moving forward."
Wilma Mankiller,We must trust our own thinking. Trust where we're going. And get the job done.
John Manley,I'm not against building a new school ? I know they need it ? but I'm looking at spending less on a school. I just can't bring myself to vote yes on this.
John Manley,"There are a lot of tech stocks out there to choose from. You can buy IBM ( IBM : Research , Estimates ), a good company, with rising growth rate expectations - you don't have to focus on this or that dot.com."
John Manley,"Both cream and scum can rise to the top, unfortunately. This lower-quality stuff that's going higher isn't doing it on fundamentals."
John Manley,"Whether it's now Prime Minister Stephen Harper or whether it has been other prime ministers in the past, we need to cut the prime minister a bit of slack."
John Manley,"We view this investigation as a very serious matter, ... The information that Jodie may have left voluntarily does not negate the seriousness or the fact that Jodie has been abducted by Phillip Denkler."
John Manley,"I share the ambassador's hope, ... But I don't expect to see it in my lifetime. I don' think we'll go back to Sept. 10. I think the world changed in an irrevocable way; it's unfortunate but that's what we live with."
John Manley,"Greg is at home, and he's improving,"
John Manley,"If you go back and look at this century -- I guess there have been twenty-three presidential elections -- in the six months leading into those elections, there's never been a bad stock market."

David Mann,"My mother-in-law, she never watched cricket in her life and she's watching it,"
David Mann,There appears to be an acceptance of a weaker dollar trend even if Europe and Japan are not happy with it. The Americans are probably only too happy to see the dollar depreciate.

Horace Mann,A teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on a cold iron.
Horace Mann,Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for mankind
Horace Mann,"A house without books is like a room without windows. No man has a right to bring up his children without surrounding them with books, if he has the means to buy them. It is a wrong to his family. Children learn to read by being in the presence of books. The love of knowledge comes with reading and grows upon it. And the love of knowledge, in a young mind, is almost always a warrant against the inferior excitement of passions and vices."
Horace Mann,"I think it's beginning to be very successful; it was always viewed as a long-term project,"

Horace Mann,It is well to think well; it is divine to act well.

Horace Mann,"If any man seeks for greatness, let him forget greatness and ask for truth, and he will find both."

Eli Manning,"It?s good that we won, but the offense did not play well, ... My performance is not OK by me. I?ve got to play better. I can?t turn the ball over like that and give points away."
Eli Manning,"It's good that we won, but the offense did not play well, ... My performance is not OK by me. I've got to play better. I can't turn the ball over like that and give points away."
Eli Manning,I am worried. Obviously you just have to wait and see what the damage is. I'll call my parents later today and they'll probably have a better feel for what's going on. You just pray that people are OK and that the damage is not as bad as it can be.
Eli Manning,It went well. I had no pain.
Eli Manning,"I'm still a young quarterback, ... I'm only in my eighth game starting. I'm still going to make mistakes. I'm going to see different looks every game that I'm going to have to make decisions on."
Eli Manning,"I didn't play well, and I made too many mistakes for us to win today. It was not the way I wanted to come out and play."
Eli Manning,I didn't play well. I didn't make enough plays. I made too many mistakes for us to win.
Eli Manning,"I'm upset. Today, I didn't play well. I made mistakes and I didn't make enough plays to give us a chance. It was not the way I wanted to come out and play today."
Eli Manning,"It's a protective thing. When you throw and plant, the knee is kind of vulnerable."
Eli Manning,"I still have a lot of room for improvement on things and being a more consistent player, ... but as the season goes on, I'll be able to improve on that. But I think I am better than I was last year."
Eli Manning,"It doesn't happen automatically, ... Sometimes it comes from hard work and repetition. After being with someone for a long period of time you start to get it. Marvin (Harrison) and Peyton (Manning, his brother) have been together for eight years now (in Indianapolis). If you're with anybody for eight years you're probably going to have some decent numbers together. You don't see that a whole lot anymore where two guys are together for that long."
Eli Manning,"When I came to Ole Miss, everyone expected me to bring the program back to its glory days. I didn't want to put that kind of pressure on myself."
Eli Manning,"I think everybody knows what to expect from Coach Coughlin, ... The five minutes early, that's just part of it. Now you know how it is. No one talks about it any more . . . . That's just the way it is. There are no ifs, ands or buts about it. Everybody knows we've got to get better. We need some discipline to be a better team than we were last year."
Eli Manning,"As a young quarterback you still have to take advantage of the situation that you're in. I think from just watching my brother and hearing about my dad, I understand that you might not have this chance again."
Peyton Manning,We'll go back to work. That's all I know to do. That's all this team knows to do.
Peyton Manning,I cannot argue with the truth or try to counter any point. That's a fact. It's disappointing when you don't win the game. That's the simple fact.
Peyton Manning,I cannot argue with the truth. I'm not going to try and counter any points. That's the fact. It's certainly not from a lack of effort on my part. I can honestly say that. . . . I'm just going to keep trying. That's all I can say.
Peyton Manning,This year they elevated their game. I sleep a lot better on Saturday nights. I don't feel like I have to go out there and score 40.
Peyton Manning,"I followed Marshall from his high school days down in New Orleans, ... I remember him on the cover of the prep section one year. He was always real special for me and he gave me some good advice."
Peyton Manning,"I'm proud of Ran. He did a good job of running the ball up in there. He was feeling a little full of himself after last night's Tennessee-Florida game I guess,"
Peyton Manning,"This is probably a little telltale of what we're going to see the rest of the season,"
Peyton Manning,"Mike and I did that on purpose to win it like that, ... Seriously, and we haven't been lying to you, it has been a closed book on the topic since February."
Peyton Manning,I'm going to be a good teammate here. We had a few protection problems. It will be more disappointing tomorrow. It certainly takes time to move on from a game like this.
Peyton Manning,"I've never taken for granted what we've had, not for one single game, not one single practice, ... I've truly been blessed."
Peyton Manning,"I think defenses like to make the offense go the long route, that's our philosophy. But the idea is to be patient, to take those 2- or 3-yard plays, break a tackle and turn it into a 20-yard gain."
Peyton Manning,"Pittsburgh, Monday night, they're just going to keep getting bigger and bigger."
Peyton Manning,"Last season is over with. If we can eliminate some of our mental mistakes, I feel we can find that rhythm. We certainly have the players to move the ball to score."
Peyton Manning,"The mistakes that are being made are correctable, and we'd like to see those get corrected so we have a better feeling going into the season, ... You'd sure like to see these things now when you can correct them."
Peyton Manning,"The mistakes that are being made are correctable, and we'd like to see those get corrected so we have a better feeling going into the season. You'd sure like to see these things now when you can correct them."
Peyton Manning,"Some guys need to see things on a grease board, ... I like when you can see it in your mind. And that's what Marvin does, too. He visualizes. He sees things in his mind so well."
Peyton Manning,I think [offensive coordinator] Tom Moore kind of had it in his mind that he wanted to throw deep on the first play.
Peyton Manning,"I think [offensive coordinator] Tom Moore kind of had it in his mind that he wanted to throw deep on the first play,"
Peyton Manning,"We kind of talked about it, about the third series or so, just amongst ourselves and the offensive line. We were hot early and we kind of stayed hot. We talked about being in a rhythm. 'Let's keep doing it. Let's don't self-destruct."
Peyton Manning,We're committed to find kids in need and give them a hand.
Peyton Manning,"That hurt was real and personal because me and my brother grew up in Louisiana. We knew those streets, neighborhoods and businesses and felt compelled to do something."
Peyton Manning,"To my brother Eli and me, the hurt was real and it was personal. The whole town of New Orleans is really like family to us. They weren't just pictures on the news to us. We knew the streets, the businesses, the neighborhoods, because we grew up there. It's different when it's your hometown that's ripped apart and washed away."
Peyton Manning,We need some other things to happen. But it's nice to have hope.
Peyton Manning,"I hope I can always call Marvin a teammate, ... It's hard to envision lining up there and not seeing No. 88 out on the right. It's a very comfortable feeling as a quarterback."
Peyton Manning,"It's an honor and privilege to be able to call Marvin a teammate, ... He's an outstanding player. He and I have combined for a lot of touchdowns and a lot of wins, but it's because of a lot of hard work. He has a tremendous work ethic, and I feel privileged to call him teammate."
Peyton Manning,"It's a tremendous honor for me and truly special for a number of reasons, the first one being for the person that it's named for. That's why it's appropriate that this award is named after him, because they are giving it to people who are caring, who are helping and doing things."
Peyton Manning,You certainly feel like (playing at home) should be an advantage. But you've still got to go out there and convert third downs and score touchdowns in the red zone and protect the ball and stop people.
Peyton Manning,"There is no question we were in good position with home field and having the bye. At this point, it is hard to swallow."
Peyton Manning,"This is two undefeated teams from the AFC South playing already, and this is a home game, ... So there is a lot riding on this one. A Week 2 game could be the most important game of the season."
Peyton Manning,"There was one guy behind me just giving me the full gamut. He covered my dad, to my mom, to Eli [his brother]. He didn't want to leave anybody out, and that was after getting after me. ... But then you've got some like, 'We love the Titans, but we still love you, Peyton.' That kind of stuff. I understand."
Peyton Manning,"The disappointing thing is that we played really well this year for a number of games. Certainly, two of the last three games here -- San Diego and Pittsburgh -- we got outplayed. There's no question it's disappointing. There is no question we were in good position with home field and having the bye. At this point, it is hard to swallow."
Peyton Manning,"The disappointing thing is that we played really well this year for a number of games. But certainly two of the last three games here, San Diego and Pittsburgh, we got outplayed. There's no question it's disappointing. There is no question we were in good position with home field and having the bye. At this point, it is hard to swallow."
Peyton Manning,"The key for him is to learn from this game. Six games from now or maybe 12 games from now, he'll look back and realize that this experience helped him."
Peyton Manning,"We may be 13-0, but there's still plenty of football left."
Peyton Manning,"We weren't a super football team my first year, but we grew during the season. We got better and better ... and hopefully Alex gets the benefits of his experiences, too."
Peyton Manning,"The whole town is like family, so it's very much a personal issue."
Peyton Manning,"I think everyone had Coach Dungy and his family on our minds. Our prayers are with him. But when you are out there playing, then you are out there trying to do your job."
Peyton Manning,I think everybody had coach and his family on their minds throughout the entire second half of the week and during the game.
Peyton Manning,"There's got to be a little give and take here (with the Hall of Fame), ... We're going to stay strong and keep this one."
Peyton Manning,"That was an excellent team, and a tough environment coming in here. We knew it was going to be a tough four quarters. It was."
Peyton Manning,"I was proud of our defense. I always have been. We're a team here, and we win as a unit. We win as the Colts. This was a combined effort."
Peyton Manning,It was good to get some rhythm. We got some confidence.
Peyton Manning,"Everyone wants to win their first game, and everyone wants it to be just like college, but it's not, ... It is the NFL for a reason. It's a big adjustment. It's tough going against an excellent defense in your first start. ... Six games or a year from now, you look back on these games and you say, 'I hated to go through it, but it helped me become a better player.'"
Peyton Manning,"Everyone wants to win their first game, and everyone wants it to be just like college, but it's not, ... It is the NFL for a reason. It's a big adjustment. Six games or a year from now, you look back on these games and you say, 'I hated to go through it, but it helped me become a better player.'"
Peyton Manning,"It feels like college when you're going to lose the seniors. I certainly like our team this year. We had good guys, guys you wanted to win for and win with."
Peyton Manning,"Everyone wants to win their first game, and everyone wants it to be just like college, but it's not,"
Peyton Manning,"I have an appreciation for what Young and Rice did as a tandem. They threw a lot of touchdowns, but those touchdowns were helping the team win football games. That's what Marvin and I are about. He and I have definitely done some things together, but it's all come along with helping our team win games."
Peyton Manning,I'm the best Manning.
Peyton Manning,You hear about how many fourth quarter comebacks that a guy has and I think it means a guy screwed up in the first three quarters.
Preston Manning,Canada is the only country founded on the relentless pursuit of the rodent.
Preston Manning,"There is a whole school of Canadian academics, media personalities, and politicians whose definition of a Canadian is a North American who fears or dislikes the United States."
Preston Manning,"Do not ghettoize society by putting people into legal categories of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or other such characteristics."
Nigel Mansell,"The rivalry between us all will be no different from those glory days back in the 1980s and 90s but given the challenges this time round, the demands of racing will be tougher for all concerned,"
Nigel Mansell,"The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger."
Nigel Mansell,Racing a thoroughbred grand prix car in front of a home crowd will be a surreal and mighty experience.
Nigel Mansell,"My grandfather always told me that it is no good lying on a hospital bed saying, 'I had the right of way', ... That's one of the reasons I was so pleased that the boys could do the IAM test as well."
Katherine Mansfield,Regret is an appalling waste of energy; you can't build on it; it's only good for wallowing in.
Katherine Mansfield,Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change.
Katherine Mansfield,"I want, by understanding myself, to understand others. I want to be all that I am capable of becoming."
Katherine Mansfield,I want to be all that I am capable of becoming.
Katherine Mansfield,If only one could tell true love from false love as one can tell mushrooms from toadstools
Katherine Mansfield,"I am treating you as my friend, asking you to share my present minuses in the hope that I can ask you to share my future pluses."
Katherine Mansfield,Some couples go over their budgets very carefully every month. Others just go over them.
Katherine Mansfield,"Risk! Risk anything! Care no more for the opinions of others, for those voices. Do the hardest thing on earth for you. Act for yourself. Face the truth."
Katherine Mansfield,"I always felt that the great high privilege, relief and comfort of friendship was that one had to explain nothing."
Lord Mansfield,True liberty can exist only when justice is equally administered to all.
Lord Mansfield,"Let justice be done, though the heavens fall."
Lord Mansfield,"It is needless to enter into many reasons for quashing the conviction, when one alone is sufficient"
Charles Manson,Look down at me and you see a fool; look up at me and you see a god; look straight at me and you see yourself
Charles Manson,"I started, 'In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit ... '"
Charles Manson,My father is the jailhouse. My father is your system.... I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you.
Charles Manson,"Believe me, if I started murdering peopleâ€¦ there'd be none of you left!"
Charles Manson,"A baby is born into this world in a state of fear. Total paranoia and awareness. He sees the world with eyes not used yet. As he grows up, his parents lay all this stuff on him. They tell him, when they should be letting him tell them. Let the children lead you."
Marilyn Manson,"The path to truth is obscured by frivolous lawsuits, but it's lit by the objectivity of a jury that sees the difference between entertainment and assault. I feel completely vindicated and I'd like to thank the jury and judge for their thoughtful verdict."
Marilyn Manson,"I speak in reality. I don't try to hide anything from anybody, and that's the most dangerous thing about our music that parents are so afraid of."
Marilyn Manson,"If someone listen's to our music, and it makes them creative, that makes me happier than anything."
Marilyn Manson,"I think every man and woman is a star. It's just a matter of realizing and becoming it. It's all a matter of willpower. The world is just how you see it. If you want to have other people tell you how to see it, then you can. But if you want to look at it differently, then it's limitless what you can do. That's why I don't feel the need to be one person. I can be as many people as I like."
Marilyn Manson,I like to pose the question to myself: Am I a man who thinks he's an Angel or an Angel who thinks he's a man?
Marilyn Manson,the fact that nobody liked me at school began to fade out of my mind like blue magic marker reminders scrawled on the back of a greasy fist.
Marilyn Manson,"There's nothing like the feeling of knowing that you've made a difference in someone's life, even if that differnce is a lifetime of nightmares and a fortune in therapy bills."
Marilyn Manson,It's these sick things they have been making up in their own heads. I didn't tell them these lies. So who is really the sick person?
Marilyn Manson,"So anybody with any bit of intelligence has got to be pissed off because if they see how things are in the world, they're not going to be happy with it."
Marilyn Manson,"I hope so, I mean, I don't expect everyone to get something, you know, deep out of it. Some people can just listen to it for the music or get their aggressions out, but I think with any great painting or movie or album, or whatever, it's better if people can take what they need from it, that they're not expected to get some particular message."
Marilyn Manson,"I'm everything they are afraid of. Everything they hate. Everything they try to hide and a lot more. Besides, I speak my mind and show people what's out there in reality."
Marilyn Manson,Why should we believe in a god that doesn't believe in us?
Marilyn Manson,"The word 'Antichrist' ,to me, is the collective disbelief in god."
Marilyn Manson,Being your own god really has nothing to do with Satan.
Marilyn Manson,I'm not against God. I'm against the Misuse of God.
Marilyn Manson,"I don't like fun, it upsets me."
Marilyn Manson,"Kids need to start thinking for themselves. Not to be like their friends who think they're individuals. I don't want you to be like us, I want you to be like you."
Marilyn Manson,"If I believed in an outside force that we wanted to call God - and I believe that there is one, maybe it's not necessarily supposed to be worshiped - I think it would appreciate what I say, because I can't see God wanting to create a world full of idiots."
Marilyn Manson,"You can't force someone to see the truth, just like you can't force a blind man to see."
Marilyn Manson,"Good and evil go hand in hand, you can't seperate them."
Marilyn Manson,"There is good and evil within all of us, and I enjoy searching to bring that out through my music. I like it that there are questions brought out by my music. People must look inside themselves for the answers."
Marilyn Manson,"Thinking for yourself, that's scarier than any devil image."
Marilyn Manson,"I've never been or never will be a Satan Worshipper, or someone who worships the Devil."
Marilyn Manson,"My desire is to be pure again and not dirtied by the world. But it's my duty to be as ugly and filthy as I am, so the audience can experience what I have."
Marilyn Manson,"I think that if our music didn't mean anything to anyone, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. I don't think that people would want to hear what I had to say if they didn't like our music. At the same time, I don't want people to just get away with just liking our music. They need to accept the baggage that comes along with it."
Marilyn Manson,"I fear being like everyone I hate, I fear failure, I fear losing control. I love balancing between chaos and control with everything I do. I always have a fear of going one way or another, getting lost in something, or losing everything to get lost in. And I fear being a completely acceptable sheep in society."
Marilyn Manson,That's the key. You make your body a place where germs don't wanna live.
Marilyn Manson,They'll see it. And it doesn't matter if they don't. It's only Rock 'n' Roll. But I do intend to move more into the Mainstream. Marilyn Manson is just the First phase.
Marilyn Manson,This is the culture you're raising your kids in. Don't be surprised if it blows up in your face.
Marilyn Manson,"The word 'Antichrist', to me, is the collective disbelief in god."
Marilyn Manson,I think art is the only thing that's spiritual in the world. And I refuse to forced to believe in other people's interpretations of God. I don't think anybody should be. No one person can own the copyright to what God means.
Marilyn Manson,A lot of people don't want to make their own decisions. They're too scared. It's much easier to be told what to do.
Marilyn Manson,"In the end we're all Jerry Springer Show guests, really, we just haven't been on the show."
Marilyn Manson,"Find out what's really out there. I never said to be like me, I say be like you and make a difference."
Marilyn Manson,Music is the strongest form of magic.
Marilyn Manson,These people are artists. These people are musicians. They're taking it out and trying to express it that way.
Marilyn Manson,"When all of your wishes are granted, many of your dreams will be destroyed."
Marilyn Manson,Part of me is afraid to get close to people because I'm afraid that they're going to leave.
Marilyn Manson,"I never said to be like me, I say to be like you and make a difference."
Marilyn Manson,"The burden of originality is one that most people don't want to accept. They'd rather sit in front of the TV and let that tell them what they're supposed to like, what they're supposed to buy, and what they're supposed to laugh at."
Marilyn Manson,People tend to associate anyone who looks and behaves differently with illegal or immoral activity.
Marilyn Manson,"We live in a society of victimization, where people are much more comfortable being victimized than actually standing up for themselves."
Marilyn Manson,"Marilyn Monroe wasn't even her real name, Charles Manson isn't his real name, and now, I'm taking that to be my real name. But what's real? You can't find the truth, you just pick the lie you like the best."
Marilyn Manson,"Anybody intelligent enough to realize what America is, is not going to sit around and do nothing about it. They're going to be the same way that I am. They're going to be the same way our fans are. They're going to be pissed."
Marilyn Manson,"When you're taught to love everyone, to love your enemies, then what value does that place on love?"
Mickey Mantle,He who has the fastest golf cart never has a bad lie
Mickey Mantle,I had it all and blew it.
Mickey Mantle,"My dad taught me to switch-hit. He and my grandfather, who was left-handed, pitched to me everyday after school in the back yard. I batted lefty against my dad and righty against my granddad."
Mickey Mantle,He who has the fastest golf cart never has a bad lie.
Mickey Mantle,My views are just about the same as Casey's.
Mickey Mantle,"As far as I'm concerned, Aaron is the best ball player of my era. He is to baseball of the last fifteen years what Joe DiMaggio was before him. He's never received the credit he's due."
Mickey Mantle,I guess you could say I'm what this country is all about.
Mickey Mantle,Hitting the ball was easy. Running around the bases was the tough part.
Mickey Mantle,"I always loved the game, but when my legs weren't hurting it was a lot easier to love."
Mickey Mantle,Roger Maris was as good a man and as good a ballplayer as there ever was.
Mickey Mantle,The only thing I can do is play baseball. I have to play ball. It's the only thing I know.
Mickey Mantle,"Today's Little Leaguers, and there are millions of them each year, pick up how to hit and throw and field just by watching games on TV. By the time they're out of high school, the good ones are almost ready to play professional ball."
Mickey Mantle,"If I knew I was going to live this long, I'd have taken better care of myself."
Mickey Mantle,The biggest game I ever played in was probably Don Larsen's perfect game.
Mickey Mantle,Heroes are people who are all good with no bad in them. That's the way I always saw Joe DiMaggio. He was beyond question one of the greatest players of the century.
Mickey Mantle,"Somebody once asked me if I ever went up to the plate trying to hit a home run. I said, 'Sure, every time.'"
Mickey Mantle,"Well, baseball was my whole life. Nothing's ever been as fun as baseball."
Mickey Mantle,To play 18 years in Yankee Stadium is the best thing that could ever happen to a ballplayer.
Mickey Mantle,"Sometimes I think if I had the same body and the same natural ability and someone else's brain, who knows how good a player I might have been."
Charlie Manuel,"I worry about my pitching, and I'm sure other guys worry."
Charlie Manuel,"That doesn't worry me. Setting up is a lot like closing. I've seen Gordon pitch a lot. I think he's still got good stuff, the same stuff as two years ago when I saw him. I think he's going to do the job for us."
Charlie Manuel,"When he got in trouble, he got better. Whether we helped him, I don't know. We just couldn't get the hit when we needed it."
Charlie Manuel,"Even more impressive was, when he got in trouble, he pitched better,"
Charlie Manuel,He started having trouble with his command. He started to get the ball up. It looked like he started to overthrow the ball.
Charlie Manuel,"Yeah, he had some trouble in that first inning and gave up four runs. He just had a little trouble getting the ball down. But he's fine. He had his breaking ball working real good."
Charlie Manuel,"He has talent. He can do some things. He has a lot of tools and is more patient at the plate. In Spring Training, his swing was out of control."
Charlie Manuel,The fact that he has talent plays into it.
Charlie Manuel,They've got all winter to rest.
Charlie Manuel,"We got to win on the homestand, and we probably got to start taking two out of three the rest of the season. We've got 25 games to play, and we've got to win some games. All those (contending) teams aren't going to play .500."
Charlie Manuel,It gives us more options. Nunez is a switch-hitter. Gonzalez is a right-hander with power. This lets us do more things off the bench.
Charlie Manuel,It's kind of a rhythm thing.
Charlie Manuel,"Of course, we've got to play better at home. Basically, what I'm saying is that we've got to play better, period, whether we're at home or on the road."
Charlie Manuel,The guys were working and fighting hard every game to win. That's what we want and how we want to build as the regular season starts.
Charlie Manuel,"We've stayed after it. We don't give in. We don't crumble. We have a lot of determination. We talk about that a lot. It comes back to having fun. When you don't tighten up, you don't think about losing."
Charlie Manuel,"Our destiny is in our hands. If we're going to win the East or be a wild-card team, now's the time to step up. Right now we're kind of even, so we're going to see how good we are."
Charlie Manuel,"We had some inconsistency in our starting pitching, in our offense, and even in our defense. We needed to play better. We needed to win some more games."
Charlie Manuel,"Once this road trip is over, if we stay where we're at until September, we can control our own destiny."
Charlie Manuel,"They played the best baseball in our division. If we played the best baseball, we would win. Evidently, we didn't play the best baseball."
Charlie Manuel,That's OK. We'll keep winning and it will be back to baseball.
Charlie Manuel,We should definitely have a big crowd. I know people in Philadelphia are good baseball fans.
Charlie Manuel,He?s going to leave the park if he swings at good balls. He just hit through that pitch. It was already up (in the zone) and he popped it out of the yard.
Charlie Manuel,"If you're patient, you'll get pitches to hit. [Howard's] been chasing some bad balls."
Charlie Manuel,"We started chasing bad balls and not waiting for our pitch [later in the game]. It disturbs me when we're not patient. I talk every day about not working the count. Once the game starts, they're on their own as far as working the pitcher."
Marquand Manuel,I just went from oldest to youngest. I didn't want to take the older ones away from work too long.
Marquand Manuel,I think guys will be focused. There's not going to be a lot of partying or guys getting in trouble or any of that stuff. The character of this team is different. This team is focused. All these guys are focused and hungry.
Marquand Manuel,"At this level, to have the guys that we have, at corner and safety and linebacker, every team doesn't have that. And then to have the caliber of guys; we've got guys that could go on other teams and start."
Marquand Manuel,"He has to learn the game at a different speed at safety. I love how he gets at it. He's young, and he's hungry. He'll be a Pro Bowler before it's all said and done. Probably next year, in fact."
Marquand Manuel,You don't get that many chances to play in these types of games. You've got to go out there and give it your best shot.
Marquand Manuel,I've never missed that many tackles in a game. Ever.
Marquand Manuel,Dreams do come true. You've got to keep working hard because you never know when your opportunity will come.
Marquand Manuel,"We played defense here, too."
Marquand Manuel,"After Mom and Dad, I started with the oldest and worked my way down. The youngest ones, sorry, just aren't going to be able to come."
Marquand Manuel,"I was determined to be better than everyone -- get better grades, be a better athlete."
Marquand Manuel,"It was a lot of fun. The biggest thing is that it taught me how to overcome adversity, how to pick and choose friends and how to trust people. I think that's the biggest thing."
Richard Manuel,There are no managers like there used to be managers.
Richard Manuel,I still don't know how to read music.
Richard Manuel,I play patterns. I'll make up a pattern and just play it.
Richard Manuel,I love the season changes.
Robert Mapplethorpe,You're never going to get anywhere in life if you don't live up to your obligations.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"With photography, you zero in; you put a lot of energy into short moments, and then you go on to the next thing."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"Whether it's an orgy or a cocktail party, I know how to do it."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"Whenever you make love to someone, there should be three people involved - you, the other person, and the devil."
Robert Mapplethorpe,This AIDS stuff is pretty scary. I hope I don't get it.
Robert Mapplethorpe,The photographs that are art have to be separated from the rest - then preserved.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"The more pictures you see, the better you are as a photographer."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"The best picture I got was Bianca Jagger whispering in Mick's ear. I caught them telling a secret, which is sort of rude."
Robert Mapplethorpe,Sell the public flowers... things that they can hang on their walls without being uptight.
Robert Mapplethorpe,People don't have time to wait for somebody to paint their portraits anymore. The money is in photography.
Robert Mapplethorpe,One must ease the public into it - that's an art in itself.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"My theory about creativity is that the more money one has, the more creative one can be."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"My lifestyle is bizarre, but the only thing you need to know is where the darkroom is."
Robert Mapplethorpe,Just because I was out at the bars all the time didn't mean I wasn't looking for someone to love.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"If I have to change my lifestyle, I don't want to live."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"If I am at a party, I want to be at the party. Too many photographers use the camera to avoid participating in things. They become professional observers."
Robert Mapplethorpe,I've never lied. I think I've lived a moral life.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I'm not a photojournalist.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I wish I could be elegant.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I went into photography because it seemed like the perfect vehicle for commenting on the madness of today's existence.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I should try to get some sleep as one doesn't know what tomorrow may bring.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I see things like they've never been seen before. Art is an accurate statement of the time in which it is made.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I recorded that because it happened to me. I wasn't making a point.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"I played around with the flowers and the lighting, so that was a good way to educate myself."
Robert Mapplethorpe,I just want to be written about as a normal artist.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I just try to live my life and do my thing.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I just hope I can live long enough to see the fame.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I don't think any collector knows his true motivation.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I don't know why my pictures come out looking so good. I just don't get it.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I don't believe in dogmas and theologies. I just believe in being a good person.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"I can't have just anybody assisting me, I need somebody who I can really communicate with."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"I am selfish, but that's an attribute that all artists possess."
Robert Mapplethorpe,"I am obsessed with beauty. I want everything to be perfect, and of course it isn't. And that's a tough place to be because you're never satisfied."
Robert Mapplethorpe,I always thought I was good. That's why it was so frustrating when other people didn't agree.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"Happiness? No, it's not there for me."
Robert Mapplethorpe,Beauty and the devil are the same thing.
Robert Mapplethorpe,I'm looking for the unexpected. I'm looking for things I've never seen before.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"My father wants me to be like my brother, but I can't be."
Robert Mapplethorpe,I would never have done what I'd done if I'd considered my father as somebody I wanted to please.
Robert Mapplethorpe,"When I work, and in my art, I hold hands with God."
Robert Mapplethorpe,To make pictures big is to make them more powerful.
John Mara,There's definitely some truth to that.
John Mara,I'm sure he is aware of the state's responsibility.
John Mara,"I go down on the field for practice maybe once a week. And that's another place where I look over to the corner, the place where he liked to watch from, and expect to see him."
John Mara,"Since he took over for Pete Rozelle, we've had unparalleled prosperity, popularity and labor peace. I think he, as much as anybody, is responsible for that."
John Mara,We were very pleased about it. It's a fitting and meaningful way to honor my father. He was always more concerned about the game on the field than anything else. I don't know that he would have allowed it if he were still here. He didn't like things being named after him.
John Mara,Never in my wildest dreams did I expect them to pitch a shutout like that.
John Mara,"Never in my wildest dreams did I expect them to pitch a shutout like that,"
John Mara,"Never in my wildest dreams did I expect them to pitch a shutout, ... I just wish he could have been there to see it. I think he would have been pretty pleased, to be honest with you. He would have had a big smile on his face."
John Mara,"But I do feel like we now have a binding agreement, and that the state is committed to going forward with us."
Wellington Mara,You can believe that he was taught to love and respect all mankind - but to fear no man.
Wellington Mara,We didn't readjust our thinking or rebuild quick enough.
Wellington Mara,These days I'm pretty much a businessman.
Wellington Mara,"The Church, presumably in the person of Cardinal O'Connor, had at one time refused to let the Governor preach in certain churches and school halls."
Wellington Mara,The Church has never changed its teaching on the sanctity of human life - it didn't make up a rule for the convenience of a particular time like a rule at a country club as the Governor would have us believe.
Wellington Mara,The Church does not pretend to be scientists. It teaches based upon what science tells it.
Wellington Mara,Self-justification is a treacherous servant.
Wellington Mara,Pop knew absolutely nothing about pro football.
Wellington Mara,Maybe since I was 35 years old it was time to go upstairs.
Wellington Mara,"Just as it had taken centuries to determine the true nature of the universe, so also the search for the beginning of human life proceeded well into the 20th century."
Wellington Mara,"In trying to scramble out of a hole, it sometimes digs it deeper."
Wellington Mara,"I think when the bottom started to drop out, we didn't recognize it."
Wellington Mara,I always root for the defense.
Steve Maraboli,"In this busy world, we should never be a stranger to love and compassion. It is the fertile soil in the garden of peace."
Steve Maraboli,The nourishment of our souls comes from the smiles of others.
Steve Maraboli,"You are where you are right now because of the actions you've taken, or maybe, the inaction you've taken."
Steve Maraboli,Today is the only day in which we have any power.
Stephon Marbury,He told me he could do whatever he wants with this franchise and that he don't want to trade me. And that he wanted me to be here and that everything that basically went on throughout the last week was over with.
Stephon Marbury,"The way our luck has been going, I'm not surprised. If this had been during the six-game winning streak (in January), when it was really fun, I would probably say, 'Nah, it wouldn't go in.' But everybody gets their day. It just wasn't our day."
Stephon Marbury,"I think it's a bunch of different things. There's a lot of teaching going on, a lot of learning the new system."
Stephon Marbury,Everything is an adjustment because everyone is learning each other.
Stephon Marbury,I wasn't caught up in the emotion. I thought I got fouled.
Stephon Marbury,"I don't think we want to be the worst team in the league. It's not by design. At this stage in the season we've got to continue to play hard, just to get better for next year. We're all losers -- whoever doesn't win the championship."
Stephon Marbury,"Of course, consistency is always the best teacher. I guess Coach feels differently."
Stephon Marbury,It's unbelievable for a coach to have that many wins.
Stephon Marbury,"I guess Coach felt like the team that was out there was doing the job, and them guys were, I always want to be on the court."
Stephon Marbury,"I don't know what Coach is going to do,"
Stephon Marbury,Coach is down for that.
Stephon Marbury,"I hope so. We need him right now, we've been playing really good basketball."
Stephon Marbury,You see little babies floating in the river ...
Stephon Marbury,"I see them little kids crying, I just think about my kids, about my son. You see little babies floating in the river. It's amazing. Amazing; these people are still just going. You complain about the littlest things. But we're so fortunate to breathe and walk, knowing all of this is going on."
Stephon Marbury,"I see the kids, ... and I just think about my kids. You see babies floating in the river. We complain about the littlest things. I mean, we're so fortunate for so many reasons; we can breathe, we can walk. It's not even about money. It's more about everybody's responsibility. This is about how you treat people. To see this every day, you know that this is going on and you got people, they don't care about it."
Sophie Marceau,You know I could stop working as an actress and still be doing promotion on movies I did ten years ago. And I don't like to do the same thing forever.
Sophie Marceau,"You know French means like sophisticated, well educated, so far."
Sophie Marceau,You can perform all kind of characters but you cannot change what people feel for you.
Sophie Marceau,"Words, yes, formulating things, creating something from your heart, it is something very necessary, yes."
Sophie Marceau,When you work with a director like this you don't have a real challenge because he makes the work very easy. He knows what he wants as a director.
Sophie Marceau,"When you direct your first film, you always start by telling stories that you are familiar with."
Sophie Marceau,"What's nice is that when you have to put a wig on, funny costumes, You know it's like being a little girl playing with accessories."
Sophie Marceau,What I am interested in is the present time.
Sophie Marceau,Well it is sometimes difficult to act in another language.
Sophie Marceau,To be honest I don't really know because I really didn't care when I was writing about mixing up reality with what was not reality.
Sophie Marceau,"There is no doubt that this film is autobiographical, but at the same time it also tries to portray an ordinary couple in a language that everyone can understand."
Sophie Marceau,"Sometimes you choose the wrong actor, he could be the best actor ever, but he's not cast in the right part then it doesn't work."
Sophie Marceau,"So, sometimes, when I'm not happy with my performance and I have to think, I will think in English."
Sophie Marceau,"Oh, I'm not English, I cannot talk on behalf of an English person. I'm French. I can say about French. They are quite emotional, though, and they talk about their emotions."
Sophie Marceau,Mel Gibson would not be a good James Bond.
Sophie Marceau,"It is personal, very honest, intimate, I would say, but sometimes the story, the anecdote, can be more or less mine - or not mine."
Sophie Marceau,I'm a good storyteller.
Sophie Marceau,I think it's almost easier to make people cry than to make people laugh.
Sophie Marceau,"I just heard a very funny story about somebody who died yesterday, I'm sorry to say so but it was so absurd that you can't help laughing. And the person that was concerned about that story was laughing too."
Sophie Marceau,"I have been making films for the last 25 years and have played characters created and inspired by others, and I often enjoyed myself doing that."
Sophie Marceau,I find the subject of childhood fascinating. I explored this subject in Speak to me of love and I am curious about portraying the often painful transition into the adult world.
Sophie Marceau,"Genre aside, I'd like to make a film about people."
Sophie Marceau,"Even if I think in English, it's more a language of acting than French."
Sophie Marceau,"But the privileges that one has enjoyed and exploited can sometimes turn against you: nobody thinks of you as a director, you are always an actress."
Sophie Marceau,"As you know it is a comedy so everything is a little bit pushed. That's what's funny about this kind of movie is you can laugh about the absurdity, and the bad side of life."
Sophie Marceau,"And that's how you have to be smart, is are you believable in this part or aren't you believable. And it has nothing to do with your talent."
Sophie Marceau,"And that's how the world, I think, imagines French women you know like very womanly and seducing men and that's how they like to imagine them."
Sophie Marceau,"And I think it's very rare to have good stories, well written comedies."
Sophie Marceau,"I want to spread my curiosity and my abilities farther than my continent, because I think being an actress is something universal, ... And I want to have more choices."
Gabriel Marcel,The wise man knows how to run his life so that contemplation is Possible.
Gabriel Marcel,"The striking thing about the Precious Blood is the bond it establishes between love and suffering in our experience, a bond that has become so close that we have come to think of suffering accepted with joy as the most authentic sign of love with any depth at all."
Gabriel Marcel,"The dynamic element in my philosophy, taken as a whole, can be seen as an obstinate and untiring battle against the spirit of abstraction."
Gabriel Marcel,On a grassroots level we say that man can touch more than he can grasp.
Gabriel Marcel,Music at times is more like perfume than mathematics.
Gabriel Marcel,Metaphysics is a science.
Gabriel Marcel,It is right that we be concerned with the scientific probity of metaphysics.
Gabriel Marcel,Contemporary thinkers would say that man is continuously transcending himself.
Gabriel Marcel,Contemplation and wisdom are highest achievements and man is not totally at home with them.
Gabriel Marcel,"But however measurable, there is much more life in music than mathematics or logic ever dreamed of."
Gabriel Marcel,But a science is exact to the extent that its method measures up to and is adequate to its object.
Rocky Marciano,Look at the blood!
Rocky Marciano,I have always adhered to two principles. The first one is to train hard and get in the best possible physical condition. The second is to forget all about the other fellow until you face him in the ring and the bell sounds for the fight.
Rocky Marciano,I don't want to be remembered as a beaten champion.
Rocky Marciano,"In the ring, I never really knew fear."
Rocky Marciano,"I believe, in my prime, I could have fought with anybody alive."
Rocky Marciano,What could be better than walking down any street in any city and knowing you're the heavyweight champion of the world?
Rocky Marciano,Why waltz with a guy for 10 rounds if you can knock him out in one?
Rocky Marciano,"I was on my face. I heard the count from one to 10. I kept telling myself that I had to get up, but I couldn't move. I couldn't make myself move. It was the strangest feeling."
Imelda Marcos,I think it is incredible the way it has shaped up in the last few years. India has the courage to show the world what it has pulled off and many can learn from its achievements.
Imelda Marcos,"My husband does not like me to give interviews because I say too much. No talk, no trouble."
Imelda Marcos,My dreams have become puny with the reality my life has become.
Imelda Marcos,"God is love. I have loved. Therefore, I will go to heaven."
Imelda Marcos,"I get so tired listening to one million dollars here, one million dollars there, it's so petty."
Imelda Marcos,I hate ugliness. You know I'm allergic to ugliness.
Imelda Marcos,"Doesn't the fight for survival also justify swindle and theft? In self defence, anything goes."
Imelda Marcos,"Win or lose, we go shopping after the election."
Imelda Marcos,"Life is not a matter of place, things or comfort; rather, it concerns the basic human rights of family, country, justice and human dignity."
Imelda Marcos,"People say I'm extravagant because I want to be surrounded by beauty. But tell me, who wants to be surrounded by garbage?"
Imelda Marcos,"I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty."
Imelda Marcos,I have never been a material girl. My father always told me never to love anything that cannot love you back.
Subcomandante Marcos,"The aim is to listen and learn about the struggles, the resistance and rebel movements, support them and bind them together to build a national anti-capitalist, leftist program."
Subcomandante Marcos,"We have to make sure of our place in society as indigenous Indians that we have won. In Mexico, there are movements, there are revolutions and change, but for the indigenous nothing changes."
Subcomandante Marcos,We hold a dialogue to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. That's why we hold a dialogue.
Stanley Marcus,"Because a review of the plain language of the ADA yields no statutory basis for distinguishing among individuals who are disabled in the actual-impairment sense and those who are disabled only in the regarded-as sense, we join the 3rd Circuit in holding that regarded-as disabled individuals also are entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA,"
Stanley Marcus,Consumers are statistics. Customers are people.
Stanley Marcus,Running those poor steers back and forth in the heat is ridiculous. What they ought to do is put the steers in the convention hall and run the delegates.
Orison Swett Marden,We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.
Orison Swett Marden,Every youth owes it to himself and to the world to make the most possible out of the stuff that is in him...
Orison Swett Marden,"The Universe is one great kindergarten for man. Everything that exists has brought with it its own peculiar lesson. The mountain teaches stability and grandeur; the ocean immensity and change. Forests, lakes, and rivers, clouds and winds, stars and flowers, stupendous glaciers and crystal snowflakes, -- every form of animate or inanimate existence, leaves its impress upon the soul of man. Even the bee and ant have brought their little lessons of industry and economy."
Orison Swett Marden,Every germ of goodness will at last struggle into bloom and fruitage... true success follows every right step.
Orison Swett Marden,There is no stimulus like that which comes from the consciousness of knowing that others believe in us.
Orison Swett Marden,There is no investment you can make which will pay you so well as the effort to scatter sunshine and good cheer through your establishment.
Orison Swett Marden,"Deep within man dwell those slumbering powers; powers that would astonish him, that he never dreamed of possessing; forces that would revolutionize his life if aroused and put into action."
Orison Swett Marden,"There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do."
Orison Swett Marden,"Obstacles are like wild animals. They are cowards but they will bluff you if they can. If they see you are afraid of them... they are liable to spring upon you; but if you look them squarely in the eye, they will slink out of sight."
Orison Swett Marden,"No man is beaten until his hope is annihilated, his confidence gone, As long as a man faces life hopefully, confidently, triumphantly, he is not a failure; he is not beaten until he turns his back on life."
Orison Swett Marden,No man fails who does his best...
Orison Swett Marden,"But how shall I get ideas? ''Keep your wits open! Observe! Observe! Study! Study! But above all, Think! Think! And when a noble image is indelibly impressed upon the mind -- Act!"
Orison Swett Marden,"There is something greater than wealth, grander even than fame -- manhood, character, stand for success... nothing else really does."
Orison Swett Marden,"The beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread, but every time we repeat the act we strengthen the strand, add to it another filament, until it becomes a great cable and binds us irrevocably thought and act."
Orison Swett Marden,"Our trials, our sorrows, and our grieves develop us..."
Orison Swett Marden,"It is like the seed put in the soil -- the more one sows, the greater the harvest."
Orison Swett Marden,Joyfulness keeps the heart and face young. A good laugh makes us better friends with ourselves and everybody around us
Orison Swett Marden,"There is no failure for the man who realizes his power, who never knows when he is beaten; there is no failure for the determined endeavor; the unconquerable will. There is no failure for the man who gets up every time he falls, who rebounds like a rubber ball, who persists when everyone else gives up, who pushes on when everyone else turns back."
Orison Swett Marden,"There is only one thing for us to do, and that is to do our level best right where we are every day of our lives; To use our best judgment, and then to trust the rest to that Power which holds the forces of the universe in his hands."
Orison Swett Marden,"There is an infinite difference between a little wrong and just right, between fairly good and the best, between mediocrity and superiority..."
Orison Swett Marden,"People who have accomplished work worthwhile have had a very high sense of the way to do things. They have not been content with mediocrity. They have not confined themselves to the beaten tracks; they have never been satisfied to do things just as others so them, but always a little better. They always pushed things that came to their hands a little higher up, this little farther on, that counts in the quality of life's work. It is constant effort to be first-class in everything one attempts that conquers the heights of excellence."
Orison Swett Marden,Make it a life-rule to give your best to whatever passes through your hands. Stamp it with your manhood. Let superiority be your trademark...
Orison Swett Marden,"Just make up your mind at the very outset that your work is going to stand for quality... that you are going to stamp a superior quality upon everything that goes out of your hands, that whatever you do shall bear the hall-mark of excellence."
Orison Swett Marden,"It is those who have this imperative demand for the best in their natures, and who will accept nothing short of it, that holds the banners of progress, that set the standards, the ideals, for others."
Orison Swett Marden,We fail to see that we can control our own destiny; make ourselves do whatever is possible; make ourselves become whatever we long to be.
Orison Swett Marden,Concentration is the factor that causes the great discrepancy between men and the results they achieve... the difference in their power of calling together all the rays of their ability and concentrating on one point.
Orison Swett Marden,"The giants of the race have been men of concentration, who have struck sledge-hammer blows in one place until they have accomplished their purpose. The successful men of today are men of one overmastering idea, one unwavering aim, men of single and intense purpose."
Orison Swett Marden,The world is sad enough without your woe.
Orison Swett Marden,"This force, which is the best thing in you, your highest self, will never respond to any ordinary half-hearted call, or any milk-and-water endeavor, It can only be reached by your supremest call, your supremest effort. It will respond only to the call that is backed up by the whole of you, not part of you; you must be all there in what you are trying to do. You must bring every particle of your energy, unanswerable resolution, your best efforts, your persistent industry to your task or the best will not come out of you. You must back up your ambition by your whole nature, by unbounded enthusiasm and a determination to win which knows no failure... Only a masterly call, a masterly will, a supreme effort, intense and persistent application, can unlock the door to your inner treasure and release your highest powers."
Orison Swett Marden,"The greatest trouble with most of us is that our demands upon ourselves are so feeble, the call upon the great within of us so weak and intermittent that it makes no impression upon the creative energies; it lacks the force that transmutes desires into realities."
Orison Swett Marden,"Begin where you are; work where you are; the hour which you are now wasting, dreaming of some far off success may be crowded with grand possibilities."
Orison Swett Marden,The Creator has not given you a longing to do that which you have no ability to do.
Orison Swett Marden,The Universe is one great kindergarten for man. Everything that exists has brought with it its own peculiar lesson.
Orison Swett Marden,"Forests, lakes, and rivers, clouds and winds, stars and flowers, stupendous glaciers and crystal snowflakes - every form of animate or inanimate existence, leaves its impress upon the soul of man."
Orison Swett Marden,All men who have achieved great things have been great dreamers.
Julianna Margulies,I was told by both an agent and a casting director that I'd never work in television.
Julianna Margulies,I'm holding out for the quality parts. I don't want to crash and burn before I've gotten to where I want to go. I want to enjoy the ride.
Julianna Margulies,"[What Edwards does share with his Hollywood alter ego is] dedication, ... He puts the same amount of energy into his family that Greene puts into his career."
Rob Mariano,"We dominated Survivor - there is no way we would not dominate that [The Amazing Race], too. I can see it already, us making deals with people. That's the best part, and with the Race, it would be even more fun because I've got a lot of tricks up my sleeve."
Rob Mariano,"Who knows, I have always lived one day at a time. Probably more adventure and excitement."
Rob Mariano,"We dominated Survivor - there is no way we would not dominate that, too. I can see it already, us making deals with people. That's the best part, and with the Race, it would be even more fun because I've got a lot of tricks up my sleeve."
Rob Mariano,Things have slowed down considerably since the new series has started airing and I am currently looking for work. It has been a nice year-long vacation nonetheless.
Rob Mariano,Most people are cool but there were a few psycho's. It's only a TV show and there are always some people that think it's more than that.
Rob Mariano,I'm a kid from Boston.
Rob Mariano,"I was really busy making appearances and doing charity events for a while after the show was over, so I had to quit my job for a while."
Rob Mariano,I just basically took a chance because it looked like fun and I wanted the .
Rob Mariano,I have been able to travel all over the country and see many places that I probably never would have visited. I have also participated in many charity events for worthy causes.
Rob Mariano,I am biased to my show as a whole but it is still very entertaining.
Rob Mariano,Burnett loves to catch you off guard all the time. I remember the day before our series started he got us all together and told us to assume nothing.
Rob Mariano,The one thing that I'm in charge of in this wedding is the food.
Carlos Marin,"I can tell you I am very happy because this was one of my goals in life. I have been here so long, and I wanted to one day do this."
Carlos Marin,"Weve included features that werent in the original proposal, ... Our concentration before was on the Rio Grande levees. Now were focusing on the floodway levees too."
Carlos Marin,"Weâ€™ve included features that werenâ€™t in the original proposal, ... Our concentration before was on the Rio Grande levees. Now weâ€™re focusing on the floodway levees too."
Cheech Marin,We just got sick of each other. We'd been together 17 years. We just kind of didn't want to listen to each other anymore. We both wanted to go our separate ways.
Cheech Marin,"I've known Rick for a long time, and he wanted a pair of outside eyes to look at the show."
Cheech Marin,Dance With Me.
Cheech Marin,The reason we're so dangerous is because we're totally harmless.
Cheech Marin,Our first gig was a battle of the bands. We did 45 minutes of comedy and never played a note - and we won!
Cheech Marin,I was part of the draft resistance movement in LA where we did demonstrations at the draft centre and burned our cards and made a lot of trouble on campus.
Cheech Marin,"We did six records, then six movies. Now we need to do six of something else, so we get 666 - and then our master Satan can return!"
Rod Marinelli,"Sometimes you have to use different things ... that show you what you're trying to accomplish. Those are things that capture the mind for a moment, and an image can do it. You can talk and talk, but an image will last."
Rod Marinelli,"It's the untalented issues that I'm really interested in. There's talent in this league, everybody's got talent. The issue is how hard are we willing to play."
Rod Marinelli,"That's the gamble, the risk."
Rod Marinelli,It's great to get this opportunity. I want to turn the Lions into a championship team. It's going to take hard work and I'll assemble a staff that will work hard for this organization.
Rod Marinelli,"I really like that, too. That's been my nature, is to have people compete and work, so we've really stirred it up a little bit and will get this thing started in the right direction, the direction I want."
Rod Marinelli,"You tell men the truth. You don't hide anything, you don't skirt the issue. You just be direct with these men - that's all they want. Be direct. And tell them what they need to hear, not what they want to hear."
Rod Marinelli,I just believe you coach each man independently. You've got to spend time showing him how good he can be. ... We just have standards. I've got to get each man to understand the standard I have for him.
Rod Marinelli,"I'm willing to take as long as it takes to get the right man. It may be an unknown, or it may be him."
Rod Marinelli,I love coaching young players and it starts with the staff that understands how to teach. I've trained to be a head football coach and that's what is exciting for me.
Rod Marinelli,"Everybody has their own philosophy. I hope I never stand in the way of my assistants. I've never faced the situation before, but hopefully I'm going to allow guys to seek opportunities."
Rod Marinelli,"I have got some history with Donnie, way back when he was a player and I was coaching back at Utah State. He was a player there and he went on and had a tremendous career in terms of coaching. I feel good about getting Donnie."
Rod Marinelli,"Hard work, coming out and doing everything we're asking him to do. I mean working hard, and he's got talent. And the offense, the system, is very demanding. And the coaches over there are very demanding."
Rod Marinelli,"You've got to find the type of men for whom football is so important to them that I've got to kick him out of the facility. He wants to be the best. 'How do I do it? Help me. What do I have to do to be great?' That's what I'm looking for, and that's what I'm going to find."
Rod Marinelli,Football is a show-me game.
Rod Marinelli,"It's not about me being comfortable. It's about what's right with this football team. Once I made that thought process, the decision was very easy."
Rod Marinelli,"The one thing I do like about him, he is a winner. He knows how to move the football. I would love to have him, but we're still talking."
Rod Marinelli,That man knows how to win and how to move the football. I like him and I would love to have him.
Rod Marinelli,"We know what (Martz) can do with the football. He has won, and he is a champion."
Rod Marinelli,"We just talk about the responsibilities we have to the game of football in this position. This position of power is important if it's pushed out correctly, if you push your power out to help people and help this organization and do it that way."
Rod Marinelli,They both bring a sense of real good leadership and passion within their own personalities. They love football. They are here all day.
Rod Marinelli,Football always has been a show-me game. Sometimes there's too much talk. It's time to show it.
Rod Marinelli,Football is a show-me game. I'm tired of talking. You start putting on pads and do the work. Let our film talk for us.
Rod Marinelli,It's not just playing really hard and really good tempo. Now it's playing smart with execution.
Rod Marinelli,I think it'll grow on me as I go. But I just want to keep my energy going at the things that are really important right now for this football team.
Rod Marinelli,I've decided to go in a new direction at the quarterback position. Things have changed since we talked last. It was my decision.
Rod Marinelli,"The competition is phenomenal. It's going to bring the best out of that entire group, I think."
Rod Marinelli,This isn't about me being in a comfort zone. It's about me getting the best people to help us win. I don't want to have a bunch of assistants sitting in there saluting me. I want a bunch of guys with strong ideas.
Rod Marinelli,That has prepared me to be a head coach.
Rod Marinelli,"He brings great tempo, great character, great toughness to what we're doing."
Rod Marinelli,"I understand football character. Guys who love football and want to be a champion. I've been around that, so I know what to look for."
Rod Marinelli,"I've got to believe they're going to be liking it -- getting down the field, stretching the field. But within that is the work ethic that's going to come with it."
Dan Marino,"We didn't win a Super Bowl together, and that's something I'll always regret â€“ not knowing what that feels like, ... But you and I have won more games together than any quarterback and coach combination in the history of the NFL."
Dan Marino,We didn't win a Super Bowl and that's something I'll always regret -- not knowing what that feels like.
Dan Marino,We didn't win a Super Bowl together and that is something I would always regret. But you and I won more games than any other quarterback-coach combination in the history of pro football and that is something I am very proud of.
Dan Marino,"It's not like tennis or golf, ... You have to rely on other people."
Dan Marino,"I don't want to say anything, because Todd and I are good friends."
Dan Marino,"As a young man God blessed me with a special talent to throw a football,"
Dan Marino,"I know individually you get the honor of being inducted in the Hall of Fame, ... but you see coach (Don) Shula up onstage and teammates and family and friends ? my mom and dad and wife and kids ? this day is for them."
Dan Marino,"When I was elected to the Hall of Fame, I challenged all Dolphin fans to overrun Canton, Ohio, and we've taken it over,"
Dan Marino,"I don't think that anybody, when they start in the NFL, sets out to be in the Hall of Fame, ... When I first got here, I wanted to be the starting quarterback for the Dolphins. I wanted to be successful. I wanted to win a Super Bowl. To think about the Hall of Fame would be stretching it a little bit. But as your career goes on and I had the success, then you know there is a possibility, you definitely know that."
Dan Marino,"I don't think that anybody, when they start in the NFL, sets out to be in the Hall of Fame. When I first got here, I wanted to be the starting quarterback for the Dolphins. I wanted to be successful. I wanted to win a Super Bowl. To think about the Hall of Fame would be stretching it a little bit. But as your career goes on and I had the success, then you know there is a possibility, you definitely know that."
Dan Marino,"It's kind of cute,"
Dan Marino,I know how important it is to spend time with my wife and children because I know what it meant to me to have my father and mother around when I was growing up. During the season it's not always easy... But I need that balance and I know that my kids and my wife need it as well.
Dan Marino,"Once it's gone, it's gone. Golfers get to play their sport just about their whole lives, baseball players play a pretty long time. But football, it's over fast, and once it's over you're not going to get that same feeling, the competition, Sunday afternoon. Everything about it is going to be over."
Dan Marino,"You can do more, you can always do more."
Dan Marino,"We've been blessed with four beautiful children. Michael, he doesn't have much of a problem anymore. He is high functional, probably because of early intervention."
Dan Marino,"We're not running the ball again until we get ahead. Shula was calling the plays, but I told them, 'I don't care what he calls. We're throwing every pass from now until we get the lead.' To Shula's credit, he always gave me that option."
Dan Marino,"Sometimes, I wish we were all amateurs again. I'd play for nothing. Ab-so-lute-ly free. But that's not the system."
Dan Marino,"My parents would always say, 'It doesnt' matter if it's a guy picking up the garbage or the President of the United States, treat everybody as you would want to be treated."
Dan Marino,I think I'm going to be around awhile.
Dan Marino,"I have always said that I want to finish my career with the Dolphins and this put me closer to that goal. I have been fortunate to break many personal records, but my overiding goal is to win a Super Bowl here in Miami."
Dan Marino,"Sure, the home-field is an advantage - but so is having a lot of talent."
Dan Marino,"If you don't play to win right now, why even play? I think that's the attitude of the coaching staff and everybody involved in the organization."
Dan Marino,"My father always taught me to appreciate what you're fortunate to have and give back to those who need it. No part of our society is more important than the children, especially the ones who need our help."
Dan Marino,"It's real nice and exciting for me to break the records, but it's more exciting for me to be on a winning team."
Dan Marino,"I just try to be myself, whatever that is. I don't think about how I'll be remembered. I just want to be consistent over a long period of time. That's what the great players do."
Dan Marino,"I think it's more and more important to spend time with your children, because it seems to be harder and harder for them to succeed as their parents have succeeded."
Dan Marino,There is no defense against a perfect pass. I can throw the perfect pass.
Dan Marino,You have to feel you're the best at what you do. You don't have to come out and say it. But you have to know it within yourself.
Dan Marino,We can change the lives of autistic children. We can make a difference. There are hundreds of families in Florida who can't afford the therapists.
Dan Marino,I know I've got to just keep throwing the ball. That's what I do best.
Dan Marino,"I think I have a passion for playing the game. I love to play, and I want to play at a high level. You have to do the right things in order to continue at that level."
Dan Marino,"If you ask any great player or great quarterback, there's a certain inner confidence that you're as good as anybody. But you can't say who is the absolute best. To be considered is special in itself."
Dan Marino,"I think positive. I always think we're going to score. Two minutes is a lot of time if you have timeouts and you're throwing every down. You have to make the right decisions. I've always had great receivers, which helps. It's not just me doing it."
Dan Marino,"I throw better than anybody in college and I can throw with anybody in the pros. There, that's what I think."
Dan Marino,"Obviously I'm not 21 anymore, but I think I can still throw with anybody."
Dan Marino,We were talking about how old quarterbacks can't throw before 10 am... Practice starts too early for us. Wake me up in the middle of the night and I can throw. I can throw anytime.
Dan Marino,"I've been a Dolphin for 17 years, and I'll be a Dolphin for the rest of my life. That will never change."
Dan Marino,"You need to feel that the game is important to you. Lose that feeling and you lose your edge. There's no faking that kind of emotion. You can't invent the feeling. It's got to be natural, real."
Dan Marino,I'm getting married because I'm in love with a girl and want to spend my life with her. You can't live your life doing what other people want you to or you'll be miserable. At some point you just have to be yourself.
Dan Marino,I try to play my game and that's being emotional because I'm that kind of guy.
Dan Marino,"I want to know what it's like to play in a Super Bowl and win one. My career will be great without it. But, personally, selfishly, I want to know what it feels like."
Dan Marino,"I look at it this way. I'm not putting age limits on what I can do. As long as I can do the job to help the team win and feel like I'm playing at a high level, which I feel I can do for a long while, I'm going to play no matter what my age is."
Dan Marino,It's nice to feel the fans are behind you. You shouldn't concern yourself with things like that - but it does matter.
Dan Marino,"As a team, you need to come from behind every once in awhile just to do it. Good for the attitude. It makes it exciting. And when everybody knows you have to throw it... that makes it fun too."
Dan Marino,I don't need to be motivated by anybody. Never have.
Dan Marino,"It was good advice,"
Shawn Marion,We were able to get a lot of stops and get out into our running game and hit some open shots. We wanted to be aggressive and try to get the last two games out of the way.
Shawn Marion,I think we were really trying to get out there and run. Don't think I wasn't running out. I was really trying to make the effort.
Shawn Marion,"The older I get, I'm starting to realize I need that time to rest, ... I'm not going to be doing that stuff (summer games) anymore. That's a wear and tear on your body. I'm still trying to rest my body from the playoffs."
Shawn Marion,"It's going to be a race down to the end in the Western Conference. They aren't sleeping on us either, believe that. We're right there. We've just got to keep doing what we've got to do and build on it to get ready for the playoffs."
Shawn Marion,"It hurts. I hate pain. I think I'm going to go anyway. I don't like to sit out. If I can walk, I'm going to play."
Shawn Marion,Y'all need to start booing everybody. I hate when they're applauding the other team. They need to boo everybody.
Shawn Marion,They had some bigger guys. We were trying to force the tempo of the game. They couldn't run with us and it showed.
Shawn Marion,It's been hectic around here for the last couple of weeks. We have to band together like dogs and get it done.
Shawn Marion,"With his style of play and his ability, he fits right in. It's like he's been here all year."
Steve Mariucci,"He did struggle, but I also thought he was under duress for most of the game. Our passing game for a variety of reasons is letting us down. We have to get those things fixed."
Steve Mariucci,"We know who is out there as far as available quarterbacks, but in reality, no one would be more prepared or capable as a No. 2 at this point than Dan. He got more snaps in the preseason than any of our quarterbacks and continues to get better."
Steve Mariucci,"Potential has never won a game yet, but we've got to bring these guys along quickly."
Steve Mariucci,"Other than Jeff and other than a lot of penalties, I was really pleased with our performance,"
Steve Mariucci,"Obviously you go through some growing pains, a learning curve so to speak. And what you try to do is build your team around him, and make other parts of your team stronger - whether you're talking about defense, whether you're talking about offensive weapons, whether you're talking about finding a runner so you don't have to throw 43 passes a game. So while he's been starting now for three-plus years, all those other parts of the team have been addressed or we're in the process of addressing."
Steve Mariucci,"They've got to know that I need to allow them to be the leaders, ... When they feel like they have a need to say something or do something, they also have to know that it's OK to do that and I will allow that and I'm OK with it and encourage it."
Steve Mariucci,"There are several spots where we're going to have to make some decisions based upon the health of our players,"
Steve Mariucci,"I don't know if I'm ready to go a lot past that. My field goals are going to come faster than my kickoffs, because the field goals, there's not as much of a sprint and power motion."
Steve Mariucci,"We had x-rays taken of Jeff's leg after the game, and they were negative, but he's very sore, ... We'll see what he can do this week and then make a decision."
Steve Mariucci,He's another set of eyes. He can help with some drill work. We wanted to extend his internship. He wants to be a coach. He's a hard worker. He knows the system. The guys respect him.
Steve Mariucci,"There are no excuses for a game like this,"
Steve Mariucci,"I thought Joey really handled it professionally. When we had our conversation, there wasn't much of a discussion."
Steve Mariucci,I think Joey [Harrington] has found a little bit of a comfort level there with Marcus. Marcus was a good get for us.
Steve Mariucci,I think our team is better than last year's team. I believe that. We have half a season to prove that I'm saying the correct thing.
Steve Mariucci,It'll be a good crowd. It'll be a national TV audience. It's a game where we're playing our guys longer.
Steve Mariucci,"The guy is a heck of an athlete. Having been in the league now for several years, he has really become a pro and really matured. We love having him here. He's been terrific for us."
Steve Mariucci,There's no way running on a beach or at some high school playground that you're going to get in football shape like you do when you practice.
Steve Mariucci,I care about this state... and I feel a responsibility to get things done. If we stay healthy and play smart we can be a playoff team. I think we're on the right track.
Steve Mariucci,"Maybe it's the way we traveled. Maybe just fly in, eat some angel hair pasta and go play. Maybe that's what we're going to do from now on."
Steve Mariucci,"Everything we talk about is about beating the Packers, the Bears and the Vikings. Obviously there are other teams in the league, but if you can dominate and be on top of your division you are always in the playoff hunt. It's time for us to win that thing."
Steve Mariucci,"There are no excuses for a game like this. I thought we were very fired up and ready to go, but it just didn't happen on the field. It's alarming."
Steve Mariucci,"If we're going to run the football, and if we're going to be an explosive offense, it's going to start up there in the trenches."
Steve Mariucci,"That's the same in college. It's the same in high school. Kids are getting bigger, stronger, faster, more into the weightlifting, more into nutrition, more into size."
Steve Mariucci,This league is getting big. We have way more 300-pound guys than ever before. That's not to say all the people in athletics who have died are 300-pound guys. There are so many different reasons.
Reuben Mark,"We are especially encouraged by the 110 basis point improvement in gross profit margin during the quarter, to an all-time record and the largest quarterly gross profit increase in over three years."
Reuben Mark,"We project double-digit earnings, and our expectation is we will be there for the year, wherever oil settles, because if it goes out of sight, our expectation is that we will be able to raise prices. Beyond that, we are less dependent on oil than many."
Reuben Mark,These strong second-quarter results give us great encouragement that our momentum will continue in the second half of this year and the year 2000.
Ed Markey,With one simple move the president has blown a hole in the nuclear rules that the entire world has been playing by.
Ed Markey,"This law does nothing to reduce prices,"
Ed Markey,"Hollywood wants to play Big Brother and make all the decisions, and not give the information to the parents,"
Ed Markey,"Technology and ride design are outstripping our understanding of the health effects of high G-forces on child and adult riders, ... How much force is too much force?"
Ed Markey,Our nation's telecommunications markets must be vigorously competitive and open to innovation in order to promote job creation and economic growth. This merger proposal is one that unquestionably merits the utmost scrutiny by government antitrust officials.
Ed Markey,"A lot of times, ... industries attempt to use Congress to wipe out good work being done at the state level."
Edwin Markham,I have felt it like a glory in my heart.
Edwin Markham,"Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans upon his hoe and gazes on the ground, the emptiness of ages in his face, and on his back the burden of the world."
Edwin Markham,"The crest and crowning of all good, life's final star, is Brotherhood."
Edwin Markham,"Ah, great it is to believe the dream as we stand in youth by the starry stream; but a greater thing is to fight life through and say at the end, the dream is true!"
Edwin Markham,Defeat may serve as well as victory to shake the soul and let the glory out.
Edwin Markham,We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.
Edwin Markham,It is better to rust out than wear out.
Edwin Markham,A good action is never lost; it is a treasure laid up and guarded for the doer's need.
Sergei Markov,My own impression when I first heard the orchestra ? was a combination of perfection and warmth -- the perfection is not cold.
Sergei Markov,"In a situation in which all the other peace mediators have proved to be paralyzed, we have in Russia a chance of giving the negotiating process a second wind."
Sergei Markov,"The world is our stage. They play here with the same passion, the same perfection as they play in Russia."
Sergei Markov,Music is coming from the depth of people's souls and hearts.
Sergei Markov,Events took a turn for the worse there and Ukraine turned out to be an unsound partner in terms of economic cooperation.
Sergei Markov,The context of culture is indivisible. Who can understand Russian music better than Russian musicians?.
Sergei Markov,"Russia has no tradition of passing power from one leader to another without crisis. Each leader rejects the policies of his predecessor, and everyone connected with the old team faces troubles."
Sergei Markov,"There is real potential for this crisis to spread. In Crimea the population is 95 percent Russian-speaking, but they are forced to [conduct official business] in Ukrainian. There is really explosive material here."
Marty Markowitz,"saw that those signs caused no problems, and that the 'Oy vey' sign would be fine."
Marty Markowitz,"When Pee Wee Reese threw his arm around Jackie Robinson's shoulder in this legendary gesture of support and friendship, they showed America and the world that racial discrimination is unacceptable and un-American."
Marty Markowitz,"Oy vey, ... expression of dismay or hurt."
Marty Markowitz,"There is no doubt that Coney is getting tony,"
Michael Marks,You can never be 100 percent sure but you can minimize the risk of selling to the wrong people. We have to be responsible.
Michael Marks,There is no doubt that governments are becoming much more protectionist.
Michael Marks,"We're excited about it. Anytime someone puts forth a challenge grant, that really does enhance your ability to raise money from other sources."

Bob Marley,"When the cats away, the mice will play."
Bob Marley,What does rasta mean? Righteousness.

Bob Marley,I handle fame by not being famous...I'm not famous to me.

Bob Marley,"The power of philosophy floats through my head, Light like a feather, Heavy as Led"

Bob Marley,Sometimes you have to fight with music.
Bob Marley,We are the children of the Rastaman we are the children of the higher man.
Bob Marley,"The first thing you must know about me is that I always stand what I stand for. Good? The second thing you must know about yourself listening to me is that words are tricky. So when you know what me a stand for, when me explain a thing to you, you must ne."

Ziggy Marley,The music I do is food... that will be your dinner.

Ziggy Marley,"My dream is to live a good life and be loving, be close to God and be a good human being and bring peace to people."
Ziggy Marley,Love is more than one thing.
Ziggy Marley,Last time I was in Jamaica I financed a teacher to teach in an orphanage.
Ziggy Marley,Jamaica has problems; America has problems; everywhere has problems.
Ziggy Marley,It's that kind of in-born music thing-I could pick up the guitar and play something. It's not something I consciously do.
Ziggy Marley,"If it is, it is, If it's not, it's not."
Ziggy Marley,I've tried body surfing. It's nice.
Ziggy Marley,I've opened up more by traveling outside Jamaica. It helps me to grow as a person to be outside of my element; to be on my own in a strange place meeting people.
Ziggy Marley,"I'm not an American, Do they count the votes in America? I haven't voted in Jamaica either."
Ziggy Marley,I'm always in love.
Ziggy Marley,"I would look at a dog and when our eyes met, I realized that the dog and all creatures are my family. They're like you and me."

Ziggy Marley,"This dragonfly came up to me. He was hovering right in front of my face, and I was really examining him, thinking, How does he see me? I became enlightened."
Ziggy Marley,I am a leader. Leaders always get heat. They're always going against the grain. Jimi Hendrix got heat; Bob Marley got heat; Miles Davis got heat. Every great artist got heat. Heat means you're doing something right.
Ziggy Marley,"When people come to Jamaica, we don't want them to think about the problems of Jamaica. So let them come be in their paradise."

Ziggy Marley,I don't have to wait to realize the good old days.
Ziggy Marley,"I rented a house, recorded the stuff in a house. Just took my time 'cuz sometimes it's just rush, rush, rush. I just wanna live and play music."
Ziggy Marley,I think that his ability to reach out to people was because of his sincerity in what he was doing. And the truth in which he did it in. He had no ulterior motive. He wasn't trying to be something. He wasn't into gimmicks. He wasn't trying to be a star. He was trying to express himself.
Ziggy Marley,"There is a physical relationship with a woman that you don't have with anybody else, but that's not about love. Love is a spiritual thing."
Sterling Marlin,So now I have somebody to share my pain with.
Sterling Marlin,"You look at 2001, we were third in points and no one gave us much of a chance when the season started. We came back last year and had the same team, the same everybody and led points."
Sterling Marlin,"We're having a good time. That's what I did last year. If you can't have a good time, you might as well stay home. I feel real good."
Sterling Marlin,"We felt like when we went into last year we had a pretty good chance to win the championship from the previous year with the fall we put together. We've got the same everything now, so I think we can come back and be as strong this year."
Sterling Marlin,The hardest part was getting the window net hooked back. I didn't think I was ever going to get it hooked. I finally got it hooked. If I'd known that I wouldn't have tried to hook it.
Sterling Marlin,The guys have a lot of good cars built up. We're going to do some more testing before we go back to Las Vegas and try to win at Vegas again. We need to get off to a quick start.

Sterling Marlin,"It was a pretty wild ride. The race wasn't bad, but qualifying would take your breath."
Sterling Marlin,It took three weeks after Kansas to get my chest or ribs or whatever I messed up... You got up in the morning and it didn't hurt.
Sterling Marlin,"I think we'll be in pretty good shape. We've got the same car we ran in all the speedway races since 2001, and it's been a real good car for us. It's led every race we've been in."
Sterling Marlin,I guess everybody saw it. It's a deal where I'd been racing cars a long time and I knew going around the track the fender was on the tire hard.
Sterling Marlin,"After Richmond, we went to Dover and tested that week at Kentucky. I was going to Dover and we had to get the trainer to meet us at the airport. I had to do some therapy on my ribs they hurt so bad."
Sterling Marlin,"A guy came to the shop every day. A lot of guys put the foam like stuff that forms to you, kinda like the Indy car guys run. He fitted it up and it felt real good, so we're going to try to run it."
Christopher Marlowe,"Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!  Her lips suck forth my soul: see, where it flies!  Come Helen, come give me my soul again.  Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips,  And all is dross that is not Helena."
Christopher Marlowe,"Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss"
Christopher Marlowe,"Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss! Her lips suck forth my soul: see, where it flies! Come Helen, come give me my soul again. Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips, And all is dross that is not Helena."

Laurence Maroney,Getting the opportunity to come here is a blessing. I just want to come here and work hard. I don?t want to walk in the footsteps of another back. I want to create my own legacy.
Laurence Maroney,"If you're a first-rounder, it's like, why stay? I feel the only thing you can do is hurt your chances next year by getting hurt."
Laurence Maroney,"I was looking at him like, 'I hope he doesn't say anything. He can't say anything. I scored."
Laurence Maroney,"Actually it was fun splitting time with a guy like Marion Barber. We both brought something different to the table, kept defenses on their toes, not knowing what they're going to get. We always had fresh legs in the game, so splitting time was never a problem. We never had any complaints about who had the ball."

Mick Mars,"It was bothering me a lot, and I became addicted to pain medication, which is like what dragged me down. When we first started talking about this thing, I was like pretty much out of it, but I wanted to do it. So I needed to get myself overhauled, cleaned up and everything else to do this, because I wanted to do it, you know?"
Mick Mars,"Musicians today have gotten used to Protools, which I hate. You can go into the studio and not even be a musician, just start beating on stuff and they can take parts out of it, move it around and then you can sound like Slash. If you want some kind of weird feedback effect in the middle of a guitar solo, now they can just fly it in. You don't have to sit there and work at it like you did back in the day."
Mick Mars,"When I get mean, I get mean."
Mick Mars,Get as rude as possible and don't let anyone tell you how to live.
Mick Mars,"I'm just as sick as the others, although I prefer to do my sickness in private."
David Marsh,This senior class is interesting in that they are from all over the world and their personalities are so different from each other. All eight are fantastic human beings and I couldn't be more pleased with them finishing their dual meet season undefeated. I think we look good going into the championship portion of the season and are fit and prepared.
David Marsh,"We only had one champion in 2002. And we won the meet very handily. So, you don't always have to have the best individuals. You have to have the best team."
David Marsh,"We have the (swimmers) and the ability. If we have a terrific meet, we should be hard to beat."
Peter Marsh,"It so happens that private developer schemes are all outside London, while London costs are double those across the rest of the country and make up half the total program."
Peter Marsh,In fact grants per home to private developers compare very equitably with grants per home to housing association developments for similar areas and types of schemes.

Rodney Marsh,He has got natural ability to keep wicket and to strike the ball and it is up to us to help make sure he gets the most out of himself.
Alfred Marshall,"The modern developments of economic science in relation to rent indicate progress. For we are learning that what is commonly called the rent of land is really a very complex thing made up of many elements, some of which differ more widely from one another than it, as a whole, differs from profits, or than some elements of it differ from wages."
Alfred Marshall,"Economics has as its purpose firstly to acquire knowledge for its own sake, and secondly to throw light on practical issues.

David Marshall,"If this had happened in the third week of September, it would have been sheer chaos,"
Gregg Marshall,"I'm not going to worry about it, I'm not going to talk about it. I signed a long-term contract, and it costs me six figures if I leave Winthrop. So I've made Winthrop that next big job. In my mind, I have a big job."
Gregg Marshall,It doesn't get any easier. I can't find the words.
Gregg Marshall,"That was one of those 'oh, no' when he shoots it. It kind of shocked me, but it also pleased me greatly when it splashed through the net."

Thurgood Marshall,"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a state has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch."
Thurgood Marshall,"A child born to a Black mother in a state like Mississippi... has exactly the same rights as a white baby born to the wealthiest person in the United States. It's not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for."
Thurgood Marshall,None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps.

Thurgood Marshall,"What is the quality of your intent?Certain people have a way of saying things that shake us at the core. Even when the words do not seem harsh or offensive, the impact is shattering. What we could be experiencing is the intent behind the words. When we intend to do good, we do. When we intend to do harm, it happens. What each of us must come to realize is that our intent always comes through. We cannot sugarcoat the feelings in our heart of hearts. The emotion is the energy that motivates. We cannot ignore what we really want to create. We should be honest and do it the way we feel it. What we owe to ourselves and everyone around is to examine the reasons of our true intent.My intent will be evident in the results."

Ralph Marston,"Every day you spend drifting away from your goals is a waste not only of that day, but also of the additional day it takes to regain lost ground."

Ralph Marston,It doesn't matter how much you want. What really matters is how much you want it. The extent and complexity of the problem does not matter was much as does the willingness to solve it.
Ralph Marston,"What if you gave someone a gift, and they neglected to thank you for it - would you be likely to give them another? Life is the same way. In order to attract more of the blessings that life has to offer, you must truly appreciate what you already have."

William Marston,Every crisis offers you extra desired power
William Marston,"Besides the practical knowledge which defeat offers, there are important personality profits to be taken."
William Marston,Women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness. The obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman.
William Marston,Realize what you really want. It stops you from chasing butterflies and puts you to work digging gold.
William Marston,Most of us actually stifle enough good impulses during the course of a day to change the current of our lives.
Phil Martelli,We crumbled a little bit mentally more than anything else. We've got to find out the reasons and work on them.

Phil Martelli,You know it's coming. You know they're going to go on a run You watch enough of their games and you know it's going to happen. I've watched six of their games and I knew what was coming. You just hope you have the plays in your repertoire to withstand it. We didn't. It got away from us.
Phil Martelli,"By the end of the season, it was like literally being in a bubble. We were floating through the experience."
Phil Martelli,"Of all the things we do, that's probably the most confidence that we have. If you want to throw the ball inside, we have a way of taking that away from you."
Phil Martelli,This is a group that deserves to be celebrated. What you have seen may never be repeated anywhere in college basketball.
Phil Martelli,"I thought that the biggest message that we delivered was that they're big boys. Everybody was responsible for us losing yesterday. Players, coaches, everybody had a hand in that. It's human nature, but no one feels sorry for you. Even though you think that they should feel sorry for you. We went back to the method we used in Dallas. We asked for maximum effort. We told them that there would be a constant rotation of players. And the second quarter was the difference. The second half was an exercise in futility and it's a shame that guys don't grasp the idea that every opportunity should be maximized."
Phil Martelli,"We're clearly playing our best basketball now. We were 11th in the A-10 after the Temple game (Feb. 14), and this is a tribute to our four seniors. They knew we were better than our record showed."
Phil Martelli,We're picking up the pieces and moving forward. We're constantly reminding ourselves that there's still a half-year of basketball to play.
Phil Martelli,"One of the things we don't do is that we don't penetrate. We don't have that ability on our team. We have one guy who can get by people on the dribble, and right now his knowledge of basketball is such that he can't find the open player. We just don't put pressure on the defense to make them help. We've allowed teams to play us head-up. If you're not getting the shot in that sweet spot, it's not going to go down easily."
Lynn Martenstein,We were shocked by the charges. But we are fully cooperating with the Department of Justice.
Lynn Martenstein,"Attorneys representing the Smith family apparently provided [the photographs] in flagrant disregard of the FBI's specific and repeated requests not to describe the cabin, an action that could seriously impede the FBI's investigation."
Lynn Martenstein,"The acts that we have been charged with are totally unacceptable, and in violation of company policy."

Jose Marti,A selfish man is a thief.
Jose Marti,A genuine man goes to the roots. To be a radical is no more than that: to go to the roots.
Jose Marti,A child who does not think about what happens around him and is content with living without wondering whether he lives honestly is like a man who lives from a scoundrel's work and is on the road to being a scoundrel.

Jose Marti,To use for our exclusive benefit what is not ours is theft.
Jose Marti,To give one's life is a right only when one gives it unselfishly.
Jose Marti,"To busy oneself with what is futile when one can do something useful, to attend to what is simple when one has the mettle to attempt what is difficult, is to strip talent of its dignity."
Jose Marti,"The wretch who lives without freedom feels like dressing in the mud from the streets Those who have you, o Liberty, do not know. you. Those who do not have you should not speak of you, but win you."
Jose Marti,"The vote is a trust more delicate than any other, for it involves not just the interests of the voter, but his life, honor and future as well."
Jose Marti,One is guilty of all abjection that one does not help to relieve.
Jose Marti,"Men of action, above all those whose actions are guided by love, live forever."

Jose Marti,It is the duty of man to raise up man.
Jose Marti,"It is terrible to speak of you, Liberty, for one who lives without you."
Jose Marti,It is necessary to make virtue fashionable.
Jose Marti,"In truth, men speak too much of danger."
Jose Marti,He who uses the office he owes to the voters wrongfully and against them is a thief.
Jose Marti,"He who receives money in trust to administer for the benefit of its owner, and uses it either for his own interest or against the wishes of its rightful owner, is a thief."
Jose Marti,"But love, like the sun that it is, sets afire and melts everything. what greed and privilege to build up over whole centuries the indignation of a pious spirit, with its natural following of oppressed souls, will cast down with a single shove."
Jose Marti,"A child, from the time he can think, should think about all he sees, should suffer for all who cannot live with honesty, should work so that all men can be honest, and should be honest himself."
Jose Marti,"Culture, which makes talent shine, is not completely ours either, nor can we place it solely at our disposal. Rather, it belongs mainly to our country, which gave it to us, and to humanity, from which we receive it as a birthright."
Jose Marti,"Fortunately, there is a sane equilibrium in the character of nations, as there is in that of men."

Billy Martin,Another club can be beating you for six innings but for some reason the good ball clubs get tough and win them in the last three.
Billy Martin,"I probably was the proudest Yankee of them all. And I don't mean false pride. When it's real on a team, it's a deep love-pride."

Billy Martin,What I miss when I'm away is the pride in baseball. Especially the pride of being on a team that wins.
Bobby Martin,"It's tradition, and we're trying to keep it going."
Bobby Martin,I don't worry about it. We work on situations everyday in practice. What can you do to prepare for that? Do you make the game close to prepare for that? We're focused enough to make decisions. All we can do is work on it in practice. We're trying to do the same thing whether we're up or down.
Bobby Martin,"We're getting smarter. People don't realize we only start one senior. We got to get focused and keep focused. I'm still pleased with them. Not satisfied, but pleased with them."
Bobby Martin,Oh boy. He might be one of the most talented big men we'll face.
Bobby Martin,"He's not as long or as tall as Witcher, but he plays a different type of big-man game than Witcher. He puts the ball on the floor a lot more than Witcher."
Bobby Martin,He was raised up to serve God. I think that background has been good to him.
Bobby Martin,Franklin County fought hard tonight. We set goals and our team has knocked them off one by one.

Bobby Martin,People need encouragement and need support. People want to know they can work through this.
Bobby Martin,That's the first time we've ever shot the ball like that this year. You've just got to keep coaching defense because the shots are eventually going to drop. You build your house with defense.
Bobby Martin,"They need to understand that if you take care of business Saturday, that's where you'll go. I think you need to know what your destination is. That's not to say that you're looking past anybody. But you need to know what you are playing for. You are playing to go to Richmond."

Bobby Martin,"They set goals at the beginning of the year. We are just trying to do them one at a time, one at a time, one at time. You can only do that one at a time. I want them to be excited about it (the title), but it is only one step."
Chris Martin,Our Canadian fans are extraordinary â€” we love Canada.
Chris Martin,"How on earth could anybody stand in a field with these people and say that it's the right thing to do to dump their excess produce cheaply on a third world country? It's beyond me. But the truth is, the people responsible haven't talked to the farmers in the areas affected."

Curtis Martin,There's something about the motivation and confidence you feel when you're in first place. We missed out on that opportunity.
Curtis Martin,Our Income and Growth Fund has a bias towards financial services companies. The performance of that particular sector over 2005 showed a greater reduction in value than any other sector for 2005.
Curtis Martin,Football has helped me discipline myself in many ways.
Curtis Martin,"I look at it, that's what you're here to do. You're here to put yourself on the line like that unless it's just hideous to do it. That's what football's about. Most of the time you're not going to play healthy, you're going to be in some type of pain. I believe a lot of times your value and your legacy and consistency depends on how well you deal with things."
Curtis Martin,"I was always the one everyone wanted to pick on their football team, their basketball team and things like that."
Curtis Martin,Real estate was one of the few markets where we saw any real significant appreciation for 2005. That would have acted as an edge against declining stock market.

Dean Martin,We try to find chemistry; we don't do a lot of situational baseball.
Dean Martin,If you drink don't drive. Don't even putt.

Emily Martin,"I don't know if the school has ever had a girl hit the ball like Jamie is hitting it this season. We've had some good hitters. But right now, I'd have to put Jamie at the top of the list."
Emily Martin,"This conference race is going to go down to the final game. In my years here, the league has never had this much balance. A lot of teams are capable of winning on any day. We're in a good position but we're going to have to keep playing like this to stay in the lead."
Emily Martin,"We had four hits and they walked six of our batters but we just couldn't take advantage of it. If we get just one or two more hits at the right time, we probably win the game. I guess it just wasn't our day. Things like this happen every now and then."

George Martin,"I had my sprinkler system on, but then we lost power,"
George Martin,"a good leader, trustworthy, with the potential to be a good Marine, either as an officer or enlisted. He's dedicated to this program as he is to the fire department. He's also a good trainer and has taught three recruit classes."
George Martin,"Well, I think, I certainly used backward music in Sea of Monsters. I can't remember in the Sea of Time. I would tend to do that all the time, you know? I tended to do all sorts of weird things. Just to get effects."
George Martin,"We're lucky, real lucky. Our friends lost their house. We just had some burning embers put holes in the screens."
George Martin,"Polls are a passive conduit, but when citizens are out going door-to-door, expressing serious commitment, getting thousands of signatures, and getting resolutions passed, it sends a direct message to members of Congress. It's very clearly illustrated by the Katrina tragedy. Local guard and reserves are supposed to serve their own communities and they weren't available because of Iraq. Equipment that could have been used to dig dirt for the levees was in Iraq."
George Martin,I am confident that Richard will continue to promote and develop Air as a world-class recording facility.
Greg Martin,"Very simply, the threat of retirement is a predicable union tactic when you get into this position. But it doesn't withstand any scrutiny."
Greg Martin,"There is no magic bullet, but natural gas gives us the time to transition to more efficient technology further down the track"
Greg Martin,"The FAA takes all incursions very seriously. We'll continue to work with the GAO, other federal agencies and Congress to strengthen airspace security even more through better coordination, clarification and information sharing."
Greg Martin,"We had received complaints that the inspector was intimidating Northwest replacement workers, was unprofessional in his conduct and exceeded his authority â€¦ so we are also investigating those charges."
Greg Martin,Mediation can really help get the sides to a voluntary agreement.
Greg Martin,It also reflects the company's confidence in the ability of the PNG gas project ... to provide an alternative source of competitively priced energy to support economic development in Eastern Australia.
Jeff Martin,"We embrace opportunities to help educate our consumers about how to take care of their eyes to keep them healthy and beautiful. The COMPLETE(R) MoisturePLUS(TM) search for America's Most Beautiful Eyes will give us a chance to reach out to doctors and consumers in an entirely new, engaging way."
Jeff Martin,We're all excited about Doreen and her book. I've seen the prototype. Very colorfully done. I'm pleased and excited by the way it turned out. It's a great story for kids.
Jeff Martin,I could tell real fast it wasn't going to be an argument. He pulls out a pipe and starts clobbering me over the head.
Jeff Martin,Our program starts at an early age. Most people have memories of having their own piggy bank or going with their parents to the bank.
John Martin,"Every practice, regardless of size, is looking for ways to become more efficient."
John Martin,This is an extensive search. We are relying on the public to report any information that they have.
John Martin,"At Riverbed we strive for continuous improvement of our product capabilities. As the wide-area data services (WDS) market matures, companies are relying more and more on the capabilities of our Steelhead appliances. IT consolidation projects are moving forward and mission-critical data is moving across the WAN. With these enhancements to the Steelhead product line, enterprise customers have access to increased product horsepower and increased optimization capabilities. And we've given our customers significant headroom to grow, by equalizing the WAN bandwidth capacity on our low-end platforms, while significantly increasing capacity on our mid-tier solutions."
John Martin,"The odds of anybody here getting that purse are slim. I see two, three or four horses from Southern California taking the money. We should do what's best for the people who run the program here all year round."
John Martin,"The global threat of a potential avian flu pandemic has challenged governments, public health officials and the pharmaceutical industry to join together in partnership for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive plan to combat this deadly disease."
John Martin,It's hard to believe that the health of the population is deteriorating to such an extent.
John Martin,What separates us is our eclectic events. We serve a real quality menu that may follow a theme for the movie that is showing.
Kathy Martin,"That second report is accurate and correct, and the first one had (some out of state travel expenses) labeled that should not have been labeled as council expenses."
Kathy Martin,I'm proud to be putting a stone here in his honor.
Kathy Martin,So they really think... serious criticism of evolution is a joke.
Kenyon Martin,"We thought this was a time we could get well. Come home, got six straight home games. It's very frustrating."
Kenyon Martin,"I feel good. You know what I'm saying? Keep getting my rest, resting my body, and I'll be all right."
Kenyon Martin,It's a good rivalry. It's intense every time we play. It's good for basketball as long as it doesn't get out of control.
Kenyon Martin,"It's a good opportunity for him to get another job to coach and display his coaching ability and help kids out. Hopefully, it can work out for him."
Kevin Martin,"Ministers must not be able to set rules governing solicitors on a whim, to suit their own requirements."
Kevin Martin,I think I only had one tough shot. Donnie cleared off the rest.
Kevin Martin,"Panasonic chose to work with Sony Ericsson because their solution already had a good track record meeting stringent quality and performance requirements. As a core manufacturer, Panasonic only embeds proven, industry standard technology in our solutions. Sony Ericsson's record with emergency services organizations was good proof for us that we'd be an excellent fit."
Kevin Martin,"This certainly defeats the purpose of playing a tough preseason. It does not make any sense. I don't like it. Of course, our goals are to win a title first."
Kevin Martin,A lot has changed since the days of disco and leisure suits.
Kevin Martin,"I think this is a disaster, ... I think it is the latest chapter in a failed U.S. policy. The administration's own estimate is about 10,000 people will die in this attack, on top of the 6,000 to 7,000 people already dying from the sanctions each month."
Kevin Martin,"The number of complaints received by the commission has risen year after year. I share the concerns of the public - and of parents, in particular - that are voiced in these complaints."
Kevin Martin,"Age was definitely a factor. For myself, I definitely wanted a good strong-sweeping front end. I've definitely got a couple of strong young guys who could get right into our training program."
Mark Martin,"As a teammate, he's the best â€” awesome. Matt is very face-value. You know what you've got with Matt. He's not phony."
Mark Martin,"I guess maybe we needed another lap, or maybe I would have crashed trying. I raced Greg hard and I raced him clean and vice versa and he was in front when it was over."
Mark Martin,"He's young, he's aggressive, he has a lot of talent and he's got a cool-looking car."
Mark Martin,Success is everything. On this level you are driven by success.
Mark Martin,"It has had a significant impact on everyone in motor sports, from the safety side of it. Everyone got aggressive on safety, from NASCAR all the way down to grass roots racing."
Mark Martin,It had a huge impact on NASCAR safety. It made the drivers and the teams take a more aggressive approach to safety.
Mark Martin,"I think it's possible, based on how we're running, that we could win a number of races. But I guard myself. What I really keep my focus on is the effort and not worry about what the results might be. Just keep my eye on the ball."
Mark Martin,"That was our fault. I had such a good race car that for once, I wasn't too flipped out about it."
Mark Martin,He had one bad race. I don't think that means anything because he had one bad race. Just because he's not stacked up in the points doesn't mean he's not going to get there and have the great success we all know he will have.
Mark Martin,Carl was spectacular. It was a great call. The right car won the race.
Mark Martin,"I drove the car harder than I had all race, but we had what we had and we came in second place. I don't like getting passed at the end, ever. But I didn't get robbed, I got beat."
Mark Martin,"It was a great car and it got better the longer the race went. There are a lot of races left. I don't need to be talking about (points), I just need to be scoring them right now."
Mark Martin,"Hopefully, the drivers will be able to race without running over one another. Anything with a heritage like this racetrack, I would not have messed with it. I would have saved my money."
Mark Martin,Todd (Bodine) was really strong and he ran a really smart race. I just had to make sure I kept them behind me and I didn't have to do that long because the caution came back out.
Mark Martin,I love racing with Todd Bodine and Ted (Musgrave) and (Mike) Skinner and all these guys. They are really good drivers.
Mark Martin,Life is short and I have some things I'd still like to do.
Mark Martin,I had no interest in the HANS until after the accident with Dale. And then I took the information that we knew about HANS devices more seriously.
Mark Martin,"We got the lead before halfway and led the whole race, and that's a formula for heartbreak in my world because more often than not something happens to spoil that."
Mark Martin,I hate crying wolf and never say never. My primary racing is going to be the truck series for the championship.
Mark Martin,We had a handful on that last restart. Todd was really good on the restarts and he was giving it all he had. We had some big horsepower here and we just stepped on it and got across the line first.
Mark Martin,"I looked like giving up wouldn't have been all bad at one time, but nobody on this team did. We had a tough break at the start of the race."
Mark Martin,"He did a fabulous job. He was giving her everything he had, and I'm happy for him."
Mark Martin,"He did a fabulous job. He was giving everything he had, and I'm happy that he's gotten an opportunity to drive a Cup car. (He) made the most of it."
Mark Martin,We are going to look at the results at the end of the semester to determine the future of the program. I am really eager to see what the scores look like on the end of the semester report cards.
Mark Martin,I'm having a ball. This is so much fun.
Mark Martin,The right car won the race. But it would have been fun to have spoiled it.
Mark Martin,I'm having a good time. I'd have more fun if I had a little more time on my hands.
Mark Martin,That's a good way to start off the weekend. It was a lot of fun.
Mark Martin,"I'm not sure that just because [rookie] Reed Sorenson didn't have to race cars to put food on the table doesn't mean that he can't be as passionate. It's a different time and a different age. But certainly as an old-school guy, I don't think I have the words for it yet to explain why [Earnhardt] was able to have the kind of impact that he had on the sport."
Mark Martin,"We'll just keep fighting. I'm charged up. I'm excited. After a weekend of my race team fighting like they fought, we've got four more races so we're going to see if we can win some."
Mark Martin,"I don't believe the trophy makes the man. Tony Stewart, in my eyes, is the greatest race car driver I've watched drive in this era. A.J. Foyt might have been that when I was a little boy, but Tony Stewart is my driving hero."
Mark Martin,"Right now it rolls the eyes back in your head, it's so fast. It's too fast. There's no need is us going as fast as we're going in these cars around here."
Mark Martin,"The Falcon Press was already in existence when I came to Florence four years ago. I wanted to revive the program and see if we couldn't make it into something really special. We added the area in the hall near the book rack where students can sit for a few minutes and read, and above that one of our parents has painted a falcon, which is the school's mascot, with a book in its mouth. We added spotlights before school started this year so we could spotlight our authors."
Mark Martin,I'm trying really hard because Todd is in a new environment with these cars and in this series. It's not like he has a veteran crew chief leading him. I'm trying to give him a little small piece of that. I'm trying to help them move along.
Mark Martin,"I am going to go out there and do the best I can. That's all. I can control the effort ? our effort, my effort. I can't even come close to controlling the outcome of it. If we take our hit tomorrow, then that's what it is."
Mark Martin,"Martin will find that the intensity of the competition in Cup racing is much higher. But for the most part, he is an incredible driver and he has a good team and I think they will do well."
Mark Martin,"As long as people do as they said they would do, then anyone who makes a choice to do something different, as long as they fulfill obligations, then it's a free world and they should do that."
Mark Martin,That would be cheating. I wasn't raised that way.
Mark Martin,"I don't really follow college basketball much, but I've been lead in the direction to pick Auburn as my favorite. I think they would be somewhat of an underdog, and that's right up my alley so I'll go with the Tigers."
Mark Martin,"Well, it's a lot harder work when you get my age to get it done. But we're working real hard to get it done, and I'm having the time of my life. As of right now, this is the best it's ever been."
Michael Martin,"I put the house I share with my partner, Eric Webb, into a trust to keep it out of harm's way, legally. And I arranged to have the Jewel Box Theater cleared of liability. But the Jewel Box owners weren't convinced. They didn't want to be involved in anything that had been found illegal in a court."
Michael Martin,Consumers in Sonora know Arizona Mills. They have been to it. They love it. They know exactly what you are talking about.
Michael Martin,"It's a [small] baby industry, pooling its resources."
Michael Martin,I do know that some MPs give authority to another MP to put their name on such a motion. But I can't think of any member who would do so in this instance. I will look into the matter. That's the best I can do and I will continue watching Big Brother in my spare time.
Mike Martin,We did a good job in all of areas of hitting. We had some quality at bats. We got a lot of guys on base and had some timely hitting. We had a sloppy inning where we gave up some runs but what impressed me the most was we turn around and answered with two in our half. We showed some maturity.
Mike Martin,Obviously we made some mistakes in the middle of the game but that's something you just move on from. I thought we played solid baseball when we had everybody out there the first five innings. We played pretty good defense and we had some good at-bats. It was a good opening weekend.
Mike Martin,"I'm glad he's admitting to his guilt. I'm relieved that there won't be a trial, but there's still some unfinished business. I just want some careful consideration of the sentence. I want the evidence to be presented thoroughly and thoughtfully."
Mike Martin,He was really cooking. I must say it just took the wind out of my sail when the base hit occurred. It was a beautifully pitched baseball game.
Mike Martin,The issue doesn't seem to lend itself to a compromise. People love this valley because it is unique. We'll only become more unique with time as the place that didn't develop.
Paul Martin,"Have you ever, on a cloudless night, looked down from a passing aircraft flying over Canada? Endless, glowing strings of cities, towns, and homesteads. Stretching on and on, one province to the next. With only the stars in the distance."
Paul Martin,"The people of Canada have worked hard to build a country that opens its doors to include all, regardless of their differences; a country that respects all, regardless of their differences; a country that demands equality for all, regardless of their differences."
Paul Martin,I stated unequivocally that comments such as that are not acceptable and that violence against women is also a blight that besmirches all humanity.
Paul Martin,"Yes, I did a tough speech. But it had to be said, it had to be done. We are close friends, and you've got to be able to tell your close friends the truth."
Paul Martin,A decade ago it was Mike Harris; today it's Stephen Harper. It was the wrong way to build a society in 1995; it is still the wrong way to build a society today.
Paul Martin,We formed the CHNA to keep neighbors informed and connected about threats or challenges that might affect our overall quality of life. We've also worked hard to build various means of communication to do so.
Paul Martin,My primary coverage is through my health card.
Paul Martin,Now we must begin the hard work together.
Paul Martin,"They are giving all these young guys an opportunity to step up. They've seen us play in the past, they know what type of players we all are and that's why we're here."
Paul Martin,"Public fear, and bad information, could all too easily snowball into panic."
Paul Martin,"nonsense. More than that, it's a breach of faith. Countries must live up to their agreements."
Paul Martin,Canadians must be able to have faith in the integrity of government and in the people who administer it. That means finding out what went wrong and repairing the system.
Paul Martin,"Our world is changing; it is growing more competitive. Tomorrow, as today, a quality education and the right training will be the keys to success."
Paul Martin,stood for courage and resolve at a time of great need.
Paul Martin,"I rise today in support of Bill C-38, the Civil Marriage Act. I rise in support of a Canada in which liberties are safeguarded, rights are protected and the people of this land are treated as equals under the law."
Paul Martin,Every Canadian who wants to learn should have the opportunity to do so.
Paul Martin,At a moment that comes rarely in the life of a country. It is a time when destiny is ours to hold.
Paul Martin,The achievements we forge in this place and in our nation will not be those of one person or one party.
Paul Martin,"If we do not step forward, then we step back. If we do not protect a right, then we deny it."
Paul Martin,"As a people, we know what we can do, we know how to do it, and we just want to get on with it. How? By ensuring that Canada's place in the world is one of influence and pride."
Paul Martin,The vicious circle has been shattered. Canadians now enjoy the benefits of the virtuous circle.
Paul Martin,"Our veterans connect generations and Canadians. As a country and as individuals, we gain in pride and in purpose from their deeds and their service."
Paul Martin,"For years governments have been promising more than they can deliver, and delivering more than they can afford."
Paul Martin,I really think Canada should get over to Iraq as quickly as possible.
Paul Martin,Abbas when he was here in Canada and in subsequent conversations asked us specifically to do this.
Paul Martin,We will win Jan. 23 and we will be in power and we will give Canadians the Canada they want.
Paul Martin,"Canada was built by neighbors helping neighbors in times of crisis. That doesn't apply just within our borders,"
Paul Martin,"Canada is our country. It belongs to us and we belong to it. Let us join together, in our time, and make history once again."
Paul Martin,"In Canada, women's rights are a vital part of our effort to build a society of real equality - not just for some, but for all Canadians. A society in which women no longer encounter discrimination nor are shut out from opportunities open to others."
Paul Martin,"I rise in support of a Canada in which liberties are safeguarded, rights are protected and the people of this land are treated as equals under the law."
Paul Martin,"It's not emotional to state the facts, and the facts are that when you sign an agreement you should live up to its terms."
Paul Martin,"When he was a sophomore, he was this big but quiet kid who had a lot of ability. His biggest improvement has been his leadership. He's like a father figure out there. The guys turn to him and look for advice."
Rhona Martin,"She had no problem with it. We all knew we could have to sit a game out, because we are a five-woman team."
Rhona Martin,It's only because of the children that I went on. They were desperate for me to go to another Olympics.
Rhona Martin,"Unfortunately the Canadians got a bit of a head start and, although we tried to keep it close, Canada got their shots in before we did."
Richard Martin,It is not a youth market. The affluent youth segment is growing much slower than the affluent middle-aged householder market.
Richard Martin,"This convention is actually about trade clearly exceeds the mandate of UNESCO, ... deeply flawed and fundamentally incompatible with (the agency's) obligation to promote the free flow of ideas by word and image."
Richard Martin,The environment has shifted dramatically because parents demand healthier foods.
Richard Martin,The food and beverage industry shares the IOM's interest in reducing childhood obesity.
Richard Martin,"For too long Latin America has been seen as a place to sell; in our view the market will emerge as one of the most creative in the next few years, and will be exporting formats back to Europe and the US."
Robert Martin,"This is a little surprising, because I know that some of the integration work had already taken place, so I was under the impression that they were on track to close."
Robert Martin,"Finding impacted wisdom teeth 15,000 years ago indicates the human diet might have already changed, some would say 'deteriorated,' earlier than previously thought."
Robert Martin,"I think it's the great thing about having kids. They have interests that you might not have, and it opens your horizons."
Robert Martin,"We're not doing this because we think there will be no jobs and this will be a safety net. We think it's what musicians should have, what young musicians deserve and need. Our view is that musicians need a broader education."
Robert Martin,There's just no other way to get the information.
Robert Martin,"It's a health issue, is what it basically amounts to. We tried to have a counter, the first 15 seats, that was no smoking to split it up a bit, but it's such a closed area that no matter where you are, you're in smoke."
Robert Martin,Taking an interest in what others are thinking and doing is often a much more powerful form of encouragement than praise
Robert Martin,I think you need to think about your community and those who can't afford it.
Robert Martin,"Responsibility for learning belongs to the student, regardless of age"

Roger Martin,"Wherever there is a live-entertainment district, I don't care what urban setting you are talking about, there are going to be homeless people."
Steve Martin,Lots of women are getting involved. They're not satisfied just being passengers anymore.
Steve Martin,I believe you should place a woman on a pedestal - high enough so you can look up her dress
Steve Martin,"A kiss may not be the truth, but it is what we wish were true"
Steve Martin,"I am really happy to stay with FPR for next year, especially after the amount of progress that we have made. We are now consistently in the top ten and I believe we have not finished improving the bike yet. The guys that I have been working with have showed me a whole new level of professionalism and that has been a major influence in my decision."
Steve Martin,"Claire is actually younger in life than the role calls for, but her emotional knowledge continued to astound me. There was never any uneasiness between us in any of the delicate scenes we had to do."
Steve Martin,We're absolutely thrilled to be named as one of the Best Companies to Work for in Texas. It's an honor to be part of an incredible team that's committed to exceeding our clients' expectations and to making our agency a fun and creative place to come to every day.
Steve Martin,All of those things make it look like a really hard transaction to pull off. But it can be done.
Steve Martin,"These times are much franker. For example, in the first movie we have to assume that the daughter and the son-in-law who got married were lovers before they got married. That could never have been in the '50s."
Steve Martin,First the doctor told me the good news: I was going to have a disease named after me.
Steve Martin,I believe in eight of the ten commandments; and I believe in going to church every Sunday unless there's a game on

Steve Martin,"Well, excuuuuuse me!"
Steve Martin,What is comedy? Comedy is the art of making people laugh without making them puke.
Steve Martin,I believe Ronald Reagan can make this country what it once was... a large Arctic region covered with ice.
Steve Martin,Comedy may be big business but it isn't pretty.
Steve Martin,Hosting the Oscars is much like making love to a woman. It's something I only get to do when Billy Crystal is out of town.
Steve Martin,The real joy is in constructing a sentence. But I see myself as an actor first because writing is what you do when you are ready and acting is what you do when someone else is ready.
Steve Martin,"A day without sunshine is like, you know, night."
Steve Martin,"There is one thing I would break up over, and that is if she caught me with another woman. I won't stand for that."

Steve Martin,"Chaos in the midst of chaos isn't funny, but chaos in the midst of order is."
Steve Martin,"Boy, those French: They have a different word for everything!"
Steve Martin,"I believe entertainment can aspire to be art, and can become art, but if you set out to make art you're an idiot."
Steve Martin,I'm surprised even now that I was aware of things like that at that age. I don't know why. But I decided I would just rather not do them. So I quit for a while.
Steve Martin,"You know what your problem is, it's that you haven't seen enough movies - all of life's riddles are answered in the movies."
Tim Martin,"We never thought this would happen. The concerns we raised were because we cared about the safety of the students and everyone in the department. Then to be told on Feb. 10 that you have to have your stuff out that day, your e-mail shut down immediately and off the premises right then was tough. I was there 18 years. As of May 11, I guess it's all over."
Tim Martin,Their pressure hurt us when we were on their end of the court. We never throw away passes like we did. We never do that.
Tim Martin,"We believe sales and margins can recover over time, once customers adjust to the non-smoking environment. In the light of our strong earnings and cash flow, combined with our continued concentration on making many small improvements to the business, I remain confident of the company?s longer term future prospects."
Tim Martin,"Unlike some endurance races where a dry break fuel system is used, all refueling is by bowser pump like a normal service station."
Tim Martin,"And that's when everyone finally understood that, you know, we had fatalities. And again, you know the emotions of the room just it's almost like everybody in the room died."
Buck Martinez,"It's such a talent-laden lineup. If they just got good at-bats and good pitches, I think we'd be all right."
Buck Martinez,"I don't know that it's pressure, but I think it's a responsibility that they all sense. These guys, when you look around the field, I don't think their vocabulary includes 'pressure.' They like the competition. They like the challenge. And I think the challenge for us is to win this tournament, and they're aware of that."
Buck Martinez,Everybody feels like they got kicked in the stomach. They have a lot of pride. It's a tough feeling right now.
Buck Martinez,Everybody feels like they got kicked in the stomach. This team has a lot of pride. This was a tough day.
Buck Martinez,"It's unfortunate to have to sit around for two days, but that's the nature of the tournament. That's our fault."
Buck Martinez,I don't think there's any feeling it's unfair. I don't think you can allow outside influences to influence how you work a game. They are professional umpires. I think they do their best to get everything right.
Buck Martinez,I'm ready to play right now. It's a phenomenal honor. We have put together a staff that we think will be able to put together a 30-man roster that will be as good as any roster ever assembled.
Buck Martinez,"I hate to use the word 'cut,' because these guys aren't worthy of being cut. When you look at that roster, it's pretty unique in its versatility and its spectrum of experience."
Buck Martinez,"When you are battling like Roger did, it has a tendency to drain you more. Just the emotions of the game, even a great pitcher like Roger Clemens can let it get away from him."
Buck Martinez,There's no doubt in my mind they understand what the goal is now.
Buck Martinez,"It's a pretty good situation, but we need to have a little cooperation from the pool. That's our fate."
Buck Martinez,"We need to give (everybody) the opportunity. They made a commitment to us, and I made a commitment to them. At the same time, they now understand what the goal is here, and that is to advance."
Buck Martinez,"Well, not after we lost to Canada it doesn't."
Buck Martinez,"It's a very helpless feeling. We had the same feeling watching Mexico play Canada (last week). There was a lot of anticipation, a lot of anxiety. Once again, the nuances of international play change dramatically from what we're used to. At the same time, we are understanding of the situation. But it's an anxious time."
Buck Martinez,It's a very helpless feeling. We had the same feeling watching Mexico play Canada (last week).
Buck Martinez,"After losing to Canada, we're just thrilled we have the opportunity to advance."
Buck Martinez,"Clearly, there is quality baseball being played all over the world. The caliber of pitching we faced was outstanding. Many of our hitters came back to the dugout shaking their heads at the quality of pitches they were seeing. You know, there was a lot said about Team USA not really taking this seriously. But I can guarantee you there are a lot of guys hurting down in that clubhouse now."
Buck Martinez,"He's one of those guys that the majority of baseball fans aren't that familiar with, but baseball players know about him and how good he is and how dominant he is."
Buck Martinez,"You come in with a lot of anxiety about whether or not you remember (how to manage), but it is like riding a bike. I think it's something that comes back to you very quickly."
Buck Martinez,We know he has the ability to do things dramatically at the plate. He's got a powerful swing.

Mel Martinez,"In America, all things are possible."
Mel Martinez,"Home ownership lies at the very heart of the America dream, ... Affordable housing is a vital element of compassionate conservatism. It is my blessing that the dream has come true for me, and it is my responsibility to help the dream come true for others."
Pedro Martinez,"I feel strong enough to go more innings, but why rush? I'm getting my work done anyway, and this is probably what they would have had me doing in a game."
Pedro Martinez,"I really have to work to get used to the mound and throw pitches around the plate. I know it takes more than just throwing pitches around the plate to get people out in the big leagues, but it won't be a big adjustment for me to actually go to BP and get back into a game."
Pedro Martinez,The only one it didn't work for was me -- me and Billy the Kid.
Pedro Martinez,"It's getting to the stage where it's kind of boring. I just want to get my work in and do my job, because it's my job. If it were up to me, as cold as it's going to be, I wouldn't play. I would take a hike, go home, sleep and stay pretty warm. I wouldn't go out there. But it's my job."
Pedro Martinez,"I'm out of shape. I'm just trying to get back to the mound, see how my toe is. My arm is not full-strength. I still have a lot of work to do."
Pedro Martinez,"It's improving. I'm feeling more comfortable. I'm trying to react the normal way, but it takes a little while. It's going to take a little time, but I'm very optimistic."
Pedro Martinez,I was trying to bury a cutter low and away. I threw it a little harder. Mistake. It stayed up and matched his bat speed.
Pedro Martinez,"Everybody here is capable, and I trust anybody to do it - especially that old goat that's beside my locker."
Pedro Martinez,"My pitches are not as sharp, but at least I had the strength and the stamina that I wanted to feel. I'm glad it happened in a way, 'cause I got my work in."
Pedro Martinez,"That really never happened to me before, ... I learned something different. Franco was running, and I knew I had to try to get him. I looked at the replay and the coach never sent [Giles]. He just ran like somebody was chasing him."
Pedro Martinez,I'm a professional. I feel I have a responsibility when I go out there because those guys pay my salary.
Pedro Martinez,"The bigger the contract, the bigger the responsibility."
Pedro Martinez,"I can't do anything if we don't score runs. I can only do whatever possible to keep my team in the game, and from there on, it's up to them."
Pedro Martinez,"I wasn't playing mind games with anybody, I just said what I said. I am responsible for it, but I wish everybody would fall asleep for that one and let me go out there and do my thing."
Pedro Martinez,"I just try to do what I have to do and let the people out there do what they have to do, which is have fun, scream, yell and jump around. I try to do what I have to do, which is play baseball, and I can only play in that piece of area there, so that's what I try to do."
Pedro Martinez,"I didn't have the quality, but the quantity was there."
Pedro Martinez,"I felt the power in my fastball, ... That's probably why I left so many fastballs up. I was a little more erratic. I just couldn't get the ball over."
Pedro Martinez,"I was just like him at one point, and when they gave me the opportunity I became who I am today. I wish him the same thing... and I know that he's going to do good."
Pedro Martinez,"It was just a night for struggles,"
Pedro Martinez,That shows you that any mistakes you make are going to be costly. Lucky for me I made one mistake and it was only two runs.
Pedro Martinez,"I just guess I have to give them credit, ... For them to actually take advantage of my mistakes and hit them out - it wasn't just playing the game hard, but also to keep their concentration level so high that every time I made a mistake - they were my mistakes â€” that they hit them out."
Pedro Martinez,"I just guess I have to give them credit, ... For them to actually take advantage of my mistakes and hit them out - it wasn't just playing the game hard, but also to keep their concentration level so high that every time I made a mistake - they were my mistakes  that they hit them out."
Pedro Martinez,"Mine were not intentional, none of them. I didn't have it in my mind to come out and get myself in trouble. ... Things happen. If it's going to have to happen again, it's going to happen."
Pedro Martinez,I started off my year with my team and I don't mind finishing it with them.
Pedro Martinez,"Man. There's something in this old barn, isn't there?"
Pedro Martinez,"I try not to think about it, but the foot reminds me that I'm hurt. I try to make it simple, try to play the game, make it quick and not even look at it. If I'm in the heat of the game, I can just put it away. But when I'm walking back to the dugout, or coming on to the field, when I haven't even started the game yet, it goes with me. My mind's not occupied then."
Pedro Martinez,Sammy told me it would be an honor to join me in New York.
Pedro Martinez,"It's a non-issue. In my heart, I know that I didn't mean to do anything like that. If he doesn't want to understand it or anyone doesn't want to understand it, then it's fine. Let it go. It's over."
Pedro Martinez,Wish me health. I'll bring my own luck.
Pedro Martinez,"It depends on my health and how comfortable I feel, how quickly I can get on the mound. Obviously I'm a little bit behind."
Pedro Martinez,Everything is going to depend on how my health is by that date.
Pedro Martinez,"Look how far we are. I haven't even gotten on a mound. According to my experience, I don't think there will be enough time."
Pedro Martinez,"I wouldn't be surprised if that happens, but without a doubt, mine were not intentional. None of them. I didn't have in my mind to come out and get myself in trouble like that. I'm sure if I'm OK, I'm able to beat anybody without hitting anybody."
Pedro Martinez,I believe feeling pressure is feeling a lack of confidence. Carlos is confident now. These [new] guys are confident. I just have this weird feeling about us becoming so good.
Pedro Martinez,I know he was upset. He's been hit three times in the last two days - I don't blame him. But that wasn't my intention. That stuff happens in the game.
Pedro Martinez,I wasn't concerned about anything happening. I just played baseball.
Pedro Martinez,"A-Rod is probably the only guy I could compare him to at the same age, ... Alex had some unbelievable numbers at 21, 22."
Pedro Martinez,"The fact he is here at a short age, from Double A, shows how much emphasis he has put on improving and how good he has been. He is very mature for a Double A guy."
Pedro Martinez,"It's a great accomplishment. I can reflect on it now. This is probably one of the biggest things that has happened in my career. From the first day, all the doubts, all the second guessing my body type, it's something I should enjoy and reflect on the rest of my life."
Pedro Martinez,"I believe that if you're healthy, you're capable of doing everything. There's no one else who can give you health but God, and by being healthy I believe that God is listening to me."
Mike Martz,"My visit with Rod was exceptional. I think he's going to be a superstar. Everybody's got talent, nice facilities and all those kinds of things, but who you work with is critical and that was a big plus."
Mike Martz,We've come a long way defensively. We've got a ways to go. But our front seven is terrific.
Mike Martz,"Wherever the ball is, that's where he is. That's the mark of an outstanding player at that position. Wherever the ball is, you'll see his number."
Mike Martz,"We're going to move Adam back to strong safety. When it's all said and done, Adam's probably better down inside than back - particularly in our nickel package. He's such an instinctive and quick read guy in the running game. We miss him being up there."
Mike Martz,We're making progress.
Mike Martz,"I think if you watch out here in practice, his speed is truly remarkable. The refinement of that position is complete for him. Now it's just how to use him and where to use him and all of those good things."
Mike Martz,He was just starting to realize his full potential. He's obviously a terrific corner. We'll move on. It just provides an opportunity for somebody else to fill in the ranks and be a good player.
Mike Martz,Anytime you lose a player like him it's hard; it's tough. He was just starting to realize his full potential. He's obviously a terrific corner. We'll move on. It just provides an opportunity for somebody else to fill in the ranks and be a good player.
Mike Martz,I think that has a significant part in [the mistakes]. But I just didn't know it'd be to this extent.
Mike Martz,"We can play power football with him down after down, ... He can take that punishment."
Mike Martz,"Matt was exceptional today, best I've ever seen him play. He's playing remarkable football. He's completely given himself over to that coaching staff."
Mike Martz,"You are never going to fool Peter. There is nobody in the league that does his homework better than Peter does. He will know everything about you. Whether you sneeze, whether you wheeze, whatever you do. He is going to know everything. Probably as good of film guy as there is in the league on defense. Obviously he plays like that; he just doesn't make any mistakes."
Mike Martz,We lacked discipline. That's coaching. That's me. We need to get a lot more disciplined in every phase.
Mike Martz,We've been a very young team for a few years now. And a young team kind of lacks direction. I think the leadership that comes with guys that have been in the league playing at such a high level is invaluable.
Mike Martz,"Darn it! ... That's another coach in the league who can coach figure eights around me. But that's okay. There's still plenty of people in this organization on whom to blame defeats. Hey, you! Boy who holds the cords to my headset! It's your fault."
Mike Martz,"That would be unfair to Steve. But if I wanted an open line, isn't that my prerogative as head coach? This is all so bizarre."
Mike Martz,I haven't been feeling good for four or five weeks and there is some type of infection in my body that has gotten worse. They think they've identified what it is.
Mike Martz,"When we drafted these guys No. 1, the first thing everybody said - and I believe it - was that for a tackle, it usually takes three years to really establish yourself."
Mike Martz,"The main issue is durability for him at his age now. Speed is not the issue, his weight is down, he's playing as well as he's ever played, but he's got some wear and tear on those knees. To ask him to carry the load, he knows it's not going to be good for him physically. This will allow us to use both of them most effectively and hopefully, potentially, extend his career."
Mike Martz,I think he kind of really wants to be back in the action.
Mike Martz,It's all about the ability to block. It's about who the best hammer is. We've got to have a guy who can knock them out of there.

Groucho Marx,If I held you any closer I would be on the other side of you.
Groucho Marx,When I was young I was amazed at Plutarch's statement that the elder Cato began at the age of eighty to learn Greek. I am amazed no longer. Old age is ready to undertake tasks that youth shirked because they would take too long.

Karl Marx,Nothing can have value without being an object of utility
Karl Marx,"In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of a different stamp; some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions, without insight into the present movement, but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheer force of tradition; others mere brawlers, who, by dint of repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declamations against the government of the day, have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water They are an unavoidable evil: with time they are shaken off."

Karl Marx,"Capital is dead labor, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks."

Karl Marx,"Without doubt, machinery has greatly increased the number of well-to-do idlers."
Karl Marx,It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends.

Jamie Masada,"Then, he started giving me a chill,"
Jamie Masada,"[The Laugh Factory, whose flagship club on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood has long been a haven for freedom of expression enthusiasts, has upped the ante in New York by listing support for Miller on the club's marquee.] Jailing a journalist for keeping confidential a conversation she had, has a chilling effect on free expression, ...

Khaled Mashaal,"You can be sure that our feeling is peace and hope, good for all people in the world, but not any side that occupies our land or makes aggression on our people. No peace without our legitimate rights. No stability with occupation. No peace with occupation. This is our right."

Khaled Mashaal,We will respect any agreement as long as it is in the interest of our people.

Abraham Maslow,"A child wants some kind of undisrupted routine or rhythm. He seems to want a predictable, orderly world. For instance, injustice, unfairness or inconsistency in the parents seems to make a child feel anxious and unsafe. This attitude may not be so mu"
Abraham Maslow,"The desire to know and to understand are themselves connotative, i.e. have a striving character, and are as much personality needs as the `basic needs' we have already discussed."
Abraham Maslow,"This Third Psychology is now one facet of a new philosophy of life, a new conception of man, the beginning of a new century of work."
Abraham Maslow,"Too many of the findings that have been made in animals have been proven to be true for animals, but not for the human being. There is no reason whatsoever why we should start with animals in order to study human motivation."
Abraham Maslow,"If you treat your children at home in the same way you treat your animals in the lab, your wife will scratch your eyes out. My wife ferociously warned me against experimenting on her babies."
Abraham Maslow,"The fact is that people are good, Give people affection and security, and they will give affection and be secure in their feelings and their behavior."
Abraham Maslow,"All the evidence that we have indicates that it is reasonable to assume in practically every human being, and certainly in almost every newborn baby, that there is an active will toward health, an impulse towards growth, or towards the actualization."
Abraham Maslow,"It is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."
Abraham Maslow,A first rate soup is better than a second rate painting.
Abraham Maslow,"If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail."
Abraham Maslow,"We fear to know the fearsome and unsavory aspects of ourselves, but we fear even more to know the godlike in ourselves."
Abraham Maslow,"We are not in a position in which we have nothing to work with. We already have capacities, talents, direction, missions, callings."
Abraham Maslow,"Classic economic theory, based as it is on an inadequate theory of human motivation, could be revolutionized by accepting the reality of higher human needs, including the impulse to self actualization and the love for the highest values."
Abraham Maslow,"What a man can be, he must be. This need we call self-actualization."
Abraham Maslow,A first-rate soup is more creative than a second-rate painting.
Abraham Maslow,"Dispassionate objectivity is itself a passion, for the real and for the truth."
Abraham Maslow,I was awfully curious to find out why I didn't go insane.
Abraham Maslow,"To the man who only has a hammer, everything he encounters begins to look like a nail."
Abraham Maslow,"If you deliberately plan on being less than you are capable of being, then I warn you that you'll be unhappy for the rest of your life."
Abraham Maslow,"But behavior in the human being is sometimes a defense, a way of concealing motives and thoughts, as language can be a way of hiding your thoughts and preventing communication."
Abraham Maslow,We may define therapy as a search for value.
Abraham Maslow,"One's only rival is one's own potentialities. One's only failure is failing to live up to one's own possibilities. In this sense, every man can be a king, and must therefore be treated like a king."
Abraham Maslow,"To the man who only has a hammer in the toolkit, every problem looks like a nail."
Abraham Maslow,"If I were dropped out of a plane into the ocean and told the nearest land was a thousand miles away, I'd still swim. And I'd despise the one who gave up."
Abraham Maslow,"A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself."
Abraham Maslow,The story of the human race is the story of men and women selling themselves short.
Abraham Maslow,"When all you own is a hammer, every problem starts looking like a nail."
Abraham Maslow,"If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail."
Abraham Maslow,What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.
Abraham Maslow,"If you plan on being anything less than you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life."
Abraham Maslow,He that is good with a hammer tends to think everything is a nail.
Abraham Maslow,"The fact is that people are good, if only their fundamental wishes are satisfied, their wish for affection and security. Give people affection and security, and they will give affection and be secure in their feelings and their behavior."
Abraham Maslow,"If both the physiological and the safety needs are fairly well gratified, then there will emerge love and affection and belongingness needs, and the whole cycle already described will repeat itself with this new centre. Now the person will feel keenl"
Abraham Maslow,"There is, first, the desire for strength, for achievement, for adequacy, for confidence in the face of the world, and for independence and freedom. Secondly, we have what we may call the desire for reputation or prestige (defining it as respect or es"

David Mason,"The sound waves are vibrations, ... It's the ability to readjust your senses so you can feel the music."
Glen Mason,He?s an awfully good quarterback that happens to also be an outstanding athlete.
Glen Mason,"[Penn State rushed for 364 yards, most of them up the middle, in a 44-14 victory over the Gophers two weeks ago.] Terrible. Atrocious, ... We violated about every fundamental there is."
Glen Mason,"Our running game has been built on the idea that if you always run to make 4 yards, every once in a while you'll make 44. If you always look to make a 44-yard gain, you'll only make 4 inches."
Glen Mason,"I thought our wide receivers really stepped it up in blocking, ... Because with a lot of the perimeter running that we do, they become point-of-attack blockers, and they really did a good job."
Glen Mason,Joel and I feel that's going to be a reality sooner rather than later.
Glen Mason,We're proud of the progress we've made. But we don't feel the job is done yet.
Glen Mason,We used this spring practice to our benefit. We got better in some areas. I thought our offensive line really moved along and we made a vast improvement in our secondary. It put us in good shape to utilize our time between now and August to improve the football team.
Glen Mason,"I think in a lot of ways the Cavaliers' performance mirrors the Gophers' performance. At times they look really, really good. At other times you think there's some room for improvement."
Glen Mason,"I think in a lot of ways that the Cavaliers' performance mirrored the Gophers' performance or vice versa. At times, they look really, really good. And at other times, you think, well, there's some room for improvement there. But certain games look spectacular. (They) just jump at you."
Glen Mason,"I think, in a lot of ways, that the Cavaliers' performance mirrored the Gophers' performance or vice versa. At times, they looked really, really good. In certain games, they look spectacular, just jump out at you. At times, you think, there's room for improvement."
Glen Mason,"[It came from his coach, Glen Mason, as a maroon-and-gold celebration spilled from the field toward the dressing room and threatened to engulf them Saturday afternoon. Mason spotted Maroney walking up the ramp in the Metrodome.] I said, 'You've got to run,'  ... He said, 'Coach, I can't run.' He said, 'You carry me and run, and we'll get it done.'"
Glen Mason,"Football is a 60-minute game. We've been on both ends of those where you start and sometimes you've got to come from behind. Momentum swings, and when you've got it, you want to keep it, and if it goes the other way, sometimes it's hard to get it back."
Glen Mason,"There are ways to coach -- one is not to lose and the other is to coach to win. I learned a long time ago that it is a lot more fun to try and coach to win. If you want to be critical, it was my decision to try and score before the half, leaving time on clock."
Glen Mason,"It's not just an athlete who is taking the snaps under center who has the ability to do things. It's a darn good quarterback. They add a dimension. Besides throwing and mobility, they've got that unique ability that when you think you've got them, you don't. That's when something really bad happens."
Jackie Mason,Victory goes to the player who makes the next-to-last mistake.
Jackie Mason,Did you ever hear of a kid playing accountant - even if they wanted to be one?

Jackie Mason,It is more profitable for your congressman to support the tobacco industry than your life.
Jackie Mason,"I have enough money to last me the rest of my life, unless I buy something."
Jackie Mason,It's no longer a question of staying healthy. It's a question of finding a sickness you like.
Jackie Mason,Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe.
John Mason,"The wise man has his foibles, as well as the fool. But the difference between them is, that the foibles of the one are known to himself and concealed from the world; and the foibles of the other are known to the world and concealed from himself."
John Mason,"I was crying, I was laughing, I was trying to stay calm to talk to her to keep her calm."
John Mason,I am ready any time. Do not keep me waiting.
John Mason,She knows what is the best purpose of education: not to be frightened by the best but to treat it as part of daily life.
John Mason,The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
John Mason,I don't think I have seen raises like the ones we've had the past two years since I've been here - and with relatively low inflation. I think that's highly commendable.
John Mason,I am as content to die for God's eternal truth on the scaffold as in any other way.
John Mason,"Happiness consists in activity -- it is a running stream, not a stagnant pool."
John Mason,"Friendship should be a private pleasure, not a public boast. I loathe those braggarts who are forever trying to invest themselves with importance by calling important people by their first names in or out of print. Such first-naming for effect makes me cringe."
John Mason,"The aim of education should be to convert the mind into living fountain, and not a reservoir."
John Mason,No one is worthy of a good home here or in heaven that is not willing to be in peril for a good cause.
John Mason,"A good conversationalist is not one who remembers what was said, but says what someone wants to remember."
John Mason,"While an original is always hard to find, he is easy to recognize."
John Mason,"As every thread of gold is valuable, so is every moment of time."
Richard Mason,"Don't assume that all travel policies are the same, or that they will cover you for everything that might go wrong. Many policies, particularly the no-frills cover, can be very limited."
Richard Mason,"Winter sports insurance has become more refined as skiers are getting more adventurous. Some policies won't cover you for activities such as ice-skating or tobogganing ... some, particularly the no-frills cover can be very limited."
Richard Mason,There are insurance options and you need to consider the health of your teeth and how often you visit the dentist.
Richard Mason,"It's not unusual that movers and shakers, important people, are involved in lots of different organizations. The conflict of interest occurs whenever you are in one role and you let one of your secondary roles materially influence how you behave in that situation."
Tom Mason,The sentencing of James Davies marks the end of an extensive and thorough investigation involving three police forces.
Tom Mason,There's nothing wrong with the design of the intersection.
Tom Mason,"The communication between the managers and the rest of the town staff is better,"
Tom Mason,A lot of people consider walking to be a recreational choice. But for some it is their mode of transportation.
Tom Mason,This authority and myself would not want to discriminate against anybody.
Tom Mason,I don't accept there has been a lack of action.
Tony Mason,"Richard was doing his job - keeping people like that outside of the club. Obviously, that guy did not need to be in there with other people."
Tony Mason,It's not just a football game. It's not just a big party. Each activity's especially meant with a major purpose.
Tony Mason,"It's not just a football game. It's not just a big party. Each activity's especially meant with a major purpose,"
John Massey,"It's frustrating. But we sign it, and we take responsibility for it."
John Massey,We're not putting blinders on their eyes.
John Massey,"To be honest with you, for a freshman to step into that environment against that caliber of a team is phenomenal."
John Massey,My biggest goal is to have a company my daughter can take over when she gets old enough.
Mike Matheny,Those were some of the best pitches he threw all night. Matt just has to realize Todd's pretty good. He's done that to people for a long time.
Mike Matheny,"That was special. He was a huge thing for me to have (in college) as a catcher. To have his stamp of approval, I had no idea (he would be here)."
Mike Matheny,"It floors me the way he thinks, how under control he is. Any kid in America who wants to be a big-league shortstop should watch every move he makes. Every kid in Venezuela, too."
Mike Matheny,"She took the advice, ... and Jack came to me the first day in Spring Training and told me what I said made a big impact."
Kim Mathers,"My husband came up to Hot Rocks to check up on me, why is still unknown to me because if I was to cheat on him it wouldn't be in a neighborhood bar where he knows I am."
Kim Mathers,"I have always taken his word on things and stood by his side. Even after the whole situation up at Hot Rocks, I tried to defend him."
Kim Mathers,"Had he asked any questions before he flew off the handle, he would have realized that everyone with me (both male and female) were only friends."
Kim Mathers,"First and foremost, I would like to start off by saying that just because my husband is an entertainer, that does not mean that our personal business is for everyone's entertainment purposes."
Kim Mathers,"Every time I find a picture of him with other women, or read in magazines that he's involved with 'groupies,' I don't go and show up where he is making a huge scene and getting our faces put all over the TV and papers."
Matt Mathes,We have jurisdiction over federal land.
Matt Mathes,"When trees are killed in fires, there is a lot of dead standing timber out there. Our fear is that eventually a wind storm will blow the dead trees over and create an enormous campfire effect across thousands of acres."
Matt Mathes,Katrina is undoubtedly the biggest problem for the country right now. We had to look at national priorities.
Henri Matisse,Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.
Henri Matisse,"A distinction is made between painters who work directly from nature and those who work purely from imagination. Personally, I think neither of these methods must be preferred to the exclusion of the other. Both may be used in turn by the same indivi"
Henri Matisse,Exactitude is not truth.
Henri Matisse,Instinct must be thwarted just as one prunes the branches of a tree so that it will grow better.
Henri Matisse,Impressionism is the newspaper of the soul.
Henri Matisse,I wouldn't mind turning into a vermilion goldfish.
Henri Matisse,With color one obtains an energy that seems to stem from witchcraft.
Henri Matisse,"I do not literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me."
Henri Matisse,"You study, you learn, but you guard the original naivete. It has to be within you, as desire for drink is within the drunkard or love is within the lover."
Henri Matisse,"There is nothing more difficult for a truly creative painter than to paint a rose, because before he can do so he has first to forget all the roses that were ever painted."
Henri Matisse,To look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage.
Henri Matisse,Creativity takes courage.
Henri Matisse,"My choice of colors does not rest on any scientific theory; it is based on observation, on feeling, on the experience of my sensibility. Inspired by certain pages of Delacroix, an artist like Signac is preoccupied with complementary colors, and the t"
Henri Matisse,"A young woman has young claws, well sharpened. If she has character, that is. And if she hasn't so much the worse for you."
Henri Matisse,"I'm growing old, I delight in the past."
Henri Matisse,There are always flowers for those who want to see them.
Henri Matisse,"It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression."
Henri Matisse,"Time extracts various values from a painter's work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is."
Henri Matisse,I don't paint things. I only paint the difference between things.
Luis Matos,That's in the past. He says he wants to stay here. I don't expect him to say he's sorry.
Luis Matos,He's only been here two or three weeks. I know he's a hustle guy. I have it in my mind he's always going to be there. We need to communicate a little better.
Luis Matos,It's pretty bad right now. It's real frustrating to be losing all these games.
Luis Matos,We just shut it down all of a sudden and started playing bad baseball.
Hideki Matsui,"He's very observant and always thinking, ... I appreciate his words, and what he spoke today had an impact. [The speech] got us going a little bit."
Hideki Matsui,(Friday's) game has nothing to do with today from my perspective. But any time the bases are loaded you want to bring a run or two in and make something happen.
Hideki Matsui,"I had no intention to compete with Ichiro or anything like that. It certainly is an honor, but beyond that honor comes the responsibility to fulfill that contract."
Hideki Matsui,"It's certainly an honor, but with that honor comes the responsibility to fulfil the contract,"
Hideki Matsui,"Usually when I get into that habit, soft toss corrects that. In terms of checking where you are and where you hit the ball, the tee was good for that."
Hideki Matsui,"I'm not conscious of it, but usually when my hitting goes bad, that tends to happen. It's a habit of mine."
Hideki Matsui,I don't have any special feelings (about 500) but I am pleased to have been able to build toward that.
Hideki Matsui,I fear that chasing two goals might get in the way of that dream.
Hideki Matsui,"[Conversation of the day: Yogi Berra with Hideki Matsui - without a translator.] It was in Japanese, always Japanese, ... Yogi just likes to joke around with me."
Yukihiro Matsumoto,"Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore."
Yukihiro Matsumoto,"From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ - but the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the same power to the programmer."
Yukihiro Matsumoto,"The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity."
Thad Matta,He has a chance to be special. But it all starts with the humility he carries for 17 years old.
Thad Matta,"It is a tremendous honor to be a No. 2 seed, and to get to play so close to home in Dayton. It is an incredible feeling, and it will be interesting to start preparing. But right now we need some rest and then we'll get our guys going for the NCAA Tournament."
Thad Matta,"It's hard, because it's been such a tremendous season. This ride has been one of the most incredible I've been on as a coach. That's a credit to the kids. It's hard to accept it's over, because it's been so much fun."
Thad Matta,"We had a long talk after the Iowa game. I was a little nervous to see how we would come out, but the guys have responded pretty well all year."
Thad Matta,I thought we did a great job of sharing the basketball and finding the open guys. To have 20 assists and nine turnovers is something we're always striving for.
Thad Matta,"I think today was a great, great college basketball game and unfortunately for us, Wisconsin made the plays they needed to make down the stretch to beat us, which is a credit to them. We had opportunities and, with Wisconsin?s help, we at times lost our composure on both ends of the floor."
Dave Matthews,This Land is Your Land.
Dave Matthews,"Take what you can from your dreams, make them as real as anything."
Dave Matthews,Celebrate we will because life is short but sweet for certain we're climbing two by two to be sure these days continue.
Dave Matthews,I can't believe that we would lie in our graves wondering if we had spent our living days well. I can't believe that we would lie in our graves dreaming of things that we might have been.
James Matthews,"We hope to sell a lot of them, and we will be selling them up until the 24th, ... Along with that, we're putting on a lamb and goat show out at Gibbs Ranch and that's where we're going to have our drawing."
James Matthews,About one-third of the county probably doesn't know we have a health department.
James Matthews,"He's an energy guy. He's the one who motivates us, and every time he steps on the court, he gives 110 percent."
James Matthews,"For the first time, in countries like Canada, France, Korea, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, year-end bonuses for this group are the norm and not the exception."
James Matthews,"Then what I asked was, 'could we do it when the baseball team is away?' and that's pretty much what we were looking for. If they were having an away game, why couldn't we use the track during those times."
James Matthews,"It takes me back to my shock, my anger and sadness,"
Leigh Matthews,Every player who is fit and well is playing particularly when we don't have to travel for the first week.
Leigh Matthews,I have not formulated a team in my mind yet so it is too early to be certain of those things.
Leigh Matthews,You want the emotional roller-coaster ... that's what we love about our sport. In the media you know what your weekend and your emotions are going to be.
Leigh Matthews,All the conditioning measurements had shown an improvement by the players on previous results.
Leigh Matthews,"We really haven't been scoring enough. There is nothing like scoreboard pressure. It's one thing to be seven goals behind but, if you have kicked eight and they have kicked 15, for instance, you have at least done some scoring. But if you are that far behind and are not scoring, it is really hard to keep morale up."
Leigh Matthews,We are glad we got him and you think 'yeah that is a good draft choice'.
Don Mattingly,"I can't concern myself with what's going on with the club or what the media is writing. If you pay attention to those things, that's when you get yourself in trouble."
Don Mattingly,"The players get no respect around here. They give you money, that's it, not respect. We get constantly dogged and players from other teams love to see that. That's why nobody wants to play here."
Don Mattingly,"Honestly, at one time I though Babe Ruth was a cartoon character. I really did, I mean I wasn't born until 1961 and I grew up in Indiana."
Don Mattingly,"I'd like to say this was our worst game. Unfortunately, I can't."
John Mattingly,This little girl is as strong and capable and bright as she can be because of her mother. It makes us hopeful for the futureâ€¦that she will in the long run do well.
John Mattingly,This little girl is as strong and capable and bright as she can be because of her mother. It makes us hopeful for the futurethat she will in the long run do well.
John Mattingly,"They have been a part of her family. She knows them quite well, ... She knows and loves them."
John Mattingly,"We do want to make sure that her family, that could be quite strong down in Bolivia, know what's happened and have a chance to figure out what they would like to see done."
Joel Maturi,"If there is a communications issue, that's something we'll work to improve. I need to talk to more than just a few people about things before we reach any conclusions."
Joel Maturi,"Some sports are more challenged than others, but we're committed to improving the numbers. We don't want any sport below 925. It's not an easy job. We just need to make sure that anybody who is admitted to the university has the ability to graduate, has the right support and is monitored appropriately."
Joel Maturi,"I want to talk to coach ( Don ) Lucia . The difference is that in Green Bay, the Packers incurred the risk. Here, we would be taking the risk. I've got to weigh the options. I'm not looking to make a lot of money, but I certainly can't afford to lose any money."
Joel Maturi,We are extremely happy to have an agreement on the key terms of the contract. I have said all along that we were committed to keeping coach Mason at the University of Minnesota and today is certainly an indication of that desire.
Drew Matus,On a real basis the trade deficit widened by over $1.7 billion for the month and places the trade balance on a trajectory that would likely reduce fourth-quarter GDP growth by more than 0.5 percent.
Drew Matus,"The overall number does suggest modest amounts of strength, but nothing necessarily that gets me too excited."
Drew Matus,"Despite the modest decline, the other indices released within this report suggest more strength than does the headline."
Drew Matus,"We expect a balanced speech that reaffirms that a March hike is likely, but that subsequent moves are data-dependent."
Drew Matus,Don Kohn is the closest thing to a Greenspan clone that modern science has produced.
Drew Matus,The prices received number tells us that basically some firms are gaining pricing power. What that really means is there could be inflation in the outlook.
Drew Matus,"The labor market is hot and getting hotter, and that is one of the reasons the Fed continues to raise rates."
Drew Matus,This data supports the Fed's view of Katrina -- the hurricane is likely to have only a short-lived influence on the national economy while the reduction in capacity and higher energy prices could prove inflationary.
Drew Matus,"With this kind of income growth, the consumer has room to run. This tells us we don't need to worry about the first quarter."
Joe Mauer,He could fit in just fine. He's been throwing strikes. He just comes in and gets his work done. He's pretty professional.
Joe Mauer,"He's got my vote,"
Joe Mauer,"Having the first year of going through that and getting to know these guys, that's a lot of information, ... It's not only a physical demand on you, but mentally as well."
Joe Mauer,"Coming in, I had a lot of questions whether I'd go a whole year, ... Even though [doctors] said I should be all right, still, you have it in the back of your mind."
Joe Mauer,I don't think it's just our hitting. It's overall. The balls aren't bouncing our way.
Marc Mauer,"Policymakers would be wise to reconsider the wisdom of current sentencing and drug policies, both to avoid expensive incarceration costs and to invest in more productive prevention and treatment approaches to crime,"
Marc Mauer,"Policymakers would be wise to reconsider the wisdom of current sentencing and drug policies, both to avoid expensive incarceration costs and to invest in more productive prevention and treatment approaches to crime."

W. Somerset Maugham,"It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who has lost it."
W. Somerset Maugham,There are three rules for writing the novel. Unfortunately no one knows what they are.
W. Somerset Maugham,The writer is more concerned to know than to judge.
W. Somerset Maugham,The trouble with young writers is that they are all in their sixties.
W. Somerset Maugham,"It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive."
W. Somerset Maugham,"The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic, and self-complacent is erroneous, on the contrary, it makes them for the most part, humble, tolerant, and kind. Failure makes people bitter and cruel."
W. Somerset Maugham,"What has influenced my life more than any other single thing has been my stammer. Had I not stammered I would probably... have gone to Cambridge as my brothers did, perhaps have become a don and every now and then published a dreary book about French literature."
W. Somerset Maugham,Perfection is what American women expect to find in their husbands... but English women only hope to find in their butlers.
W. Somerset Maugham,Perfection has one grave defect. It is apt to be dull.
W. Somerset Maugham,American women expect to find in their husbands a perfection that English women only hope to find in their butlers.
W. Somerset Maugham,You are not angry with people when you laugh at them. Humor teaches tolerance.
W. Somerset Maugham,"Hypocrisy is the most difficult and nerve-racking vice that any man can pursue; it needs an unceasing vigilance and a rare detachment of spirit. It cannot, like adultery or gluttony, be practiced at spare moments; it is a whole-time job."
W. Somerset Maugham,The unfortunate thing about this world is that the good habits are much easier to give up than the bad ones.
W. Somerset Maugham,"By the time a man notices that he is no longer young, his youth has long since left him."
W. Somerset Maugham,We know our friends by their defects rather than their merits.
W. Somerset Maugham,"If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose its freedom: and the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will lose that, too."
W. Somerset Maugham,There are two good things in life -- freedom of thought and freedom of action.
W. Somerset Maugham,"It's a funny thing about life: if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it."
W. Somerset Maugham,Only a mediocre person is always at his best.
W. Somerset Maugham,"If a man should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no otherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because it was I."
W. Somerset Maugham,It is funny about life: if you refuse to accept anything but the very best you will very often get it.
W. Somerset Maugham,You know what the critics are. If you tell the truth they only say you're cynical and it does an author no good to get a reputation for cynicism.
W. Somerset Maugham,People who ask for your criticism want only praise.
W. Somerset Maugham,You can do anything in this world if you are prepares to take the consequences.
W. Somerset Maugham,"Common-sense appears to be only another name for the thoughtlessness of the unthinking. It is made of the prejudices of childhood, the idiosyncrasies of individual character and the opinion of the newspapers."
W. Somerset Maugham,Common sense and nature will do a lot to make the pilgrimage of life not too difficult.
W. Somerset Maugham,"I am told that today rather more than 60 per cent of the men who go to university go on a Government grant. This is a new class that has entered upon the scene. It is the white-collar proletariat. They do not go to university to acquire culture but to get a job, and when they have got one, scamp it. They have no manners and are woefully unable to deal with any social predicament. Their idea of a celebration is to go to a public house and drink six beers. They are mean, malicious and envious . They are scum."
W. Somerset Maugham,"What makes old age hard to bear is not the failing of one's faculties, mental and physical, but the burden of one's memories."
W. Somerset Maugham,"The complete life, the perfect pattern, includes old age as well as youth and maturity. The beauty of the morning and the radiance of noon are good, but it would be a very silly person who drew the curtains and turned on the light in order to shut out the tranquillity of the evening. Old age has its pleasures, which, though different, are not less than the pleasures of youth."
W. Somerset Maugham,"The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind."
W. Somerset Maugham,"We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person."
W. Somerset Maugham,Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species.
W. Somerset Maugham,"Imagination grows by exercise, and contrary to common belief, is more powerful in the mature than in the young."
W. Somerset Maugham,"When you choose your friends, don't be short-changed by choosing personality over character."

William Maugham,"The value of art is not beauty, but right action"
William Maugham,Beauty is an ecstasy; it is as simple as hunger. There is really nothing to be said about it. It is like the perfume of a rose: you can smell it and that is all.

Armistead Maupin,Being in love is the only transcendent experience.
Armistead Maupin,I have always distrusted memoir. I tend to write my memoirs through my fiction. It's easier to get to the truth by not claiming that you are speaking it. Some things can be said in fiction that can never be said in memoir.

Kevin Mawae,"It's tough to deal with, knowing what Chad went through last year, and just fighting to get back to where he could play again this year. I just spoke with him a little while ago and he's a little down in the dumps right now. From the friend standpoint, you have to feel bad for the guy, from a team standpoint we just have to move on with the guy that comes in there. Brooks Bollinger is going to do a great job and maybe he'll provide the spark for us that we need on offense."

John Maxwell,"She shows that the force has a lot of talent in it. It also shows that the police force is becoming more intelligent because the women used to have a hard time being in the force, but this shows that all that is changing."
John Maxwell,"The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. Just do it. Exercise, lose weight, test your blood sugar, or whatever. Do it without motivation. And then, guess what? After you start doing the thing, that's when the motivation comes and makes it easy for you to keep on doing it."
John Maxwell,"Remember, man does not live on bread alone: sometimes he needs a little buttering up."
John Maxwell,"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way."

The whole purpose of scouting is to help the children grow up making good decisions in life."
William Maxwell,"Wilkinson acknowledges, ''but I mostly side-stepped them. Still, in any relationship, including marriage, issues arise when the balance changes drastically or great success is achieved suddenly. It's only natural. You're both moving toward the same point, and some accommodation must be made. In my case, I grew out of being Bill's son to being something like a friend and colleague."
William Maxwell,Happiness is the light on the water. The water is cold and dark and deep.
William Maxwell,It was lovely when you found students who responded to things you were enthusiastic about.
Brian May,I have a perfectly clear idea of what was in Freddie's mind. But it was unwritten law among us in those days that the real core of a song lyric was a private matter for the composer.
Brian May,"It was very much like losing a family member. And, of course, you never really get over it. You get through it and you rebuild your life. But it's always there. And I will always carry that with me."
Brian May,"I don't think anybody comes close to The Beatles, including Oasis."
Brian May,"Not for a million -- years. I mean, I like the INXS boys, but I found the process very degrading, really. Reality television has eaten away at our standards of excellence. I don't like this whole culture, which has evolved, of TV being the king."
Brian May,"It was really there in our heads from the beginning - to get the orchestration of the voices and guitars. It was just a question of being able to realize the dream, and getting the time and money and studio equipment to be able to do it. Actually, the 'Queen II' album [in 1974] had a lot of that in it - it tends to be slightly underrated, but a lot of the foundations for the sound were laid on that album."
James May,"We absolutely support the concept of Secure Flight, or whatever name you want to give to passenger pre-screening. It's the concept that we support. We don't support at this time Registered Traveler, we think it takes the focus away from where we really ought to have it."

James May,The reality is that we do not have an air traffic control system that is smart enough and technologically capable enough to be able to handle that kind of demand.
Mark May,It's still unclear to what degree AOL will market the service. They may not be all that aggressive. This has to be a very successful product to win market share.
Mark May,"It's wonderful for the kids. They can go out and they have access to all those facilities right next door every school day, and they get a lot of use of them, and of course physical activity is so important these days."
Mark May,Bob Stoops made the right decisions in this game. Mack Brown did not.

John Mayer,I'm weaker than you know.
John Mayer,"Never, ever underestimate the power of 'Id Like that."
John Mayer,"Even if you think the flame has died, there's at least one lyric that'll hit that last hot spot, and then you'll find yourself as f***ed as you were the day you lied and said you never wanted to see her again,"
John Mayer,"And if you never stop when you wave goodbye, you just might find, if you give it time, you will wave hello again. You just might wave hello again. And that's the way this wheel keeps working now."
John Mayer,"I need some kind of emotional stake in it to write my lyrics, assuming that place. It might just be an emotion I understand but am not currently experiencing necessarily."
John Mayer,"Numb is the new deep, done with the old me, and talk is the same cheap it's been."
John Mayer,"I'm not as surprised in going from playing 1,000 seats to 4,000 seats as I was from 100 to 500 seats."
John Mayer,"People want to see musicians sing things that come from their own mind and own heart in real time, responding to the moment for them."
John Mayer,"Everybody is just a stranger, but that's the danger in going my own way."
John Mayer,I'm singing what I want to sing based on the emotion of what that day feels like. That's what comes out of my mouth and guitar. That impacts people. They know anything can happen.
John Mayer,I feel my shows are like a late-night talk show that we settle down and do every night.
John Mayer,I feel strikingly domestic. We're in our own world with two busses and trucks.
John Mayer,"I think people right now, the age they are, being 21 and 22, really do want to find a group of bands they can take with them through life."
John Mayer,"I hope that what it comes down to at the end of the day is that people believe that I believe what I'm singing. It comes down to being believable. You don't have to be likeable; generally, though, I think I am."
John Mayer,Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain.
John Mayer,I'm getting to a point where everything is becoming streamlined in my life. I'm learning how to stand onstage for two hours and play in front of thousands of people as if I am completely in the moment every moment.
John Mayer,It is too easy to watch music coming out of people's mouths lately and you're not quite sure if it was written with the best of intentions.
John Mayer,"High School is like a spork: it's a crappy spoon and a crappy fork, so in the end it's just plain useless."
John Mayer,"If you get half a million, at a certain stage you probably will get 4 million people, if they are able to hear it. The touring thing is unbelievable. It really is amazing from what we did the last tour even to what we are doing now."
John Mayer,I'd like to think the best of me was still hiding up in my sleeve.
John Mayer,"Sometimes I wish that I was the weather, you'd bring me up in conversation forever. And when it rained, I'd be the talk of the day."
Marissa Mayer,Steve Jobs is the best at launching new products. They have to see how he does it.
Marissa Mayer,"We are excited to make an investment in AOL's future. It gives us more opportunities with more advertisers, and more kinds of advertising programs."
Marissa Mayer,"The market favors open choice for search, and companies should compete for users based on their quality of search services."
Marissa Mayer,We believe that we have an index that is three times larger (without counting duplicate pages).
Jeremy Mayfield,"I asked him before and he said he wasn't looking. ... You've got to trust each other. When you ask a guy questions and he says he's not looking and you find out later he is, that's not good either. The trust is gone when that happens."
Jeremy Mayfield,"But the other guys are going to have to have trouble, too. That's something you haven't seen yet -- but it's coming."
Jeremy Mayfield,"I think we've got the first 26-race deal figured out,"
Jeremy Mayfield,"It's a great place, a great area to race in, all that, ... It just hadn't been that good for us as a race team. We just haven't had the finishes we feel like we needed there."
Jeremy Mayfield,"We should have pitted with the leaders late there at Bristol, ... But we didn't, and we paid for it. But that's NASCAR Ã¢â‚¬â€ you win some, or none, and you lose most."
Jeremy Mayfield,"We're not giving up, ... It's better now than later. I guess that's the way you've got to look at it. We'll be all right."
Jeremy Mayfield,"We knew if it went caution free we had a shot to win the race, ... My hats off to these guys, they put their butts on the line...and we won the race."
Jeremy Mayfield,"We knew if it went caution free we had a shot to win the race. My hats off to these guys, they put their butts on the line...and we won the race."
Jeremy Mayfield,"I think we might see some changes, maybe expanding the number of cars in the Chase, ... but not that one."
Max Mayfield,We have six months to prepare for the 2006 hurricane season. It's reality. We've got to deal with that.
Max Mayfield,"We are concerned with the moisture associated with this hurricane, flash flooding and the problems associated with that."
Max Mayfield,"As it hits the Yucatan peninsula, it has the potential to do catastrophic damage,"
Max Mayfield,"I had to let the mayor know that this storm has the potential not only to cause large property damage, but large loss of life if people don't make the right decision."
Max Mayfield,"As it hits the Yucatan peninsula, it has the potential to do catastrophic damage."
Max Mayfield,"As it hits the Yucatan peninsula, it has the potential to do catastrophic damage, ... The thing to do now is to closely monitor the progress of Hurricane Wilma."
Max Mayfield,With just a little bit of advance planning you can be ahead of the game. There's going to be enough stress anyway when a hurricane comes. Please don't wait until the last minute. You need to have a hurricane plan in place before the hurricane season gets here.
Max Mayfield,"It's going to take a little patience,"
Max Mayfield,"Within all the record-breaking statistics of the past hurricane season, there are epic human impacts ... suffering on a very large scale."

Max Mayfield,This is going to be a long night for Miami-Dade and Broward counties.
Max Mayfield,We keep making the same mistakes over and over again.
Max Mayfield,Today's coastal development along with hurricane amnesia places modern man on a collision course with catastrophe if the lessons of history are ignored.
Max Mayfield,We'd love to be able to tell people to flee from the water and hide from the wind.
Max Mayfield,The potential for large loss of life is with us.
Max Mayfield,"[But Wilma still could] cause tremendous damage and loss of life if we're not careful, ... The storm surge and the wave action will be tremendous with this hurricane, given the intensity and the size."
Max Mayfield,"If it stays over the Yucatan for any significant length of time and much of the circulation is over land ... that would obviously be terrible news for Mexico, but for the United States' interests, it means that we'll have a weaker hurricane coming out into the Gulf of Mexico and it will be slower in getting here."
Max Mayfield,It seems like this year all but three or maybe four of them have impacted land.
Max Mayfield,"If it stays over the Yucatan for any significant length of time and much of the circulation is over land ... that would obviously be terrible news for Mexico, but for the United States' interests, it means that we'll have a weaker hurricane coming out into the Gulf of Mexico and it will be slower in getting here,"
Max Mayfield,"Our memories are very, very short. The government absolutely can't do this alone. If we're going to get people to take that individual responsibility, there's got to be a team effort."
Max Mayfield,"We've been preaching this for decades, and you know, the government can only do so much. I don't know how we motivate people."
Max Mayfield,I'm convinced more people died from Hurricane Camille last year than when it hit in 1969. Experience is not always the best teacher.
Max Mayfield,"The older you get, the less you want to leave your environment. We've got to find better ways to take care of these people and people in nursing homes and hospitals."
Max Mayfield,"I don't have any doubt that it will become a major hurricane, and that means a Category 3 or above,"

Max Mayfield,"I don't think any [computer] model can tell you with any confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not but that is obviously a very, very grave concern."
Max Mayfield,It's not always about the numbers. It just takes one hurricane over your community to make it a bad season.
Max Mayfield,We need to remember that the research community is telling us that we are in this active period for hurricanes that may very well last another 10 to 20 years. And that's not good news for this region.
Max Mayfield,The advice for folks in Florida is not to put away all those hurricane supplies yet.
Max Mayfield,This hurricane has the potential to cause extreme damage and large loss of lives if they don't take action very soon.

Peter Mayhew,Then I put on the new suit they'd made and it felt wonderful to climb back into it and feel the character coming back out again.
Peter Mayhew,"Richard Marquand, on Jedi, was very much an actor's director."
Peter Mayhew,"Never having played Chess before, it was most interesting to be playing the game with no pieces in front of me. But I still knew how to stroke my hair when I won."
Peter Mayhew,"It was amazing that during rehearsals, without any of the costume on, the character was there complete. It just happened. Half the time, I didn't know I was doing it."
Peter Mayhew,"I was in the costume department having the costume made the next day, and we were shooting two weeks later when the main unit returned from Tunisia."
Peter Mayhew,"I think the things I wanted answered have been answered by people in the know that we can't talk about, so I'm perfectly happy with how Chewie came to be where he is and what is going on in Episode III."
Peter Mayhew,"I think the main thing was that the character couldn't speak in regular language, so he had to be mimed."
Peter Mayhew,"I think that Star Wars revolutionized not only sci-fi movies, but also the entire industry in the way that things are done."
Peter Mayhew,"I think by that time I knew where Chewie was going, and he left me to do what was called for, because the character had been well established. You know, it was like putting on a second skin by that time."
Peter Mayhew,I really enjoyed the last scene at the Ewok celebration after the battle.
Peter Mayhew,"I can go out in public without being recognized. If I want to be recognized in public, it will happen."
Peter Mayhew,George Lucas puts those types of characters in for the kids. Same with Jar Jar.
Peter Mayhew,"George has only got to ring me. His imagination is so wonderful, I'd do any character he might create."
Peter Mayhew,"But, apart from that, there was very little on underneath the suit."
Peter Mayhew,"After my own for instance, my favourite is Princess Leia."
Peter Mayhew,"After a while, the character sort of took over."
Peter Mayhew,Doing the Muppet Show you forget about conventional filming.
Peter Mayhew,"A whole new generation is looking at the videos, and going to the video shop and buying the re-release of the complete trilogy, which you can buy at a reasonable price."
Peter Mayhew,"I've always been interested in the cowboys and the history of the West and the history of America, so it wasn't so bad,"
Peter Mayhew,"Texas is an integral part of America,"
Pat Mayo,"She's like a coach on the court ? she gets the girls together, makes them focus, gives direction out. That maturity level about her is fabulous, she's very unselfish ? too unselfish at times. And in pressure situations, she wants the ball in her hands. She doesn't put up (big) points, but she puts up everything else."
Pat Mayo,Before this one I told the girls that the rest of the season -- our destiny -- was in their hands. Let's hope this is a sign of our maturity.
Pat Mayo,And I had them at the gym at 7:30 this morning for breakfast. You can't roll out of bed and onto a court.
Mike Mayock,You've got three potential franchise quarterbacks who all should go in that top 10.
Mike Mayock,"I think you start with winning. Pete has brought that magic back to Troy. They're recruiting nationally, and not a lot of programs can do that successfully."
Mike Mayock,"He's been living it, breathing it, sleeping it since he was a high school kid."
Mike Mayock,"He's more a manage-the-game kind quarterback -- make decisions, don't lose games. And he's got a big injury history."
Mike Mayock,"Sitting at No. 1, you think what football player is going to help us be the best team we can be, and we can't worry about what Tennessee does. If we happen to take the guy they want, and it's the guy we want, that's even better. But we can't worry about it."
Mike Mayock,"I'm a big believer that if you can get a tight end that can stretch a defense vertically and give you some blocking on top of it, you can change your whole offense. That's why I think San Francisco is going to take him at six â€” because they have average wide receivers, he can help with a young quarterback, and he can be a difference-maker."
Mike Mayock,"If he had perfect character, he would probably be a late first-day type of prospect. Given where he is today, he's probably a sixth- or seventh-round pick at best, and maybe even a priority free agent."
Mike Mayock,He's not as good an athlete as his older brother. He's not as dangerous a runner as his older brother. He's got a better innate feel for the passing game than his brother did at this time of his career.
Mike Mayock,"I really believe that Ernie Sims is the most explosive, through-the-hips athlete in this draft."
Benjamin Mays,"The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream. It is not disgrace to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to"
Benjamin Mays,"Not failure, but low aim is sin."
Benjamin Mays,"Every man and woman is born into the world to do something unique and something distinctive and if he or she does not do it, it will never be done."
Benjamin Mays,It must be borne in mind that the tragedy of life does not lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy of life lies in having no goal to reach.
Willie Mays,"My name gives me a little more publicity, but there is some pressure living up to the standards of a legend. I just tell myself to play my game, be myself and enjoy every minute of it."
Willie Mays,"It was all I could do to not scream. If they were closer they may have seen my eyes tearing up. Man, that hurt."
Willie Mays,"I wanted badly to play and coach (Mike) Goldschmidt gave me that opportunity. My best friend came up here and told me about the program. I want to be drafted after this season. Ultimately, I want to play pro baseball and meet Willie Mays in person."
Willie Mays,"I remember that last season I played. I went home after a ballgame one day, lay down on my bed, and tears came to my eyes. How can you explain that? You cry because you love her. I cried, I guess, because I loved baseball and I knew I had to leave it."
Willie Mays,"The home-field advantage in baseball, to me, I don't understand. I had to play as well on the road as I did at home."
Willie Mays,"Yes, I had to learn how to live life outside, but I had so many people help me."
Willie Mays,When I was in Birmingham I used to go to a place called Redwood Field. I used to get there for a two o'clock game. Where can you make this kind of money playing sports? It was just a pleasure to go out and enjoy myself and get paid for it.
Willie Mays,When I got to professional ball I used to play 150 games every year. It depends on how many games there was.
Willie Mays,"The greatest challenge I think is adjusting to not playing baseball. The reason for that is I had to come out of baseball and come into the business world, not being a college graduate, not being educated to come into the business world the way I should have."
Willie Mays,"That's how easy baseball was for me. I'm not trying to brag or anything, but I had the knowledge before I became a professional baseball player to do all these things and know what each guy would hit."
Willie Mays,"People talk about that catch and, I've said this many times, that I've made better catches than that many times in regular season. But of course in my time, you didn't have a lot of television during the regular season. A lot of people didn't see me do a lot of things."
Willie Mays,"In order to excel, you must be completely dedicated to your chosen sport. You must also be prepared to work hard and be willing to accept constructive criticism. Without one-hundred percent dedication, you won't be able to do this."
Willie Mays,"In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn't drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing."
Willie Mays,"I'm a very lucky guy. I had so many people help me over the years that I never had many problems. If I had a problem, I could sit down with someone and they would explain the problem to me, and the problem become like a baseball game."
Willie Mays,"I would try and help everybody, because the game was so easy for me. It was just like walking in the park."
Willie Mays,"I was very fortunate to play sports. All the anger in me went out. I had to do what I had to do. If you stay angry all the time, then you really don't have a good life."
Willie Mays,"I think that all athletes should practice. They should practice, because you want to know what's happening as far as - when the game is concerned."
Willie Mays,I think I was programmed to do good things when I came into the majors. I knew how to play.
Willie Mays,"I didn't say I was that smart, I said I went to class and I enjoyed what I was doing."
Willie Mays,"I always enjoyed playing ball, and it didn't matter to me whether I played with white kids or black. I never understood why an issue was made of who I played with, and I never felt comfortable, when I grew up, telling other people how to act."
Willie Mays,Defense to me is the key to playing baseball.
Willie Mays,"And my father didn't have money for me to go to college. And at that particular time they didn't have black quarterbacks, and I don't think I could have made it in basketball, because I was only 5' 11. So I just picked baseball."
Willie Mays,"If you can do that - if you run, hit, run the bases, hit with power, field, throw and do all other things that are part of the game - then you're a good ballplayer."
Willie Mays,"I don't compare 'em, I just catch 'em."
Willie Mays,"Every time I look at my pocketbook, I see Jackie Robinson."
Willie Mays,I think I was the best baseball player I ever saw.
Willie Mays,Maybe I was born to play ball. Maybe I truly was.
Willie Mays,"It's not hard. When I'm not hitting, I don't hit nobody. But when I'm hitting, I hit anybody."
Willie Mays,"Baseball is a game, yes. It is also a business. But what is most truly is is disguised combat. For all its gentility, its almost leisurely pace, baseball is violence under wraps."
Willie Mays,"I don't mean to be bashful, but I was."
Willie Mays,"When I'm not hitting, I don't hit nobody. But, when I'm hitting, I hit anybody."
Willie Mays,"Robinson was important to all blacks. To make it into the majors and to take all the name calling, he had to be something special. He had to take all this for years, not just for Jackie Robinson, but for the nation."
Willie Mays,"I was very blessed with a good body. Never got hurt. Never was in the hospital. The only time I was in the hospital was when I would get exhausted a little bit, and go in for a check-up or something."
Willie Mays,"I was a baseball player, I taught baseball, and all of a sudden I was in the business world. Now I used the baseball world to talk about their product. Not too much, just enough to keep going. Just be yourself and you'll never have a problem. That's what I did."
Willie Mays,I played with the Birmingham Black Barons. I was making 500 at 14. That was a lot of money in those days.
Willie Mays,"At ten I was playing against 18-year-old guys. At 15 I was playing professional ball with the Birmingham Black Barons, so I really came very quickly in all sports."
Willie Mays,"They throw the ball, I hit it. They hit the ball, I catch it."
Tim Mazanec,We are getting a consistent view from the Fed now that they are somewhat worried about the risk of a higher inflation rate. That is going to cause more rate hikes to come and higher yields will help the dollar.
Tim Mazanec,This reiterates the view of many that a quarter point per meeting for the rest of this year is in the cards.
Tim Mazanec,"This reiterates the view of many that a quarter point per meeting for the rest of this year is in the cards,"
Tim Mazanec,The market's focused on the potential for the Fed to pause. That could be sooner rather than later.
Tim Mazanec,"If unit labor costs are not increasing as much as we initially expected, that would get the Fed to pause (rate hikes) sooner than expected."
Tim Mazanec,The enthusiasm over Japan is extremely high right now.
Tim Mazanec,There's absolutely no reason to think why (the Bank of Canada) would not keep on hiking rates at least two more times.
Giuseppe Mazzini,"The angel of the Family is Woman. Mother, wife, or sister, Woman is the caress of life, the soothing sweetness of affection shed over its toils, a reflection for the individual of the loving providence which watches over Humanity. In her there is treasure enough of consoling tenderness to allay every pain. Moreover for every one of us she is the initiator of the future. The mother's first kiss teaches the child love; the first holy kiss of the woman he loves teaches man hope and faith in life; and love and faith create a desire for perfection and the power of reaching towards it step by step; create the future, in short, of which the living symbol is the child, link between us and the generations to come. Through her the Family, with its divine mystery of reproduction, points to Eternity."
Giuseppe Mazzini,"O my Brothers! love your Country. Our Country is our home, the home which God has given us, placing therein a numerous family which we love and are loved by, and with which we have a more intimate and quicker communion of feeling and thought than with others; a family which by its concentration upon a given spot, and by the homogeneous nature of its elements, is destined for a special kind of activity."
Giuseppe Mazzini,"So long as you are ready to die for humanity, the life of your country is immortal"
Giuseppe Mazzini,"Love and respect woman. Look to her not only for comfort, but for strength and inspiration and the doubling of your intellectual and moral powers. Blot out from your mind any idea of superiority; you have none."
Giuseppe Mazzini,"[Past Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas once said,] America is fitted by tradition for directing and guiding revolutions. We won our freedom by revolution. ... Great revolutions are the work rather of principles than of bayonets, and are achieved first in the moral and afterwards in the material sphere."
Giuseppe Mazzini,"Every Age has its own peculiar faith. Any attempt to translate into facts the mission of one Age with the machinery of another, can only end in an indefinite series of abortive efforts. Defeated by the utter want of proportion between the means and the end, such attempts might produce martyrs, but never lead to victory."
Leo Mazzone,It's talent. It's a gift.
Leo Mazzone,It's almost like they've been here. That's the type of makeup they have and the influence in this clubhouse. That starts with No. 6.
Leo Mazzone,"The color you have to get used to, I hope I don't look like a pumpkin."
Leo Mazzone,"It's all about the pitchers around here. They are first-class citizens, and they get treated that way."
Leo Mazzone,"I know that the opportunity doesn't come around too often when you can work for your best friend and go back to your home state,"
Leo Mazzone,I think the World Baseball Classic is great for the game. But the timing of it makes it more difficult in spring training because you like to set up your rotation right on March 2 and ride it all the way through. There's going to be some skips here and there.
Tito Mboweni,It is my responsibility to vote. We have to fulfil this responsibility.
Tito Mboweni,The higher food price inflation is evident in production prices. Along with higher maize prices (these) also point to a possible acceleration in retail food price inflation going forward.
Tito Mboweni,"The cost of servicing this debt, while still low, nevertheless increased from six and three quarters per cent of disposable income in the third quarter of 2005 to 7% in the fourth quarter."
Tito Mboweni,"There is a danger that if debt servicing costs increase, many households will find themselves in a bit of difficulty. And they might."
Rachel McAdams,"I suppose there is a little bit of a numbers game played in Hollywood, so of course the success of something like Wedding Crashers helps, but it's not something that you seek out. I didn't go into that movie hoping it would make a ton of money, but I did hope that it would hit an audience and people would really enjoy it."
Rachel McAdams,"But that confinement actually fed the fear and drove it a little bit because I was stuck on this plane for such a long period of time, so it kind of works."
Rachel McAdams,"[Rachel McAdams is quietly and cheerfully philosophical when it comes to talking about her impending fame. Now that her recent Wedding Crashers is a bona fide hit, the beautiful actress, back on screen in Wes Craven's Red Eye, says she is happy to take it as it comes.] I suppose there is a little bit of a numbers game played in Hollywood, so of course the success of something like Wedding Crashers helps, but it's not something that you seek out, ... I didn't go into that movie hoping it would make a ton of money, but I did hope that it would hit an audience and people would really enjoy it."
Rachel McAdams,I have a certain curiosity for life that drives me and propels me forward.
Mike McAfee,"From the first quarter, right on through the fourth, I feel our kids played a good game. It's always our hope that everyone will get involved and it was great to see Kyle Morrow come in and play well. I'm hopeful that Kyle can continue to come in and contribute."
Mike McAfee,Turnovers hurt us and especially in the first half. We had our team average in the first half for turnovers. We can't afford to squander that many opportunities to score. We have to be smarter with the basketball.
Mike McAfee,You can't match him on heart - he gives everything. Bill was a leader on the floor too. He was the one before every game that got the guys together for the group cheer - 'Who's house? Our house.' He's the one that took the initiative to make the warm-up CD. He's just a great young man. I can't tell you how much I appreciate everything he did for our basketball team.
Mike McAfee,"Jay had a stellar night. He made five field goals inside, hit 2-of-2 at the line. He really did a good job."
Mike McAfee,"Bill played one of the best games he's played all season. He's one of the leaders on the floor and he's one that when we talk at halftime, he really takes it to heart and he takes things as a challenge."
Mike McAfee,At that point it's anybody's game.
Mike McAfee,I was pleased with the way our kids kept playing defense. I'm proud of the way our kids played all four quarters.
Mike McAfee,"We think this event has the ability to bring people from outside of the area. Thomas Hart Benton and the work he did is very popular right now, so we saw the momentum."
Deuce McAllister,"I've had to change my game some, ... In college it was more of me being able to outrun people. Now it's a time to line up inside the tackles. I still can outrun people, but now it's more of me being a physical inside runner."
Deuce McAllister,"It's all about, do you want your job? ... If you do, then you'll get it done. If you take pride in what you do, you'll get it done. It's all about being a pro."
Deuce McAllister,"It doesn't matter where we are or what's easier or best for us. It doesn't matter where we play or who we play. Your job is your job. No one is going to feel sorry for you out there, so why feel sorry for yourself?"
Deuce McAllister,"We thank the NFL for giving us a home game in New York and raising all the money they did. But when it comes down to it, we have to play football."
Deuce McAllister,"I think it's hard, not because of football, but because there are people inside. You can always play a football game somewhere."
Deuce McAllister,"[McAllister said he'd been unable to reach about 15 to 20 friends and family members in affected areas, including some cousins and his high school basketball coach.] He's a real good friend of mine, ... I don't know if he and his family got out."
Deuce McAllister,"There's a lot of anxiety. There's uncertainty about what's going to happen, what's going on. It's devastating because of what happened to the city, what happened in Mississippi and other places. . . . I watched. I tried to keep up with it and see what's going on. . . . Unfortunately, you have to expect the worst. Many of the worst things that could have happened, they happened."
Christa McAuliffe,I touch the future. I teach. I really appreciate that sentiment. That's going with me.
Christa McAuliffe,"When I'm 60, maybe, I'll look at my pile of papers and wonder, What really happened that year?"
Christa McAuliffe,"We haven't sat down with Scott and Caroline and said, Now you realize that there's X amount of pounds of thrust. And this can happen and that can happen."
Christa McAuliffe,"This is a kind of a personal message from me, and that is that teachers are good communicators, they do an important job in our society."
Christa McAuliffe,"The Twilight Zone' wasn't around with the kids. They think going up in space is neat. Within their lifetime, there will be paying passengers on the shuttle."
Christa McAuliffe,The president felt that it was important to send an ordinary citizen to experience the excitement of space travel as a representative for all Americans.
Christa McAuliffe,Reach for the stars.
Christa McAuliffe,My sympathies have always been for working-class people.
Christa McAuliffe,"It's not the Olympics. It's Concord, New Hampshire, and a homecoming should reflect the community I'm part of."
Christa McAuliffe,"If I can get some student interested in science, if I can show members of the general public what's going on up there in the space program, then my job's been done."
Christa McAuliffe,"If anything, the overriding emotion is gonna just be excitement."
Christa McAuliffe,"If anything happened, I think my husband would have to deal with that as the time came."
Christa McAuliffe,"I will have a one-hour program called the Mission Watch, where I will describe details of the mission and give additional information about the lessons from space."
Christa McAuliffe,I will go around the space shuttle and give a guided tour of the major areas and describe what is done in each area. This will be called The Ultimate Field Trip.
Christa McAuliffe,I touch the future. I teach. That's going with me.
Christa McAuliffe,I really don't want to say goodbye to any of you people.
Christa McAuliffe,I have the LIFE magazine of the men walking on the moon.
Christa McAuliffe,Every shuttle mission's been successful.
Christa McAuliffe,I touch the future. I teach.
Christa McAuliffe,Reach for it. Push yourself as far as you can.
Christa McAuliffe,"I cannot join the space program and restart my life as an astronaut, but this opportunity to connect my abilities as an educator with my interests in history and space is a unique opportunity to fulfill my early fantasies."
Christa McAuliffe,Space is going to be commonplace.
Christa McAuliffe,"Sometimes when things get kind of frantic, it helps to call my husband Steve, because I think he's got a real good sense of where everything's gonna be in a few years."
Christa McAuliffe,"We sat around one night and thought that people are going to look back and say, I can't imagine there was a lot of excitement about HER going up!"
Christa McAuliffe,"NASA was going to pick a public school teacher to go into space, observe and make a journal about the space flight, and I am a teacher who always dreamed of going up into space."
Christa McAuliffe,My job in space will be to observe and write a journal. I am also going to be teaching a class for students on earth about life in space and on the space shuttle and conducting experiments.
Christa McAuliffe,I was a little concerned with how the crew was going to view me because I didn't know whether this program had been kinda forced down their throats. But they were wonderful.
Christa McAuliffe,"I told them how excited I would be to go into space and how thrilled I was when Alan Shepard made his historic flight, and when John Kennedy announced on the news that the men had landed safely on the moon, and how jealous I was of those men."
Christa McAuliffe,I can remember in early elementary school when the Russians launched the first satellite. There was still so much unknown about space. People thought Mars was probably populated.
Terry McAuliffe,To be able to play the most challenging golf courses in the world is as good as it gets. That is a dream vacation.
Terry McAuliffe,"In his budget, President Bush has given trillions away in a tax cut that favors the wealthiest but has devoted not a single penny to electoral reform, ... Rather than enhancing voting rights, it seems clear that George Bush is dead-set on rolling them back."
Terry McAuliffe,"He's the last guy who should be lecturing John Kerry about how to defend America and keep the faith with those who wear the uniform,"
Anne McCaffrey,Make no judgments where you have no compassion
Anne McCaffrey,Writing has been so much a part of my life that I'm really quite annoyed that I can't do as much as I used to.
Anne McCaffrey,"What I used to do between writing fits was feed my kids, ride my horse and go shopping for cat and dog food."
Anne McCaffrey,"The thing is, emotion - if it's visibly felt by the writer - will go through all the processes it takes to publish a story and still hit the reader right in the gut. But you have to really mean it."
Anne McCaffrey,"That's what writing is all about, after all, making others see what you have put down on the page and believing that it does, or could, exist and you want to go there."
Anne McCaffrey,"That's such a thrill - a story I wrote at the beginning of my career, and it's still packin' the house."
Anne McCaffrey,People have freaked out when I tell them that my dragons are scientifically based... what else can you call a genetically engineered life form?
Anne McCaffrey,Make no judgements where you have no compassion.
Anne McCaffrey,"I'm very fond of the Talent series, and also the Crystal Singer trio."
Anne McCaffrey,"I'm 78, I'm on my pension in Ireland, and all that good stuff."
Anne McCaffrey,I wouldn't encourage new writers to start off publishing through electronic media... it still isn't wide enough for the readership they would need to get a good start.
Anne McCaffrey,"I would recommend the short story form, which is a lot harder to write since you have to be so careful with words, until there is plenty of time to doodle through a novel."
Anne McCaffrey,"I think writers need windows on a view to remind them that a whole world is out there, not the minutiae with which they might be dealing on a close scale."
Anne McCaffrey,"I think the Internet, particularly the availability of information, is great. I do a lot of correspondence on-line and have a chat line to talk to my fans as well."
Anne McCaffrey,"I have written my own screen version of Pern, but had no buyers yet."
Anne McCaffrey,"I have my good days and my bad days, but I don't have as much energy as I used to back when I was young and foolish and didn't count the cost - and it takes a lot - to write."
Anne McCaffrey,I have always used emotion as a writing tool. That goes back to me being on the stage.
Anne McCaffrey,"I have a shelf of comfort books, which I read when the world closes in on me or something untoward happens."
Anne McCaffrey,"I don't often reread my own books, unless I am going into another in the series and need to refresh my mood when originating the concept."
Anne McCaffrey,"I do outlines when I'm writing with someone, but they also need to have a certain amount of freedom."
Anne McCaffrey,"I didn't raise Todd to be a writer, but he happened to be one anyway."
Anne McCaffrey,I did not have a chance to write novels until my youngest child started school fulltime.
Anne McCaffrey,But Ship Who Sang remains my favorite story. I really rocked folks with that and still cannot read it aloud myself without weeping at the end.
Anne McCaffrey,"But I will say that living in Ireland has changed the cadence and fullness of speech, since the Irish love words and use as many of them in a sentence as possible."
Anne McCaffrey,"At age 77, I need the help of someone with more energy than I can now summon to finish a book."
Anne McCaffrey,Mostly I'm telling people that they don't have to be victims.
Anne McCaffrey,A good story is a good story no matter who wrote it.
Anne McCaffrey,"I don't keep up with developments, but I do find an expert in any field in which I must explain myself and the science involved."
Anne McCaffrey,"Because we build the worlds we wouldn't mind living in. They contain scary things, problems, but also a sense of rightness that makes them alive and makes us want to live there."
Barry McCaffrey,"Other treatments have been deemed safer and more effective than a psychoactive burning carcinogen self-induced through one's throat,"
Barry McCaffrey,"There has to be strict compliance with safety concerns,"
Barry McCaffrey,We've got to talk to parents who are taking their young people to an all-night rave and seeing police uniforms and believing that because it's quoted as alcohol-free that this is a safe environment. Their young people are at risk in that environment.
Barry McCaffrey,"This money is aimed at helping those nations' economies, judicial systems, police and armed forces, in hopes of re-establishing the rule of law,"

Barry McCaffrey,has a reputation of impeccable integrity.
Barry McCaffrey,"The heart and soul of the national effort ought to be prevention, education and treatment, ... In the last five years, we've increased our prevention budget by 52 percent, our treatment budget has gone up by a third. ... We are putting our money where our mouth is."
Barry McCaffrey,"[The sun is setting on American dreams in Iraq; what remains now to be worked out are the modalities of withdrawal, which depend on the powers of forbearance in the American body politic. But the dynamic has already been set in place. The United States is running out of troops. By the spring of 2006, nearly every active-duty combat unit is likely to have been deployed twice. The National Guard and Reserves, meanwhile, make up an unprecedented 40 percent of the force, and the Guard is in the] stage of meltdown, ... the wheels are coming off."
Barry McCaffrey,extremely disappointed that corruption may have reached such a level in Mexico.
Barry McCaffrey,"We came out of it with a firm commitment to continue to uphold federal law, to capture data on what starts to go wrong because of these two propositions, and we are going to attempt to educate other state authorities on what actually happened."
Barry McCaffrey,"We have made the drug criminals afraid. We will now make them disappear, ... and this is only beginning of it."
Barry McCaffrey,"We have 1.8 million Americans behind bars today at Local, State and Federal level. In the federal system, which has doubled in the last ten years, over 110,000 people behind bars in the Federal system, probably two-thirds are there for drug related reason."
Barry McCaffrey,"The United States and Mexico are trapped - economically, culturally, politically and because of drug crime - in the same continent."

Barry McCaffrey,"I'm a professor of national security studies, and I know a lot more about fighting than Rumsfeld does."
Barry McCaffrey,"We first began to see increased drug use among this age group several years ago when they were teens, ... Sadly, now that this age group has established drug use patterns, they and our society will be dealing with the harms associated with increased drug use -- disease, overdoses, health care costs, crime and the like -- for years to come, as they grow older."
Mark McCall,"We have a few free weekends after that, so it may be advisable to let him rest,"
Mark McCall,You can look at the performance of our backs but our forward won us the game. Our forwards gave us the platform.
Mark McCall,"Overall the performance was extremely disappointing,"
Mark McCall,"Although they have lost two of their first three games, this is going to be their first home game of the season,"
Mark McCall,I'm just glad that all the boys came back fit and well from Ireland duty.
Mark McCall,I was very impressed by the boys' commitment to the sport.
John McCallum,I think that's reflected in the comment of the union leader who said Mr. Dingwall was worth every penny he got. So he clearly did a very good job at the mint.
John McCallum,"I've been there and I've done that. We had ready-made proposals in procurement and service delivery which we already used. We really only had to find $5 billion, and he has to find $22 billion, fast. And they're going to tell him the only way you can do that is to lay off people."
John McCallum,"You know I just want to find my parents, and give them a hug for allowing me to be able to be here, and not go through something like that, because that is just something terrible, what they are experiencing right now, and just the fact that I was able to go down and help is great."
John McCallum,The government has come to the conclusion that that is the appropriate amount that he should receive.
John McCallum,"The Government of Canada continues to work with Canadians to research and develop clean energy solutions and innovative approaches to energy production, ... By supporting projects such as the Integrated Waste Hydrogen Utilization Project, we can help build a solid foundation for moving forward on climate change and ensuring our future prosperity. These measures also support Project Green, the Government of Canada's action plan to build a more sustainable environment."
John McCallum,"It's a fundamental feature of Canada and I've suggested that he should apologize to Mr. Ouellet,"
John McCallum,"These stamps, with their colourful and action-packed designs, are sure to appeal to young Canadians, ... In this, the International Year of Sport and Physical Education, I hope that these stamps will encourage kids to look at the benefits of being involved with sports and with stamp collecting."
Rick McCallum,"I'm amazed nobody's had a problem with that whatsoever, ... They can all identify with that. It's like your mother having cancer or your sister being hit by a car -- there are so many things subliminally in people's lives that make them relate to him, but it was a very tough concept on paper to get through."
Rick McCallum,I love that scene. But at least it's on the DVD.
Rick McCallum,"We shot so fast, so relentlessly, that I don't think we had any funny moments where people flubbed lines or stunts went wrong, ... We do 50 (scene) setups a day. That focuses people in a different way."
Rick McCallum,"We know we want it to be darker, edgier and have fun sense of humor, but it will be more character--based,"
Rick McCallum,"We're just starting to interview writers and trying to really figure out which direction [it will go]. It is going to be much darker, much grittier, and it's much more character based."
Bryan McCann,"My parents aren't giving any pressure on distance, ... This will be my decision, totally. It will be weird not having my parents see me play every week, but I think that's a reality of going off to school anyway."
Bryan McCann,"[It is the] jobs of groups like us to make sure that doesn't happen. Anytime there is a local screening, we get involved."
Bryan McCann,"There is more emotion playing defense, ... If you make a mistake but are going hard, you can still be in the play. On offense, there is more structure every down. On defense, you can play more on instinct and athleticism."
Richard McCann,"We suspended the meeting, ... Karen called the police to have him removed from the meeting."
Richard McCann,"Police were called and there were some heated words exchanged between the union representative and Ms. Knight,"
Richard McCann,"Iâ€™m not sure there was one specific reason, ... I know (there are) factions in the Police Department. Karen and I thought it was a good idea to have a study done to put a lot of issues to rest."
Rashad McCants,I guess I have the reputation of being a confident guy because I'm a scorer. But it has nothing to do with that. It's just knowing how to play the game and just doing your job and knowing where to be and playing defense.
Rashad McCants,It's a struggle. But you keep pushing and keep learning and keep trying to get better every year.
Rashad McCants,"I think every rookie has to go through some kind of learning process. You know, I'm here and I've learned and I'm trying to progress."
Rashad McCants,We knew (Richardson) would have a good game. But even 25 points in the second half wasn't enough tonight.
Brandon McCarthy,"We swept a few teams this year ? it just kind of sucks that it was our turn to get swept at the end of the season,"
Brandon McCarthy,My dad also was born on May 5.
Brandon McCarthy,It's probably the most nervous I've ever been on a baseball field in God knows how long.
Kevin McCarthy,"a pleasing result, especially in light of all the teeth-gnashing in the market surrounding PC unit sales."
Kevin McCarthy,"While HP's stock has taken a beating, we believe there is further risk to earnings estimates and to the share price."
Kevin McCarthy,"Their legal claims are of equal quality and they are equally entitled to the ball, ... The ball must be sold and divided equally between the parties."
Kevin McCarthy,"Investors have found IBM to be a safe haven, given the company's product diversity and easy comparisons. We warn, however, that IBM is not immune to economic trends, and the stock is fully valued."
Kevin McCarthy,She's the whole reason I got into college. She never let me accept anything less than my best work. She even called me at home when I was sick. She's an inspiration.
Kevin McCarthy,We don't want this to get caught up in the legislative cycle and the budget cycle.
Mick McCarthy,"If he is pain-free, he would be a couple of weeks getting fit."
Mick McCarthy,"Something like that absolutely knocks the stuffing out of you, ... It tastes lousy, that defeat!"
Mick McCarthy,"Rory is in contention. He has only missed three weeks. Prior to that, he'd been playing, he'd been fit, so yes, he's in contention. He will be travelling with us."
Mick McCarthy,Most teams probably think we're the whipping boys but they could get a surprise.
Mick McCarthy,"It's the usual one - a manager leaves, somebody else comes in and they get the result. Well, balls to that."
Mike McCarthy,Those were the words he used.
Mike McCarthy,"Just like every other team, we had our trials and tribulations, many obstacles that we had to overcome."
Mike McCarthy,We don't get this kind of thing very often.
Mike McCarthy,"I don't think there's a coach in the National Football League who wouldn't love the opportunity to work with Brett Favre. We had a very positive working relationship in 1999, and I'm definitely looking forward to working with him again."
Mike McCarthy,"Tim knows our offense inside and out. But it comes down to execution. It isn't like we're going to be walking up to the line of scrimmage and they're going to be calling out plays. I'm not expecting anything like that. But even if they are, you still have to execute it."
Mike McCarthy,"Tim knows our offense inside and out, ... But it comes down to execution. It isn't like we're going to be walking up to the line of scrimmage and they're going to be calling out plays. I'm not expecting anything like that. But even if they are, you still have to execute it."
Mike McCarthy,It wasn't a pleasant conversation.
Mike McCarthy,We have to take advantage of the skills of our players. Arnaz Battle can do a lot of things.
Bill McCartney,God's calling for a whole heart. Those are his terms. There's no compromise. Go after him. It's worth everything on that day.
Bill McCartney,"When you're born again, your DNA changes. You have the ability to understand God's terms."
Bill McCartney,We'd like to build a highway for healing and unity.
Bill McCartney,Big dreams create the magic that stir men's souls to greatness.
Bill McCartney,"All coaching is, is taking a player where he can't take himself."
Bill McCartney,"I've never wanted just part of the package, part of the prize. I want it all!"
Linda Mccartney,I'm rather complimented that Mary has caught my passion for photography.
Linda Mccartney,We're very proud of the way in which all our kids want to do their own thing.
Linda Mccartney,"Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words will break my heart."
Linda Mccartney,I absolutely adore my kids more than anything. They're my best friends.
Linda Mccartney,"Stella is doing great as a designer, and I love her clothes. We went to her first Chloe show in Paris, and I was just so proud of her and the reaction she got."
Linda Mccartney,"James is studying architecture now, but neither Paul nor I would be surprised if he moves into music, as he has such a passion for playing."
Linda Mccartney,"When Paul was arrested in Japan for having hash in his luggage, I thought he'd be out that night. But it became really serious stuff when he was kept in a cell. I became more fearful as the days went by."
Linda Mccartney,"When I married Paul, we lived in St John's Wood in London. We had nice next-door neighbours, but you don't know anyone else. Everyone lives in isolation."
Linda Mccartney,When I first toured with Wings things that were said about me were true - I did sing out of tune.
Linda Mccartney,"We spent last night listening to Liverpool football team on the radio, wanting them to win so badly. Paul supports Liverpool. He was Everton for a while because of his family - but it's all Liverpool now."
Linda Mccartney,"We spend so much time together, because that's how we like it. I never used to go on girl's nights out, even at school. And Paul has never liked going out for a night with the boys, either."
Linda Mccartney,"We moved there a year ago, just as a weekend place. Then we decided to move out of London completely. We will eventually have to work it out a bit more, because you can't have a little boy living with his sisters like that, can you? But we like the idea of closeness."
Linda Mccartney,"We have lasted this long close together, so we must have something going for each other."
Linda Mccartney,"We both came from families in which parents got married, had children and the whole thing. So we were not the kind of people to live together permanently."
Linda Mccartney,"We are really on top of one another at the moment and I think it is amazing how we stay so close. Maybe that's the test. Why not totally put yourself together, rather than always wonder whether you actually like each other?"
Linda Mccartney,"They all have some talent. Mary plays the recorder beautifully. I am not pushing them on, though. They are pretty good at the moment just being kids."
Linda Mccartney,"Paul persuaded me to join the band. I would never have had the courage otherwise. It was fun at the beginning. We were playing just for fun, with Paul's group."
Linda Mccartney,"Out of the six of us, I am the quietest."
Linda Mccartney,Our kids haven't any airs about them. I don't like posh kids who don't like dirty dolls or expect a chauffeur every time they go out.
Linda Mccartney,"In our position, we could have a big house with maids and chauffeurs - but what's the point of having kids if you have all that?"
Linda Mccartney,If slaughterhouses had glass walls the whole world would be vegetarian.
Linda Mccartney,"I would travel only by horse, if I had the choice."
Linda Mccartney,I would like them all to enjoy life and try different things until there is something they really like.
Linda Mccartney,"I won't be having any more kids, though. Four is enough."
Linda Mccartney,"I wasn't looking for another marriage. I had been married before. He is a nice man - a geologist, an Ernest Hemingway type. But Paul and I married because of convention."
Linda Mccartney,"I had daydreams and fantasies when I was growing up. I always wanted to live in a log cabin at the foot of a mountain. I would ride my horse to town and pick up provisions. Then return to the cabin, with a big open fire, a record player and peace."
Linda Mccartney,"He is not in the least arrogant. The last album was written in a room in Sussex. He was like a mad professor, spending all day writing and then coming out with brilliant tunes."
Linda Mccartney,"He is a terrible planner, though. So am I."
Linda Mccartney,Cooking for six people every day is like having a cafe.
Linda Mccartney,But I wanted marriage for myself. I was not calculating about it. I wish I was more calculating.
Linda Mccartney,"We think we want to do something and when it comes to it, we don't. We don't like to commit."
Linda Mccartney,I don't need a lot of money. Simplicity is the answer for me.
Paul McCartney,"I will continue to work with Heather Mills on the recording project, and even though this story (of romance) is not true, I hope it will bring attention to her worthwhile efforts for the disabled worldwide."
Paul McCartney,"People don't like land mines, especially the survivors and the people who are living in the countries with them, ... They think they are cowardly, like we do, so I think it's down to the governments to actually just listen to the people and sign the treaty and get rid of all these things and there would be an end to it."
Paul McCartney,"We didn't all get into music for a job! We got into music to avoid a job, in truth - and get lots of girls."
Paul McCartney,"It was Elvis who really got me hooked on beat music. When I heard Heartbreak Hotel I thought, this is it"
Paul McCartney,"Something like George passing, it makes you think, `God things are so impermanent: suddenly there's this little friend of mine, he used to get on the bus, and now he's passed away.' There's that whole lifetime of a friendship that physically has ended, not emotionally."
Paul McCartney,The two of us were on fire every time we sat down to write.
Paul McCartney,"This is given with a deep respect and gratitude, from our family to yours, for all that you (the firefighters) have done, ... A heartfelt thanks, and I hope that all of the firefighters will be able to enjoy its beauty once it finds its resting place."
Paul McCartney,Someone like John would want to end the Beatle period and start the Yoko period. He wouldn't like either to interfere with the other.
Paul McCartney,None of us wanted to be the bass player. In our minds he was the fat guy who always played at the back.
Paul McCartney,"I don't take me seriously. If we get some giggles, I don't mind."
Paul McCartney,"If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian."
Paul McCartney,"I had this song called Helter Skelter, which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise."
Paul McCartney,Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds actually wasn't meant to say LSD. It was a drawing that John's son brought home from school. Lucy was a kid in his school.
Paul McCartney,Love is all you need.
Paul McCartney,I used to think anyone doing anything weird was weird. Now I know that it is the people that call others weird that are weird.
Paul McCartney,"In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make."
Paul McCartney,There are only four people who knew what the Beatles were about anyway.
Paul McCartney,I love to hear a choir. I love the humanity to see the faces of real people devoting themselves to a piece of music. I like the teamwork. It makes me feel optimistic about the human race when I see them cooperating like that.
Paul McCartney,"I'm really pleased to be working with Fidelity Investments. We have a lot in common--a commitment to helping people, a dedication to the arts, and a belief that you should never stop doing what you love."
Paul McCartney,"When your parents do so much to help get you through college, it's a nice bonus."
Paul McCartney,If they want to consider themselves a civilized nation?they're going to have to stop this.
Paul McCartney,"I'm singing 'English Tea' from my new album 'Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.' I have a cup of tea in the morning, so it's something good to wake up to."
Paul McCartney,Canada is known as a great nation. But this is something that leaves a stain on the character of the Canadian people and we don't think that's right. I don't think the vast amount of Canadians think that's right.
Paul McCartney,"And she was just on his chest, you know, and I was just doing -- it was a Beatles song, ... and I just was singing it, and I caught them in the audience, and you do. And it's just like a picture, it's like a Rockwell or something. Very emotional."
Paul McCartney,"But I've looked out at audiences, I've seen the effect some of these songs -- it's like, it's hard to be me and sing them,"
Stella McCartney,"That's kind of my strongest thing in the tailoring,"
Stella McCartney,"The only positive thing you can really gain through losing someone is learning, and teaching other people, ... So I hope to teach other people, and I hope to learn."
Stella McCartney,I've always felt there was something wrong about making high-priced clothes - and I am really proud of the quality.
Stella McCartney,"The direction is just really wearable, cool clothes."
Stella McCartney,"The one thing I have going for me is that I'm exactly the age bracket of the person who buys my clothes,"
Darren McCarty,"With the year off and just getting back into it, you're more susceptible, your body's not as hard as it usually is. You got to develop some of those calluses again, that pain tolerance. But everybody's got to go through it. It happens. For me, it's inevitable -- it's just the way that I play -- that I'm going to get banged up."
Darren McCarty,"No doubt. It's the way the schedule is. Every team goes through it, so we've got to put together some good games."
Darren McCarty,"This kid is beyond his age. He skates as well as anybody, he reads the play as well, he's as smart. He can play in any situation."
Tim McCarver,"Look at Benito Santiago. When he first signed, there was definitely a language barrier. But he could throw, and if you can do that and block the balls in the dirt, that speaks volumes."
Tim McCarver,Good habits are as easy to form as bad ones.
Tim McCarver,"You want to give the audience the feeling this is the only game the Yankees and Red Sox are playing this year, ... that this is the only game that matters."
Richie McCaw,It was probably our best performance.
Richie McCaw,I think there were mistakes from both teams when they got into scoring positions but there were also a lot of big hits out there and that probably contributed.
Richie McCaw,"I'm relieved, to be quite honest. We got put under a heap of pressure and the boys defended well but possibly we concentrated too much on defending rather than keeping on attacking."
Steve McClaren,The biggest thing I learned from Sir Alex is to trust the players when they are out there.
Steve McClaren,It's a suspected fractured cheek and obviously that will rule him out for the rest of the season. We'll assess it in the morning.
Steve McClaren,We have to guard against a repeat performance against Coventry because that would make the season even worse.
Steve McClaren,What a great performance from a young player. He came in and took responsibility and was one of those players who came out of the game with credit.
Steve McClaren,"We have a big week coming up but the standard of performance in this game had to be the same. We have to find ways to win games like this and we did that, which keeps our momentum going. It's a big opportunity coming up for the players and they have to make the most of it - and they know how to do that."
Steve McClaren,"It was an excellent performance, a great European performance."
Steve McClaren,"It's a great scalp and it's a massive victory for the club. It was excellent European performance, full of patience, discipline and control. We deserve the plaudits we will get. These are very exciting times here. Roma are one of the best sides in Italy but we controlled the game and defended ever so well and we are always capable of scoring. It gives us a good platform for second leg and our away record has been very good, so we should go there with confidence."
Steve McClaren,Management is easy when you are winning. It is a bit tougher when you are not. The mark of a good manager is how you get through the bad times. He has done a fantastic job here over the last season or so but now is the time to hold his nerve and not panic.
Steve McClaren,It's a learning process â€” he'll know a lot more about the Premier League after today.
Steve McClaren,"It's a learning process for him. He's learning that the Premier League every week is very difficult and very physical, which Wigan did against him. On the evidence we have seen he's going to be some player for us, and he is getting better every week."
Steve McClaren,I said before the game this was going to be difficult. The hard work was done last week and we just had to make sure we got the right result to take us through.
Steve McClaren,"A great European performance, full of experience, concentration and discipline."
Steve McClaren,"The 1-0 defeat is not a bad result. We are even delighted with it, because it could have been worse."
Steve McClaren,"At the moment we've got no consistency, ... Away from home our form has been very good but at home it's been patchy. That's been disappointing but the solution is there and we will find it."
Steve McClaren,"Teams in adversity stick together and ignore what is going on externally. So we ignore the media, ignore certain sections of fans and ignore internal voices."
Steve McClaren,To reach the final is a phenomenal achievement for a small town in Europe. But now we want to win it.
Steve McClaren,"The acquisition of Ray is very important. I have admired him throughout his career. He has tremendous talent and ability and a great attitude. You know what you are going to get, week in, week out and he is a winner. We need that and we are delighted to have him here."
Scott McClellan,It's progress and ... now we will look forward to seeing results.
Scott McClellan,You're putting words in my mouth.
Scott McClellan,"[Noting that] some have taken this report and exploited it and used it to incite violence, ... I think Newsweek recognizes the responsibility they have. We appreciate the step that they took by retracting the story. Now we would encourage them to move forward and do all that they can to help repair the damage that has been done by this report."
Scott McClellan,on all groups to end the violence and refrain from violence.
Scott McClellan,We are on the way to accomplishing the mission and achieving victory.
Scott McClellan,My understanding is that he has assured us that he was not involved in the negotiations to purchase this British company.
Scott McClellan,"That's a process that's ongoing at this point, and the truth will come out."
Scott McClellan,We plan to take parallel steps involving targeted travel restrictions and financial sanctions. We encourage all members of the international community to demand that authorities in Belarus protect the rights of their own citizens to express themselves peacefully.
Scott McClellan,"I think it's important for the President of the United States to travel to the region and get firsthand accounts of the operations and to provide comfort and support to those who have been affected by these hurricanes, as well as those who are providing the critical support."
Scott McClellan,We support the call for a new election.
Scott McClellan,"There is strong, united support for the policies that we are putting in place."
Scott McClellan,"I think what those files show is a young White House staffer helping to provide legal analysis in support of the president's agenda, President Reagan's agenda."
Scott McClellan,We continue to support the European Three's efforts to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic way.
Scott McClellan,The king offered Saudi Arabia's support.
Scott McClellan,some (who had come) to express support for the steps that we're taking and a number of others that have expressed a different view.
Scott McClellan,"We've got to continue to do everything we can in support of those who are involved in the operational aspects of this response effort,"
Scott McClellan,"committed to doing what is legally necessary. ... If necessary, he will support a constitutional amendment."
Scott McClellan,"The terrorists will be defeated, and the civilized world will prevail in this global struggle of ideologies."
Scott McClellan,This is more of a visionary and directional speech than it is a laundry list of proposals. It's more thematic in nature.
Scott McClellan,This is more of a visionary and a directional speech than it is a laundry list of proposals. It's more thematic in nature.
Scott McClellan,This is more of a visionary and a directional speech than it is a laundry list of proposal. It's more thematic in nature.
Scott McClellan,This is more of a visionary and directional speech than it is a laundry list of proposals.
Scott McClellan,"The U.S. steel industry wisely used the 21 months of breathing space we provided to consolidate and restructure. The industry made progress increasing productivity, lowering production costs and making America more competitive with foreign steel producers."
Scott McClellan,We are a society that has been welcoming of immigrants. We are also a nation of laws. We need to keep that in mind as we move forward on this important debate.
Scott McClellan,"I know she's proud that a number of her attorneys on her own staff are members of the Federalist Society. And she, like the rest of the White House, knows that the Federalist Society has been a great ally on many important issues, particularly when it comes to the federal judiciary."
Scott McClellan,"I know she's proud that a number of her attorneys on her own staff are members of the Federalist Society, ... And she, like the rest of the White House, knows that the Federalist Society has been a great ally on many important issues, particularly when it comes to the federal judiciary."
Scott McClellan,"The president appreciates Mike Brown's service,"
Scott McClellan,That is why we are working with other members of the UN Security Council -- it's why we are working with friends and allies ... To prevent this regime from obtaining nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon know-how.
Scott McClellan,I'm not going to talk about security measures.
Scott McClellan,"I know that the Department of Homeland Security have said they will cooperate fully in the investigation. The individual who was arrested is someone who is a civil servant, and my understanding is that the Department of Homeland Security has placed that individual on administrative leave. These are very serious allegations."
Scott McClellan,"Last week the Security Council sent a very clear statement to the regime, and said, 'Comply with your obligations, come clean'. You have 30 days to come clean, make a commitment to come clean and comply with your obligations, or we're going to back at the Security Council consulting about next steps to take."
Scott McClellan,There are security precautions that were taken and we are confident in the security precautions that have been taken. One of those was not informing you of the trip until now.
Scott McClellan,The Coast Guard remains in charge of physical security. The Customs and Border Patrol remain in charge of cargo security.
Scott McClellan,The IAEA board will be meeting on Thursday and we expect the board to refer the matter to the Security Council at that point.
Scott McClellan,in greater detail than he has previously about how we need to work together to ... permanently fix Social Security.
Scott McClellan,That means continuing to train Iraqi forces so that they can take over all of the security of their own country and provide for their own defense.
Scott McClellan,"The president has worked to move forward on reforming both Medicare and Social Security. Those are programs that need to be addressed, and the sooner we address those programs, the better."
Scott McClellan,"We are reviewing all eleventh-hour executive orders, rules and regulations by the Clinton administration and we will make decisions after President-elect Bush is sworn into office,"
Scott McClellan,"We'll talk with the rest of the Security Council members and others about the next steps. Right now, the regime has been given an opportunity to comply with its obligations, and the most recent statements by the regime only further isolate itself and continue to show that it's moving in the wrong direction."
Scott McClellan,"She, like the rest of the White House, knows that the Federalist Society has been a great ally on many important issues, particularly when it comes to the federal judiciary."
Scott McClellan,"He is the president, and as he indicated to you all, it is his responsibility when it comes to the federal government's role in these hurricanes."
Scott McClellan,"I think it reflects the reality on the ground, that this was an important milestone that's been achieved by the Iraqi people, and it's a significant development. It's a real hopeful moment for democracy in Iraq."
Scott McClellan,"We have to deal with reality. The reality is, we have a number ? a very high number of illegal immigrants in this country. They're meeting an important economic need. And we are a nation of laws, and we're a nation of immigrants. And if we're going to address the real threats, then we need to have a temporary worker program to allow our Border Patrol agents to focus on the criminals and the thugs and the terrorists and the traffickers and smugglers that are trying to come into this country illegally."
Scott McClellan,I think that there's a tendency in this town to try to selectively pick snapshots when the broader reality is that we have a record of results and that we're getting things done for the American people.
Scott McClellan,"This is a race between Al Gore and Gov. Bush,"
Scott McClellan,These safeguard measures have now achieved their purpose.
Scott McClellan,"There has been some progress that has been made in those negotiations. Whether or not it gets done during the trip - before the trip or during the trip, we will have to see. But we believe it will get done. It is an important agreement. But these are complex issues that we are dealing with here, and they have been ongoing for some time, these negotiations. And we will see where they lead."
Scott McClellan,"There's important progress being made, but there is much work that remains to be done. And you'll hear the president talk in greater detail about our efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces."
Scott McClellan,"We've made some progress. The negotiations are ongoing. Whether it gets done during the trip or not, we will see. But we believe it will get done."
Scott McClellan,"And I think that, again, some of this is an indication of the progress that is being made to train and equip Iraqi security forces. We're standing up more Iraqi security forces, they're assuming more responsibility for their defense."
Scott McClellan,The president believes that it's important that the problems of immigration be addressed in a comprehensive way.
Scott McClellan,And we've also been taking steps to make sure we prevent some of those problems that occurred from recurring in future response efforts. And that's what we'll continue to do.
Scott McClellan,There are ongoing problems that need to be addressed. We've got to keep our energies focused on the task at hand.
Scott McClellan,"It's time for North Korea to come back to the talks. There were very clear principles that everybody agreed to at previous rounds of the talks, and we want to move forward in a substantive way based on those principles."
Scott McClellan,It's not our practice to go and try to chase down anonymous sources every time there is a report in the media.
Scott McClellan,"There was no objection raised by any of the departments during the review process or any concerns expressed about potential national security threats, and that's why it didn't rise to the presidential level."
Scott McClellan,familiar with a number of potential nominees and so he has a foundation to start with.
Scott McClellan,The president does not discuss with a potential nominee his or her views on specific issues that could come before the court.
Scott McClellan,He's been considering a diverse group of potential nominees.
Scott McClellan,We have done much to plan for a pandemic. But planning alone is not enough. Plans must be tested and improved upon.
Scott McClellan,"By taking the fight to the enemy abroad, and by doing so, that is keeping them from plotting and planning to attack inside America."
Scott McClellan,The hearings are really the place where they will get into more detailed questions about that judicial philosophy and about her record. She is someone who has a distinguished career and a long record of accomplishment.
Scott McClellan,He will bring a lot of outside perspective to this White House and that will be helpful.
Scott McClellan,"Let's put this in perspective. I mean, this issue here relates to the threat that Saddam Hussein and his regime posed to the region, to his people and to the world. And the statement in the State of the Union was one piece of one part of a much larger body of evidence."
Scott McClellan,The best way to get to peace is through the two-state vision that the president outlined.
Scott McClellan,We've got to continue working to get them assistance as quickly as we can. There is some level of patience that obviously is going to be required during this time ... but we are urging everyone to move forward as quickly as they can to get people the help they need.
Scott McClellan,"We don't typically tend to get into discussing legal matters of that nature. But in this instance, the president chose to respond to it. Call it presidential prerogative."
Scott McClellan,I'm not expecting anything of that nature at this point. What we have done is work to make sure that they get the information they need to do their job. We've worked in good faith.
Scott McClellan,All of us here serve at the pleasure of the president. And that's important to keep in mind.
Scott McClellan,"Let's keep in mind, when you have hurricanes, I don't know of instances when there is not flooding. So I think that is stating something that could be fairly obvious."
Scott McClellan,"This had been something in the back of the president's mind in case such a scenario came into being, if the chief justice had retired. The president when he met with [Roberts] knew he was a natural-born leader."
Scott McClellan,Maybe Senator Kerry needs to be spending more time in the United States Senate so he can refresh his memory on Senate rules. The Senate rules say you have to have the votes in order to filibuster.
Scott McClellan,"He is strongly committed to protecting the sanctity of marriage, ... this is an issue that has been raised because of some court cases and we're going to continue to monitor those court cases and the president is strongly committed as a matter of principle to protecting the sanctity of marriage."

Red McCombs,"[Of course, McCombs, like virtually all of his peers, wants the public to subsidize a new stadium for his sports team and is not especially receptive to the notion of paying for such a facility out of his own pocket.

He told me flat-out, 'There's no way I'm giving you anything.' So at least I knew. I like Jesse as a person; we just disagreed."

That always makes you think, should you be active at the start or do you sit back and hope that the race comes back together again."

As we consider renovations to Lee County High School, we will be looking at what we've done at Southern Lee."

Frank McCourt,"There were positive things about the church, that is, in the European cultural sense, the architecture, the liturgy, the music, the art, such as it was, the stations of the cross in the church, the tradition, and the atmosphere of awe and mystery in the mass.

Jim McCrery,"What is being done is fairly massive. There will be temporary field offices in various areas around the disaster zone, ...

Frances McDormand,"It was an excellent job, ... I like the idea of playing a 42-year-old woman -- actually, 41, I was 41 last year -- who was pregnant and has to face it."
Frances McDormand,The only power you have is the word no.
Graeme McDowell,It's nice to have a round of golf like this one. I've been waiting on a round like this for a while.
Graeme McDowell,It's a brutal golf hole.
Graeme McDowell,Golf is a cruel game.
Graeme McDowell,You know how frustrated I've been getting for the last month or so. I've been playing good golf but it has been a long time since I did any real scoring. I know I've been well but I've been missing cuts and I know I'm a much better player than that.
Josh McDowell,Forgiveness is the oil of relationships.
Josh McDowell,Forgiveness is the oil of relationships
Josh McDowell,"WHY BELIEF MATTERS,"
John McEnroe,Andy has everything. He really does have the potential to do anything he wants in the game and I think with a bit of luck he can do really well here in New York.
John McEnroe,"If you believe that [Anna Kournikova's claim that she is a virgin], I've never questioned a call in my life."
John McEnroe,"You're watching true genius,"
John McEnroe,"I think I'm about as fit as I've been the last 10 years. As far as my fitness level for playing a couple sets of doubles, this isn't about fitness. This is going to be about -- you know, luck is going to have something to do with it, mentally sort of how I handle it, how Jonas handles it, how my opponents handle it. Everyone is going to come into this with a different level of pressure, feeling they have to prove themselves in different ways. From that standpoint, the way I see it, it's more mental than anything else. I could see myself doing doubles in five years. I hardly feel like that's a big issue."
John McEnroe,His experience and work ethic is a wonderful example for the rest of this squad. This is a very professional bunch of players and I am confident in our team spirit - we will be well prepared for the task at hand.
John McEnroe,"There's one more to go and it's two Stanford boys, apparently, so I hope they've got the script right."
John McEnroe,I told Jonas to pick up me up because I was bound to drop down after my birthday.
John McEnroe,Now I get docked 10 to 20 per cent (of my appearance fee) if I don't yell at some people and break at least one racquet.
John McEnroe,"Well I think that's probably one of a few, where I grew up in the City of New York, it's got a lot of energy, my parents are Irish-American so there was a bit of yelling going on in my house but it seemed normal."
John McEnroe,To be involved in a senior tournament back in the States is very satisfying.
John McEnroe,"This taught me a lesson, but I'm not sure what it is."
John McEnroe,"Things slow down, the ball seems a lot bigger and you feel like you have more time. Everything computes - you have options, but you always take the right one."
John McEnroe,"There's something deeply satisfying when it succeeds, but I'm not going to do another book just to put my name on something and make some money if it's not something I deeply care about."
John McEnroe,"There's more shot-making, there's less of an ability before there was more shot-making because I think that guys didn't hit the ball as hard."
John McEnroe,"Let's put it this way: I was proud of the effort I put into the book and of the success it had, but I'm in no hurry to do another book."
John McEnroe,It means a lot to be back in New York. Particularly since one of the last senior event scheduled in the States was supposed to be here in New York. We were supposed to play in Central Park right after 9-11 and when 9-11 happened obviously things changed.
John McEnroe,"If Roger stopped right now and never won another match, to me he'd already be one of the greatest players to ever play the game. To me, he's the greatest all around talent that I've ever seen."
John McEnroe,"I'd like to think I could have and should have won more, but that's not the point. And I was at the point where I was playing great tennis in the mid 80s - the type of tennis people hadn't seen before - and I was very proud of that."
John McEnroe,"I haven't seen a professional player come out of New York in over 20 years since my brother Patrick came out. Blake spent a few years in Harlem, but he moved to Connecticut when he was a kid."
John McEnroe,I had a similar year back in 1984 when I felt like I couldn't lose.
John McEnroe,"I believe, for example, there should be senior singles events at the majors. That's something you've got to go around to work to be supportive."
John McEnroe,"Everybody loves success, but they hate successful people."
John McEnroe,"But these guys learn so fast now, they sort of soak up the information, they're fearless. Those are the guys who learn from their mistakes and come back strong the next time."
John McEnroe,Because in order to be successful with someone you've got to spend time with that person. You can't sort of just show up one week a year.
John McEnroe,"When I had Roddick on the Davis Cup team as a practice player, you could tell right away the guy was going to be a top 10, top 5 player."
John McEnroe,I believe there's only one autobiography you can do.
John McEnroe,"I think the players, I put in the book for example that we should go back to wood rackets, probably they laughed at me, I'm a dinosaur, but I think that you see these great players, have even more variety and you see more strategy, there'd be more subtlety."
John McEnroe,"The important thing is to learn a lesson every time you lose. Life is a learning process and you have to try to learn what's best for you. Let me tell you, life is not fun when you're banging your head against a brick wall all the time."
John McEnroe,"If, in a few months, I'm only number 8 or number 10 in the world, I'll have to look at what off-the-court work I can do. I will need to do something if I want to be number 1."
John McEnroe,"Do you have any problems, other than that you're unemployed, a moron, and a dork?"
John McEnroe,We should reach out to people to try to go after the fans the way other sports do. Because we can't just depend on the fact that it is a great game.
John McEnroe,I think it's the mark of a great player to be confident in tough situations.
John McEnroe,"What is the single most important quality in a tennis champion? I would have to say desire, staying in there and winning matches when you are not playing that well."
John McEnroe,"This taught me a lesson, but I'm not quite sure what it is."
John McEnroe,"I know anything can happen but then again you can still dream even at (age) 47. I couldn't pick a better place to come back. I love this area, and I loved the crowd support."
John McEnroe,I'll let the racket do the talking.
Robbie McEwen,"The final circuit was tough as we had to climb an uphill section three times. I'm happy for the victory but I'm exhausted,"
Robbie McEwen,"I'm very happy to have won another stage at the Giro after just two stages and even happier to have pulled on the pink jersey,"
Robbie McEwen,It's now 2-2 with Tom but this is not football. I ride to win stages not to compete against another rider. We have a sporting rivalry but we're good friends.
Brian McFadden,"I think you'll know Nortel as more a software company than a hardware company,"
Brian McFadden,We are increasingly a software company ... we've kind of hit a tipping point.
Brian McFadden,"bed tax is for tourism, it's not just another slush fund."
Todd McFarlane,"Once the character was established, I felt that I had to build a strong foundation for the Spawn brand name, ... To build a strong foundation you need four pillars. In the comic book industry, those pillars are television, video games, movies and toys or ancillary products. If you have a good foundation and pillars, you'd be surprised what you can build. You could even build skyscrapers"
Todd McFarlane,"[Disturbed singer David Draiman explains the album art, saying,] We wanted to bring our old icon, the Disturbed smiley face, whom we call 'the guy,' to life. I came up with a concept that embodied what the record was about, the 'guy' leading an army of people from all walks of life and all colors of skin, with their fists raised in unison, as a symbol of unity, strength and defiance with an azure sky in the background. Being a fan of the Spawn comic book series and the artwork that Todd and his company have done in the past, we could think of no better team to bring this idea to life. We are incredibly pleased with the piece, and think it is the most striking and certainly our favorite of the three covers. ... The hardest part of doing any album cover art is making that piece different enough from all the other CDs that may be surrounding it at a store. I believe that Greg Capullo and I have delivered an image that will be evocative and inspiring. Much like the music that Disturbed has unleashed upon us."
Todd McFarlane,"The Spawn comic book character doesn't fit in the same action figure formula as Barney or Disney, ... I didn't get a sense that the other toy companies really understood what 'Spawn' was, so I decided to just make my own."
Bobby Mcferrin,"If I can bring joy into the world, if I can get people to stop thinking about their pain for a moment, or the fact the tomorrow morning they're going to get up and tell their boss off. . . then I'll be successful."
Bobby Mcferrin,"If I can delay that [pain] for a moment and bring a little joy. . . and help them to see things a little differently, then I'll be successful."
Bobby Mcferrin,"Then when I was in grammar school I played the clarinet, and then, after clarinet I played the flute in college orchestra - besides singing in the college chorus and things like that."
Bobby Mcferrin,"I've got one week left, and then I'm done for a year. I haven't had a sabbatical, I haven't taken a year off from touring in 15 years at least."
Bobby Mcferrin,I grew up in a time when being a musician and learning to be a musician was actually very wonderful.
Bobby Mcferrin,"When I'm on stage by myself, I don't have to think about anything. I don't have to worry about anything because I'm not responsible for anything except just opening my mouth and making sure music comes out."
Bobby Mcferrin,The true musician is to bring light into people's hearts.
Bobby Mcferrin,It's not that I don't love the song. My songs are like my children: some you want around and some you want to send off to college as soon as possible.
Bobby Mcferrin,"I like to use the audience as my color palette, my instrument."
Bobby Mcferrin,"Part of our responsibility as parents, as adults, is to set examples for children. But we have to like children in order to be really happy fulfilled adults."
Ian McGeechan,"We are keeping our fingers crossed it is not a fracture, but you worry when you see the ankle twist like that,"
Ian McGeechan,"The enthusiasm and experience he can share with other players has already had an impact since he returned to full training a couple of weeks ago, and his leadership and physicality on the pitch will be a massive plus."
Ian McGeechan,"For me, the top priority is that we have got to look after own destiny."
Ian McGeechan,He's part of a new generation of players and we thought that in Lawrence's absence it was important that the leadership of the team stayed within the forwards.
Ian McGeechan,"He's part of a new generation of players and we thought that in Lawrence's absence it was important that the leadership of the team stayed within the forwards,"
Bryant McGill,Courteousness is consideration for others; politeness is the method used to deliver such considerations.

Bryant McGill,No time is better spent than that spent in the service of your fellow man.
Bryant McGill,Birth and death; we all move between these two unknowns.
Bryant McGill,"Knowledge is that possession that no misfortune can destroy, no authority can revoke, and no enemy can control. This makes knowledge the greatest of all freedoms."
Bryant McGill,"True education is limited to those people who would die without knowing, whereas the masses in the institutions are merely going through the motions, for education is a way of living."
Bryant McGill,Human intelligence may not be the best trick nature has to offer.
Bryant McGill,Education should prepare our minds to use its own powers of reason and conception rather than filling it with the accumulated misconceptions of the past.
Bryant McGill,It is better to have a fair intellect that is well used than a powerful one that is idle.
Bryant McGill,"Our understanding of the world around us is constantly being redefined and expanded, and so therefore, it is wiser to be passionate about seeking for truth than knowing it."
Bryant McGill,An intelligent person is never afraid or ashamed to find errors in his understanding of things.
Bryant McGill,"It is better to lose everything you have to keep the balance of justice level, than to live a life of petty privilege devoid of true freedom."
Bryant McGill,One column of truth cannot hold an institution of ideas from falling into ignorance. It is wiser that a person of prudence and purpose save his strength for battles that can be won.
Bryant McGill,It is better to have a meaningful life and make a difference than to merely have a long life.
Bryant McGill,"A mistake made by many people with great convictions is that they will let nothing stand in the way of their views, not even kindness."

Bryant McGill,"I have never read for entertainment, but rather for understanding and to satisfy my eager curiosity."

Bryant McGill,"The test of a belief is not exclusively in the belief itself, but also in the intentions and actions of those who embrace it."
Bryant McGill,A person who makes few mistakes makes little progress.
Bryant McGill,Truth is not a matter of fact but a state of harmony with progress and hope. Enveloped only in its wings will we ever soar to the promise of our greater selves.
Bryant McGill,"While it is important for people to see your promise you must also remember that hope is the keeper of both happiness and disappointment, the father of both progress and failure."
Bryant McGill,"Freedom is not a gift nor does it simply exist for us to have, but rather it is a sacred duty, and its blessed yield of hope is born from none other than the blood of the innocent."
Bryant McGill,Join me in my quest for a greater understanding of our existence. Join me in my desire for a greater self. Join me as I seek the humility to love and understand my fellow man.
Bryant McGill,"In the company of the accomplished, people hope it will rub off on themselves, in the company of the misfortunate, they fear it!"
Bryant McGill,"You may find many contradictory statements and philosophies within my writings. However, to this I will say such is life, for life is full of contradictions."

Bryant McGill,Yearning for the seemingly impossible is the path to human progress.

Bryant McGill,Suffering is one of life's great teachers.

Bryant McGill,Change will never happen when people lack the ability and courage to see themselves for who they are.
Willie McGinest,We're happy for him. We want for him to make those plays and come to the sideline with a smile.
Willie McGinest,"Plummer is one of those guys who I think, sometimes, he is at his best when he is running. When he is on the move, he can throw the ball really well running to his left or his right. He is one of those guys who is not good running to just one side. He can do it both ways. He is one of the most accurate quarterbacks at throwing on the move in the league."
Willie McGinest,"You can't win 'em all. It's not going to stop us from doing what we normally do, fighting hard in the off-season, getting guys back to the way we used to be and make another run."
Willie McGinest,"We're never a team that makes excuses. But it took a while, because of the injuries, having to move guys around, whatever, to get on track. But I like the way we're playing now. We're a lot sounder than we were."
Willie McGinest,"The advantage Troy has is he can read a lot of those routes because he is a receiver. He understands what receivers are trying to do and he knows all the little tricks, so he has a little advantage over the corners as far as that goes."
Paul McGinley,We are taking this very seriously. It is good to have a different perspective on the bag every now and again and he certainly brings that.
Paul McGinley,"I've won big tournaments in the past but to win a big one like this means a lot to me. I knew I had a chance today,"
Paul McGinley,I can't take a huge amount of credit for that. I watched Luke roll it 8 feet past and I was just trying to lag it to the hole.
Paul McGinley,"I was the last man in and hopefully I`ll be the last man standing,"
Paul McGinley,Anyone can do yardages and more or less pull a club. It is friendship I need more than anything else when things aren't going your way. You need someone you can count on.
Paul McGinley,"We have been friends for 15, 20 years and he has been on and on about caddying for me and it has never worked out. When he finally sold his company, he became unemployed and I said I would employ him for a week."
Paul McGinley,"Luke is a world-class player as everybody knows and he had a lot of support as a local boy, ... But I was able to keep them quiet."

George McGovern,"I fully endorse the millennial goals to make (hunger) history, ... Those are big goals, but it's do-able."

George McGovern,There'll be no criticism of anybody that wants to jump out. I'll take you close to the field. All you have to do is jump out and pull the rip cord.

Glenn McGrath,"Their strength definitely lies with their top-order batting, they need to score runs for the West Indies to really have a chance to allow their bowlers to bowl at something, and so far it really hasn't happened,"
Glenn McGrath,That's the way it goes with cricket. We accept it. England  I'm sure things were similar with them. It's hard to say one team was worse.

Glenn McGrath,"If something does happen and we do lose the Test I feel we play our best cricket when we are really under pressure - and we will be under pressure then, going into the last two Tests."
Glenn McGrath,"Ricky did float it around the boys. It wasn't a decision he made by himself, so all the guys are happy."
John McGrath,It's strategically a good move for them to have a better understanding of how product gets into the channel and if there are any grey market activities. This will take that opportunity away.

John McGrath,The tabloids line the grocery-store checkout aisles; most news outlets [broadcast] entertainment news ... and even Internet pop-ups and ads often reference celebrity gossip. It's pretty much impossible to get away.

Judy McGrath,"This is a great leap forward in the evolution of our mobile video strategy, and we look forward to developing more exciting initiatives in this space over the year to come."
Judy McGrath,"There is a way to operate this company if we combine forces in some places. Rather than having four editorial departments, we will have one. There also will be some shared technology practices."
Judy McGrath,"We're highly focused on being on every screen that our audiences care about and use the most, and wireless is certainly in the forefront around the world."
Robert McGrath,Somehow society shifted and took these things seriously.
Robert McGrath,"Often the notes a professor uses in her research one year become her lecture notes the next, ... Each one of our faculty members is working hard to do truly innovative science."

Robert McGrath,"Now the Valley's become as much a dining destination as it is for resorts and golf. Barbara pulled the stars into alignment. She is the ultimate promoter of the Southwest, and she's one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. . . . She's hung the moon as far as I'm concerned."
Robert McGrath,"They were injuring each other as a result of overcrowding. Our facility was not designed to house this many animals of this size and strength. The compound in Texas is more than four times larger, with both indoor and outdoor facilities for them."
Muffet McGraw,"It was a pretty intense practice. I thought we battled and competed against Tennessee. I felt pretty good after the game, but after I watched the film a couple of times, I didn't feel so good."
Muffet McGraw,"We haven't seen that kind of pressure since, not even from Tennessee."

Aaron McGruder,Oprah has the power to lay waste to entire industries with a mere utterance. That's a power that you have to respect. And ultimately I respect it.
Aaron McGruder,I've never been able to predict what people are going to get mad at. I've tried and I've always been surprised.
Aaron McGruder,"that's what late-night cable is for, I guess. You don't have to hear it at 8 o'clock, but you sure can hear it at 11:30, or 11 o'clock, on Adult Swim, if you so desire -- it will be there for you."
Aaron McGruder,"Every well needs occasional refreshing. I hope that this fall you will agree that the time away from the demands of deadlines has served the strip, your readers and me."
Aaron McGruder,"Our show is not 'Family Guy,' ... The element of race changes everything."
Aaron McGruder,"For me, it really first has to be a good story and be funny. If you're doing sincere comedy, the edgy stuff kind of happens on its own."
Aaron McGruder,"You know, every time a summer movie comes out, people think they're gonna get rich off of the merchandise."
Aaron McGruder,"When the news wants to tell you something is important, they put dramatic theme music behind it. They scare you into watching the story."
Aaron McGruder,"We have, essentially, a worthless democracy."
Aaron McGruder,We have to confront the very scary fact that the president is a moron. He's really dumb.
Aaron McGruder,The American people have no control over what the military does. We have no say in American foreign policy.
Aaron McGruder,"One, I push my deadlines closer than anybody else, or let's say it this way: I'm really late."
Aaron McGruder,"Once you give up rights, they're not going to give them back."
Aaron McGruder,I want the news delivered unbiased. I thought that was the whole point with journalism.
Aaron McGruder,I don't want the news to be patriotic. I don't want to see flags on the lapels of the anchors. I don't want any of that.
Aaron McGruder,I cannot be made into the commentator for the unspoken black masses.
Aaron McGruder,And I'm not so in love with making people mad that I want to live my life around it.
Aaron McGruder,"I'm trying to live well, and there is no freedom in America if you're economically bound to the system."

Martin McGuinness,It is his responsibility to deal with this and we believe that no individual party or government has the right to dictate to the independent body.
Martin McGuinness,"We are more than willing to go into government with the Rev. Ian Paisley and his party, but we are not going into limbo with him."
Martin McGuinness,Instead of grasping this unique opportunity he has chosen to undermine the rule of the IICD by rejecting their determination.
Martin McGuinness,bring an end to conflict on this island.
Martin McGuinness,I think we have to be concerned that there are still people within the nationalist and loyalist community who still believe that the way forward is to attack in a consistent basis in order to undermine and destroy all the work that the pro-agreement parties have been involved in.
Martin McGuinness,deliver on their outstanding obligations and commitments.
Martin McGuinness,Our biggest fear is that we are going to go into a vacuum over Christmas and that people that are ill-disposed towards the peace process can use that vacuum to destabilize the entire peace process.

Al McGuire,"When I was losing, they called me nuts. When I was winning they called me eccentric."
Al McGuire,The only mystery in life is why the kamikaze pilots wore helmets.
Al McGuire,I don't know why people question the academic training of an athlete. Fifty percent of the doctors in this country graduated in the bottom half of their classes.
Al McGuire,"Remember, half the doctors in this country graduated in the bottom half of their class."
Al McGuire,I think everyone should go to college and get a degree and then spend six months as a bartender and six months as a cabdriver. Then they would really be educated.
Eddie McGuire,"Once the rugby league finished, those that actually like the oval sports, the rugby league and the AFL, swapped from Channel Nine to Ten, so there was some very heartening figures there for AFL in Sydney, particularly in the last hour of football."
Eddie McGuire,"We will read all the stories about how tough he was and all the rest of it, but I think he was a tremendously compassionate man as well."
Eddie McGuire,"We still remain the highest live television talk show. (Andrew) Denton and Rove (McManus) and all the rest of it get the Logies and we get the ratings,"
Eddie McGuire,"I think Hawthorn supporters would hate to see Hawthorn players being banned, ... I think Hawthorn players who receive a significant income (from Nine) would not be happy."
Mike McGuire,I can imagine Songbird as a Web interface for a brand like that. There would be interesting value there.
Mike McGuire,"Creating a seamless link between the device and the service is crucial, ... That's what Apple has done, and that's what Sony wants to do with the PSP. Consumers are nothing if not foragers of digital content. With the PSP, you can connect to the Internet, browse and download content other than games."
Mike McGuire,"I am not able to answer questions on that, There's a real fear that some of these victims are still angry. That's why the government is concerned."
Mike McGuire,There is the benefit of allowing me or any individual a way to place a stamp on the culture.
Mike McGuire,"It's wonderful and unique stuff, and it's a clever way to do it. Being online and digital gives them the ability not to have to invest a whole lot of capital to distribute it."
Mike McGuire,It's an interesting idea. But you've got a whole bunch of audiences that have to be satisfied with this.
Mike McGuire,"Assuming they are looking at this as pure incremental revenue, ... they are in an interesting position to take advantage of changing consumer patterns and chart new territory where other folks have not yet looked."
Kevin McHale,The best way to learn is through experience. He's getting that. Eventually he'll be back in the NBA.
Kevin McHale,"Mark brings so much more to a team than just statistics, ... First and foremost, he brings energy, and a tremendous work ethic. Plus, he is a good teammate and a great guy to have in the locker room."
Kevin McHale,"Anthony is a veteran point guard who has proven his ability to run a team when he's on the court, ... He excels on the defensive end of the floor and helps to solidify our backcourt."

Jim McKay,I guess I didn't worry too much about the six runs I gave up. I tried to redeem myself with those two home runs.
Jim McKay,Halftime Highlights. It was a milestone in TV sports coverage.
Jim McKay,"Jamie Morgan had a great shooting game tonight. She was 3-for-3 on 3-pointers. It really seems like she was on. Every time Pine River would start to rally, she'd come up with a big three to shut it down."
Jim McKay,Working on the film really made me confront my opinions about change and gentrification.
Jim McKay,"When you make work, your goal might not be first and foremost to have as many people as possible see it, but it might be more about honing your craft as a storyteller or making art, but, there's no doubt about it, you want lots of people to see it."
Jim McKay,"Well, this is the second time I've done New Directors."
Jim McKay,"Toward the end of school I started watching movies. Got a job in a movie theater in Brookline, Massachusetts."

Jim McKay,"Right now the thing that I have learned the most is to be grateful that I have finally gotten to a point where I am being paid to make films, after eight years."
Jim McKay,One day I had an idea for a movie. Everything came after that.
Jim McKay,"On one level, I enjoyed the irony of the situation: a girl who's from a Cuban or Puerto Rican household who's been discouraged from speaking Spanish."
Jim McKay,"On one hand, as a filmmaker, I don't want to make a movie with guns everywhere."
Jim McKay,Kids who have no money are still figuring out a way - somehow - to dress nicely.
Jim McKay,Kids - in a really good way - can talk about their differences without the baggage that adults have.
Jim McKay,"Initially, it was about kids at the bottom rung of the social ladder, due to their looks and their class background. But they're also outsiders in terms of their peer group."
Jim McKay,"If you're a kid who's not necessarily attractive, and you don't have money, and you're not hip and cool, chances are you're not going to feel good about yourself and want to be an actor."
Jim McKay,I was the first voice of Baltimore television in 1947.
Jim McKay,I was going to be an English teacher.
Jim McKay,I think there are some very evil things about gentrification.
Jim McKay,"I think Bob Costas is terrific. He's so knowledgeable. He can talk about any subject, not just sports."
Jim McKay,I studied secondary education.
Jim McKay,I still haven't figured out how to have fun on a shoot.
Jim McKay,I remember what I got paid when I joined the Baltimore Evening Sun. I got $35.00 a week. I think on television it was $100.00 a week.
Jim McKay,I like the way Wiseman builds a story in an unconventional way.
Jim McKay,I had to learn to read a light meter and to properly expose film. I had never written a script before. I needed help. I hired a DP.
Jim McKay,"I am playing with the assumptions that we have in our everyday life when we are tripped up or fooled and we learn something, that makes things exciting - I am having fun with that stuff, but you have to manage it so it doesn't get too cute, that's what I trying to work toward."
Jim McKay,How you define yourself is a major issue for young people and adults alike.
Jim McKay,"Here were these college kids beating the Soviets and going on to the Olympic Gold Medal. To me, that's the greatest upset of all time in any sport that I can think of."
Jim McKay,"But what I did think would be interesting is if we created a fictitious story of our own, and then took these stories that we had collected and assigned them to characters who would be played by actors."
Jim McKay,This thing that Colin Powell's son is expected to do is kind of scary when you think that television and radio and newspapers are what make people think what they think.
Jim McKay,Of course the Munich tragedy was the biggest event in my career and the most terrible.
Jim McKay,"So, when you see a kid with ratty jeans on, wearing sneakers that aren't clean, you know they're in a certain place economically. I was interested in that experience."
Rich McKay,"The last capped-year rules that are in place are much different to the rules we've operated with to date. They capture a lot of the tricks of the trade that otherwise would allow you to extend salary-cap dollars. Labor peace has been great for us in the National Football League. It has made life easier, and I think it's been good for the players."
Rich McKay,There has been no contact and I've yet to see anything from Cleveland regarding Phil. The NFL has rules that prohibit anybody from contacting an employee of another team until the season is over.
Rich McKay,That's too much of a wait and too much of a risk.
Rich McKay,"You have to realize that the purpose of what we were doing was moving to cost sharing from revenue sharing. Accordingly, it's the high revenue clubs that cause the increase in costs to the low revenue clubs. Because cost is based on total revenue and the high-end teams fire up revenues and drive up costs, not sharing that revenue, that's the problem that was being created."
Rich McKay,"The baseline purpose, as I see it, is two-fold. No. 1, for competitive purposes so the other team has . . . some idea as to who's going to play . . . and No. 2, to discourage anybody from wanting to seek out inside information."
Rich McKay,"Our feeling was that of the backs out there, he fit what Jon wanted. He could be a power runner inside. He could run the quick tosses. He could do what [ Tyrone ] Wheatley did in [Oakland] for Jon. Yet he could also stay in the game on third down because he caught the ball so well. We just liked the entire package."
Rich McKay,"If you have no opportunity to avoid, there's no penalty. But there are plays where we believe players are coming off a block, have an opportunity to avoid the low hit and do not, and we would like to see those called (a penalty)."
Rich McKay,"When he has an opportunity to avoid, he must take that opportunity to avoid. When the quarterback has his feet on the ground, he's really defenseless."
Rich McKay,"We're going to put a little more onus on the defensive player. When the defensive player has an opportunity to avoid, he must take that opportunity to avoid."
Rich McKay,"As far as the window goes, the window is purely a function of the draft in my mind,"
Rich McKay,"Just like with any schedule, there are positives and negatives. We certainly look forward to a great home schedule for our fans and the prime-time appearances."
Rich McKay,"I remember playing those ['76 Pittsburgh] Steelers, and my God, when they walked out, we said, 'Are you kidding me?'"
Rich McKay,"When you look at some of these celebrations, you think they're kind of funny. But when you look at a bunch of them, you are a little concerned by it. We're trying to make sure that sportsmanship remains central to the game."
Rich McKay,"The quarterback sits in a defenseless position when his feet are on the ground and he's throwing the football. We have to find ways to try to protect him. We're going to put a little more onus on the defensive player. When the defensive player has an opportunity to avoid (a low hit), he must take that opportunity to avoid."
Rich McKay,"Without a doubt, the player costs are highest in this deal, and a good portion of the burden is going to fall hardest on the lower-revenue clubs. But we did what was in the best interest of the entire National Football League [by reaching an accord]."
Rich McKay,"In looking at it today and talking to the doctors, the safe way to go is to shut Mike down,"
Rich McKay,I think my dad fired him twice.
Rich McKay,Let's not take away individualism. Let's not take away creativity. Let's just make sure there are bright lines [to follow].
Rich McKay,They did what they did and they knew there would be consequences. But they won championships doing it. They made the trade-off.
Rich McKay,"Almost from the day I got here, I heard complaints about the field in the indoor facility. It was too hard. Guys would feel like they took a pounding on their legs. The material that was in there before was produced by a company that no longer exists, so it wasn't like we could do anything to make it better."
Rich McKay,"[During the 2003 season, McKay said, there were several complaints about the lax enforcement of the rules regarding contact beyond five yards of the line of scrimmage.] [Competition Committee co-chair and Tennessee coach] Jeff Fisher complained, and he's a defensive guy, ... It started before last year, actually. In our last three [annual] reports to the teams, we said we had to do something about the illegal contact. There was just getting to be too much of it. And as we went through last season, I don't want to use the term 'death threat,' but there was going to be a clear emphasis made on clarifying the rule after the season. By the end of last year, it was well on our radar screen."
Rich McKay,"I will say one thing: it probably took us more time to discuss it (at preliminary competition committee meetings) and all the different aspects of it this year than any year I can remember in the past. But it is one that has drawn a lot of media attention, and I think the league and the teams have talked a lot about it. We certainly talked a lot about it, and then when we get to Orlando, we'll obviously tell you what our position was. But for now, I'll just say that it is one that's definitely sparked interest."
Rich McKay,The competition committee looked at this two years ago and we probably should have done something then.
Rich McKay,"[Competition Committee co-chair and Tennessee coach] Jeff Fisher complained, and he's a defensive guy. It started before last year, actually. In our last three [annual] reports to the teams, we said we had to do something about the illegal contact. There was just getting to be too much of it. And as we went through last season, I don't want to use the term 'death threat,' but there was going to be a clear emphasis made on clarifying the rule after the season. By the end of last year, it was well on our radar screen."
Rich McKay,It basically would end the communication.
Rich McKay,"The No. 1 (criterion) in my mind for drafting a player is tape. How did he play as a college player? The second-most-valuable piece is going to be the character side, football and personal. That gives you a better way to predict how he'll be as a pro. Those two things will tell you."
Rich McKay,"The salary-cap system makes you make choices, and some of them are not very popular choices. But because the money is so big, the choices have big consequences if they don't work out. It has a trickle-down effect on the rest of your football team."
Rich McKay,We're preparing as though we're going down two different paths â€” one with an agreement and one without. Our meetings tonight will really focus on there being no agreement.
Rich McKay,"There's no question that it creates a bigger advantage,"
Rich McKay,"The reason we wanted big receivers is based on the offense. The ability to block and be a factor on the inside is a huge factor. In the passing game, tall guys present huge targets as they cross the field. In the West Coast offense, you have so many horizontal routes and you have so many guys crossing the field that you need bigger targets."
Ian Mckellen,"When you were on stage, you could be absolutely open about your emotions and indulge them and express yourself in a way that - in real life - I wasn't doing."
Ian Mckellen,If you've got Mystique as your girlfriend the fun you could have in bed - I've just imagined X-Men 3 might open with me in bed with Patrick Stewart.
Ian Mckellen,The thing you notice here after America is how refreshingly ordinary people look because they haven't had their chin wrapped around the back of their ears.
Jay McKenna,It was great. He can do a lot of things. We were very pleased with that performance.
Jay McKenna,"One of our goals is to get it inside. We have some shooters, but it?s tough when you can?t get anything inside. We were able to get the ball inside and take some of the pressure off the outside shooters."
Jay McKenna,"It was tight. They?re a good team, a solid team. It?s a good experience to have a close game and make the right decisions at the end and come out on the winning end of it. I was very pleased with the effort."
James McKenzie,"...All that combined is a greater burden on him than we, as a state and society, can impose."
James McKenzie,People have a lot of misconceptions about the district. I just want to get the information out there so they know what is going on.
James McKenzie,"My dad had a heart attack recently and we had to have an ambulance for him, I had to call for my wife too. We rely on the district just like everyone else."
James McKenzie,"We have the best support from patrons. At Christmas we have people bring stuff in here all the time and express their gratitude, and we really appreciate their support."
James McKenzie,We do not feel on-site training is sufficient for our employees to avoid unnecessary accidents and potential loss of limb or life.
Jack McKeon,I didn't see it. I saw a guy in the upper deck trying to catch it.
Jack McKeon,He was looking for trouble. What is this game turning out to be? It used to be you could argue and have some fun. Today you can't say a word. We've got to sit in the dugout with our Sunday school Bibles.
Jack McKeon,It's like making a trade.
Jack McKeon,"I'm not running a kindergarten here where I have to go ask permission to win a game, ... I think Tony LaRussa said it best. He said, 'How you perform will determine where you hit in the lineup.'"
Jack McKeon,"You have rules, and you expect each player to do what he's expected to do. When they don't, you do something about it. When you do, you're a bad guy."
Jack McKeon,"They did a good job, both Pierre and Conine, of getting on base and setting things up for the rest of the guys. Pierre's a big factor is helping us score. [Conine] is a good RBI guy, he showed that today."
Jack McKeon,"I feel for him about as much as I do myself. He's a pro. He's got a lot of pride. You could say it's one of those years it's not clicking. If you've got to win, you can't have too many days of not clicking."
Jack McKeon,"I had to go with a lot of young guys, which is something I like, ... I don't mind that at all. The problem is, when they all get good, you're gone."
Jack McKeon,We need a lot of luck.
Jack McKeon,You've got to have some luck. This thing is going to go down to the last week of the season.
Jack McKeon,"He was hobbling around, but he's a gamer and he did the job."
Jack McKeon,"I never solicited a job, ... I never looked for a job. I said, 'They know where I'm at. If they want me, fine. If they don't, fine.'"
Jack McKeon,"I like my players to use their imagination. I don't like pushing buttons, like they're robots, ... I want them to get smarter."
Jack McKeon,Too many bases on balls are going to hurt you. He wasn't on his game.
Jack McKeon,You have to know he was in a lot of grief. But he's a pro. He's always the same old Roger. He's a first-ballot Hall of Famer.
Jack McKeon,"That's not one of my goals,"
Jack McKeon,"It's tough. It shouldn't be [like that], but it is. You're getting in these 2-1 games and you never have anyone to pop one out and give a two- or three-run cushion. Every game it's magnified because one mistake by [the bullpen] and you're out of the game."
Jack McKeon,"This game, funny things happen. Somebody gets injured, somebody gets cold with the bat, and somebody jumps in and takes advantage of the opportunity. You know, like Cabrera did, Willis did, Vargas did."
Jack McKeon,"What can you say? No doubt in my mind, [he's] the MVP of this league,"
Jack McKeon,"No doubt in my mind he's the MVP in this league. I'm so proud of him because he's such a class individual, goes about his work in a very businesslike manner. No fanfare with him. ... You get through a dogfight like we did in 2003 with guys like Lee."
Jack McKeon,"This guy has the poise, the know-how, the confidence. You can't say enough good things about the kid."
Jack McKeon,"We still want to beat him, but we understand he pitched under tough circumstances. He certainly was the same old Roger Clemens, the Hall of Famer."
Jack McKeon,"That's the good thing about the game of baseball -- you can redeem yourself the next night. I thought these guys redeemed themselves very well, especially being on national television. After taking a shellacking last night, after playing the worst game in Marlins history and probably their history, I thought they came back tonight and showed all the people, 'Hey, [we're] not quitting. [We're] not giving up.' We may get beat, but we're not giving up."
Jack McKeon,We had a major breakdown on defense. The Department of Defense wasn't in action tonight.
Jack McKeon,"He certainly has enough ability to be one of the top pitchers in the league, but you also have to be focused."
Patricia McKillip,"[Imagination] must be visited constantly, or else it begins to become restless and emit strange bellows at embarrassing moments; ignoring it only makes it grow larger and noisier."
Patricia McKillip,"[Imagination] is best fed by reality, an odd diet for something nonexistent; there are few details of daily life and its broad range of emotional context that can't be transformed into food for the imagination."
Patricia McKillip,"Imagination must be visited constantly, or else it begins to become restless and emit strange bellows at embarrassing moments; ignoring it only makes it grow larger and noisier."
Patricia McKillip,"Content, it dreams awake, and spins the fabric of tales. There is really nothing to be done with such imagery except to use it: in writing, in art."
Hank McKinnell,"There has to be a balanced approach, which first satisfies our need for security and at the same time makes sure we allow reasonable access to foreign investors to the United States."
Hank McKinnell,"In each of the three areas of this survey -- sales, capital spending and employment -- more companies still anticipate expansion rather than contraction. Capital expenditure plans continue to reflect steady gains, and employment predictions by the nation's leading companies are near their all-time high."
Hank McKinnell,"It looks like a combination of raising HDL and lowering LDL cholesterol could have dramatic impact, maybe eliminating cardiovascular risk,"
Hank McKinnell,"The fact that half of our companies are planning to increase spending on plants, equipment and technology bodes well for economic growth."
Hank McKinnell,"This is a normal part of our planning cycle,"

Drayton McLane,"It hurt for a minute, but now I'm ready to go. We're still in charge. It will just make it all the more meaningful when we do win it in St. Louis."
Drayton McLane,"Each year, with our players, I ask them what their goals are. I said, 'Roy, what is one of your goals?' He said, 'To own a bulldozer.' That kind of took me back a little bit. I had never heard that before."
Drayton McLane,"We're very, very excited about Preston Wilson. His enthusiasm is as sky high as ours is. He wants to be a champion, and we are still committed to being that champion. We want to go back to that World Series and win the World Series."

Alex McLeish,Barry broke his nose and he is having a bit of trouble breathing. We know that we need all our best players for this weekend because this is a really hard game and it's an important game. But we feel we can cover the loss of Ferguson.
Alex McLeish,"I was delighted for Kris. He certainly finds space in the box, his movement off the ball is great and he will always score goals as long we can provide the ammunition for him."
Alex McLeish,T here is pressure on everyone here to perform and there has to be collective responsibility. We have to get going and start playing the way we can with the experienced guys we have here.
Alex McLeish,The lads have shown tremendous spirit despite our problems this season. We played a very good side. At half-time I thought we might go out and lose our discipline and get picked off.
Alex McLeish,Kris is a young player with great potential and we have been monitoring his progress over the last couple of years.
Alex McLeish,I asked the players for a performance tonight and I felt the players played well. We needed a wee bit of luck. Did we deserve a point? I thought the performance was terrific but whether we deserved a point is for others to decide.
Alex McLeish,"The performance, without taking anything away from Falkirk, was just not acceptable. I am surprised and very, very disappointed by the poor performance of the players. It's as disappointed as I have been since coming to Rangers but we take collective responsibility and it is up to me to gets things right."
Alex McLeish,"I felt it was as good as a performance all round as I have seen. Once the second (goal) went in, we had some breathing space and I was pleased with the control display."
Alex McLeish,I'm extremely proud of the players' performance.
Alex McLeish,We want to try to reward the guys who did so well the other night with the same team if we can. We have a couple of niggles but we would hope to have the same bunch.
Alex McLeish,"On the question of playing three at the back, it's something we haven't done and it's not the kind of thing you would normally spring on them for an important European tie. It could be a way of setting traps for myself, leaving myself open to criticism if it doesn't work."
Alex McLeish,I hope it doesn't spread any further or we have real problems.
Alex McLeish,We were so close to getting one of the greatest ever results in the club's history.
Alex McLeish,"It's been a tough week, that's an understatement, but it has been a hard week but there is nothing you can do about it."
Alex McLeish,"We lost a couple of sloppy goals, which we can improve on, but many aspects of our play were much better than the game at Inverness."
Alex McLeish,If Peter keeps scoring goals he is going to give us a headache in terms of what his demands would be if he was to stay.
Alex McLeish,"I am quite disappointed at scoring two goals away from home, playing as well as we did, and not winning,"
Alex McLeish,"I was very pleased for Dado because he is still searching for peak fitness after his injury, and he enjoyed those two strikes. No matter what age a striker is, they always thrive on scoring goals and today's performance will do his confidence no harm."
Alex McLeish,It's a real test but I don't fear it. I was a little bit uneasy and a little bit in limbo because it was a case of you must win this one or that one.
Alex McLeish,"It is time to move on and I decided that, with my family, last summer. I told the chairman at the beginning of the season that I felt this would be my last campaign. It is a demanding job but I would not have changed anything about it. Am I sad? No. We are turning this into a soap opera. Managers come and go but the well-being of Rangers is the most important thing."
Alex McLeish,Fernando will now be brought back into the squad. We can rely on his experience. He has played in every round and is available to us.
Alex McLeish,"We have been looking at other countries - Bulgaria and Hungary, for example - but we have to make sure that these players are able to come to a club like Rangers, where the expectations are so high, and hit the ground running. It is easier for players to go to places like Hearts, for example, where the expectations and pressures are not so great."
Alex McLeish,"Over the last couple of years we have made contact with the top agents in the Czech Republic, for example,"
Alex McLeish,"We should have taken all three points, without a doubt. It's ridiculous that I am standing here talking about dropping two points."
Alex McLeish,"Our efforts were fantastic. We can play better, but the spirit, determination and passion were there... We're still alive."
Alex McLeish,"We played well on a horrendous surface and my only criticism is that we didn't score as many as we should have done. He had it manipulated last week and it was painful, but I hope that talk of an operation is premature."
Alex McLeish,"We are fortunate to have two terrific goalkeepers and competition for a specialist position,"
Alex McLeish,"That match was really the birth of the real European Aberdeen team, against a high quality Ipswich side,"
Alex McLeish,"That match was really the birth of the real European Aberdeen team, against a high quality Ipswich side."
Alex McLeish,"Making the last 16 was a great achievement, but it isn't enough. We're not going to look at where we are and think we've done well and that we should be satisfied to leave it at that. We want very much to progress to the quarter-finals of the tournament."
Joanne McLeod,I've tended to hang in there with the guy because he doesn't have a big support system and I think support systems are very big in life.
Joanne McLeod,She was a teensy bit not quite into her space. She usually is.
Joanne McLeod,"When I first moved here to coach we were strong in singles skating, but didn't have much in pairs and dance. This year we're going to the nationals with the full package."

Marshall McLuhan,The new electronic independence re-creates the world in the image of a global village.
Marshall McLuhan,"The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation, we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a rear view mirror. We march backwards into the future."
Marshall McLuhan,We drive into the future using only our rear view mirror.
Marshall McLuhan,The future masters of technology will have to be light-hearted and intelligent. The machine easily masters the grim and the dumb.
Marshall McLuhan,"Persons grouped around a fire or candle for warmth or light are less able to pursue independent thoughts, or even tasks, than people supplied with electric light. In the same way, the social and educational patterns latent in automation are those of self-employment and artistic autonomy."
Marshall McLuhan,The spoken word was the first technology by which man was able to let go of his environment in order to grasp it in a new way.
Marshall McLuhan,One of the effects of living with electric information is that we live habitually in a state of information overload. There's always more than you can cope with.

Marshall McLuhan,"Today we are beginning to notice that the new media are not just mechanical gimmicks for creating worlds of illusion, but new languages with new and unique powers of expression."
Marshall McLuhan,Mass transportation is doomed to failure in North America because a person's car is the only place where he can be alone and think.
Marshall McLuhan,Madison Avenue is a very powerful aggression against private consciousness. A demand that you yield your private consciousness to public manipulation.

Vince McMahon,"I thought it would be great for WWF fans, especially Canadians, to see Bret back in some capacity."
Vince McMahon,"There's no Hollywood outlet for this. The Rock's hooked, like all of us are."
Vince McMahon,"You can say what you want about Vince McMahon, but he was the best ... He was a genius at creating stories for the wrestlers."
Vince McMahon,"Quite frankly, I prefer 90-minute events."
Vince McMahon,"I think we look at all forms of entertainment and steal, if you would, from all of them."
Vince McMahon,"We are Hollywood, ... We're entertainment, and that's what the World Wrestling Federation is all about."
Vince McMahon,"When you think about it, you should compare the World Wrestling Federation to other major entertainment companies or motion picture studios."
Vince McMahon,"It's the greatest form of sports-entertainment in history, and the audience loves it for that, but at one time, this industry was lying to the public."
Vince McMahon,"The one thing you cannot get from any other form of entertainment - you cannot get the rush of 20,000 people, what they give you as a performer. No actor can get that."
Vince McMahon,The original Saturday Night Main Event was a pop culture phenomenon with a rich history of big moments. We promise to make the new Main Event in prime time on NBC even bigger and better.
Vince McMahon,It's Bret choice not to want that. I'm alright with it.
Vince McMahon,One of the public things that my character (Mr. McMahon) says is that I always do everything I do for WWF fans.
Vince McMahon,"But other than that, no, I'm not flattered by what I read when people call me a genius and things of that nature because I'm not."
Vince McMahon,"As far as sustaining our popularity, I believe we can."
Vince McMahon,I think that the Internet - and I do love the free flow of ideas on the 'Net - is like the wild west of the information world.
Vince McMahon,"I believe that given the audience attention level, we could do an even more compelling 90 minutes."
Vince McMahon,"I'm a real common sense guy who caught a lot of good breaks and who has been very, very fortunate."
Vince McMahon,"So no, I don't think we've lost our edge at all."
Vince McMahon,Sometimes you have to take a half step back to take two forward.
Vince McMahon,"The biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public, there is no bigger thrill than that."
Vince McMahon,"When I'm on vacation here in the States, I can do all kinds of stuff; I can train and keep busy."
Vince McMahon,"But because our organization has grown so much and in so many different ways, the delegation process places responsibility and authority on the shoulders of people you can watch grow and watch the way they treat others."
Vince McMahon,"I don't know what drives me, I don't have a clue, but I'm driven more today than I ever have been."
Vince McMahon,"In Europe we could do it, if we fly as soon as the event is over."
Vince McMahon,"That crossover of whether it's entertainment or news is the biggest crock of b.s. in television today, because it's all entertainment."
Vince McMahon,"The standards are being lowered, not just on the Internet, but in all of news and media."
Vince McMahon,"I'm excited about it, thrilled with the success thus far."
Vince McMahon,I think there are certain business matters which we must now conduct differently than we used to.
Vince McMahon,"We love our fans, so there's nothing we wouldn't do for them, and we go directly to t hem."
Vince McMahon,One of the problems with the Internet is that a lot of times it is inaccurate.
Vince McMahon,"The key, of course, is to stay away from the losing years."
Vince McMahon,"It's difficult to do that internally, because you're flying five, six hours."
Vince McMahon,The Rock will always come back to us.
Vince McMahon,"So, I get a kick out of working with the media."
Vince McMahon,I'm not too good at lying still in the sun.
Vince McMahon,"I would dare say that most anyone in public life, if they stay in public long enough, is not treated fairly."
Vince McMahon,I'm not afraid of failing. I don't like to fail. I hate to fail. But I'm not afraid of it.
Vince McMahon,I understand the common man because I understand me in that regard at least.
Vince McMahon,"I have to do something with my mind, or I'll get in trouble."
Vince McMahon,"So we're living by that sword, and we're going to cut every now and then from it's backlash."
Vince McMahon,"We do have our finger on the pulse of the marketplace, if for no other reasons than having all these live events and listening to our audience all the time."
Vince McMahon,"We're going to be treated very poorly, I think that goes with the territory, and you have to get over it, get beyond it and know who you are among your peers and especially among your family when you look in the mirror."
Vince McMahon,I guess maybe another gift I have is a great work ethic.
Vince McMahon,In America it's live by the sword of freedom of expression and be will to die by it as well.
Rove McManus,We reassess ideas and launch new ones where we can.
Rove McManus,"It is nice to have that reputation that when people land in the country, they want to be part of the show."
Rove McManus,"Doing that (the comedy gig) has been very enjoyable,"
Jamie McMurray,"You don't want to wreck somebody to get back at him, ... I just wanted to find him after the race so I could punch him, to be honest with you. I was so mad. I thought I just wanted to hit him and that would make me feel better."
Jamie McMurray,"I did something I shouldn't have done in practice,"
Jamie McMurray,But this week is a lot better. I even played golf this week.
Larry McMurtry,"The lives of happy people are dense with their own doings -- crowded, active, thick. But the sorrowing are nomads, on a plain with few landmarks and no boundaries; sorrow's horizons are vague and its demands are few."
Larry McMurtry,"You need strength; love is not easy. It's not easy if you find [it], it's not easy if you don't find it. It's not easy if you find it but it doesn't work out. It merely says the strong survive, but not everybody is strong."
Larry McMurtry,"One of the things that Ang brings to all of his projects is his deep sense of being a double exile, an outsider's outsider."
Larry McMurtry,Incompetents invariably make trouble for people other than themselves.
Larry McMurtry,Members of the Academy are mostly urban people. We are an urban nation. We are not a rural nation. It's not easy even to get a rural story made.
Larry McMurtry,"If we know anything about man, it's that he's not pacific. The temptation to butcher anyone considered undesirable seems to be a common temptation, not always resisted."
Larry McMurtry,"You expect far too much of a first sentence. Think of it as analogous to a good country breakfast: what we want is something simple, but nourishing to the imagination."
Larry McMurtry,Bunk! Pure bunk! For all I know Yellow Hand died of old age.
Larry McMurtry,"No illusion is more crucial than the illusion that great success and huge money buy you immunity from the common ills of mankind, such as cars that won't start."
Donovan McNabb,I felt he was probably worth more. He felt the need to take less to stay with that team. Each individual guy has to decide what he wants. It's on the player.
Donovan McNabb,"This is a type of game that when you talk about the Philadelphia Eagles and the struggle of getting to our goal, and that's the Super Bowl, this would be a great story."
Donovan McNabb,"It's still sore, ... For days, it was sore to sleep, sore to move around, sore to get up. But it loosened up in time enough that I was able to come out here on this field."
Donovan McNabb,"I don't regret anything that I've done or said, or the way I've handled it, ... We are role models and we are grown men. Things that I've done, I think my teammates understand."
Donovan McNabb,Teams are definitely game planning for Brian.
Donovan McNabb,"It's good that I've been in the situation before where I've dealt with pain, I've dealt with soreness, dealt with injuries,"
Donovan McNabb,"I know about his work ethic and the way he approaches games,"
Donovan McNabb,That's between us. We could have been talking about food in the vending machines or what we eat on the plane.
Donovan McNabb,I'm sure he was glad he was our side of the field. I don't think he would have been too happy on their side of the field today. I'm sure he's happy he's 7-0.
Donovan McNabb,I have to make quicker decisions.
Donovan McNabb,"I think this is a sign for my teammates. Every individual makes their own decisions. Now, it's up to me to see how they react. They obviously reacted during the season when they wanted (Owens) back."
Donovan McNabb,"I was able to recognize some different things. Again, it just goes back to having a comfort level with the guys. We were all on the same page. Greg changed his route a little bit, gave me an opportunity to put it in a position where he could score."
Donovan McNabb,"It's going to come about. But if we have to keep going through [receiver coach David] Culley? Hey, I'm going to go through every channel I can to make sure we're on the same page. If I need to go through the other receivers, that's exactly what I'll do."
Donovan McNabb,Hunger awareness is an important issue in our country that often goes overlooked. I?m honored to partner with a company that holds this issue in such high regard.
Bob McNair,"I'm really interested in sitting down with him and getting to know him. We'll get some quality one-on-one time with him. We'll do the same with Reggie Bush, too."
Bob McNair,"As far as getting horses ready for the Derby, he's as good as they come, He's done a magnificent job with Bob and John."
Bob McNair,"I'm going to meet with Dom after the season, and we'll evaluate the personnel before decisions are made. We've underachieved, and that's not what we're about. We're here to overachieve, not underachieve."
Bob McNair,"I wouldn't say all those decisions didn't work. Certainly, some of the changes didn't help."
Bob McNair,"I'm not going to give charity here to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I want to get this straight, please."
Bob McNair,The collective bargaining agreement is more in the hands of the Players Association and their willingness to be reasonable. No agreement is better than a bad agreement.
Steve McNair,He's still a talent to be reckoned with. I don't know if he's talking about retirement because of the injuries but he's not declining skill-wise.
Steve McNair,Ed Reed. He's a very smart player. He's the kind of reader who makes you think he's going to one place and he ends up at another. When you have put him in the game plan you have to make sure you don't throw the ball in the middle of the field because he always has a knack for being in the middle of the field.
Steve McNair,"It's a different saying every year, but it all depends upon my health. As long as I can stay healthy, I will continue to play."
Steve McNair,"I think Matt is well prepared. He's a guy that studies hard. He knows the game, and I think whatever decision is made, he'll be ready."
Steve McNair,"You get a lot of mixed emotion. The sad thing about it is that you get so frustrated because there is not communication. They can't communicate with you, and you can't communicate with them,"
Steve McNair,"If a guy can't communicate as far as hand signals, I don't know what you can do. ... I don't know what the rule is on that, I don't think it was the right call to be made."
Steve McNair,"If they can get away with it, it's not cheating,"
Gerry McNamara,The most important statistic to me is that we've won every game I've played here.
Gerry McNamara,I'm just proud. I'm proud of these guys for the way they're fighting.
Gerry McNamara,"If I was going out with a loss, that's the way I wanted to go out fighting."
Gerry McNamara,I'm glad coach took me out when he did. I'm not sure how much longer I could have held it together.
Allan McNish,It's a little unfortunate. Sometimes we come up against problems.
Allan McNish,"This was the first real endurance test, we encountered trouble but nothing we couldn't overcome. The engineers did a great job preparing for things that could go wrong. The car's rhythm was really good, it was fun to really blast the car around the track."
Allan McNish,"We had our share of trouble today, but that's natural in development. This was the first real endurance test. We encountered trouble, but nothing we couldn't overcome."
Allan McNish,We still have to look at our competition. I'm sure they were not as flat out as they could have been and it's a long drive [today].
Allan McNish,"Today, Audi has showed America the potential of diesel power. This is a historic day for Audi and for sports car racing."
Paul McNulty,Drug trafficking in cyberspace is just as harmful to public safety as drug trafficking on street corners.
Paul McNulty,I won't be putting my mother or grandmother into it unless it is cheap.
Paul McNulty,The defendant violated his pledge to protect classified information. He compromised national security and the system that protects it.
Paul McNulty,This conviction is the result of extraordinary law enforcement work and international cooperation. It serves as a clear warning to all that terrorists can and will be brought to the bar of justice.
Paul McNulty,"They think if they (the White House lawyers) say 'unfair' five thousand times, eventually you just believe them, ... The strategy is clear: attack the process, attack the process and that way you never get to the facts."
Paul McNulty,This indictment sends a clear message to corporate America that executives will be brought to justice not only for cooking their own company's books but also for knowingly helping their counterparts at other companies do the same.
Larry McReynolds,"Maybe that didn't work so well me doing that with Senior. I remember once we had a 20-minute penalty in practice, and NASCAR wouldn't start the penalty until the driver was on pit road. And Senior was just raising cane, sitting in that hot black car. He said he was getting out and coming back to the garage. So I told him 'Well, I wouldn't sit in that hot car either ... you've only made a gazillion dollars sitting in it. I wouldn't sit in it another 20 minutes either.'"
Larry McReynolds,"Cell Signaling is in a fast-growing space. They develop numerous products for high-level customers, many who are pursuing treatments for cancer. Our company helped them get started, and now they are growing rapidly on their own."
Larry McReynolds,"They're our Tiger Woods. When they're on their game, people tune in and watch. When they're off their game, people tune in to see if they can find their game. Fans' interest is still there on both sides of the spectrum."
Larry McReynolds,He (Wallace) has fire in his eyes and wants go out a a winner.
Larry McReynolds,You have to applaud them for doing something because it has gotten out of control. But it's going to be a tough one to police. It's a ball-or-strike call on what's blatant and what isn't blatant.
Larry McReynolds,"He could step away today. He could wake up tomorrow and say, 'I'm done boys,' and be just fine."
Kyle McSlarrow,"Any government mandates, and certainly for any one of those options (suggested by Martin), in our view is very clearly under Supreme Court precedent a violation of the First Amendment."
Kyle McSlarrow,The notion that the government knows better how to improve on a competitive marketplace is not supported by the evidence.
Kyle McSlarrow,The government must avoid picking winners and losers by imposing regulation based on the particular mix of technology a video provider deploys.
Kyle McSlarrow,It is critical for all providers of video services to be treated on a level playing field. The government should not pick winners and losers in the broadband industry by establishing a different set of rules that favor one provider over another.
Kyle McSlarrow,"We continue to believe that the better course is for the government to resist injecting itself into a thriving, dynamic market where investment and innovation are flourishing."
Kyle McSlarrow,"Such a massive government intrusion into how a broadband service like video is marketed, offered and priced would undoubtedly chill the needed innovation and investment necessary to build out capital intensive networks that rely on the marketplace to determine the most economically effective way to provide a return on investment."
Kyle McSlarrow,"If what we understand is being considered, this is a huge step . . . in the wrong direction. Essentially, you have the government picking winners and losers by giving the Bell monopolies a special break."
Kyle McSlarrow,They're about to have a lot more choices around the corner.
Kyle McSlarrow,A correct analysis concludes that mandated a la carte would be more expensive for consumers and result in less choice and shrinking diversity in cable programming.
Kyle McSlarrow,It is clearly a sweetheart deal for an industry that doesn't deserve a special break and a competitive advantage over anybody.
Kyle McSlarrow,"Government-mandated multi-casting requirements ... would constitute a 'taking' of cable operators' private property, which, in the absence of 'just compensation,' is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment."
Kyle McSlarrow,The government shouldn't regulate the Internet in the absence of a market failure.
Norman McSwain,"My goal was to get out with the knowledge I have ... and get the word out on what was really going on, and try to prevent things like this in the future,"
Norman McSwain,"We need coordinated help from the government,"
Norman McSwain,"The military didn't help; the state government didn't help and the federal government didn't help,"
Norman McSwain,"This is a national disgrace. FEMA has been here three days, yet there is no command and control. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans."
Norman McSwain,"One patient from Charity was being hand-ventilated. That patient was almost dead when he left here,"
Norman McSwain,"There is no food in Charity Hospital. They're eating fruit bowl punch and that's all they've got to eat. There's minimal water,"
James McTeigue,"It became apparent very quickly that he was never going to be comfortable in or make peace with the mask. You spend a long time as an actor learning what to do with your face. It is the big tool that you have, and so are your eyes. When you take that away, it's difficult."
James McTeigue,"It is an allegory. It is about things that have gone on in the past, things that are happening now and things that I am sure will happen in the future. I hope it works as a piece of entertainment and I hope audiences will talk about some of the ideas it discusses and the questions it asks."
James McTeigue,It is a work of fiction. It is a piece of entertainment.
James McTeigue,"She's an amazing actress. You need to believe the journey that character goes on, and I think Natalie lets you really believe it. She's your guide through the narrative. It's really about her presence and her intelligence."
John McTiernan,You see a lot of good ideas or well-written scripts that are bad ideas.
John McTiernan,To find a script that works with provocative ideas is hard to find.
John McTiernan,Thrillers are an enormous amount of fun for filmmakers.
John McTiernan,"They were knowingly false, your honor."
John McTiernan,The entertainment is in the presentation.
John McTiernan,"In a thriller, the camera's an active narrator, or can be."
John McTiernan,"Before I did any action movies, I did a couple of thrillers. That's hung around for me."
Timothy McVeigh,I am sorry these people had to lose their lives. But that's the nature of the beast. It's understood going in what the human toll will be.
Timothy McVeigh,tyrants whose blood had to be spilled to preserve liberty.
Timothy McVeigh,just keep your sense of humor and be yourself.
Timothy McVeigh,is not happy about any of it.
Timothy McVeigh,"funny, cheerful and happy -- but also misguided."
Timothy McVeigh,[Ashcroft urged the news media to exercise] self-restraint ... help him inject more poison into our culture.
Timothy McVeigh,than the average conversation would go.
Timothy McVeigh,"There's a new constellation of circumstances today that didn't exist before, and he will make his decision based upon the circumstances as they exist now."
Timothy McVeigh,"I believe I had anger welling in me,"
Christine McVie,I'm looking more like my dogs every day-it must be the shaggy fringe and the ears.
Christine McVie,"The chemistry was still there. To me, that was the biggest thing: Would the chemistry be there? Can we really go ahead and do this? And it was obvious within the first moment of plugging in the instruments that the magic was still there. It was a fantastic feeling."
Christine McVie,"I enjoy my money, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I'd certainly rather be rich than poor."
Christine McVie,I do like my wine.
Christine McVie,"I find it hard to get excited by just a sound. I have to have a song there, then I'll find what used I can make of that sound within the song."
Christine McVie,"I wasn't raised with money, so I had to get used to having it. I think I've adjusted to it pretty well."
Christine McVie,"I was in Tower Records in San Francisco a few weeks ago, buying some cassettes, and a couple of people recognized me and ran up with albums, and I just wanted to cover my face and have a seizure or something. I want people to just go away."
Christine McVie,"Some of the best songs I've written, I've written in 10 minutes."
Christine McVie,I still like to play the blues more than anything else.
Christine McVie,I haven't turned into some rich monster. I've kept my perspective. But I am a bit spoiled. It's hard not to be a little spoiled by having a lot of money.
Christine McVie,"It really comes down to Mick. He's the one who was constantly trying to get these five people in one room together. This is his love, his baby. It's his band, and there's nothing more he loves to do than get up on stage and play with us."
Christine McVie,My songs are self-explanatory... somebody pointed out to me that... my songs pretty much speak for themselves.
Christine McVie,"For Stevie, the words are of prime importance; the song moves around the words, rather than the words moving around the song."
Christine McVie,"There were a lot of bad feelings when Lindsey first left the band. But there's been a lot of healing going on, growing up, maturing. The bond is a great deal stronger than what we first thought."
Christine McVie,"I couldn't go anywhere unless there was a security guard with me. That spoiled my life. It was like being in captivity. Those days are gone, and I don't ever want to see that happen to me again. Now I can wander around the streets of Los Angeles on my own. I like it that way."
Christine McVie,"I wouldn't think a blues album would be that commercially successful, but I don't really care. I'd do it for the love of blues, not for the money. I've got plenty of money."
Christine McVie,"The old Fleetwood Mac was much better; they did some beautiful and, to my mind, very authentic blues. Chicken Shack did pretty well in Europe, but after I left, it was over."
Christine McVie,There's a whole bunch of unfinished stuff. Then I've got books of lyrics. I find it frustrating to finish a song and not be able to record it... so I don't write a million songs.
Christine McVie,You can only mend the vase so many times before you have to chuck it away.
Christine McVie,"I'm rather old-fashioned about this video business. It's all relatively new. We really don't do videos, Fleetwood Mac. We've only done two."
Christine McVie,I'm looking more like my dogs every day - it must be the shaggy fringe and the ears.
Peter McWilliams,"All the things you think you should have done that you didn't do, and all of the things that you shouldn't have done, accept them. You did (or did not) do them. That's reality. That's happened. No changing the past."
Peter McWilliams,"Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories: We would be more alive if we did more of this, and, Life would be more lovely if we did less of that. Once we get the pain's message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away."
Peter McWilliams,"What's more important-your goal, or others' opinions of your goal."
Peter McWilliams,"Mistakes, obviously, show us what needs improving. Without mistakes, how would we know what we had to work on?"
Peter McWilliams,The value of action is that we make mistakes; mistakes show us what we need to learn.
Peter McWilliams,"Your Master Teacher knows all you need to learn, the perfect timing for your learning it, and the ideal way of teaching it to you. You don't create a Master Teacher / that's already been done. You discover your Master Teacher."
Peter McWilliams,"Marijuana is the finest anti-nausea medication known to science, and our leaders have lied about this consistently. [Arresting people for] medical marijuana is the most hideous example of government interference in the private lives of individuals. It's an outrage within an outrage within an outrage."
Peter McWilliams,"This is our true wealth -- the riches we take with us, the joy we carry inside, the support we learn to give ourselves, and the self-loving that flows as a natural by-product of that support."
Peter McWilliams,Keep your goals away from the trolls.
Peter McWilliams,Feeling right is a strong drug. Some people sacrifice a lot to be right. Ever hear the expression dead right?
Peter McWilliams,Our thoughts create our reality -- where we put our focus is the direction we tend to go.
Peter McWilliams,"All the good, fine, noble, and creative acts of humanity were conceived as a spark in a single human consciousness."
Peter McWilliams,Guilt is anger directed at ourselves.
Peter McWilliams,Anger begins as an inner twinge. We sense something long before it blossoms (explodes?) into an emotional tirade. If we listen to this twinge -- and follow its advice -- the emotional outburst (or in burst) is not needed.
Peter McWilliams,Guilt is anger directed at ourselves -- at what we did or did not do. Resentment is anger directed at others -- at what they did or did not do.
Peter McWilliams,"While goals are chosen, a purpose is discovered. Our purpose is something we have been doing all along, and will continue to do, regardless of circumstances, until the day we die."
Peter McWilliams,"In reality, serendipity accounts for one percent of the blessings we receive in life, work and love. The other 99 percent is due to our efforts."
Peter McWilliams,"The news media are, for the most part, the bringers of bad news... and it's not entirely the media's fault, bad news gets higher ratings and sells more papers than good news."
Peter McWilliams,"I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact, I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble. If you must have it in order to be happy, then you are denying the happiness of the here and now."
Peter McWilliams,"Choosing what you want to do, and when to do it, is an act of creation."
Peter McWilliams,To avoid situations in which you might make mistakes may be the biggest mistake of all.
Peter McWilliams,The road to positivity is strewn with the abandoned vehicles of the faint-hearted.
Peter McWilliams,Do what you love and the necessary resources will follow.
Peter McWilliams,Life is not a struggle. It's a wiggle.
Peter McWilliams,It's your life. Live it with people who are alive. It tends to be contagious.
Peter McWilliams,Comfort zones are most often expanded through discomfort.
Peter McWilliams,"As the world gets dumber and dumber, I feel more and more at home."
Peter McWilliams,Definition of a victim: a person to whom life happens.
Peter McWilliams,"If you change the belief first, changing the action is easier."
Peter McWilliams,"To overcome a fear, here's all you have to do: realize the fear is there, and do the action you fear anyway."
Peter McWilliams,"Nothing adventured, nothing attained."
Peter McWilliams,"We are all, right now, living the life we choose."
Peter McWilliams,"We can consciously end our life almost anytime we choose. This ability is an endowment, like laughing and blushing, given to no other animal... in any given moment, by not exercising the option of suicide, we are choosing to live."
Peter McWilliams,"Fear is something to be moved through, not something to be turned from."
Peter McWilliams,Mistakes show us what we need to learn.
Peter McWilliams,"One of the great joys of life is creativity. Information goes in, gets shuffled about, and comes out in new and interesting ways."
Peter McWilliams,"The media tends to report rumors, speculations, and projections as facts... How does the media do this? By quoting some expert... you can always find some expert who will say something hopelessly hopeless about anything."
Peter McWilliams,"If you're not actively involved in getting what you want, you don't really want it."
Margaret Mead,I was brought up to believe that the only thing worth doing was to add to the sum of accurate information in this world
Margaret Mead,"I do not believe in using women in combat, because females are too fierce"
Margaret Mead,"The negative cautions of science are never popular. If the experimentalist would not commit himself, the social philosopher, the preacher, and the pedagogue tried the harder to give a short-cut answer."
Margaret Mead,I learned the value of hard work by working hard.
Margaret Mead,"The natives are superficially agreeable, but they go in for cannibalism, headhunting, infanticide, incest, avoidance and joking relationships, and biting lice in half with their teeth"
Margaret Mead,"The United States has the power to destroy the world, but not the power to save it alone"
Margaret Mead,"Women want mediocre men, and men are working hard to be as mediocre as possible"
Margaret Mead,"Coming to terms with the rhythms of women's lives means coming to terms with life itself, accepting the imperatives of the body rather than the imperatives of an artificial, man-made, perhaps transcendentally beautiful civilization. Emphasis on the male work-rhythm is an emphasis on infinite possibilities; emphasis on the female rhythms is an emphasis on a defined pattern, on limitation."
Margaret Mead,I've been married three times -- and each time I married the right person.
Margaret Mead,To cherish the life of the world.
Margaret Mead,Human nature is potentially aggressive and destructive and potentially orderly and constructive
Margaret Mead,"Nobody has ever before asked the nuclear family to live all by itself in a box the way we do. With no relatives, no support, we've put in an impossible situation."
Margaret Mead,"Of all the peoples whom I have studied, from city dwellers to cliff dwellers, I always find that at least 50 percent would prefer to have at least one jungle between themselves and their mothers-in-law."
Margaret Mead,I had no reason to doubt that brains were suitable for a woman. And as I had my father's kind of mind-which was also his mother's-I learned that the mind is not sex-typed.
Margaret Mead,"The institution of marriage in all societies is a pattern within which the strains put by civilization on males and females alike must be resolved, a pattern within which men must learn, in return for a variety of elaborate rewards, new forms in which sexual spontaneity is still possible, and women must learn to discipline their receptivity to a thousand other considerations."
Margaret Mead,"Chief among our gains must be reckoned this possibility of choice, the recognition of many possible ways of life, where other civilizations give a satisfactory outlet to only one temperamental type, be he mystic or soldier, businessman or artist, a civilization in which there are many standards offers a possibility of satisfactory adjustment to individuals of many different temperamental types, of diverse gifts, and varying interests."
Margaret Mead,"Some veil between childhood and the present is necessary. If the veil is withdrawn, the artistic  imagination sickens and dies, the prophet looks in the mirror with a disillusioned and cynical sneer, the scientist goes fishing."
Margaret Mead,"When human beings have been fascinated by the contemplation of their own hearts, the more intricate biological pattern of the female has become a model for the artist, the mystic, and the saint. When mankind turns instead to what can be done, altered, built, invented, in the outer world, all natural properties of men, animals, or metals become handicaps to be altered rather than clues to be followed."
Margaret Mead,And when our baby stirs and struggles to be born it compels humility: what we began is now its own.
Margaret Mead,It is an open question whether any behavior based on fear of eternal punishment can be regarded as ethical or should be regarded as merely cowardly
Margaret Mead,"Sooner or later I'm going to die, but I'm not going to retire."
Margaret Mead,The pains of childbirth were altogether different from the enveloping effects of other kinds of pain. These were pains one could follow with one's mind.

Margaret Mead,For the very first time the young are seeing history being made before it is censored by their elders.
Margaret Mead,"Nobody has ever before asked the nuclear family to live all by itself in a box the way we do. With no relatives, no support, we've put it in an impossible situation."

Margaret Mead,I was wise enough to never grow up while fooling most people into believing I had.
Margaret Mead,One of the oldest human needs is having someone to wonder where you are when you don't come home at night.
Margaret Mead,The way to do fieldwork is never to come up for air until it is all over.
Margaret Mead,"A city is a place where there is no need to wait for next week to get the answer to a question, to taste the food of any country, to find new voices to listen to and familiar ones to listen to again."
Margaret Mead,"Man's role is uncertain, undefined, and perhaps unnecessary."
Margaret Mead,"Thanks to television, for the first time the young are seeing history made before it is censored by their elders."
Margaret Mead,The solution to adult problems tomorrow depends on large measure upon how our children grow up today.
Margaret Mead,"Every time we liberate a woman, we liberate a man."
Margaret Mead,"We are now at a point where we must educate our children in what no one knew yesterday, and prepare our schools for what no one knows yet."

Margaret Mead,We have nowhere else to go... this is all we have.
Margaret Mead,"What people say, what people do, and what they say they do are entirely different things."
Margaret Mead,"It is utterly false and cruelly arbitrary to put all the play and learning into childhood, all the work into middle age, and all the regrets into old age."
Margaret Mead,Life in the twentieth century is like a parachute jump: you have to get it right the first time.
Margaret Mead,I must admit that I personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to her or his fellow human beings.
Margaret Mead,Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.
Margaret Mead,"Sister is probably the most competitive relationship within the family, but once the sisters are grown, it becomes the strongest relationship."
Margaret Mead,"Our humanity rests upon a series of learned behaviors, woven together into patterns that are infinitely fragile and never directly inherited."
Margaret Mead,"Prayer does not use up artificial energy, doesn't burn up any fossil fuel, doesn't pollute. Neither does song, neither does love, neither does the dance."
Margaret Mead,"It may be necessary temporarily to accept a lesser evil, but one must never label a necessary evil as good."
Margaret Mead,"People in America, of course, live in all sorts of fashions, because they are foreigners, or unlucky, or depraved, or without ambition; people live like that, but Americans live in white detached houses with green shutters. Rigidly, blindly, the dream takes precedence."
Margaret Mead,Because of their age long training in human relations for that is what feminine intuition really is women have a special contribution to make any group enterprise
Margaret Mead,"Old age is like flying through a storm. Once you're aboard, there's nothing you can do."
Margaret Mead,"If you associate enough with older people who do enjoy their lives, who are not stored away in any golden ghettos, you will gain a sense of continuity and of the possibility for a full life."
Margaret Mead,"If we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in contrasting values, we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities, and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric, one in which each diverse gift will find a fitting place."
Margaret Mead,"Women want mediocre men, and men are working to be as mediocre as possible."
Margaret Mead,"Anthropology demands the open-mindedness with which one must look and listen, record in astonishment and wonder that which one would not have been able to guess."
Margaret Mead,We won't have a society if we destroy the environment.
Margaret Mead,"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."
Margaret Mead,"Fathers are biological necessities, but social accidents."
Margaret Mead,"Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have."
Margaret Mead,"As long as any adult thinks that he, like the parents and teachers of old, can become introspective, invoking his own youth to understand the youth before him, he is lost."
Richie Meade,This has been our pattern. We played extremely well defensively and made just a few mistakes.
Richie Meade,"We made mistakes, but fortunately it's been well advertised that we have Matt Russell. I thought we played a solid game defensively."
Richie Meade,"When the other team only scores three goals, it's always a positive for the defense. I thought we played a solid game defensively, played with confidence."
Richie Meade,"If Army wants to push the ball, we'll push back. If the pace slows and there's a lot of six-on-six, we're fine with that, too."
Richie Meade,I'm sure John Walker is going to play great in his last Army-Navy game.
Richie Meade,"I'm impressed that Army has found a way to win close games, often coming from behind to do so. That shows mental toughness."
Donella Meadows,Scientists worldwide agree that the reduction needed to stabilize the climate is actually more like 80 percent.
Donella Meadows,"You may be able to fool the voters, but not the atmosphere."
Donella Meadows,A knowledgeable and courageous U.S. president could help enormously in leading the world's nations toward saving the climate.
Russell Means,"I don't want to talk about the environment and the American Indian viewpoint, I hate the word Native American. Its a government term, which was created in the year 1970 in the Department of the Interior, a generic term that describes all the prisoners of the United States of America."
Russell Means,Young people and Indian people need to know that we existed in the 20th Century. We need to know who our heroes are and to know what we have done and accomplished in this century other than what Olympic athletes Jim Thorpe and Billy Mills have done.
Russell Means,"In the government schools, which are referred to as public schools, Indian policy has been instituted there, and its a policy where they do not encourage, in fact, discourage, critical thinking and the creation of ideas and public education."
Russell Means,"Indian policy has now been brought down upon the American people, and the American people are the new Indians of the 21st Century."
Russell Means,So Indian policy has become institutionalized and the result has been that American people have become more dependent on government and that the American people have become more dependent on corporations.
Russell Means,Let me go to Clinton's new proposal: to have uniforms in public schools. And people are doing that. How come they're doing that? Dress codes! I find that abhorrent.
Russell Means,I'd like to talk about free markets. Information in the computer age is the last genuine free market left on earth except those free markets where indigenous people are still surviving. And that's basically becoming limited.
Rocco Mediate,I'm very pleased. I would have been happy with 74 to tell you the truth.
Rocco Mediate,"It doesn't favor the long hitter. The fairways are so much narrower and they are so much more trouble that if they hit it off-line, they have got problems."
Rocco Mediate,"Rocco always knew what he wanted from the start, ... Sure, it's hard to watch him struggle, but I don't worry about him because he's going to do it. I have that much faith in him."
Rocco Mediate,"I remember taking a couple swings on the practice range and seeing Jim look at my dad and say, 'Are you sure you want me to teach him?'"
Rocco Mediate,They don't mess around and make a lot of mistakes around here. Maybe they didn't see this coming.
Rocco Mediate,"[The $147,000 Mediate won last weekend vaulted him into the top 30 on the 2003 PGA Tour Money Leaders list, which, if he stays there, would earn him a spot in the season-ending Tour Championship in November. That's a goal, he said, but his recent good play has him aiming slightly higher.] I'm getting closer to the winning thing, ... Earlier in the year, everybody was asking, 'What's wrong?' I had a period from March through June where my body just wasn't feeling that good. You can't come out here at 50 percent and beat the best. This week was fun, finally, again. It was almost really good."
Rocco Mediate,"He's got an absolutely marvelous golf swing. He's one of our best, by far. He's very calm, very calm. And he's not going anywhere."
Rocco Mediate,There's no green jackets hanging in the trees. Just play golf.
Rocco Mediate,I haven't played a lot of golf and I've been hurt.
Rocco Mediate,"All I do is play golf better than some of the people in the United States. Other than that, I'm nothing special."
Rocco Mediate,"Oh, I can play when I can play. I mean, the only time I can't play good golf is when my body won't let me."
Rocco Mediate,"An absolutely marvelous golf swing, one of our best by far, and tremendous striker of the golf ball. I like seeing that because it gets me trying to do the same thing. But he's calm, very calm."
Rocco Mediate,It's the best 71 holes of golf I've ever played.
Rocco Mediate,"An absolute marvelous golf swing, one of our best by far. I like seeing that because it gets me trying to do the same thing. He's very, very calm. He's not going anywhere, that guy. He's really, really good."
Rocco Mediate,"What Joe and Maggie Hardy have done for golf in Western Pennsylvania is unbelievable,"
Rocco Mediate,"But I have to do something real special these last 32 holes to win this golf tournament. Some other guys, even though they're behind me right now, just have to play well. I have to do more than that."
Rocco Mediate,"Really, seriously, I thought I was going to win this golf tournament making that turn."
Rocco Mediate,"I have to do something real special the next 33 holes to win this golf tournament. Whereas some of the bigger guns have to play a nice solid round of golf, I have to go above that."
Rocco Mediate,"It looked like something crazy might happen. But then, a lot of funny things started happening."
Rocco Mediate,It would be nice to see this place with some fire in it. It has been so soaked and wet. The course is built for speed. Hopefully it will be fast and firm and the greens will be bricks.
Rocco Mediate,"Excuse me, son, what do you think you're doing?"
Rocco Mediate,"I always thought I was in reasonable shape, although I knew I could be better, ... The doctors told me, and I knew it before they said anything, that I needed to get in the best shape I could to take stress off my back."
Rocco Mediate,I just said this to Tiger yesterday. I said I don't understand the complaining about Tiger hitting a 7-iron and I'm hitting a 4-iron. He's a million times stronger than me and hits it 50 yards further. What's wrong with that? The strong ones are always going to be the longest guys. That's just how it is. I don't have a problem with that.
Rocco Mediate,"My body actually did what I asked it today, and it better keep listening. It's fun to come to this major with some semblance of a clue of what is going on with my golf swing."
Rocco Mediate,"My body actually did what I asked it today, and it better keep listening. I was very excited to play this week because I knew I was striking the ball the way I used to and my body is feeling a lot better. It's going to be fun to come to this major with some semblance of a clue on what was going on with my golf swing."
Rocco Mediate,"I haven't played well at all. I've had a couple good events in two years. That's all body-related, not golf-swing or golf-game related, because otherwise I probably could have killed myself by now."
Rocco Mediate,"I've been hurt. When your body goes away, you can't do anything with the golf club. Even if you can do partial things, you've got to come play these guys. That's the killer."
Eliseo Medina,"We march in the streets, but we will also march to the voting booth in November."
Eliseo Medina,We are going to need more people to take care of older people. Nursing homes and assisted living is going to be huge in terms of the need for workers.
Eliseo Medina,"But right now, we are seeing hundreds of leaders coming together. Many of them are people nobody had ever heard of. This organic organization will outlive any one charismatic figure."
Marty Meehan,"The cleanest way to have an election is to have money that doesn't come from special interests, ... In the long run it's a much better system. The system is better served if you put limits on what people can spend."
Marty Meehan,"The leadership of both houses of Congress are now operating under a cloud of scandal, impropriety, and the possibility of illegality,"
Marty Meehan,"The relationship between Congress and K Street has gotten too close and too cozy, ... The opportunity for reform is now."
Marty Meehan,"We can't get fair decisions made on the merits of any of the issues before us in Congress as long as we have this soft money system,"
Marty Meehan,"It's a tempting response to the problems baseball has right now. It feeds into anger and frustration that fans have about the potential of losing their teams, ... But I don't believe that taking away the antitrust exemption will solve this problem and it could make it worse. I don't see how triggering a antitrust litigation free-for-all...really solves anything."
Kendrick Meek,"President Bush's economic policies have failed Florida, ... His corporate buddies have shipped 70,000 Floridian manufacturing jobs overseas, and now it's time for Mr. Bush to get the pink slip."

Kendrick Meek,Florida has seen empty promises on education before.
Kendrick Meek,"We need to call out some of these contractors that have been abusive, ... People are very frustrated throughout the country by story after story of contractors taking advantage of the American taxpayer."
Kendrick Meek,"The confidence of our nation was shaken by the slowness and inadequacy of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, ... a concerted effort to make certain that the tax dollars we appropriate actually help the victims and does not generate quick profits to big contractors."
Mary Meeker,It isn't uncommon this time of year for prices of technology stocks to contract when catalysts are insufficient.
Mary Meeker,The rapid growth in headcount bears watching.
Mary Meeker,The reality here is we're dealing with a market environment that was overheated.
Mary Meeker,"The beauty or scary thing about Yahoo! (depending on your perspective), is that is has created this big ... base (and database) of users -- more and more of them keep going to the site a lot, they keep doing things with Yahoo!'s integrated sets of services and the users become dependent on the site and services and they don't pay a cent for them."
Lindsay Meggs,His performance was important because it allowed us to rest our pen and use those guys in the second game.
Lindsay Meggs,We needed to win the game.
Lindsay Meggs,The rain throws everybody out of their routine. Baseball is meant to be played in dry and warm weather.
Deepa Mehta,To make WATER was akin to climbing Everest; a hard journey. But where to go from there? Having Fox Searchlight distribute the film in the U.S. is like finding a stairway to Heaven. I couldn't be more pleased.
Deepa Mehta,To make 'Water' was akin to climbing Everest; a hard journey. But where to go from there? Having Fox Searchlight distribute the film in the U.S. is like finding a stairway to Heaven. I couldn't be more pleased.
Deepa Mehta,To make 'Water' was akin to climbing Mount Everest -- a hard journey.
Deepa Mehta,"Honesty for me works,"
Deepa Mehta,Honestly it is of no consequence to me. My film has some of the loveliest performances I have seen. John Abraham and Lisa Ray will be right up there with the hottest Hollywood men and women after Water.
Deepa Mehta,"It's rather simplistic but that's what it is: That there is room for redemption and hope, however grim things are; that the human spirit does have that ability to do something that is selfless, even under the most horrendous circumstances."
Deepa Mehta,It makes them feel good. It makes them feel like they belong in Canada -- and it's not just lip service.
Deepa Mehta,The strength only came later. That was the conviction of a filmmaker. The strength came from my belief in the script.
Richard Meier,An important work of architecture will create polemics.
Richard Meier,It is a very significant project for the city that will demonstrate Rome's ability to move into the 21st century so people should care deeply about it.
Richard Meier,Rome has not seen a modern building in more than half a century. It is a city frozen in time.
Andrew Mellon,"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers."
Andrew Mellon,A nation is not in danger of financial disaster merely because it owes itself money

Herman Melville,"All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys"
Herman Melville,"How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg -- a cozy, loving pair."
Herman Melville,"The beauty myth moves for men as a mirage; its power lies in its ever-receding nature. When the gap is closed, the lover embraces only his own disillusion."
Herman Melville,". . . these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang."
Herman Melville,Is there some principal of nature which states that we never know the quality of what we have until it is gone?
Herman Melville,Yet habit - strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?
Herman Melville,"Truth is the silliest thing under the sun. Try to get a living by the Truth and go to the Soup Societies. Heavens! Let any clergyman try to preach the Truth from its very stronghold, the pulpit, and they would ride him out of his church on his own pulpit bannister."
Herman Melville,"Toil is man's allotment; toil of brain, or toil of hands, or a grief that's more than either, the grief and sin of idleness."
Herman Melville,"To be hated cordially, is only a left-handed compliment."
Herman Melville,"There is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath."
Herman Melville,"There is a touch of divinity even in brutes, and a special halo about a horse, that should forever exempt him from indignities."
Herman Melville,"There are times when even the most potent governor must wink at transgression, in order to preserve the laws inviolate for the future."
Herman Melville,"There are some persons in this world, who, unable to give better proof of being wise, take a strange delight in showing what they think they have sagaciously read in mankind by uncharitable suspicions of them."
Herman Melville,"Truth is in things, and not in words."
Herman Melville,It is impossible to talk or to write without apparently throwing oneself helplessly open.
Herman Melville,"To be called one thing, is oftentimes to be another."

Herman Melville,"Heaven have mercy on us all - Presbyterians and Pagans alike - for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending."
Herman Melville,"Let us speak, though we show all our faults and weaknesses, - for it is a sign of strength to be weak, to know it, and out with it - not in a set way and ostentatiously, though, but incidentally and without premeditation."
Herman Melville,"The march of conquest through wild provinces, may be the march of Mind; but not the march of Love."
Herman Melville,"At sea a fellow comes out. Salt water is like wine, in that respect."
Herman Melville,"There is sorrow in the world, but goodness too; and goodness that is not greenness, either, no more than sorrow is."
Herman Melville,"Where do murderers go, man! Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?"
Herman Melville,A man thinks that by mouthing hard words he understands hard things.
Herman Melville,"There is something wrong about the man who wants help. There is somewhere a deep defect, a want, in brief, a need, a crying need, somewhere about that man."
Herman Melville,A whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.
Herman Melville,"He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it."
Herman Melville,"In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers."
Herman Melville,"Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope."
Herman Melville,Art is the objectification of feeling.
Herman Melville,It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
Herman Melville,"Some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged."
Herman Melville,There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method.
Herman Melville,It is not down in any map; true places never are.
Herman Melville,"To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be that have tried it."
Herman Melville,"Friendship at first sight, like love at first sight, is said to be the only truth."
Herman Melville,"There is nothing namable but that some men will, or undertake to, do it for pay."
Herman Melville,Truth uncompromisingly told will always have its ragged edges.

Herman Melville,There are hardly five critics in America; and several of them are asleep.
Herman Melville,"Know, thou, that the lines that live are turned out of a furrowed brow."
Herman Melville,"Hope is the struggle of the soul, breaking loose from what is perishable, and attesting her eternity."
Herman Melville,"He who has never failed somewhere, that man can not be great."
Herman Melville,A smile is the chosen vehicle of all ambiguities.
Herman Melville,They talk of the dignity of work. The dignity is in leisure.
Herman Melville,There is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself.
Herman Melville,"Let America first praise mediocrity even, in her children, before she praises... the best excellence in the children of any other land."
Herman Melville,"We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men; and among those fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as courses, and they come back to us as effects."

Carlos Mencia,I have little compassion for people in trailer parks who refuse tomove after getting tornado warnings. How hard is it for them torelocate? Their house have wheels.
Carlos Mencia,"I am a product. . . . I'm a comedian. I'm not curing cancer. In the end, I tell jokes. I make people laugh. I make sense out of ridiculous situations, but in the end, it's all about laughter. It's all about your cheek hurting, your stomach hurting."
Carlos Mencia,"God has a sense of humor. If you don't believe me, tomorrow go to wal-mart and just look at people."

Mencius Mencius,There is no greater delight than to be conscious of sincerity on self-examination.
Mencius Mencius,"We live, not as we wish to, but as we can."
Mencius Mencius,"Evil exists to glorify the good. Evil is negative good. It is a relative term. Evil can be transmuted into good. What is evil to one at one time, becomes good at another time to somebody else."

Mencius Mencius,Friendship is one mind in two bodies.
Mencius Mencius,It is not difficult to govern. All one has to do is not to offend the noble families.

H.L. Mencken,It is hard to believe that a man is telling the truth when you know that you would lie if you were in his place.
H.L. Mencken,The truth that survives is simply the lie that is pleasantest to believe
H.L. Mencken,I believe that it is better to tell the truth than a lie. I believe it is better to be free than to be a slave. And I believe it is better to know than to be ignorant.
H.L. Mencken,If women believed in their husbands they would be a good deal happier and also a good deal more foolish.
H.L. Mencken,"Time stays, we go."
H.L. Mencken,"The truth is that the average schoolmaster, on all the lower levels, is and always must be essentially and next door to an idiot, for how can one imagine an intelligent man engaging in so puerile an avocation?"
H.L. Mencken,"Unquestionably, there is progress. The average American now pays twice as much in taxes as he formerly got in wages."
H.L. Mencken,"How little it takes to make life unbearable: a pebble in the shoe, a cockroach in the spaghetti, a woman's laugh."
H.L. Mencken,"Before a man speaks, it is always safe to assume that he is a fool. After he speaks it is seldom necessary to assume."
H.L. Mencken,Love is the delusion that one man or woman differs from another.
H.L. Mencken,Remorse is regret that one waited so long to do it
H.L. Mencken,"After all, all he did was string together a lot of old, well-known quotations."
H.L. Mencken,"Unionism, seldom if ever, uses such powers as it has to ensure better work; almost always it devotes a large part of that power to safeguard bad work."
H.L. Mencken,"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."
H.L. Mencken,Women have simple tastes. They get pleasure out of the conversation of children in arms and men in love.
H.L. Mencken,The average man does not get pleasure out of an idea because he thinks it is true; he thinks it is true because he gets pleasure out of it.
H.L. Mencken,"Philosophy consists very largely of one philosopher arguing that all other philosophers are jackasses. He usually proves it, and I should add that he also usually proves that he is one himself."
H.L. Mencken,There is no record in history of a happy philosopher.
H.L. Mencken,"Philosophy consists very largely of one philosopher arguing that all others are jackasses. He usually proves it, and I should add that he also usually proves that he is one himself."
H.L. Mencken,"Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it."
H.L. Mencken,"Nothing is more patent, indeed, than the fact that charity merely converts the unfit - who, in the course of nature, would soon die out and so cease to encumber the earth - into parasites - who live on indefinitely, a nuisance and a burden to their b"
H.L. Mencken,Nature abhors a moron
H.L. Mencken,Time is the great equalizer in the field of morals.
H.L. Mencken,"Morality is the theory that every human act must be either right or wrong, and that 99 % of them are wrong."
H.L. Mencken,"The difference between a moral man and a man of honor is that the latter regrets a discreditable act, even when it has worked and he has not been caught."
H.L. Mencken,"All human progress, even in morals, has been the work of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have whooped them up and tried to enforce them."
H.L. Mencken,"On one issue, at least, men and women agree: they both distrust women"

H.L. Mencken,"Marriage is a wonderful institution, but who would want to live in an institution?"
H.L. Mencken,Whenever a husband and wife begin to discuss their marriage they are giving evidence at a coroner's inquest.
H.L. Mencken,"If I ever marry it will be on a sudden impulse, as a man shoots himself."
H.L. Mencken,"For it is mutual trust, even more than mutual interest that holds human associations together. Our friends seldom profit us but they make us feel safe. Marriage is a scheme to accomplish exactly that same end."
H.L. Mencken,The truth that survives is simply the lie that is pleasantest to believe.
H.L. Mencken,"Lying is not only excusable; it is not only innocent; it is, above all, necessary and unavoidable. Without the ameliorations that it offers, life would become a mere syllogism and hence too metallic to be borne."
H.L. Mencken,I believe in only one thing: liberty; but I do not believe in liberty enough to want to force it upon anyone.
H.L. Mencken,"Most people want security in this world, not liberty."
H.L. Mencken,"The idea that leisure is of value in itself is only conditionally true. The average man simply spends his leisure as a dog spends it. His recreations are all puerile, and the time supposed to benefit him really only stupefies him."
H.L. Mencken,It doesn't take a majority to make a rebellion; it takes only a few determined leaders and a sound cause.
H.L. Mencken,"Say what you will about the Ten Commandments, you must always come back to the pleasant fact that there are only ten of them."
H.L. Mencken,A judge is a law student who grades his own papers.
H.L. Mencken,One horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms. It is not only more effective; it is also vastly more intelligent.
H.L. Mencken,But I wonder where we will land if trial Judges begin deciding that the fact that a man has committed an atrocious crime is proof sufficient that he is not responsible for his acts
H.L. Mencken,"We are here and it is now. Further than that, all human knowledge is moonshine."
H.L. Mencken,When women kiss it always reminds one of prize-fighters shaking hands.
H.L. Mencken,Injustice is relatively easy to bear what stings is justice.
H.L. Mencken,"If you want peace, work for justice."
H.L. Mencken,"It is impossible to imagine the universe run by a wise, just and omnipotent God, but it is quite easy to imagine it run by a board of gods. If such a board actually exists it operates precisely like the board of a corporation that is losing money."
H.L. Mencken,We suffer most when the White House busts with ideas
H.L. Mencken,It seems to me that a great university ought to have room in it for men subscribing to every sort of idea that is currently prevalent
H.L. Mencken,"Strike an average between what a woman thinks of her husband a month before she marries him and what she thinks of him a year afterward, and you will have the truth about him."

H.L. Mencken,We must be willing to pay a price for freedom.
H.L. Mencken,The most costly of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not true. It is the chief occupation of mankind.
H.L. Mencken,"The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one  spends most of one's time defending scoundrels.  For it  is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed,  and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is  to be stopped at"
H.L. Mencken,"Puritanism:  The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy"
H.L. Mencken,To expect defeat is nine-tenths of defeat itself.
H.L. Mencken,"School days, I believe, are the unhappiest in the whole span of human existence."

H.L. Mencken,"During many a single week, I daresay, more money is spent in New York upon useless and evil things than would suffice to run the kingdom of Denmark for a year"
H.L. Mencken,The comfortable estate of widowhood is the only hope that keeps up a wife's spirits.
H.L. Mencken,"The one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fear - fear of the unknown, the complex, the inexplicable. What he wants above everything else is safety."
H.L. Mencken,"The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all; it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed a standard citizenry, to put down dissent and originality"
H.L. Mencken,The ideal way to get rid of any infectious disease would be to shoot instantly every person who comes down with it
H.L. Mencken,"The world always makes the assumption that the exposure of an error is identical with the discovery of truth--that the error and truth are simply opposite.  They are nothing of the sort.  What the world turns to, when it is cured on one error, is usu"
H.L. Mencken,A man loses his sense of direction after four drinks; a woman loses hers after four kisses
H.L. Mencken,The cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy.
H.L. Mencken,"I confess I enjoy democracy immensely. It is incomparably idiotic, and hence incomparably amusing."
H.L. Mencken,"Democracy is the theory that the common people know what They want, and deserve to get it good and hard."
H.L. Mencken,"Democracy is based upon so childish a complex of fallacies that they must be protected by a rigid system of taboos, else even half-wits would argue it to pieces"
H.L. Mencken,Democracy is also a form of worship. It is the worship of Jackals by Jackasses.

H.L. Mencken,Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.
H.L. Mencken,The essence of a self-reliant and autonomous culture is an unshakeable egoism.
H.L. Mencken,"It is impossible to think of a man of any actual force and originality, universally recognized as having those qualities, who spent his whole life appraising and describing the work of other men."
H.L. Mencken,Criticism is prejudice made plausible.
H.L. Mencken,The common argument that crime is caused by poverty is a kind of slander on the poor.

H.L. Mencken,The way for newspapers to meet the competition of radio and television is simply to get out better papers
H.L. Mencken,"School days are the unhappiest in the whole span if human existence. They are full of dull, unintelligible tasks, new and unpleasant ordinances, with brutal violations of common sense and common decency."

H.L. Mencken,Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable.
H.L. Mencken,The chief value of money lies in the fact that one lives in a world in which it is overestimated.
H.L. Mencken,"Each party steals so many articles of faith from the other, and the candidates spend so much time making each other's speeches, that by the time election day is past there is nothing much to do save turn the sitting rascals out and let a new gang in."
H.L. Mencken,"Democracy is only a dream: it should be put in the same category as Arcadia, Santa Claus, and Heaven."

H.L. Mencken,Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage.
H.L. Mencken,All men are frauds. The only difference between them is that some admit it. I myself deny it.
H.L. Mencken,I never smoked a cigarette until I was nine.
H.L. Mencken,"It is inaccurate to say that I hate everything. I am strongly in favor of common sense, common honesty, and common decency. This makes me forever ineligible for public office."
H.L. Mencken,"A man always remembers his first love with special tenderness, but after that he begins to bunch them."
H.L. Mencken,The only really happy folk are married women and single men.
H.L. Mencken,"No matter how happily a woman may be married, it always pleases her to discover that there is a nice man who wishes that she were not."
H.L. Mencken,"On one issue at least, men and women agree; they both distrust women."
H.L. Mencken,Old age ain't no place for sissies.

John Mendel,"Judging by the vanity plates in California - 'Saving More,' 'Low Mileage' - hybrid is a badge of honor that people want to wear. Hydrogen is the path to the future. But, on the way to hydrogen, hybrid is an alternative."
John Mendel,"For 2006, the Civic underwent the most radical transformation in its 33-year history. It is a cornerstone of the Honda lineup, and we're delighted that Motor Trend has recognized the new levels of styling, performance, technology, safety and value that characterize the new Civic. Customers have validated our direction too, as evidenced by strong sales of the new model."
John Mendel,"I believe it's constantly good to be paranoid. If I'm not worried about Toyota (Motor Corp.) or the Koreans, I'm worried about the Chinese. I think that sets up a pretty good framework for how you need to operate."
Lee Mendelson,It was a hit because of the morals and humor of a great Midwestern guy.
Lee Mendelson,I've always said that the reason 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' is a classic is because it reflects the Midwest values that Charles Schulz grew up with.
Lee Mendelson,"Charlie Brown's message, decrying the commercialization of Christmas, is even more relevant today than it was in 1965."
Lee Mendelson,We felt the show was too slow and wouldn't resonate with any segment of the audience. Even our choice of music was questionable at the time.
Lee Mendelson,Sparky liked it from the beginning.
Felix Mendelssohn,"Though everything else may appear shallow and repulsive, even the smallest task in music is so absorbing, and carries us so far away from town, country, earth, and all worldly things, that it is truly a blessed gift of God."
Felix Mendelssohn,"People often complain that music is too ambiguous, that what they should think when they hear it is so unclear, whereas everyone understands words. With me, it is exactly the opposite, and not only with regard to an entire speech but also with individual words."
Felix Mendelssohn,"Ever since I began to compose, I have remained true to my starting principle: not to write a page because no matter what public, or what pretty girl wanted it to be thus or thus; but to write solely as I myself thought best, and as it gave me pleasure."
Felix Mendelssohn,"These seem to me so ambiguous, so vague, so easily misunderstood in comparison to genuine music, which fills the soul with a thousand things better than words."
Bronco Mendenhall,It was a gratifying victory. We executed to the highest level that we have all year. We still have a long way to go but we're making significant strides.
Bronco Mendenhall,"There's no way to know what to expect. It's far greater than that, it's a tremendous responsibility. I'm amazed daily with what it requires, but I'm grateful and humbled with the opportunity."
Bronco Mendenhall,I'm not sure you mess with principles like that.
Bronco Mendenhall,They can come to practice and see if what we're telling them about the program is for real.
Bronco Mendenhall,It was a mistake. I wouldn't do it again like that.
Bronco Mendenhall,"It was about our improvement,"
Bronco Mendenhall,We did not recruit potential. We recruited players that play hard right now.
Bronco Mendenhall,"It's opened my eyes,"
Bronco Mendenhall,"The linebackers we felt before spring were talented enough and had enough leadership and experience to make sure we had enough of them on the field. It's a significant change in terms of the number of 'backers out there, not a significant change in terms of scheme. But who they are has warranted us making some adjustments to make sure we get our best players out there. There's tremendous competition, depth and talent at that position. That's why we're featuring those players in our defense this year."
Bronco Mendenhall,"[Mendenhall also acknowledged that TCU has better overall team speed.] The clear way to beat speed is with execution based on tendencies, ... I want our football team to play fast on Saturday. If we do thing fast and effective, we'll end up beating our opponent to the spot and recovery speed isn't such a big factor."
Bronco Mendenhall,We have plenty to improve on. We didn't do our part as it relates to execution and that ultimately was it today.
Bronco Mendenhall,"Is there one vision, is there one focus, is there one execution standard? Absolutely,"
Bronco Mendenhall,"We have an immediate need on special teams. As we evaluated our special teams, we determined it was important to find an experienced deep snapper. Matthew will help us fill that need."
Bronco Mendenhall,"There's been some criticism for that game,"
Bronco Mendenhall,"Once you have a symbol that reflects greatness, it should not be changed, ... Consistency is key to a lasting tradition."
Bronco Mendenhall,He's bringing consistency and he's bringing in simplicity and he's bringing in a mind-set of staying the course. You're not seeing an offense that's maybe as variable from week to week.
Bronco Mendenhall,I'm extremely excited about this class. The first word that comes to my mind is character.
Bronco Mendenhall,I think we're progressing well. We're seeing the balls caught in front of the secondary and they have leverage. Now we need to work on finishing and tackling at a higher level.
Bronco Mendenhall,It's designed to show appreciation for what they have done for the program and to give them a chance to have nothing asked of them but to enjoy the day.
Bronco Mendenhall,"We should get about 60 plays, and everyone will play. We want to make sure everyone gets some action."
Bronco Mendenhall,"Their quarterback last year was very mobile with a lot of bootleg and play action, and very difficult to keep in the pocket. This quarterback's mobility isn't the same, but [he has] experience. We're preparing for him as if he were a returning starter. I think he's capable of leading their team, within the scheme they use, at a very high level."
Sam Mendes,"There is an immense, childlike enthusiasm about the man. It's inspiring when you work with a 77-year-old man who has that kind of love and excitement still in him about what he does. And like Paul Newman, each day is like the first day of his career."
Sam Mendes,I play a lot of cricket.
Sam Mendes,"I'm from the theater, where the process of creating a character from the ground up is something that's not imposed on him. We started working on it months in advance, and we rehearsed for two weeks, and even the look of his apartment came out of discussions with him and the production designer."
Sam Mendes,Thank God I don't live in Los Angeles. I think if you're there the whole time it just gets out of proportion and you lose touch completely with reality.
Sam Mendes,"You make the movies for audiences. You get as many people to see the movie as possible. You do not make them for Academy voters. There are only 6,000 and me. It's going to get at least one vote. I'll vote across the board for my movie."

Karl A. Menninger,"One does not fall in love; one grows into love, and love grows in him."
Karl A. Menninger,The voice of the intelligence is drowned out by the roar of fear. It is ignored by the voice of desire. It is contradicted by the voice of shame. It is biased by hate and extinguished by anger. Most of all it is silenced by ignorance.

Robert Menzies,"A man may be a tough, concentrated, successful money-maker and never contribute to his country anything more than a horrible example. A manager may be tough and practical, squeezing out, while the going is good, the last ounce of profit and dividend, and may leave behind him an exhausted industry and a legacy of industrial hatred. A tough manager may never look outside his own factory walls or be conscious of his partnership in a wider world. I often wonder what strange cud such men sit chewing when their working days are over, and the accumulating riches of the mind have eluded them."
Robert Menzies,"Men of genius are not to be analyzed by commonplace rules. The rest of us who have been or are leaders, more commonplace in our quality, will do well to remember two things. One is never to forget posterity when devising a policy. The other is never to think of posterity when making a speech."
Robert Menzies,You don't have a democracy. It's a photocracy.
Robert Menzies,It is a simple but sometimes forgotten truth that the greatest enemy to present joy and high hopes is the cultivation of retrospective bitterness.

John Mercer,Those four are the best recruiting class we've had since we've been here. They're going to do nothing but get better and we're excited to see where they take us in the future.
Larry Merchant,"I haven't seen Johnson enough in the past to know, but he's a guy who's fought all these years, 16 years, finally gets a title, he's fighting for his biggest payday, he's still fighting back in occasional flurries, just as Jimmy Garcia did when he fought Gabe Ruelas. So he was still fighting back, Every time he went back to the corner he seemed to be going slower and slower. In fact I did mention after the eighth, ninth round that he sorta wobbled onto his stool. So the signs were there and it's in the hands of the referee."
Larry Merchant,There are too many governing bodies. They're all corrupt. I think they have replaced the old Mobsters with the kind of 'corporate rule' of boxing.

Suzy Merchant,I think every kid on our team was in foul trouble. That was disappointing.
Suzy Merchant,I think Ryan and Nikki (Knapp) did a great job of being leaders tonight. They kind of rode Carrie Moore there down the stretch.

Thomas Merton,"I am willing to admit that some people might live there for years, or even a lifetime, so protected that they never sense the sweet stench of corruption that is all around them -- the keen, thin scent of decay that pervades everything and accuses with a terrible accusation the superficial youthfulness, the abounding undergraduate noise, that fills those ancient buildings."

Mark Messier,"I went to New York with one thing in mind, to win a Stanley Cup, ... When the time came, Glen Sather asked me where I wanted to go and I said I'd like to go to New York and win a Stanley Cup. He was able to make it happen."
Mark Messier,"Having lived in New York for 10-plus years, it becomes a part of you, ... I love the city and I love the team and what we were able to do. Obviously, that's a good fit for me."
Mark Messier,I don't know that I ever really considered it. I was definitely open to listening to his offers but I knew in my heart that if I was going to play it was going to be in New York.
Mark Messier,"It's not easy winning or leading a team sport because there are so many different agendas and individuality, ... I feel lucky to have been part of some of the best hockey ever played [in Edmonton] and to be part of a team [in New York] that was willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the team."
Mark Messier,I knew all the past history of the teams in New York ... but I don't think anything can really prepare you for going to play in New York until you get there. I felt that I was fairly confident in what it took to win a Stanley Cup.
Mark Messier,"I came here wanting to win the Stanley Cup and what I got was a life experience. I learned more about life coming here and seeing there were more important things than just playing hockey. That was sharing in the compassion and the overall care and sincerity of the people of New York. That changed not only my life, but the life of my whole family."
Mark Messier,"When you experience something like we did here, there's no introduction or uneasiness when you get back together. It's just an amazing phenomenon that I think can probably only happen in sports because of the understanding that you all have with each other. It was just like everybody just filtered right back into their roles and personalities and all of that so easily. Because of it, it was just a real comfortable, easygoing time. ... It was just awesome. Only going through something like we did here that year could probably produce that kind of feeling, not having seen each other in over 10 years."
Mark Messier,"It's been an unbelievable experience playing in New York and to do the things, after the success we had in Edmonton to come here and have success in New York, it was a dream come true. I came here wanting to win the Stanley Cup, and what I got was a life of experience."
Mark Messier,"I'll go to my grave with the feelings and emotions and the memories of 1994, ... When I was traded from Edmonton, I told my agent that I wanted to go to New York to help them win a Stanley Cup. We had a great team and 1994 was a magical year for us and the city."
Mark Messier,That process in itself was an education for me.
Mark Messier,"It's just a testimony to the commitment that we had to each other for them to be able to show up here. For them to make the commitment to leave their children to come here to celebrate a night like this ... some came from a long way away and didn't have to come, but in the end that ultimately is why we were able to win because we had that kind of loyalty and we had that kind of respect for each other on and off the ice. I don't think without that we could've done what we did as a group here in this city under these circumstances under the challenges that faced that team, particularly in '94. [There was] unbelievable character in that dressing room. That was the only reason we were able to win."
Mark Messier,"He was a coach, GM, mentor, father, just about anything you can think of. Other than my dad, nobody has been behind me more and did more for me as a person and a player."
Mark Messier,My jersey hanging from the ceiling is going to be a symbol of the hard work of the people I played with.
Mark Messier,He earned the respect and admiration of all the people here in New York.
Mark Messier,"his emotion and his compassion for the game. Inside of all those things, there was his ability to excel and his expectations to win. But it was always on a team level, it was never the expectation to go out and score three goals when the score was 7-1. Mark was the kind of guy who always seemed to excel when it was a 2-1 game or a 3-2 game."
Jim Messina,"It's been great from the start, but I'm realizing that the music has just gotten tighter the more we play together,"

Thanks to the entire team, we have a strong slate for the rest of 2006 and well into 2007."

Urban Meyer,"I think college football is one of the unique sports where people share their information. I don't really understand that either.

Urban Meyer,"I feel very good about the work ethic and I feel good about the character of it. Now there are some fundamental issues where we've got to get a lot better.

On offense we're not at all, so we'll have to evaluate that."

Kweisi Mfume,"When the television-viewing public sits down to watch the new prime-time shows scheduled for this fallâ€™s lineup,"
Kweisi Mfume,"a society 200-plus years beyond its own revolution, that has failed to come to grips with the issue of race."
Kweisi Mfume,"It's been a special kind of relationship, and in a special way, I think it's spoken volumes to the rest of America, the bulwark of American democracy."
Kweisi Mfume,so let me put that to rest.
Kweisi Mfume,"This issue is crying out for advocates, ... and we expect advocacy from the White House and the Justice Department."
Kweisi Mfume,"I should point out that this does not constitute an official meeting with the NAACP, ... I do hope, however, that it begins the process for future dialogue with the NAACP."
Kweisi Mfume,"I think we've reached a point in our history as a people and as a nation that we've almost come full circle,"
Kweisi Mfume,"Little Richard has distinguished himself as not only an unparalleled musical genius, but also as a unique and innovative performing artist -- fusing pure vocal talent with exhilarating showmanship,"
Kweisi Mfume,"exacerbated when there is an excessive use of force by the police. I'm appealing, quite frankly, to those persons who are very angry, to hold their anger a little longer, until we're able to bring a little justice here."
Kweisi Mfume,"I was there when your officers opened fire after the funeral, ... So, I'm not ill-informed."
Kweisi Mfume,"While the eyes of the nation are on Washington, and on this inauguration, we've come back to Florida to say that we remember and we must not ever forget. These two events, simultaneously and noteworthy, produce for us an interesting juxtaposition. The contrast hearkens our attention to the need for a nationwide uniform system for casting ballots and counting ballots that's the same -- no matter what state you're in, no matter what you might look like, no matter what the election is."
Kweisi Mfume,"And it really gets down to an issue of class. The poor and the poorest of the poor tend to be the ones that are being missed by the census,"
Kweisi Mfume,"Their anger is justified, ... Their feelings of frustration are justified. We have an obligation to listen so that we don't repeat [this] situation in communities all across this nation."
George Michael,It's absolutely essential that we have the same safeguards that straight couples do. But I want more than a 50 percent chance of success. I don't want to emulate that.

George Michael,You'll never find peace of mind until you listen to your heart.
Duane Michals,Trust that little voice in your head that says Wouldn't it be interesting if..; And then do it.
Duane Michals,Think photographs should be provocative and not tell you what you already know. It takes no great powers or magic to reproduce somebody's face in a photograph. The magic is in seeing people in new ways.
Duane Michals,"How foolish of me to believe that it would be that easy. I had confused the appearance of trees and automobiles, and people with a reality itself, and believed that a photograph of these appearances to be a photograph of it. It is a melancholy truth that I will never be able to photograph it and can only fail. I am a reflection photographing other reflections within a reflection. To photograph reality is to photograph nothing."
Duane Michals,"Photography deals exquisitely with appearances, but nothing is what it appears to be."
Duane Michals,Trust that little voice in your head that says Wouldn't it be interesting if...; And then do it.

Duane Michals,I believe in the imagination. What I cannot see is infinitely more important than what I can see.

Michelangelo,"The promises of this world are, for the most part, vain phantoms; and to confide in one's self, and become something of worth and value is the best and safest course."
Michelangelo,"It is necessary to keep one's compass in one's eyes and not in the hand, for the hands execute, but the eye judges."

Edouard Michelin,Our productivity drive is indispensable to the maintenance of market share and improvement in profitability.
Edouard Michelin,"It has been an amazing weekend for Michelin, and one that is only possible because of the hard work of so many people in our Company. It exemplifies our sporting values and our dedication to the team spirit of racing and fair competition. I am very proud and want to thank them all. I also want to congratulate both Fernando Alonso and Valentino Rossi on their World Championships. They are fantastic racers and great ambassadors for their sports."
Edouard Michelin,"In this environment, we are aiming for dynamic sales growth that will translate into additional operating income and an operating margin equivalent to 2005, despite the additional negative impact from higher raw material costs."
James A. Michener,"… Although most of us know Vincent van Gogh in Arles and Paul Gauguin in Tahiti as if they were neighbors -- somewhat disreputable but endlessly fascinating -- none of us can name two French generals or department store owners of that period. I take enormous pride in considering myself an artist, one of the necessaries."
James A. Michener,"An age is called Dark not because the light fails to shine, but because people refuse to see it."
James A. Michener,The permanent temptation of life is to confuse dreams with reality. The permanent defeat of life comes when dreams are surrendered to reality.
James A. Michener,The really great writers are people like Emily Bronte who sit in a room and write out of their limited experience and unlimited imagination.
Phil Mickelson,"When I made the putt on 15, I felt like victory was in hand. That's when I felt it was mine to control."
Phil Mickelson,I want to savor this victory. It was hard-fought. It was one of the most stressful tournaments because I was on the lead or in the lead or tied every night. And there was an extra night thrown in there for good measure.
Phil Mickelson,I'm still trying to find something that works the best for that event. It's still a little awkward for me.
Phil Mickelson,"I don't think there's any extra pressure trying to repeat, but what I do feel are a lot of great memories to look back on and to gain some momentum."
Phil Mickelson,"I feel very confident with how I'm playing. I'm trying to take that momentum and carry it over here to Firestone, and the reason I like playing here so much right after last week is it's a very similar setup."
Phil Mickelson,I really don't want to trade next year. I certainly enjoyed the jacket put on me.
Phil Mickelson,"Well, I don't really want to trade next year."
Phil Mickelson,I don't really want to trade next year. But I certainly enjoyed having the jacket put on me rather than putting it on [someone else].
Phil Mickelson,Lucas Glover is going to be just an incredible talent.
Phil Mickelson,"Well, unfortunately, they have the video running on one of the channels here at the hotel, so I get to see it every night, isn't that great? I've had a chance to see it a bunch and reflect on it. Every time I look at it with three or four feet to go, it just looks like it's going to go right in the middle and just somehow snaps off at the end. I keep waiting for the video to change, but it never does."
Phil Mickelson,"After birdies on the first two holes, I was off and running."
Phil Mickelson,"There are a lot of guys out here on tour that are going through personal problems. It's almost a reprieve to have those four or five hours to yourself to go play golf, knowing that you have to redirect your thoughts to playing each shot. It affects you more off the course."
Phil Mickelson,"In the past, I have not putted Bermuda well. But as I've played more and more, listened to Bones, my caddie, who grew up playing Bermuda greens, I'm feeling much comfortable on these surfaces. Last year, I putted very well (at Doral), and I should hopefully have a good week this week."
Phil Mickelson,We were just relishing the moment and relishing the opportunity.
Phil Mickelson,"For Chris to win it was so fitting this week. It's a memory that we'll have a lifetime, and we'll never forget."
Phil Mickelson,"I love the format, and I'm going to try to make a run tomorrow."
Phil Mickelson,"I'm sorry to see the tournament leave. It's such a great place, and I'd love to be the last one to win it."
Phil Mickelson,"It's kind of our signature hole for the event, and because of that, I love it. I think it's great. I think it's unique, it's different, it's special."
Phil Mickelson,"I'm four back, I've got to make a run. What really hurt was the couple of bogeys coming. ... It's going to take a low round. I just need a couple of those putts to go and I think a little bit of momentum, and I think I might have a low round in me."
Phil Mickelson,I haven't felt good on the greens yet. It's guesswork for me. I look up and hope it's on line. I feel really close right now where I'm starting to get much more control over my ball-striking.
Phil Mickelson,"As much as I want to be part of the history of this tournament and of this great game of golf, what I really try to do is prepare my best for each and every event. I don't think about leaving a legacy."
Phil Mickelson,"As much as I want to be a part of the history of this tournament and a part of the history of the great game of golf, it's not something I dwell on. I really enjoy the challenges that each major presents."
Phil Mickelson,I don't think that the way I plan on playing the golf course is any different being ahead as it would be being behind. I think you have to take what the course gives you.
Phil Mickelson,The most important piece of equipment is the golf ball.
Phil Mickelson,"He's played some great golf in majors, and he's won some big tournaments. He's just a tremendous player. Last year wasn't the year he wanted. He came back this year really hungry to play well, and he is. He's going to be really tough this weekend."
Phil Mickelson,He has meant a lot to the game of golf and we're all pulling for him. We all want him to do better and recover.
Phil Mickelson,"The nice thing about not having played a golf course before is you don't know what holes are birdie holes and what holes aren't, so you play it as it comes. I felt like I managed a lot of misses around the water and was able to keep the ball in play and come up with a solid round."
Phil Mickelson,"I have heard a lot of good things about this golf course and I have been waiting to come up here. It worked out perfectly the week before the Presidents Cup. It gives me a chance to get competitive, get ready for it."
Phil Mickelson,It's going to be very difficult. It's going to be a very tough test of golf now with the changes making it even more difficult. It's a very challenging golf course now. I think the course is going to play a full shot harder each round.
Phil Mickelson,"This is fun. This is what I've dreamt of doing since I was a kid â€” to be in the final group and have a chance. Yeah, there's pressure, but this is what I've been dreaming of."
Phil Mickelson,"I played well. It was fun to hit shots and have them end up where I wanted them to and end up making the putts. It was a fun first three rounds. I came out a little early today, about three-and-a-half hours before I played and I got a little bit tired and I hit some sloppy shots there at the end. Tomorrow I'll probably not come out quite so early."
Phil Mickelson,"There's a tremendous amount of guys that have a shot tomorrow. It should be a fun shootout. ... I'd like to be in the group in front so maybe I'll be able to make some birdies early and see if I can get out to a good start, put a little pressure on them and force them to make birdie, too."
Phil Mickelson,This is fun. This is going to be an exciting final round because there are so many players with a chance.
Phil Mickelson,It was a fun round. I didn't feel as though I left any shots out there.
Phil Mickelson,"Well, it was a fun round. I enjoyed coming out this morning when the greens were fresh and making a couple of putts early. It was fun to keep the ball in play and feel like I was trying to make birdie every hole rather than fighting for par. Those rounds are few and far between for me, but I love them when they occur."
Phil Mickelson,There's a tremendous amount of guys who have a shot. It should be a fun shootout.
Phil Mickelson,"It was certainly a fun week. I was very pleased with the way I played obviously and I felt like I was playing well at The Players Championship. I had some good practice days, but it really means a lot to actually have the scores reflect the way I felt I was playing."
Phil Mickelson,We're going to have our five biggest events spread out each month. I think that's terrific. It puts more emphasis on the quality of this event.
Phil Mickelson,"Even after Augusta, having not won a major or come close this year, I didn't doubt the fact it would happen again. I just didn't know when. It's tough for me to really say tangibly if there was something that was missing before The Masters win or not. I certainly feel a little bit different entering the majors. Certainly I'm a little bit more patient with myself."
Phil Mickelson,"I haven't named them yet, but that's a cute idea."
Phil Mickelson,"I feel as though I'm starting to get really sharp as far as distance control and some of the areas I've been working on. I think those are going to be critical next week for a good performance at Augusta, especially given the changes and how difficult it's playing."
Phil Mickelson,It was fun. I felt like I had pretty good control. I hit some good shots. I seem to roll them in today. I'm optimistic for the next few days.
Phil Mickelson,"It's not the easiest thing to do. On the other hand, when you're playing well and you have some confidence, if you just get a couple of putts to go in, it sets the tone for the day."
Phil Mickelson,They do not value the education the way I was brought up to value it. I think a college education is important no matter what you do in life. It just seems the focal point has changed.
Phil Mickelson,"This is one of the biggest catastrophes in the United States. They will read about it in their history books throughout their education years. I wanted them to see it from the destructive stage, and I want them to see it as it rebuilds to show them what we can do when Americans pull together."
Phil Mickelson,"The object of golf is not just to win. It is to play like a gentleman, and win."
Phil Mickelson,It'll be nice not to have to use my fake IDs anymore.
Phil Mickelson,I think a college education is important no matter what you do in life.
Phil Mickelson,"I have come to understand and appreciate writers much more recently since I started working on a book last fall. Before that, I thought golf writers got up every morning, played a round of golf, had lunch, showed up for our last three holes and then went to dinner."
Phil Mickelson,I hate to play a tournament in which I'm not contending. It's just not any fun for me.
Phil Mickelson,I have this great feeling of accomplishment.
Phil Mickelson,It gives me an incredible feeling of accomplishment to be able to come out on top this week.
Malcolm Midgely,"The woman also said that she heard the men talking loudly, but that their voices got softer as they apparently drowned. To my knowledge, if a person is drowning, they scream for help and put up a fight."
Malcolm Midgely,We are not sure if this was a family feud or what. The police are investigating.
Malcolm Midgely,Disaster management has made alternative arrangements with churches around the area.
Mido Mido,"I didn't elbow him. It would be different if I tried to elbow him, tried to hurt him."
Mido Mido,"I know about football - I've played for six clubs after all - and I can see the changes Martin makes during matches. Managing isn't only about training and talking, it's about what you do during the 90 minutes. That's his strongest point - his tactics, how he changes the game."
Mido Mido,"You could see the influence of Edgar in midfield, expressing for every ball and everybody was fighting,"
Harriet Miers,"I have been informed repeatedly that in lieu of records, I would be expected to testify about my service in the White House to demonstrate my experience and judicial philosophy."
Harriet Miers,"The underlying theme in most of these cases is the insistence of more self-determination. And the more I think about these issues, the more self-determination makes sense."
Harriet Miers,The wisdom of those who drafted our Constitution and conceived our nation as functioning with three strong and independent branches has proven truly remarkable.
Luis Miguel,"Piracy is important to talk about. It's harming the music industry. It hurts all of us. The public needs to understand every time they buy a pirated CD, they hurt the industry. The only ones who can change that are the fans and the people that buy CDs. It's everybody's responsibility to prevent it."
Luis Miguel,I am very adamant about keeping my private life private. I don't prefer to talk about my family.
Luis Miguel,"I think we all wish we could erase some dark times in our lives. But all of life's experiences, bad and good, make you who you are. Erasing any of life's experiences would be a great mistake."
Chris Mihm,We definitely want and expect to be a playoff team. We're glad our owner has the confidence in us and that he believes we'll be a playoff team.
Chris Mihm,"I was worried about this game because everybody is talking about and looking forward to the Christmas game. This is an easy one to overlook and let slip, but we came out and took care of business."
Chris Mihm,"As long as it's a king-sized bed, I'm OK. I just sleep diagonally."
Barbara Mikulski,"Women would be disproportionately affected by the privatization of social security. It is one of the most important safety nets for American women in old age, or in times of disability, to insure financial income for their families."
Barbara Mikulski,"Our children are our greatest resource. Our public policy must reflect our values. That means not just passing legislation to Leave No Child Behind, but funding those programs. Words must be backed by deeds to make sure all America's children - black and white, Latino and Asian have an equal chance to succeed."
Barbara Mikulski,"Our courts are charged with safeguarding the very principles America stands for: justice, equality, individual liberty. That courthouse door must always be open, and when someone walks through that door they have to find an independent judiciary. I want to be sure when somebody walks through that courthouse door they not only get a fair trial and a fair hearing, but they know that person providing it is the best of the best."
Barbara Mikulski,"The world has witnessed shameful acts committed by people who represent the United States in Iraq. Now America must show the world how the United States of America exercises the true principles of democracy - upholding the rule of law by administering justice in a swift, transparent and fair manner."
Barbara Mikulski,The world must know that America holds to the highest standards of military conduct and human rights protections. Anything less is unacceptable.
Alyssa Milano,"It's hard enough to go through puberty. Everyone's embarassed about their youth, but if just happens that the '80s were particularly disgusting. Flock of Seagulls is not cool."
Alyssa Milano,"I'm not getting married, ... Our relationship is so new we don't even really know what it is yet."
Alyssa Milano,Everything he touches turns to gold. I worked with him on 'Melrose Place' and I am happy to be working with him again. You always feel safe with Spelling.
Alyssa Milano,"Everything he touches turns to gold, ... I worked with him on 'Melrose Place' and I am happy to be working with him again. You always feel safe with Spelling."
Alyssa Milano,"I don't get ... not giving them what they deserve for hanging in for seven years, because that's going to lose more audience."
Alyssa Milano,"[Milano said she was at first intimidated because Doherty and Combs had an established friendship.] I knew they were friends, and I was a little freaked out, ... But as soon as I got to the set, I was like, 'This is going to be so much fun.'"
Les Miles,"As a coach, you work hard to mask really insignificant distraction. It's easy to do. You deny it, you work beyond it. Here, you don't do that."
Les Miles,"I think it's a compliment to the talent that's on our team, ... I don't think talent in and of itself is the reason why you win championships. I don't think that that will determine where we finish. It will be a character and style and chemistry that's developed through a season at LSU that will determine where we finish."
Les Miles,"We've addressed both issues. We feel like ball security is going well. I think that our team understands that. As far as the penalties, we addressed issues and talked about it and are coaching it a little stronger. The proof of that will come Saturday afternoon."
Les Miles,"I remember as a little kid following him around, ... He had a reputation for knocking the snot out of the ball. He was an all-world catcher."
Les Miles,"We're fortunate to have talented backs. Joseph Addai, Justin Vincent and Shyrone Carey are all quality, quality tailbacks and will shoulder the responsibility to carry the ball for us Saturday. We are confident that when we hand them the ball that they will be what we need."
Les Miles,"On offense we cannot sustain the mistakes that we made. I will not allow it. We're going to work hard at it. We worked hard at it last week, and we're going to work hard at it again. There's got to be a stronger push and a greater commitment by our team. We're going to fix it."
Les Miles,"Here are the three spots where the cupboard needs a little improvement for us to do the things that we need to accomplish: One of them is on offense, one of them is on defense and one is special teams, ... Every coach sees its team, its strengths and its weaknesses. Certainly, we need to improve to be the best team that we can be. But certainly there is talent and that's enjoyed. I don't think that there will be limitations based on talent; it will be limitations on other variables."
Les Miles,one of the great catches and great plays in LSU history.
Les Miles,Our team has had the longest camp in the history of camps.
Les Miles,"I think the running backs, depending on the health at that position with our veterans, (will play soon). I think the tailbacks will come in and look forward to some early playing time. I think there are a number of guys that fit into being fast and will hit you. They can fit into special teams. I think you'll see a large number of these guys starting with holding down special teams spots."
Les Miles,"We want to win it all. But right now, the task at hand is developing our football team and making up a good, solid football team."
Les Miles,"The hardest thing I ever did was pursue my degree and play championship football. Toughest thing I ever had to do. And I so respected the endeavor that when I got out, I really didn't think anything I was doing was as rewarding."
Les Miles,"He's pretty instinctive over there. He's new to the spot but not to football. We knew he was big enough, we knew he was strong enough. Lining up at tailback is not necessarily a criteria for linebacker. Not only the athleticism, but he had toughness and competitiveness. It seemed to fit him."
Les Miles,"This is not a made-for-TV movie. This was a real-life trauma where friends and family had to stay in the dorms and the town swelled to take in the New Orleans evacuees. We are treating people that are injured and disadvantaged 200 yards from our stadium. We have a scrimmage, and Blackhawk helicopters are flying people from New Orleans over our heads."
Les Miles,"I think that speaks to the experience that they've had here. I think it says that they have enjoyed their college career, and their families have allowed them support and enjoyed the fact that they stayed."
Les Miles,We have not played our best up to this point. We have not played with emotion for the last two weeks.
Les Miles,"Then a guy said, 'Well, you know, 12 victories is probably just what we'd like, Coach,'  ... I said, 'Well, you know, frankly, that's only one game left.' We'd like to win and certainly that's what we will pursue."
Les Miles,"[LSU offensive line coach Stacy Searels and head coach Les Miles, a former Michigan guard and offensive line coach, say center is the most natural position for Niswanger, though he has the 6-foot-5, 294-pound build of a tackle.] Rudy is quick and smart, which are two things you have to be play center, ... He fits in very well there and has played very well. He calls a lot of the blocking assignments and has been good at that."
Les Miles,"I think Nate has the quickness of a guard and the size and ability to set on the edge at tackle. I think both are great spots for him. The good thing about Nate is that it's kind of where we need him. He's a team player, and it doesn't make any difference to him."
Les Miles,"The skills of their quarterback make him a wild card. He's got the ability to throw the ball, and he's very dangerous with his feet."
Les Miles,"I don't know if I've been around a quarterback who has the ability to throw the ball like he does. If continues to make the right decisions and maintain ball security, he can be a great quarterback."
Les Miles,"But our team has practiced well and is showing the ability to put everything on the backburner for two hours and practice a little football. That's been a break, sort of a release, for me and a positive release for them."
Les Miles,Our team has practiced well and is showing the ability to put everything on the back burner for two hours and practice a little football.
Nelson A. Miles,"The troops were occasionally occupied in pursuing scattered bands going north or south, and on three occasions the large camp of Sitting Bull ventured south of the Canadian border, and important expeditions were sent against them."
Nelson A. Miles,"One hundred years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, the Spanish government issued a decree authorizing the enslavement of the American Indian as in accord with the law of God and man."
Nelson A. Miles,"On the contrary, if they are treated with justice and humanity, proper example and the advantages of education given them, the coming years will be as bright and prosperous to the unfortunate race as the past has been dark and painful."
Nelson A. Miles,If we dismiss from our minds the prejudice we may have against the Indians we shall be able to more clearly understand the impulses that govern both races.
Nelson A. Miles,"For a time during the early settlement of this country peace and goodwill prevailed, only to be followed later by violent and relentless warfare."
Nelson A. Miles,"Whether or not our system of Indian management has been a success during the past ten, fifty, or hundred years is almost answered in the asking."
Nelson A. Miles,To illustrate to the Indians the advantages the white race had in the telephone I divided a body of warriors from Sitting Bull's camp into two parties and had them talk to each other over the telephone line.
Nelson A. Miles,The importance of the educational and moral improvement of a race heretofore entirely debarred of its benefits was early considered.
Nelson A. Miles,"Looking at the purpose of our government toward the Indians, we find that after subjugating them it has been our policy to collect the different tribes on reservations and support them at the expense of our people."
Nelson A. Miles,"These are hallowed moments, when every American has reason to express his gratitude to Almighty God that it has been our good fortune to witness the light of this auspicious morn."
Nelson A. Miles,"The tide of immigration in Canada has not been as great as along our frontier. They have been able to allow the Indians to live as Indians, which we have not, and do not attempt to force upon them the customs which are distasteful to them."
Nelson A. Miles,The more we study the Indian's character the more we appreciate the marked distinction between the civilized being and the real savage.
Nelson A. Miles,The intrusions of the white race and the non- compliance with treaty obligations have been followed by atrocities that could alone satisfy a savage and revengeful spirit.
Nelson A. Miles,"The Indians, however, could not migrate from one part of the United States to another; neither could they obtain employment as readily as white people, either upon or beyond the Indian reservations."
Nelson A. Miles,Step by step a powerful and enterprising race has driven them back from the Atlantic to the West until at last there is scarcely a spot of ground upon which the Indians have any certainty of maintaining a permanent abode.
Nelson A. Miles,"Replying to your long telegram, one point is of vital importance-the difficult Indian problem can not be solved permanently at this end of the line."
Nelson A. Miles,"It is unfair to suppose that one party has invariably acted rightly, and that the other is responsible for every wrong that has been committed."
Nelson A. Miles,"If the graves of the thousands of victims who have fallen in the terrible wars of the two races had been placed in line the philanthropist might travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, and be constantly in sight of green mounds."
Cesar Millan,I'm focused. I learned from my father not to hesitate.
Cesar Millan,"I wished to have a TV show  a series, not a special  to change the way people behave with their dogs. I saw the need and wanted to fulfill the need. See what happens? Are you with me? The universe is always there for you."
Cesar Millan,"My dad still doesn't understand why people are paying me to walk their dogs. America is a very positive country. Here, you can be whatever you want. It's awesome. A guy can cross the border 14 years ago and now have his own TV show. Only in America."
Cesar Millan,"Mother Nature always wants to be balanced. So there's no age where they don't want to return back to normal. I have worked with dogs that are 11 years old, 13 years old, which you witness in the show. I worked with a dog that was 13 years old that was extremely territorial to her food. And I was able to accomplish a calm, submissive state, which is allowing for you to create rules, boundaries and limitations. The mind backs away from the food. So in their world, they are always ready to balance. It's the human who fights it."
Cesar Millan,"At the age of 13, I wanted to be the best dog trainer in the world. That was my wish."
Cesar Millan,Dogs in America get more affection than women in most Third World countries.
Cesar Millan,"We have to use exercise, discipline and affection every day. Most of the time people share affection, affection, affection, and that creates frustration. In a powerful breed, that's going to lead him into aggression. So exercise and discipline play a big role in balance."
Kevin Millar,"[Kevin Millar , the subject of trade rumors recently, reiterated his importance in the clubhouse because of his close relationship with Manny Ramirez .] He and I are as close as you can be as a teammate and friend, ... I spend more time with him on the road probably than a lot of guys, whether it be working out, whether it be eating lunch, [or] just hanging out. Do other guys take the time or effort to do that? No."
Kevin Millar,"You don?t want to make a living out of being down four runs in this game, but you?re going to be down at times, ... The bottom line is, this lineup can do that."
Kevin Millar,"I mean, every year's different. You don't want to make a living doing this, but we find a way to toughen up when it's crunch time and we got to win each inning right now. We don't have an inning to give away."
Kevin Millar,"One hundred percent, this is where he wanted to be. He's worked so hard to get back here. He's worked so hard for the opportunity."
Kevin Millar,"It's going to be three Super Bowl games with two heavyweight fighters. There's going to be energy in the city, in the media and with the fans. It's going to be awesome."
Kevin Millar,"[Red Sox 8, Devil Rays 7 Boston's lead over the Yankees in the AL East is down to a half-game, but] we're fine, ... One thing we don't do is panic. One thing we don't do is get negative."
Kevin Millar,"I'm ready to play baseball, man."
Kevin Millar,That's baseball. Anybody can win any given night. It just takes that one swing in a game and tonight we couldn't get that.
Kevin Millar,The gods of baseball wanted this to happen.
Kevin Millar,"Sometimes, Manny is taking a nap, and you woke up the baby. There's not a better retaliation, something like that. Manny's one of the best at that."
Matt Millen,"I think where we're sitting, there are enough quality players that someone may be interested to jump up."
Matt Millen,"This is more of a passing league than it's ever been. That said, there's a huge upside with our potential."
Matt Millen,"Youth is not an excuse anymore. We're faster, we have more talent and we have more potential."
Matt Millen,"Leaders are never appreciated or needed until you don't have them,"
Matt Millen,"Sometimes Rod says some things, and I start laughing, because it's stuff that has been said a thousand times through my past. It came out of the mouths of different people, but it becomes what you are. So when I hear him, I get a kick out of it."
Matt Millen,"We have to be better on our offensive line. Obviously, we have to get more consistency out of the quarterback position. We need more consistency out of our receivers. Defensively, our secondary has got to be better. And I want to get more consistent pressure out of our front seven."
Matt Millen,"I believed that this was a roster that was capable of making a playoff run, and I still believe that."
Matt Millen,Roy can be as good as anybody in the league. Charles has as much downfield ability as whatever is out there. He's not up there with Randy because he's not as fast. But he's pretty fast. And Mike is a huge man who runs well who doesn't know what he's doing.
Adam Miller,"We have firm policies prohibiting payola and requiring compliance with the federal sponsor identification rules , and we enforce them. We have cooperated fully with the attorney general's office in this investigation. Now that the attorney general has filed this civil action, we are confident that the issues will be fully and fairly resolved by the court."
Adam Miller,We are hiding him a little bit. It's really not by design. We switched a few things with him in batting practice about a week ago. We moved him up in the box a little. It wasn't that he was struggling. He just couldn't get anything on the barrel.
Adam Miller,He consistently gets better. If we can keep him under control mentally he is going to be tough. He's a little bulldog.
Adam Miller,"You get to see it all in show choir ? Broadway, pop, cowboy tap dancing and comedy."
Alice Miller,"When a woman like that whom I've seen so much, All of a sudden drops out of touch; Is always busy and never can, Spare you a moment, it means a man"
Alice Miller,There are people who have benefited from therapy without being confronted with the past at all.
Alice Miller,"The capacity of the human organism to bear pain is, for our own protection, limited. All attempts to overstep this natural threshold by resolving repression in a violent manner will, as with every other form of violation, have negative and often dangerous consequences."
Alice Miller,"A child too, can never grasp the fact that the same mother who cooks so well, is so concerned about his cough, and helps so kindly with his homework, in some circumstance has no more feeling than a wall of his hidden inner world"
Alice Miller,"If it's very painful for you to criticize your friends - you're safe in doing it. But if you take the slightest pleasure in it, that's the time to hold your tongue."
Alice Miller,"The truth about childhood, as many of us have had to endure it, is inconceivable, scandalous, painful. Not uncommonly, it is monstrous. Invariably, it is repressed. To be confronted with this truth all at once and to try to integrate it into our consciousness, however ardently we may wish it, is clearly impossible."
Alice Miller,",,,It is possible to resolve childhood repression safely and without confusion - something that has always been disputed by the most respected schools of thought."
Alice Miller,"Don't ever dare to take your college as a matter of course - because, like democracy and freedom, many people you'll never know have broken their hearts to get it for you."
Alice Miller,Contempt is the weapon of the weak and a defense against one's own despised and unwanted feelings.
Alice Miller,Genuine forgiveness does not deny anger but faces it head-on.
Alice Miller,"Learning is a result of listening, which in turn leads to even better listening and attentiveness to the other person. In other words, to learn from the child, we must have empathy, and empathy grows as we learn."
Andre Miller,It's not reality right now. It's just a bunch of rumors . ... Normally you'd think we would talk about it. But we haven't been.
Andre Miller,"We're giving a lot of 30-point quarters up. Teams are shooting high percentages, getting a lot of easy baskets on us."
Andre Miller,Not too many people get that opportunity to come out and give back to their community or to the college that gave them an opportunity to get an education.
Andre Miller,I don't feel we have a lack of confidence. We're just playing some bad basketball.
Arthur Miller,"Nobody dast blame this man. For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to the life. He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you medicine. He's a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back -- that's an earthquake. And then you get yourself a couple of spots on your hat, and you're finished. Nobody dast blame this man. A salesman is got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory."
Arthur Miller,That is a very good question. I don't know the answer. But can you tell me the name of a classical Greek shoemaker?
Arthur Miller,The task of the real intellectual consists of analyzing illusions in order to discover their causes
Arthur Miller,"A play is made by sensing how the forces in life simulate ignorance-you set free the concealed irony, the deadly joke."
Arthur Miller,"I dreamed I had a child, and even in the dream I saw it was my life, and it was an idiot, and I ran away. But it always crept on to my lap again, clutched at my clothes. Until I thought, if I could kiss it, whatever in it is my own, perhaps I could s"
Arthur Miller,"Success, instead of giving freedom of choice, becomes a way of life. There's no country I've been to where people, when you come into a room and sit down with them, so often ask you, What do you do? And, being American, many's the time I've almost"
Arthur Miller,"My conception of the audience is of a public each member of which is carrying about with him what he thinks is an anxiety, or a hope, or a preoccupation which is his alone and isolates him from mankind; and in this respect at least the function of a play is to reveal him to himself so that he may touch others by virtue of the revelation of his mutuality with them. If only for this reason I regard the theater as a serious business, one that makes or should make man more human, which is to say, less alone."
Arthur Miller,"He wants to live on through something-and in his case, his masterpiece is his son. all of us want that, and it gets more poignant as we get more anonymous in this world."
Arthur Miller,I cannot sleep for dreaming; I cannot dream but I wake and walk about the house as though I'd find you coming through some door.
Arthur Miller,"The problem was to sustain at any cost the feeling you had in the theater that you were watching a real person, yes, but an intense condensation of his experience, not simply a realistic series of episodes."
Arthur Miller,"Certainly the most diverse, if minor, pastime of literary life is the game of Find the Author."
Arthur Miller,"If you complain of people being shot down in the streets, of the absence of communication or social responsibility, of the rise of everyday violence which people have become accustomed to, and the dehumanisation of feelings, then the ultimate develop"
Arthur Miller,"Where choice begins, Paradise ends, innocence ends, for what is Paradise but the absence of any need to choose this action?"
Arthur Miller,Maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets.
Bill Miller,We try to buy companies that trade at large discounts to intrinsic value. What's different is we will look for that value anywhere we can. We don't rule out technology as an area to look for value.
Bill Miller,"In the last month, we have been extremely active in speaking to a wide range of potential customers."
Bill Miller,"He's for real. If you look up the definition of patriotism in the dictionary, his picture is there."
Bill Miller,"I know everybody down here. You live in a condo, you don't even know the guy living across the hall from you."
Bill Miller,That's because he was man of deep thought and integrity. He thought giving away the taxpayers' money to a large corporation was not in the best interest of the taxpayer.
Bill Miller,Our overall philosophy was to invest in permanent facilities rather than temporary facilities. We steered them in that direction so that we had something left at the end of the Olympics.
Bill Miller,"Everything is different (for DeLay), and in a bad way. There is nothing good out there and it is an adverse situation to be operating in."
Bill Miller,"They were not happy with the debate and some of the bills that came out, so they're showing their irritation ... by running for the Legislature. It's the great American way - if you don't like it, change it."
Bobby Miller,"By the end of the night, (your forearms) will be black and have no hair."
Bobby Miller,"With all the development in Asia, and especially China, that's the biggest spot for growth."
Bobby Miller,"I'm a good team player and I don't care who gets the team glory as long as we win. I had to come off the bench because of my injury, but the team still found a way to win."
Bobby Miller,I just want to thank God for giving us the strength to accomplish this.
Bobby Miller,Now I feel good. Experience took us and being mentally prepared. That's what took us there.
Bobby Miller,"Their defense was causing us to shoot from the outside. But we were getting open and knocking them down, so we kept shooting."
Bobby Miller,"The very first thing that you take out of your bag should be a good attitude, if not, you'll miss out on the most rewarding part of golf."
Bode Miller,I think there's strength in the coaching of our team. I think there's strength in the training partners I have. I don't think there's any negatives for me except that I have to respect what they ask me to do.
Bode Miller,"If the snow was like this I would race all the time. It's not tiring when you ski like that, when the snow is that way, but I'm ready for some golf and rest, too."
Bode Miller,"When I ski a downhill race, I feel more like an astronaut than an athlete. One wrong move, and I'm toast."
Bode Miller,"The last few days there's been a huge improvement,"
Bode Miller,"If things went well, I could be sitting on four medals, maybe all of them gold."
Bode Miller,"Whether somebody wants me to get five gold medals or whatever it is, I feel like they are all other peoples concerns and issues, not really mine."
Bode Miller,"Fame is almost a poison. I couldn't care less, in fact I lived better when I was a nobody. Sport is born clean and it would stay that way if it was the athletes who ran it for the pleasure of taking part. But then the fans and the media intervene and finish up by corrupting it with the pressure that they exercise."
Bode Miller,"The days where you crash, you ... get your drink, get your clothes, cruise to the lodge, take your boots off, have some food, go home, take a nice shower, hang out with your buddies, read your book."
Bode Miller,In no way was I trying to incriminate him (Armstrong) or accuse him in any way of cheating. The interview was pretty warped and pretty compressed to make it sound that way.
Bode Miller,"I feel it's super hypocritical for a drug to be legal for you to buy, but not for an athlete to buy. You have to look at the result and ask would [drugs] help guys not to injure themselves and beat themselves up as bad so that they would have a more positive, enjoyable life at the end of their lifetime."
Bode Miller,"That feeling is the same whether you're on either side of the hundredths. Obviously, it's great to win the world championship, but if you put down that kind of skiing, it's awesome either way."
Bode Miller,My goal is the same as every year - to not hurt myself.
Bode Miller,I always do the contrary of what my coaches tell me.
Bode Miller,"But there was no question in my mind that I was gonna still go for it. I was still going for the win. I wasn't skiing for second or third place today, and in the end I think that's probably what got me there."
Bode Miller,"In some ways, that's the story of my season - when I wasn't making big mistakes, I was winning races and being on the podium. And when I made mistakes I was still fourth or fifth, just off the podium."
Bode Miller,"Once the season starts for me, there isn't a change in my focus, just a change in my tactics and strategies."
Bode Miller,"People in the U.S. will watch anything if it's put in front of their face over and over again. I like to see what's possible, more than anything."
Bode Miller,"We've got a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence we're doing the right stuff because the athletes are showing it, especially in the big championships."
Bode Miller,"When you back off, it's easier to do mistakes. For me it's better to ski fast."
Bode Miller,It's not quite as important who you beat as that you end up on top.
Bode Miller,"We expected him to be back in super-G and downhill, because it suits his ability a little more now."
Charles Miller,I've been to Honduras for each of the last six years and brought back my knowledge.
Charles Miller,They have given us some more ideas of needs that we are pursuing right now.
Charles Miller,"We had a tremendous year in 2005. We're very happy with where we are, and where we're headed. We wouldn't want to switch places with anyone."
Charles Miller,We know the graduation numbers are awful when it comes to all but a small percentage of colleges. It's a failure of the system.
Charles Miller,"We don't really understand how money is used in higher education, ... I think most people outside higher education don't have a clue, and my experience inside is a lot of us who govern higher education don't know a lot about it."
Charles Miller,"Once we do, we will make a determination about what steps to take."
Charles Miller,The government has made no determination yet as to what the government's next step will be.
Charles Miller,It is under review and no determination has been made as to what the government will do next on this matter.
Charles Miller,We hope his opinion will demonstrate the government's belief that this information would be helpful in protecting the nation's youth against potentially harmful material.
Charles Miller,"For the past 150 years, the post office has issued stamps to raise awareness of individuals and events that shaped America, ... It is an honor to immortalize those who fought for peace and justice."
Charles Miller,Seem like to me our government is taking every advantage -- taking every opportunity to increase these gas prices.
Cheryl Miller,I'm just happy for the young lady.
Cheryl Miller,"My coach, Floyd Evans, took the same heat when he left me in. That's what this game's all about, special moments in special situations. Instead of people getting their feelings hurt, they should pat her on the back."
Cheryl Miller,It's just this budget issue. Parents are concerned it's what everybody's talking about.
Craig Miller,"Internships are very important part of our education program, first and foremost. In setting up professional internships, not only will we be able to offer students a chance to work with industry professionals, but the students also will be able to take the theory they learn in the classroom and put it into practice here, in whichever activity they're focused."
Craig Miller,It was probably one of the toughest decisions that I ever had to make: to tell my people that we are not going back.
Craig Miller,"If I had the choice, and it was at all feasible to operate in New Orleans, why would I move?"
Craig Miller,"Recognizing the unique character and strong demographics of each of these great markets, we are thrilled that they will be home to the newest members of the Ruth's Chris Steak House family,"
Craig Miller,"I don't see that the public has that same affinity for protecting the lake that we do as owners, because it's our home. The lake is our front yard, ... We're not the bad guys. We're just trying to exercise our private property rights."
Dan Miller,Our ultimate goal is to build more quality telescopic handlers and pavers and to deliver them to our dealer network faster to meet the demands of their customer markets.
Dan Miller,You can't do that against a quality opponent like Harlan.
Dan Miller,I hate it when it's like this. We don't need eight more weeks of winter. I can't wait until spring.
Dan Miller,He's a tremendous running back. He's hard to tackle and just has great vision.
Dan Miller,My view is that while you do occasionally have differences you ought to have a process where you can sit down and talk about things. How else do you solve problems?
Dan Miller,"You know, we have our differences, everybody does, honest, real differences, but I do believe strongly that we as neighbors are drawn together far more than we're driven apart."
Dan Miller,"We're also fairly stubborn, I think, fairly independent. We have our share of difficulties with our federal government, although I've tried to as I am here encourage a better way of discussing those problems."
Dan Miller,It's easy to focus on the things that divide us. Sometimes too easy.
Dan Miller,"The heart of our relationship, this natural environment that has blessed us really all along the west coast of North America, on both sides of the border we've realized that this incredible natural wealth comes with a price."
Dan Miller,"We share a wonderful, I think, physical or geographical heritage."
Dan Miller,"He's an average kind of athlete, ... but he doesn't have an average kind of heart. That heart was built by the coaches he's had."
Dan Miller,It's true that technology and the information age is sweeping the world. It has changed fundamentally some of the economies of the world.
Dan Miller,"If you look at the four fatal accidents that have occurred in West Virginia this year, they're very different from one another. Except they all occurred in the mining industry in this state."
Dan Miller,"We tried to slow the game down because of their ability to score points, but when we took a shot we did some things that were totally out of character for us. Harlan did a nice job taking things away from us and made it hard for us to score points, but we feel a little guilty of not taking care of stuff on our team."
Frank Miller,You can't have virtue without sin. What I'm after is having my characters' virtues defined by how they operate in a very sinful environment. That's how you test people.
Frank Miller,What I want to bring back to superheroes with this project is a sense of play. Things have gotten so dreary. The heroes have gotten so ugly that even their muscles have muscles.
Frank Miller,Think of me as the weathered sheriff coming back into Dodge 'cause the youngsters are shooting up the church and scaring the horses and not doing right by the women.
Frank Miller,Sometimes the solitary voice can be the best one.
Frank Miller,The noir hero is a knight in blood caked armor. He's dirty and he does his best to deny the fact that he's a hero the whole time.
Gene Miller,The project starts as soon as school is out. We will move them (the mobile units) in when school is out.
Gene Miller,"They'll come to us and say we need this, we need that. Any group of school supporters that wants to come to the administration and board of education are encouraged to come to us."
Gene Miller,"We would design it here in Stafford, pre-build it here and assemble it at the hospital."
Gene Miller,"In lieu of not building buildings, we do not have a choice, We are adding 1,000 students per year. We need to be building three schools every two years, and we are not even coming close to that."
Greg Miller,"All clubs are after quality players and guys who are goal kickers. I am very confident in the quality of our football club. The people we have got around our footy club, I believe they can get the best out of any player."
Greg Miller,"The appeals process consists of reviewing what went on in the cases to see if any mistakes were made. The 3rd District is compromised of 17 counties, the largest of the 12 districts in the state."
Greg Miller,"This is the only football factory in America. And everything used to make a ball is made in America, too -- the leather, the laces, the bladder. People here believe that 'Made in America' says something special. Football is an American game. It doesn't seem right that the ball would be made in China."
Harry Miller,"Primarily, it's a value proposition, ... First and foremost, (customers) are getting 3 pairs of shoes in one. It's such a practical idea, people always say, 'Why didn't I think of that?'"
Harry Miller,"Most pipelines are operating at pressures of 1,000 to 1,200 psig. But some companies are planning new pipelines at pressures up to 2,500 psig to transmit more gas in a given diameter. The DATUM-C will be able to meet those requirements, as well."
Harry Miller,"The inline design makes the DATUM-C practical and efficient as a pipeline booster, and because of the compact size and quiet operation it would not even require the construction of a traditional pipeline station."
Heath Miller,"I don't worry about when I might be starting, ... I just try to go out and do my job when I get the opportunity and make the best of it."
Heath Miller,"His stats might not have been great, but he's a champion and that's all that matters."
Heath Miller,It was very exciting. That was my first live action in front of a packed house at Heinz Field.
Henry Miller,"The American ideal is youth --handsome, empty youth."
Henry Miller,"The American ideal is youth /handsome, empty youth."
Henry Miller,"A man writes to throw off the poison which he has accumulated because of his false way of life. He is trying to recapture his innocence, yet all he succeeds in doing (by writing) is to inoculate the world with a virus of his disillusionment. No man would set a word down on paper if he had the courage to live out what he believed in."
Henry Miller,"After all, most writing is done away from the typewriter, away from the desk. I'd say it occurs in the quiet, silent moments, while you're walking or shaving or playing a game, or whatever, or even talking to someone you're not vitally interested in."
Henry Miller,Nine-tenths of our sickness can be prevented by right thinking plus right hygiene -- nine-tenths of it!
Henry Miller,Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such
Henry Miller,"The American white man (not to speak of the Indian, the Negro, the Mexican) hasn't a ghost of a chance. If he has any talent he's doomed to have it crushed one way or another. The American way is to seduce a man by bribery and make a prostitute of him. Or else to ignore him, starve him into submission and make a hack of him."
Henry Miller,"If there is to be any peace, it will come through being, not having"
Henry Miller,"Music is a beautiful opiate, if you don't take it too seriously"
Henry Miller,"Whatever there be of progress in life comes not through adaptation but through daring, through obeying the blind urge"
Henry Miller,"Topographically the country is magnificent -- and terrifying. Why terrifying? Because nowhere else in the world is the divorce between man and nature so complete. Nowhere have I encountered such a dull, monotonous fabric of life as here in America. Here boredom reaches its peak."
Henry Miller,"There are lone figures armed only with ideas, sometimes with just one idea, who blast away whole epochs in which we are enwrapped like mummies. Some are powerful enough to resurrect the dead. Some steal on us unawares and put a spell over us which it takes centuries to throw off. Some put a curse on us, for our stupidity and inertia, and then it seems as if God himself were unable to lift it."
Henry Miller,"Sin, guilt, neurosis /they are one and the same, the fruit of the tree of knowledge."
Henry Miller,"The world isn't kept running because it's a paying proposition. (God doesn't make a cent on the deal.) The world goes on because a few men in every generation believe in it utterly, accept it unquestioningly; they underwrite it with their lives."
Henry Miller,Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed
Henry Miller,You can travel fifty thousand miles in America without once tasting a piece of good bread.
Henry Miller,"Fame is an illusive thing -- here today, gone tomorrow. The fickle, shallow mob raises its heroes to the pinnacle of approval today and hurls them into oblivion tomorrow at the slightest whim; cheers today, hisses tomorrow; utter forgetfulness in a few months."
Henry Miller,"Fame is an illusive thing / here today, gone tomorrow. The fickle, shallow mob raises its heroes to the pinnacle of approval today and hurls them into oblivion tomorrow at the slightest whim; cheers today, hisses tomorrow; utter forgetfulness in a few months."
Henry Miller,"What have we achieved in mowing down mountain ranges, harnessing the energy of mighty rivers, or moving whole populations about like chess pieces, if we ourselves remain the same restless, miserable, frustrated creatures we were before? To call such activity progress is utter delusion. We may succeed in altering the face of the earth until it is unrecognizable even to the Creator, but if we are unaffected wherein lies the meaning?"
Henry Miller,"The dreamer whose dreams are non-utilitarian has no place in this world. In this world the poet is anathema, the thinker a fool, the artist an escapist, the man of vision a criminal."
Henry Miller,"The stabbing horror of life is not contained in calamities and disasters, because these things wake one up and one gets very familiar and intimate with them and finally they become tame again. No, it is more like being in a hotel room in Hoboken let us say, and just enough money in one's pocket for another meal."
Henry Miller,"Men are not suffering from the lack of good literature, good art, good theatre, good music, but from that which has made it impossible for these to become manifest. In short, they are suffering from the silent shameful conspiracy (the more shameful since it is unacknowledged) which has bound them together as enemies of art and artists."
Henry Miller,"The study of crime begins with the knowledge of oneself. All that you despise, all that you loathe, all that you reject, all that you condemn and seek to convert by punishment springs from you."
Henry Miller,"All the lies and evasions by which man has nourished himself -- civilization, in a word is the fruits of the creative artist. It is the creative nature of man which has refused to let him lapse back into that unconscious unity with life which characterizes the animal world from which he made his escape."
Henry Miller,"There is the happiness which comes from creative effort. The joy of dreaming, creating, building, whether in painting a picture, writing an epic, singing a song, composing a symphony, devising new invention, creating a vast industry."
Henry Miller,"The world itself is pregnant with failure, is the perfect manifestation of imperfection, of the consciousness of failure."
Henry Miller,"The life of a creator is not the only life nor perhaps the most interesting which a man leads. There is a time for play and a time for work, a time for creation and a time for lying fallow. And there is a time, glorious too in its own way, when one scarcely exists, when one is a complete void. I mean -- when boredom seems the very stuff of life."
Henry Miller,"This is not a book. This is libel, slander, defamation of character. This is not a book, in the ordinary sense of the word. No, this is a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art, a kick in the pants to God, Man, Destiny, Time, Love, Beauty... what you will. I am going to sing for you, a little off key perhaps, but I will sing."
Henry Miller,When one is trying to do something beyond his known powers it is useless to seek the approval of friends.  Friends are at their best in moments of defeat.
Henry Miller,Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed.
Henry Miller,The world has not to be put in order: the world is order incarnate. It is for us to put ourselves in unison with this order.
Henry Miller,The only thing we never get enough of is love; and the only thing we never give enough of is love.
Henry Miller,"Sin, guilt, neurosis; they are one and the same, the fruit of the tree of knowledge."
Henry Miller,What distinguishes the majority of men from the few is their ability to act according to their beliefs.
Henry Miller,Instead of asking 'How much damage will the work in question bring about?' why not ask 'How much good? How much joy?'
Henry Miller,"Any genuine philosophy leads to action and from action back again to wonder, to the enduring fact of mystery."
Henry Miller,"The world dies over and over again, but the skeleton always gets up and walks."
Henry Miller,"Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself."
Henry Miller,Man has demonstrated that he is master of everything except his own nature.
Henry Miller,"Los Angeles gives one the feeling of the future more strongly than any city I know of. A bad future, too, like something out of Fritz Lang's feeble imagination."
Henry Miller,"Life, as it is called, is for most of us one long postponement."
Henry Miller,The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough is love.
Henry Miller,"Moralities, ethics, laws, customs, beliefs, doctrines - these are of trifling import. All that matters is that the miraculous become the norm."
Henry Miller,The real leader has no need to lead - he is content to point the way.
Henry Miller,It isn't the oceans which cut us off from the world - it's the American way of looking at things.
Henry Miller,Confusion is a word we have invented for an order which is not understood.
Henry Miller,Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such.
Henry Miller,What does it matter how one comes by the truth so long as one pounces upon it and lives by it?
Henry Miller,"If there is to be any peace it will come through being, not having."
Henry Miller,"The prisoner is not the one who has commited a crime, but the one who clings to his crime and lives it over and over."
Henry Miller,"All growth is a leap in the dark, a spontaneous unpremeditated act without benefit of experience."
Henry Miller,When one is trying to do something beyond his known powers it is useless to seek the approval of friends. Friends are at their best in moments of defeat.
Henry Miller,"The worst sin that can be committed against the artist is to take him at his word, to see in his work a fulfillment instead of an horizon."
Henry Miller,"The world is not to be put in order; the world is order, incarnate. It is for us to harmonize with this order."
Henry Miller,"What is not in the open street is false, derived, that is to say, literature."
Henry Miller,Actors die so loud.
Henry Miller,"The great work must inevitably be obscure, except to the very few, to those who like the author himself are initiated into the mysteries. Communication then is secondary: it is perpetuation which is important. For this only one good reader is necessary."
Henry Miller,"In this age, which believes that there is a short cut to everything, the greatest lesson to be learned is that the most difficult way is, in the long run, the easiest."
Henry Miller,"The man who looks for security, even in the mind, is like a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones which will give him no pain or trouble."
Henry Miller,"Plots and character don't make life. Life is here and now, anytime you say the word, anytime you let her rip."
Henry Miller,The world is the mirror of myself dying.
Henry Miller,If men cease to believe that they will one day become gods then they will surely become worms.
Henry Miller,When you know what men are capable of you marvel neither at their sublimity nor their baseness. There are no limits in either direction apparently.
Henry Miller,"The ordinary man is involved in action, the hero acts. An immense difference."
Henry Miller,Whatever I do is done out of sheer joy; I drop my fruits like a ripe tree. What the general reader or the critic makes of them is not my concern.
Henry Miller,"We live in the mind, in ideas, in fragments. We no longer drink in the wild outer music of the streets - we remember only."
Henry Miller,Every man with a bellyful of the classics is an enemy to the human race.
Henry Miller,The concert is a polite form of self induced torture.

Henry Miller,"Analysis brings no curative powers in its train; it merely makes us conscious of the existence of an evil, which, oddly enough, is consciousness."
Henry Miller,There is nothing strange about fear: no matter in what guise it presents itself it is something with which we are all so familiar that when a man appears who is without it we are at once enslaved by him.
Henry Miller,"In the beginning was the Word. Man acts it out. He is the act, not the actor."

Henry Miller,"Until we accept the fact that life itself is founded in mystery, we shall learn nothing."
Henry Miller,Why are we so full of restraint? Why do we not give in all directions? Is it fear of losing ourselves? Until we do lose ourselves there is no hope of finding ourselves.

Henry Miller,I have always looked upon decay as being just as wonderful and rich an expression of life as growth.
Henry Miller,"If we are always arriving and departing, it is also true that we are eternally anchored. One's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things."
Henry Miller,We live at the edge of the miraculous.
Henry Miller,"We do not talk - we bludgeon one another with facts and theories gleaned from cursory readings of newspapers, magazines and digests."
Henry Miller,"One of the reasons why so few of us ever act, instead of react, is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses."
Henry Miller,One's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.
Henry Miller,One can be absolutely truthful and sincere even though admittedly the most outrageous liar. Fiction and invention are of the very fabric of life.
Henry Miller,"Art is only a means to life, to the life more abundant. It is not in itself the life more abundant. It merely points the way, something which is overlooked not only by the public, but very often by the artist himself. In becoming an end it defeats itself."
Henry Miller,"Whatever there be of progress in life comes not through adaptation but through daring, through obeying the blind urge."
Henry Miller,"Honest criticism means nothing: what one wants is unrestrained passion, fire for fire."
Henry Miller,"Music is a beautiful opiate, if you don't take it too seriously."
Henry Miller,"Develop an interest in life as you see it; the people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself."
Henry Miller,"We have two American flags always: one for the rich and one for the poor. When the rich fly it means that things are under control; when the poor fly it means danger, revolution, anarchy."
Henry Miller,"It does me good to write a letter which is not a response to a demand, a gratuitous letter, so to speak, which has accumulated in me like the waters of a reservoir."
Henry Miller,"Back of every creation, supporting it like an arch, is faith. Enthusiasm is nothing: it comes and goes. But if one believes, then miracles occur."
Henry Miller,No man is great enough or wise enough for any of us to surrender our destiny to. The only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore to us the belief in our own guidance.
Henry Miller,"The new always carries with it the sense of violation, of sacrilege. What is dead is sacred; what is new, that is different, is evil, dangerous, or subversive."
Henry Miller,"And what is the potential man, after all? Is he not the sum of all that is human? Divine, in other words?"
Henry Miller,"True strength lies in submission which permits one to dedicate his life, through devotion, to something beyond himself."
Henry Miller,"The tragedy of it is that nobody sees the look of desperation on my face. Thousands and thousands of us, and we're passing one another without a look of recognition."
Henry Miller,"I have never been able to look upon America as young and vital but rather as prematurely old, as a fruit which rotted before it had a chance to ripen."
Henry Miller,"Perhaps I am still very much of an American. That is to say, nanve, optimistic, gullible. In the eyes of a European, what am I but an American to the core, an American who exposes his Americanism like a sore. Like it or not, I am a product of this land of plenty, a believer in superabundance, a believer in miracles."
Henry Miller,I see America spreading disaster. I see America as a black curse upon the world. I see a long night settling in and that mushroom which has poisoned the world withering at the roots.
Henry Miller,"Any genuine philosophy leads to action and from action back again to wonder, to enduring fact of mystery"
Henry Miller,"Example moves the world more than doctrine. The great exemplars are the poets of action, and it makes little difference whether they be forces for good or forces for evil."
Henry Miller,"Life has no other discipline to impose, if we would but realize it, than to accept life unquestioningly. Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. What seems nasty, painful, evil, can become a source of beauty, joy and strength, if faced with an open mind. Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such."
Henry Miller,What distinguishes the majority of men from the few is their ability to act according to their beliefs
Henry Miller,"I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive."

Jack Miller,"It's something we're looking at. Whether it's an issue or not, it's hard to say at this point."
Jack Miller,"The Orphan Car Show is very different from other enthusiast events in that it showcases hundreds of forgotten and unusual vehicles. Visitors can enjoy an outstanding collection of cars, trucks and motorcycles -- many they may never have seen before. Our colorfully entertaining pass-in-review is a rolling history lesson that breathes new life into each vehicle."
Jack Miller,"We pay based upon on ratings. As the audience grows, we pay more per ad."
Jack Miller,"When someone has the desire to go to school and has the ability but can't get into our schools, that's wrong. Education drives the economy and the quality of life."
James Miller,The only exercise I excel at is jumping to conclusions.
James Miller,"If it had been her on the chopping block, I would've faced the music and made it a tie again. That way me and Bobby Jon would've had to pull the bad rock."
James Miller,It's really music. It's not just ringing bells.

James Miller,"It's hard to move in it because it's so wet, heavy and slippery."
James Miller,really improved their game.
James Miller,There's no doubt he's making a profit.
James Miller,"We are really in a crisis. The implications are that we are going to be in deep, deep trouble. The whole technology thing is happening elsewhere, and we are not keeping pace."

Jeff Miller,"If we don't get our execution right against these blokes, they can put 50 points on you in the blink of an eye."
Jeff Miller,Caleb really gave us an injection of strong running and enthusiasm and we would have been a lot closer to the Chiefs if more players had shown that.

Jeff Miller,"This is not a design that we can live with, or for that matter that the frog can live with."
Jeff Miller,"Aside from the results on paper (one win from seven matches) it's been an enjoyable year. The commitment from the players is undisputed. Everyone is trying their hearts out in every game, bar possibly the Chiefs match."
Jeff Miller,I said he would be welcome. He's the Australia coach. I'm here to make sure our boys have the best opportunity to represent Australia so my feelings don't come into play at all.
Jeff Miller,The establishment of a global operations centre in India is an extension of our integrated service capabilities as we further expand our global business.
Joaquin Miller,Let us go and talk with the poets. (on arriving in San Francisco)

Joaquin Miller,The biggest dog has been a pup
John Miller,"I don't think he realized it was steroids, and that it was dangerous and that he would get in trouble for it, and he found that out later on."
John Miller,This is an ongoing struggle.
John Miller,Everybody is hyped because we're playing against players we played against in high school.
John Miller,We want the highest price possible. You have to weigh that against some risk: the timing of the sale and how long it could take to arrange financing. So sometimes it does make sense to take a lower price.
John Miller,"Needless to say, we're delighted. This is progress, and we agree with the steps they've taken."
John Miller,The 4 p.m. burning law is one of the most effective tools we have in the prevention of wildfires.
John Miller,Widespread understanding of the truth commission's report and recommendations is essential in charting a course of justice for victims.
John Miller,"For many years, it was just him and his mom. She really did a great job raising him."
John Miller,"[But New York police officials said they had never seen such reports discounting the information because of its specificity, and at least one senior F.B.I. official took issue with that version of events.] Nothing is discounted if it can be investigated, ... There was plenty to investigate here, and any judgments about the veracity of the threat would not have been made until the investigation is done."
John Miller,"Just in Iraq alone, we're throwing away our future and funds that could be used to solve problems here."

Jonathan Miller,"What I did was a terrible thing, ... Words cannot describe how I'd feel if someone took my daughter away. I can still watch my daughter grow [while in prison]. I took that away from you, and for that I am so, so sorry."
Jonathan Miller,"Humor is vague, runaway stuff that hisses around the fissures and crevices of the mind, like some sort of loose physic gas"
Jonathan Miller,"Like many fast-growing companies, we went through a period where cost management was not a priority. That ends now,"
Jonathan Miller,"Wall Street accounts for only about 6 percent of the jobs in New York but 25 percent of the economic activity. Every time there's an up-tick in bonuses, there's an up-tick in the real estate market."
Jonathan Miller,The foyer at Covent Garden looks like Harrods food hall has offered up its dead
Jonathan Miller,I wasn't driven into medicine by a social conscience but by rampant curiosity.
Jonathan Miller,What makes literature interesting is that it does not survive its translation. The characters in a novel are made out of the sentences. That's what their substance is.
Jonathan Miller,This is the second consecutive quarter where we've seen moderating appreciation. The market has appeared to make a transition from a double-digit frenzied growth to a more modest growth.
Judith Miller,I agreed to the new ground rules because I knew that Mr. Libby had once worked on Capitol Hill. I assumed Mr. Libby did not want the White House to be seen as attacking Mr. Wilson.
Judith Miller,"[The Times report said the newspaper's reputation has suffered.] Neither The Times nor its cause has emerged unbruised. ... Even as the paper asked for the public's support, it was unable to answer its questions. ... The entire thing."
Judith Miller,"He asserted that George J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, had never even heard of Mr. Wilson. Veep didn't know of Joe Wilson."

Judith Miller,"Mr. Fitzgerald asked if I had discussed classified information with Mr. Libby. I said I believe so, but could not be sure."

Judith Miller,"I was a journalist doing my job, protecting my source until my source freed me to perform my civic duty to testify."
Judith Miller,the institution most in danger would be the newspaper in your hands.
Judith Miller,under rather challenging circumstances.
Judith Miller,I did the best I could under rather challenging circumstances.
Judith Miller,I did not go to jail to protect wrongdoing. I did not go to jail to get a large book contract or to martyr myself. Anyone who thinks I would spend 85 days in jail as a canny career move knows nothing about jail and nothing about me.
Judith Miller,I served 85 days in jail because of my belief in the importance of upholding the confidential relationship that journalists have with their sources.
Judith Miller,"I served 85 days in jail because of my belief in the importance of upholding the confidential relationship journalists have with their sources, ... Believe me, I did not want to be in jail."
Judith Miller,"I served 85 days in jail because of my belief in the importance of upholding the confidential relationship journalists have with their sources, ... Believe me, I did not want to be in jail. But I would have stayed even longer."
Larry Miller,He's got a strong vision and a strong will of what he wants to do. . . . It's the stuff of which governors are made to look good or bad.
Larry Miller,Wendy's has become a 'Pandora's Box' of shareholder value. We think this could ultimately result in deeper and quicker cost cuts at the core Wendy's brand.
Larry Miller,"Wendy's has become a 'Pandora's Box' of shareholder value. We think this could ultimately result in deeper, and quicker cost cuts at the core Wendy's brand."
Larry Miller,"Europe was a big surprise. The U.S. continues to perform and European sales are steadily improving, which could lead to better margins and upward EPS (earnings per share) revisions in 2006."
Larry Miller,"Any time we can get together and talk about an issue, I think it should be considered progress. I'd like to thank Representative Bradley for putting this committee hearing together. We look forward to working with the mineral rights groups and our elected leaders on a solution."
Larry Miller,"[It's almost impossible to fire a poor-performing teacher, Schwarzenegger said.] No, you're wrong, ... No, I'm not going to let you finish because you're wrong."
Larry Miller,"It was very clear these people live with very real fear of emotional and physical harm, even now. Learning that they live in that world, that causes me to rethink and be more sensitive to some of the actions I do may have unintended consequences."
Larry Miller,"The premium valuation is warranted in our view given the consistently high level of execution, the expansion into other revenue-driving channels such as entertainment and food ... and the improvement in both U.S. and international profitability."
Larry Miller,"Finally, we got some confidence tonight -- for one night. We believed we could win."

Larry Miller,"I did not attend a dinner or lunch on this particular date in Memphis. Under no circumstances would I have left the Finance Ways and Means Committee, driven to Memphis for dinner and come back."
Larry Miller,"They are a bunch of pampered babies. We need some guys with some guts and some fire down the stretch. It wouldn't hurt me to turn over all 15 guys, but the trading deadline has passed and there's nothing we can do."
Larry Miller,"I was asleep, in the upstairs bedroom, in the rear of the house. There was this tremendous crash, there was a terrible wind force hitting my body, and then I blanked out."
Larry Miller,"Manufacturers are making products kosher to get in on that market, plus more people are looking for kosher."
Larry Miller,"Women say they have sexual thoughts too. They have no idea. It's the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. If they knew what we were really thinking, they'd never stop slapping us."
Lee Miller,"[Imagine you're negotiating on someone else's behalf: It's hard for everyone to negotiate for themselves, but women especially so, Miller noted. So pretend you're representing a client's best interests.] If you do your homework you will know what is fair and reasonable to ask for, ... Don't settle for less."
Lee Miller,"The distribution of essential commodities is going well, ... We are trying to get more supplies on the way, and the distribution seems to be working well."
Lee Miller,I still remember watching on television when Gary McSwegan scored a brilliant equaliser against Marseille that put Rangers on the way in the Champions League in 1992. And I went to a few of the Celtic home games in their run to the UEFA Cup final two years ago. It is the goals that you remember. Scoring them in Europe is a great way to make a name for yourself and get the limelight.
Lee Miller,The issue is putting two monstrous obelisks in the middle of a bucolic area. The technology exists to lower these things substantially below the tree line.
Lee Miller,"Our primary task is to get correct information out there. We find a lot of people have heard about the referendum, but have heard rumors that are wrong."
Lee Miller,Walter told me as long as I kept scoring goals and kept up my level of performance I had nothing to worry about. Fortunately I managed to score a couple of goals against Motherwell last weekend and another one against Inverness on Sunday so that was a decent response.
Lee Miller,"People talk about goals, goals, goals but the important thing is to win the game. If we win 1-0 and it's an own goal we will take it."
Lee Miller,"Court is only a recourse for those people who have broken communication with the company. If [lenders] cannot communicate with you at all, some companies view justice court as a chance to, as they say, kick it up a notch."
Marcus Miller,"After conducting extensive market research, we found that Mr. Jim's customers were passionate and loyal, but Mr. Jim's did not have a consistent brand image. Working with the team at Mr. Jim's, we developed a new branding campaign to tell their unique story."
Marcus Miller,"We learned a lot more from how we played tonight, than what happened last night (a 12-2 win over Washington). Good teams like West quickly exposed some of the things we need to work on."
Marcus Miller,"Kanye West took Sean Carter's grown man look to a different level. I remember when white dudes were the only ones who wore blazers and jeans. Now you gotta look like that to even go to the club,"
Marcus Miller,"Hip-hop influences everything and everybody. It's not just music. It's...a culture. Guys like the clean look now ever since Jay-Z said, 'and I don't wear jerseys no mo I'm 30 plus, give me a fresh pair of jeans and a button up'. Before that, Jay-Z had everyone wearing jerseys. Jerseys were the thing. But now it's different."
Marcus Miller,"It looks like somebody took a machine gun, shot out all the windows and put holes in the cars. All of our 110 cars sustained some kind of damage."
Marvin Miller,"It's not good enough (for the NHLPA) to say they've done it like this in the past, ... That's just an admission of guilt. They've clearly violated their constitution and it makes it possible that they could be looking at a civil and criminal offense."
Marvin Miller,"We can build up to about a hundred units right now with the water that's available on the land right now. But to go past that we're going to have to build a new water pipe, a water main to the small town of Dolton. That's where the water is and that's about ten miles south of where we're going to be,"
Marvin Miller,"I'm just happy to be here. I'm so thankful to have so many people, kids and everything, and such nice neighbors."
Marvin Miller,"You're not just talking about 2 teams and 50 jobs. You're talking about establishing a precedent that the owners can eliminate jobs. That would be very troubling for players,"
Marvin Miller,We hope to sit down with them and address their concerns.
Marvin Miller,"This is a molehill case, and the government is going to have to make a mountain out of it."
Marvin Miller,They've clearly violated their constitution and it makes it possible that they could be looking at a civil and criminal offence.

Matt Miller,"It's just way over what we plan for, even planning for emergencies."
Matt Miller,"I hate to say it, but I ain't never seen anything like it,"
Matt Miller,I like when he flies the kite inside the house. It's so funny.
Matt Miller,"Already, we've been down to Lower Greenville. We've tried to see the sights, and we've had some really good food."
Matt Miller,He has never taken any action because of a contribution. He supported the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail because it was a huge economic engine that benefited the constituents of the 13th District. And that's beyond dispute.
Merton Miller,"What counts is what you do with your money, not where it came from."
Merton Miller,You only need to make one big score in finance to be a hero forever.

Mike Miller,"From our perspective, there is no violation."
Mike Miller,"It's going to be operated the same as it is now but instead of Suburban doing the management, it's going to be me personally."
Mike Miller,Nothing irritates me more than someone campaigning to be elected to a seat and breaking the law of the land. I'd like to see the city adopt a zero tolerance on any sign in a right-of-way.
Mike Miller,I'm proud of them. Our players did a great job.
Mike Miller,"It boils down to common sense: We just don't want or need to live in a moldy, contaminated environment,"
Mike Miller,My relationship with Coach was good enough that it drew me from South Dakota. That's a long way to go to a school. He was basically like my father up there. You've got to be comfortable with him if you are going to go that far away.
Mike Miller,"We are pleased to extend the affiliation agreement as the top affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. They clearly have demonstrated their commitment to player development throughout the minor leagues. Lakeland, West Michigan, and Oneonta made the post-season in their respective leagues and then, of course, Toledo winning the International League's Governors' Cup."
Mike Miller,"We need some action. We need some action quickly,"
Mike Miller,We played good basketball. I really was pleased. I thought maybe we played with our highest energy level we did all year. I really thought we played with focus. It was a good college basketball game. They were able to make one more play.
Nicole Miller,"A dress is an entire outfit. You don't have to worry if everything works together. You avoid that feeling of getting up in the morning, where you have a top to wear, but you can't find a skirt."
Nicole Miller,It's really a lot of fun. But every season it seems that I come up with new silhouette ideas that seem to take hold and have a lot of longevity.
Nicole Miller,"There's a new person drinking a cup of coffee outside their home every day, and there's also someone going from one cup to two."
Reggie Miller,"Until Indiana shows me they've solved their chemistry problems, you have to go with a team that doesn't argue, that gets the job done at the end of the day. Any little thing can set Indiana off."

Reggie Miller,"Sometimes they're old ladies, old gentlemen, and sometimes they're there [just] to watch the game."
Rich Miller,is suspended the rest of this season and the start of next.
Rich Miller,"It's a great product that will add a considerable boost to the level of quality we offer. In addition, this lotion doesn't copy anything else we sell. It's completely original."
Rich Miller,"He can pitch in the morning, at 12:15 (afternoon) and definitely at night."
Rich Miller,"I can't believe I'm saying this but if we get a choice and if it costs us less, I say why not. If we are getting options and it costs less, why not grab it."
Richard Miller,"While most New Zealanders consider jobs plentiful, if less well paid, than this time last year, they are increasingly pessimistic about job opportunities over the year ahead."
Richard Miller,"It was an outstanding show. She's a great show person, and she did a superb job. There was really something for everybody. I looked around and could just see smiles on everyone's faces. It was a fantastic show and everyone had a really great evening."
Richard Miller,We've been fighting for HB 4756 and we've been fighting for it for the past five years. AAA is very much in support of this. We feel it's the critical gap in an otherwise comprehensive GDL law.
Richard Miller,"It's important to remember that the audience for Immersion Days was the design teams, and the panels were put together with that in mind. The purpose was to immerse the teams in the issues, and they have had two and a half extremely full days of panels, luncheons and presentations to that end."
Richard Miller,It is not enough for politicians to wear white bands. They had the power to turn commitment into reality in 2005 and they failed to rise fully to the challenge.

Robert Miller,"This has been one of the most difficult transitions, getting scientists to understand accountability in the short term."
Robert Miller,"While major obstacles and difficult issues remain to be resolved, the discussions to date with GM and our major unions helped frame the concerns and objectives of each organization."
Robert Miller,"Are these guys really Robin Hood and his Merry Men as they claim, or Genghis Khan and the Mongol hordes?"
Robert Miller,It was a zoo but I think they got all of the animals in the cage.
Robert Miller,A person that knows what he wants is dangerous.
Robert Miller,"We took this action because we are determined to achieve competitiveness for Delphi's core U.S. operations, and the key to accomplishing that goal is reducing these costs as soon as possible. We simply cannot afford to continue to be encumbered by high legacy issues and burdensome restrictions under current labor agreements that impair our ability to compete."
Robert Miller,"We took this action because we are determined to achieve competitiveness for Delphi's core U.S. operations, and the key to accomplishing that goal is reducing these costs as soon as possible, ... We simply cannot afford to continue to be encumbered by high legacy issues and burdensome restrictions under current labor agreements that impair our ability to compete."
Roger Miller,We think what she has decided to do is very heart-warming. It's nice that she wants to help others who don't have very much.
Roger Miller,I didn't believe he would go out with his record the way it was. I think he's going to come back and do some damage and then possibly next year maybe quit.
Roger Miller,I want my music to leave an indelible mark.
Roger Miller,I always took a great deal of pride in being original.
Roger Miller,It's one thing to have talent. It's another to figure out how to use it.
Roger Miller,"Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet."
Ryan Miller,That's something we take pride in. It's just implied now. I don't even think we have to mention it. We wanted to come back and just play hard.
Ryan Miller,"It feels good to be recognized as a potential athlete, we'll see how it turns out. There's still another week and there's some time during the games where I could head over there and I'd be thrilled to do it, but I'm just going to concentrate on the next three games and a little break, and if the Olympics comes up, I'll be happy."
Ryan Miller,We're in a funk for whatever reason. We got to put the joy back in our game.
Ryan Miller,"I'm disappointed it worked out this way. The Olympics are a great honor, and I'm sorry I'm probably going to miss out on it. I'm just moving forward with my career, and I think I'm on a good path right now."
Ryan Miller,"They're a pretty intense crowd. J.P.'s laying on the ice, visibly in pain and they're giving it to him. That's just the nature of the city. They're not going to take any prisoners."
Ryan Miller,They're still so talented when they're dancing down the ice.
Shannon Miller,"It was a very similar situation. It was players that were unhappy and causing problems (in 2002). As a coach, you try to carry them as long as you can. There comes a point where you are no longer responsible to carry everyone."
Shannon Miller,We have to get jobs to support ourselves. We can't sit around for six months like it's vacation.
Shannon Miller,One of the main goals of D.I. is teamwork. We really talk about this often during our practices. I always tell them to have fun and show everyone else how you all can shine in your very own way too.
Shannon Miller,"Gymnastics has helped me so much, how to be dedicated to something, how to work hard to acheive your goals, also to be organized, and how to try and balance my life out. I think it's helped me in school too,because it's kept me organized and I'm always striving for a goal."
Shannon Miller,Marin is one of those silent leaders who lead just through sheer work ethic and by example.
Shannon Miller,We do have depth. We need team chemistry and discipline and tonight it went in. I attribute that to chemistry.
Shannon Miller,"When you grow up on camera and in the public eye, you feel you have to put forth this image. I just took that to the extreme and there was a lot of pressure on me."

Shannon Miller,"Gymnastics uses every single part of your body, every little tiny muscle that you never even knew."
Shannon Miller,"Gymnastics is the type of sport where you can't take something that gives you more energy. Something may be great for the vault, but then you have the bars after it and you have to be more sedate for that."
Shannon Miller,For the most part I'll probably do floor exercise and balance beam. Those are the two things that I do.
Shannon Miller,"For me, one of the pitfalls was trying to be perfect to everyone at all times instead of just being me and understanding that everyone's human."

Wentworth Miller,"You've got 150 years of fear and violence and pain soaked into those walls, but the overall mood there is one of despair."
Wentworth Miller,"I remember my father saying one word to me as I would walk out to school every day: 'increments.' Every test, every quiz, every conversation with the teacher, it all added up to the final grade, which would affect where you went off to college and the rest of your life. All those little bits and pieces added up to something larger,"
Wentworth Miller,"There's 150 years of fear, violence and pain soaked into those walls, ... The overall mood there is one of despair, and filming there gives the show grit and authenticity."

Wright Mills,"In the world of the celebrity, the hierarchy of publicity has replaced the hierarchy of descent and even of great wealth."
Wright Mills,"The professional celebrity, male and female, is the crowning result of the star system of a society that makes a fetish of competition.

Kevin Millwood,"It's probably our biggest win to date. This is fun, man. Everybody around here is having a good time."
Kevin Millwood,"It's fun, man. I think it's better before the games than after the games. The guys are relaxed, they're having a good time. It's just like it was in spring training, in March, April, May. We're the same team we were then. We're playing better now than we did then."
Kevin Millwood,A guy who hasn't accomplished much and he dogs our guys?

Slobodan Milosevic,We have no quarrel with America. We all know NATO is the strongest military machine in the world. We simply want them to stop being so busy with our country and worry about their own problems.

Omar Minaya,We'll let his performance dictate all that. I think we'll probably have to pull him back a little bit at first. A lot of young guys want to get right after it ... We're not in the business of rushing young pitchers.
Omar Minaya,One of the reasons we brought him in this spring is his passion. His passion is something that's contagious.

Luis Miranda,"It shouldn't surprise anyone that the President who let the oil and gas industry write the country's energy policy hasn't backed up his promise to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil with real action. Sadly, the President doesn't have much credibility left. Instead of insulting the staff of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the voters of Colorado with a PR stunt and a lot of hot air, President Bush should join Democrats in working to promote true energy independence by restoring funding for research into renewable sources of energy that will create jobs, enhance our national security, and keep our economy the strongest in the world."
Luis Miranda,These new revelations make it clear that the administration and the foreign government-owned company have not been forthcoming with the American people.

Steve Miskin,It's a false argument to say anybody is going to be disenfranchised. The only ones that are going to be disenfranchised are the ones trying to commit fraud. What are [Democrats] hiding from? What are they scared of?
Angela Missoni,"[Color, always an attraction in any Missoni collection, is here in abundance -- but more subdued.] Amber, gold, orange, kind of light olive-greens and yellow, but very mixed, ... They're never, never precise colors. Lots of mixture. Lots of soft interpretation."
Angela Missoni,"The direction of the collection is it's a very precise look, strict, proportions are controlled, ... It's the first time we are introducing wovens and this also helps in a way to give more structure to the collection."

John Mitchell,The demands of the entitlement system are here. This has major implications for an aging population facing past promises made in a very different world. All of these unfunded liabilities are coming together.
John Mitchell,Frustrated love has been the incentive for many great works.
John Mitchell,"In the United States, when income goes up, that doesn't necessarily mean consumers will spend more on food. They may spend more on the way food is prepared. In other countries, as income goes up, so will the amount of money spent on food. A rapid demand for food will take place."

Kevin Mitchell,The security build-up has practically doubled the amount of time it takes for checking in at airports.
Kevin Mitchell,"It's nothing but a lost opportunity as they drag this out and frustrate travelers, for some of whom this is a real burden, ... If this were some mundane issue, it's not a surprise this would drag on. But to fall on something that so touches the individual travelers is a serious mistake. Each of them go out and tells 10 people, and they all tell 10 people. It's very bad form and publicity."
Kevin Mitchell,"We swam all through the night and successfully completed one length in 14 hours and four minutes but the conditions were so bad we couldn't go on,"

Kevin Mitchell,"Business travelers and companies that fund the travel have been through the drill, they're a bit jaundiced (about code levels) at this point."
Kevin Mitchell,"It's a little early to see the impact now. Companies are now just beginning to form committees. But there is a tension in a lot of companies, ... Until the headline reads 'Human-to-human transmission,' there's no reason to trigger those changes in travel policy. But if that happens, we could end up with a lot fewer airlines globally. I think as we see images of airport quarantine rooms, people will get message that flying isn't a good idea."
Kim Mitchell,Some of their stories are so moving. Some of those kids have been through so much and at so young. They realize where they went wrong and the changes they need to make.

Pat Mitchell,"I guess we have to take credit for this whole thing, ... One year for Christmas, Mike asked for a tacky lawn decoration, and I bought him a flamingo. That year he brought it with him to Old Threshers, and that little flamingo became our mascot."

Sam Mitchell,I thought all the guys played well. The young guys played well when we had to give other guys rest.
Sam Mitchell,We went to a zone and started to communicate. They had been posting us up and giving us trouble.
Sam Mitchell,"I feel good, I'm happy for those guys in there, ... Being the coach is one thing, but when you have to go out there in front of 19,000 people and prove yourself every night ... those guys have to go out and be the focal point and hear the cheers and hear the boos and I'm proud of them."
Sam Mitchell,"Other than winning the basketball game, I'm pleased with our effort,"
Sam Mitchell,"[The Bulls] played hard. There were three loose balls after we made a run, and those guys got on the floor."

Jessica Mitford,"Gracious dying is a huge, macabre and expensive joke on the American public."
Jessica Mitford,I have nothing against undertakers personally. It's just that I wouldn't want one to bury my sister.

Issey Miyake,"Even when I work with computers, with high technology, I always try to put in the touch of the hand."

Shigeru Miyamoto,I think Zelda 64 is utilizing about 90 percent of the N64 potential. When we made Mario 64 we were simply utilizing 60 to 70 percent. So we have come a long way I believe.

Rather, in this day and age, he sees the two enterprises - design and television - working as one.] Synergistically - I hate that word; it's so 90's - but each of these projects feeds one another, ... I don't know how the clothes can exist without the show, and I don't know how the show can exist without the clothes."
Isaac Mizrahi,"The thing is, I am very connected to popular culture, I am. And I watch 'Will & Grace' and I watch 'My Name is Earl' and I watch prime-time television a lot and every other joke is about pubic hair ... So I don't feel it's wrong to talk about that on the red carpet."
Isaac Mizrahi,"You try to overcome this day to day, primarily through communication. They have understood that as much as it hurts, there are things you must slightly turn away from."
Isaac Mizrahi,All of my research is about the middle class in 1965. It's about servicing those people in the ?60s. What do jockey shorts look like in the '60s? That actually was one of my favorite fittings on Patrick. The jockey short fitting!

Isaac Mizrahi,I don't want to offend people.
Isaac Mizrahi,I don't like people to feel completely described by the clothes they wear of mine. I want them to feel that they're describing themselves.
Isaac Mizrahi,How do I do it? I don't know how I wouldn't do it - that's the thing.
Isaac Mizrahi,"Half the time I don't even think about it, I just throw something on because I'm so late or so busy."
Isaac Mizrahi,"Everyone asks, Will he make it, will she make it? You never make it."
Isaac Mizrahi,Either it works or it doesn't.
Isaac Mizrahi,I'm not trying to be the next Joan Rivers.
Isaac Mizrahi,Most of my life I was occupied with American television and American food. My ethnicity was my choice. It still is.
Isaac Mizrahi,"All I want are high heels, high heels. If I was a girl, I'd wear a lot of high heels. High, stiletto heels."
Isaac Mizrahi,"You're not working with models, you're working with real women who have, like, anatomy. Models do not have anatomy."
Isaac Mizrahi,This is what I like about being a designer: You can't really get it until you see it.
Harry Moberly,"We certainly would hope it would be received well and that what we've done _ in education at all levels, and human services _ would be appreciated. We hope that that's the case. We think it's a budget that moves Kentucky forward."
Harry Moberly,"We realize that the legislative process is a compromise. We won't get everything that we want, and he (Fletcher) won't get everything he wants and the Senate won't get everything they want."
Harry Moberly,I think we'll have some major points of agreement.
Mark Mobius,"The worst risk would be the politicization of the citizens in Hong Kong, where they become active politically and begin to demonstrate and oppose policies on the mainland,"
Mark Mobius,"The worst risk would be the politicization of the citizens in Hong Kong, where they become active politically and begin to demonstrate and oppose policies on the mainland."
Mark Mobius,Some people mistake his reticence to mean a lack of dynamism. He's been quiet because the spotlight has not been on him. I think Victor Li will surprise a lot of people with his ability.
Mark Mobius,"There's no reason to sell, because earnings growth is keeping pace with share prices. We're in an amazing period of history for many of these markets."
Mark Mobius,"It's quite difficult to ascertain the real hits on earnings, as a lot will depend on how fast the government is to implement the new price mechanism, and how high oil prices will go from here."
Mark Mobius,"We're not at the danger stage yet, but we are at danger of getting there - and history does repeat itself."
Mark Mobius,There is an example of a company that will not be impacted by a Y2K problem. They are so well diversified that problems in one area won't impact other areas.
Mark Mobius,One of the problems in Latin America is that the growth rate in the economies has not been as fast as in Asia. The reason for that is the governments' policies.
Mike Modano,"I saw the voting and it would be tough to accept that, considering the way I played, ... But being voted in by the fans, it's a little bit of an honor and a commitment. And being here made it an easy choice."
Mike Modano,"The guys who are big and physical who took up a lot of space are now having to move their feet and keep their heads up. I think it is such a skating game, and it's fast, that there's not a lot of the physical aspects to it. It makes the game better and a lot more fun to watch. It's about positioning on the ice and being able to skate. You've got to get into body position or you're going to be left behind."
Mike Modano,"WeÂ´re just kind of easing into things and getting a feel for the new rules, which I think is going to make a big impact on the game, ... ItÂ´s going to really change it around, probably give guys time and space to make plays. YouÂ´re probably going to see a lot more goals."
Mike Modano,"We're just kind of easing into things and getting a feel for the new rules, which I think is going to make a big impact on the game, ... It's going to really change it around, probably give guys time and space to make plays. You're probably going to see a lot more goals."
Mike Modano,"We're just kind of easing into things and getting a feel for the new rules, which I think is going to make a big impact on the game."
Mike Modano,"That's tough. You like to have those timeouts to get a minute or two rest, so we keep our shifts shorter to keep guys fresh. It makes it a quicker game because there are more changes."
Mike Modano,I don't know if that's nerves or [being] scared to make mistakes. You can sense a little tentativeness to our game.
Mike Modano,"A lot of what they got, we gave them. We made too many mistakes early, and we had turnovers. You can't do that against a good team on the road and expect to win."
Mike Modano,"His mind for the game and the way he thought the game out, he obviously had those tendencies and you could see it a little bit in the back of his mind that he was kind of leaning towards that after he was done playing."
Mike Modano,"Brian was strictly a shooter who had great hands, was tough to move and made a living in front of that net. It has been fun chasing those numbers. Hopefully, I can add to them so that no one else can get them."
Mike Modano,You always want to get off to a great start and kind of settle into the season and kind of take a deep breath and relax. It's a plus to get those numbers early.
Mike Modano,"You hope that one of these guys comes through and demands some ice time. At 20, 21, they probably weren't ready, but now at 23 or 24, they're more confident and comfortable."
Mike Modano,"When you go, you go hard, but you have to pace yourselves, too."
Mike Modano,"For those guys, it's been kind of a habit in Detroit."
Mike Modano,I want to be out there on the ice when the game is on the line. I want to be the one who decides games.
Mike Modano,"The tough part is that you feel like we deserve a better fate. The way we've been playing, with the type of urgency ... the skating has been there. It's exactly what we wanted to do. But it's a fine line over here."
Mike Modano,"I could stand here and give you all sorts of excuses about why I had the season I did in 2003-04, but I have vowed to be proactive ... in everything I do this season,"
Mike Modano,"Maybe we need some new blood in there. You'd think USA Hockey would be more of a well-oiled operation. Basically, we were on our own as far as flights, hotels, tickets, stuff we normally wouldn't have to worry about and we could just focus on hockey."
Mike Modano,"It's our ability to stay with the game plan and not really veer off too much. If we're behind, we don't start trying low percentage plays, we stick with it and keep the puck going forward and hopefully we'll get a break."
Mike Modano,I go back to the ability to make plays with the puck and being creative and doing things we had done all season long. I don't know if that's nerves or [being] scared to make mistakes.
Mike Modano,"Our ability to make plays and do things we've done well all season, all of the sudden to not have that happen, I think everybody has got questions why that's happening and why that is."
Lalit Modi,We have tremendous revenue potential in the game and the board is in a unique position to benefit from it as we create and own the rights to cricket in perpetuity. No one in the country has the kind of property we have.
Lalit Modi,We got the clearance yesterday (Wednesday) from the government for these matches.
Lalit Modi,The idea of a BCCI channel is still alive and we are also planning an inter-city cricket league in a day-night format.
Lalit Modi,I have been surprised yet again with my estimates. This is magic. It shows what cricket is all about in this country.
Lalit Modi,The emphasis of the marketing committee was to raise revenue for the ruling body and one of our plans is to have a production house for the BCCI that would generate funds through media rights.
Lalit Modi,We've not signed any agreement to play in future editions and we've made our position very clear to (world governing body) the ICC many times.
Tanuvasa Moe,"His philosophy is to swarm to the ball. If someone misses a tackle, another guy will be right behind."
Tanuvasa Moe,"It was exciting to get the call. When your turn comes, you'd better take advantage of it, because it can go to the next guy if you don't do the job."
Tanuvasa Moe,"That's terrible. I don't like to hear when people get hurt. But we're playing football, and injuries happen. I feel really bad for him, and I hope he gets better."
Mahathir Mohamad,"We were also able to clear up a few minor bilateral issues regarding trade and some logging issues, ... There is some problem about logging at the border, trading at the border, border crossings et cetera."
Mahathir Mohamad,"It is obvious that we are short of scientists. With what we have, it may not be possible for us to compete (in terms of) innovation,"
Mahathir Mohamad,Now Australia is basically European and it has made clear to the rest of the world it is the deputy sheriff to America.
Mahathir Mohamad,"Australia is basically European and it has made clear to the rest of the world that it is the deputy sheriff for America. Therefore Australia's views would represent not the East, but the views representing the stand of America."
Mahathir Mohamad,"I am quite sure the court has given this sentence because the court thinks that is the right punishment for whatever,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"This meeting was really meant to keep us close together and up to date on each other's problems and how we can resolve these problems and also to encourage cooperation in the economic field and the cultural (arena),"
Mahathir Mohamad,The police have been generally blamed but we will have to find out in detail ...surely we cannot blame the whole police force.
Mahathir Mohamad,"I was also following something my mother taught me. When you are enjoying a real good meal, stop when the food is still good. So, I guess it's good for me to stop now,"
Mahathir Mohamad,We had a casual chat. I was so inspired that I invited him to open A Beautiful Mind. ... What do I know about the arts?
Mahathir Mohamad,"I think this is good because we can exchange the information about the movement and the activities of these people,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"It is Indonesia's problem and we hope whatever they do brings good to Indonesia,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"They hate Malaysia, especially the current leadership, and hate it extremely."
Mahathir Mohamad,"By and large, I think other members of the U.S. government understand the way we deal with our problems in Malaysia."
Mahathir Mohamad,"It is true that somebody paid but it was not the (Malaysian) government. I understood some people paid a sum of money to lobbyists in America but I do not know who these people were, and it was not the Malaysian government."
Mahathir Mohamad,"We can predict that in the future, the borders of independent nations will be breached at the whims and fancies of the superpowers,"
Mahathir Mohamad,exposing their evil intent when it introduced the concept of globalization and a borderless world.
Mahathir Mohamad,"Despite the less than favourable external environment, growth is estimated at 5.0 percent for 2005,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"that he was prepared to step down after 17 years as prime minister of Malaysia, once the economy stabilizes."
Mahathir Mohamad,"If that is everybody's desire we will have to consider it,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"He did not raise anything about democracy or human rights in Malaysia,"
Mahathir Mohamad,This means that democracy will not exist and dictatorship by foreign powers with their puppet governments will be the system of the world.
Mahathir Mohamad,"It is the good life that democracy brings that counts, not democracy per se."
Mahathir Mohamad,"The economic crisis has impoverished ASEAN economies and undermined national stability,"
Mahathir Mohamad,That is their system. It is not corruption at all.
Mahathir Mohamad,"I'm not going to lose any sleep ... My conscience is clear,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"I'm not going to lose any sleep, ... I still believe that he's guilty. My conscience is clear."
Mahathir Mohamad,"Until the international community agrees on an international regime that will remove the kind of dangers we have been exposed to, we will have to continue with our controls."
Mahathir Mohamad,example of selfless devotion to charity. I hope she can be a good example to all charity workers and philanthropists.
Mahathir Mohamad,"For agreeing to that, I think we should take action to lift sanctions,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"It shows that we are tough. We had promised to take action against terrorists, whether they are locals or foreigners creating trouble in our country, we detained them,"
Mahathir Mohamad,"We will not take any action or support this action,"
Dominique Moisi,"This problem is exploding in the face of the government. They have politicized it so much they are making fools of themselves. There's the image of Paris burning and that is very, very bad."
Dominique Moisi,I don't think that it is impossible to carry out reform in France. The real crisis is a crisis of confidence.
Dominique Moisi,Chirac is saying: France is adapting. We are applying the same strategic thought but to deeply different circumstances.
Moliere,Birth is nothing where virtue is not
Moliere,Things only have the value that we give them
Moliere,I would like to be like my father and all the rest of my ancestors who never married
Moliere,One should examine oneself for a very long time before thinking of condemning others
Moliere,If you suppress grief too much it can well redouble

Moliere,I assure you that a learned fool is more foolish than an ignorant fool
Moliere,"According to the saying of an ancient philosopher, one should eat to live, and not live to eat"
Moliere,"Hypocrisy is a fashionable vice, and all fashionable vices pass for virtue"
Moliere,The beautiful eyes of my cash-box.
Moliere,"If everyone were clothed with integrity, if every heart were just, frank, kindly, the other virtues would be well-night useless, since their chief purpose is to make us bear with patience the injustice of our fellows."
Moliere,What the devil did he want in that galley?
Moliere,"Don't appear so scholarly, pray.  Humanize your talk, and speak to be understood."
Moliere,"A wise man is superior to any insults which can be put upon him, and the best reply to unseemly behavior is patience and moderation."

Moliere Moliere,"Of all the noises known to man, opera is the most expensive."
Moliere Moliere,"The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it."
Moliere Moliere,People of quality know everything without ever having learned anything.
Moliere Moliere,Some of the most famous books are the least worth reading. Their fame was due to their having done something that needed to be doing in their day. The work is done and the virtue of the book has expired.
Moliere Moliere,"It is not only what we do, but also what we do not do, for which we are accountable."
Moliere MoliFre,"I always write a good first line, but I have trouble in writing the others."
Moliere MoliFre,He must have killed a lot of men to have made so much money.
Moliere MoliFre,"We often marry in despair, so that we repent of it all our life after."
Moliere MoliFre,Long is the road from conception to completion.
Moliere MoliFre,We always speak well when we manage to be understood.
Paul Molitor,"I hope Rollins goes as long as he can; it's good for the game. I've got no problem with (him surpassing Molitor). But it's been nice that no one's reached that number (39) since 1987, which is a pretty long time. Eventually someone's going to pass it, and this guy seems like he's on track to do it, so I hope he does."
Paul Molitor,"You do what you can to prevent cancer, and when you get it, you do what you can to fight it. That's what we're trying to let people know; that there is a support team out there to try to help them do that,"
Paul Molitor,It happened so quickly that baseball didn't adjust. There are aberrations; Minnesota and Montreal are playing well. The fact is you have to be high on the revenue list to reach the post-season.
Paul Molitor,There's a certain crispness to the sound of the ball coming off his bat that only a few players have. It's because he's so strong.
Ted Molter,"It's like living in the shadow of an older brother. The San Diego Zoo is world-renowned; it's done amazing things over the years. We don't want the park to falter, to get behind the times."
Ted Molter,"Creating some humor, creating some fun to energize people was our intent."
Ted Molter,"We don't have to rush. The train will still operate, still give guests a good experience. It is more important to do it right."
Steven Monaco,It sucks not knowing
Steven Monaco,"It's not grudges that I hold, it's just bad memories I can't forget"
Steven Monaco,"If hope didn't exist, neither would I"
Steven Monaco,Experience is the greatest teacher of all
Walter Mondale,"I've traveled more this year than any other living human being, and if I'd traveled any more I wouldn't be living."
Walter Mondale,"By instinct and tradition, I don't like the thing. I like to look someone in the eye."
Walter Mondale,"A lot of people say `How's your dad?' A lot of people say I look like him,"
Walter Mondale,What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around Japanese computers?
Walter Mondale,We were marginalized in the public eye as a presidential party. What Clinton did is an enormous accomplishment. I myself even wondered if we'd do it again.
Robert Mondavi,Critics have done the wine industry a lot of good overall.
Robert Mondavi,Wine has been with civilized man from the beginning.
Robert Mondavi,"Whether I played marbles, whether I played football or slam anything else, I wanted to excel."
Robert Mondavi,We want to raise the art of living well.
Robert Mondavi,We definitely need to get the excitement back.
Robert Mondavi,This is what I think is very essential... moderation can be good for you.

Robert Mondavi,My mother served me wine and water from the time I was 3 years old.
Robert Mondavi,"My brother and I had saved $15,000 by working many years nailing fruit crates together."
Robert Mondavi,"Later, at Stanford University, I thought I'd become a lawyer or businessman, but my father came to me and said he thought there was a big future in the fine-wine business."
Robert Mondavi,"It is giving me a great satisfaction, because I had the notion that we could make great wines equal to the greatest wines in the world, and everybody said it was impossible."
Robert Mondavi,"If you go back to the Greeks and Romans, they talk about all three - wine, food, and art - as a way of enhancing life."
Robert Mondavi,"I've always wanted to improve on the idea of living well, In moderation, wine is good for you - mentally, physically, and spiritually."
Robert Mondavi,I want to make wines that harmonize with food - wines that almost hug your tongue with gentleness.
Robert Mondavi,"I say to consumers: instead of relying totally on critics, drink what you like and like what you drink."

Robert Mondavi,"How beautiful it is to excel, and the goodness of giving from your heart."
Robert Mondavi,"Ever since I was a child, I wanted to excel in everything."

Robert Mondavi,"I always knew that food and wine were vital, with my mother being Italian and a good cook."
Claude Monet,"The effect of sincerity is to give one's work the character of a protest.  The painter being concerned only with conveying his impression, simply seeks to be himself and no one else."
Claude Monet,"For me, a landscape does not exist in its own right, since its appearance changes at every moment; but the surrounding atmosphere brings it to life - the light and the air which vary continually. For me, it is only the surrounding atmosphere which gives subjects their true value."
Claude Monet,"I would advise young artists . . . to paint as they can, as long as they can, without being afraid of painting badly . . . . If their painting doesn't improve by itself, it means that nothing can be done - and I wouldn't do anything!"
Claude Monet,I perhaps owe having become a painter to flowers.
Sophie Monk,I play Adam's secretary and then end up in bed with him. It's really bizarre working with him because he's always been my favourite comedian. I used to have 'Adam Sandler' nights back home.
Sophie Monk,I end up in bed with Adam Sandler. It's so surreal it's hysterical.
Sophie Monk,"I play David Hasselhoff's secretary and she gets around a bit - it's quite a role. I end up in bed with Adam Sandler, It's so surreal it's hysterical ... I'm so excited. This is the biggest thing I have ever done, there's no comparison."
Sophie Monk,"I end up in bed with Adam Sandler,"
James Monroe,National honor is the national property of the highest value
James Monroe,"Hayden is a phenomenal football player, ... I send recruiting films out on George Long and they all ask who number seven [Hayden] is."
James Monroe,"Our country may be likened to a new house. We lack many things, but we possess the most precious of all -- liberty!"
James Monroe,"He loved Kentucky, ... He thought this was the prettiest country in the world."
James Monroe,The best form of government is that which is most likely to prevent the greatest sum of evil.
John Monroe,"I don't think there's going to be any integration here. There may be some technology they can use, but this is purely a power play."
John Monroe,"I don't think there's going to be any integration here; there may be some technology they can use, but this is purely a power play. It's a very good deal for the investors [a 60 percent share price premium], but unfortunately not a good deal for many Maxtor employees."
John Monroe,Seagate is the most formidable force in the hard-disk-drive industry. This just makes them a more formidable force.
John Monroe,Seagate is the most formidable force in the hard disk-drive industry--this just makes them a more formidable force.
Marilyn Monroe,"I'm for the individual as opposed to the corporation. The way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It's really tragic."
Marilyn Monroe,"I'm looking forward to eventually becoming a marvelous - excuse the word marvelous - character actress. Like Marie Dressler, like Will Rogers."
Marilyn Monroe,My great ambition is to have people comment on my fine dramatic performances.
Marilyn Monroe,I restore myself when I'm alone.
Marilyn Monroe,I've never been in a Hollywood fight or feud. I have the most wonderful memory for forgetting things.
Marilyn Monroe,"I don't know if high society is different in other cities, but in Hollywood important people can't stand to be invited someplace that isn't full of other important people. They don't mind a few unfamous people being present because they make good listeners. But if a star or studio chief or any other great movie personages find themselves sitting among a lot of nobodies, they get frightened - as if somebody was trying to demote them."
Marilyn Monroe,"They way it is the individual is the underdog, and with all the things a corporation has going for them the individual comes out banged on her head. The artist is nothing. It's really tragic."
Marilyn Monroe,"My travels have always been of the same kind. No matter where I've gone or why I've gone there it ends up that I never see anything. Becoming a movie star is living on a merry-go-round. When you travel you take the merry-go-round with you. You don't see natives or new scenery. You see chiefly the same press agents, the same sort of interviewers, and the same picture layouts of yourself."
Marilyn Monroe,I think cheesecake helps call attention to you. Then you can follow through and prove yourself.
Marilyn Monroe,"People feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, of any kind of nature — and it won't hurt your feelings — like it's happening to your clothing."
Marilyn Monroe,A photographer once told me that my two best points are between my waist and my neck.
Marilyn Monroe,You would think all other women kept their bodies in vaults.
Marilyn Monroe,Everyone's a star and deserves the right to twinkle.
Marilyn Monroe,I won't be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me.
Marilyn Monroe,I don't understand why people aren't a little more generous with each other.
Marilyn Monroe,"Wouldn't it be nice to be like men, just getting notches in your belt, having affairs with the most atttractive men . . . and not getting emotionally involved."
Marilyn Monroe,"You can't sleep your way into being a star, though. It takes much, much more. But it helps. A lot of actresses get their first chance that way."
Marilyn Monroe,"I don't mind being burdened with being glamorous and sexual. But what goes with it can be a burden. We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it's a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift."
Marilyn Monroe,"It's nice to be included in people's fantasies, but you also like to be accepted for your own sake."
Marilyn Monroe,I think if other girls know how bad I was when I started they'll be encouraged. I finally made up my mind I wanted to be an actress ~and I was not going to let my lack of confidence ruin my chances.
Marilyn Monroe,"I used to say to myself, 'What the devil have you got to be proud about, Marilyn Monroe?' And I'd answer, 'Everything, everything,' and I'd walk slowly and turn my head slowly as if I were a queen."
Marilyn Monroe,"I feel as though it's all happening to someone right next to me. I'm close, I can feel it, I can hear it, but it isn't really me."
Marilyn Monroe,"If I'd observed all the rules, I'd never have got anywhere"
Marilyn Monroe,I don't want to make money. I just want to be wonderful.
Marilyn Monroe,I am not interested in money. I just want to be wonderful.
Marilyn Monroe,Men are so willing to respect anything that bores them.
Marilyn Monroe,"I wanna guy I can look up to . . . I just gotta feel that whoever I marry has some real regard for me, aside from all that loving stuff."
Marilyn Monroe,"I like actors very much, but to marry one would be like marrying your brother. You look too much alike in the mirror."
Marilyn Monroe,My marriage brought me neither happiness nor pain. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say.
Marilyn Monroe,"A wise girl kisses but doesn't love, listens but doesnt believe, and leaves before she is left."
Marilyn Monroe,I always felt insecure and in the way — but most of all I felt scared. I guess I wanted love more than anything else in the world.
Marilyn Monroe,I don't mind living in a man's world as long as I can be a woman in it.
Marilyn Monroe,"As of today, I have absolutely no regrets. I think I am a mature person who can take things in stride. I'm grateful for people in my past. They helped me get to where I am, wherever that is. But now, I am thinking for myself and sitting in on all the business transactions."
Marilyn Monroe,I don't consider myself an intellectual. And this is not one of my aims. But I admire intellectual people.
Marilyn Monroe,I want to continue my growth in every way.
Marilyn Monroe,The truth is I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't.
Marilyn Monroe,"I want to grow old without facelifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face I've made. Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you'd never complete your life, would you? You'd never wholly know you."
Marilyn Monroe,"I'm trying to find myself as a person, sometimes that's not easy to do. Millions of people live their entire lives without finding themselves. But it is something I must do. The best way for me to find myself as a person is to prove to myself that I am an actress."
Marilyn Monroe,"Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you're a human being, you feel, you suffer."
Marilyn Monroe,"People respect you because they feel you've survived hard times and endured, and although you've become famous, you haven't become phony."
Marilyn Monroe,What good is it being Marilyn Monroe? Why can't I just be an ordinary woman? A woman who can have a family ... I'd settle for just one baby. My own baby.
Marilyn Monroe,It's better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone.
Marilyn Monroe,"The nicest thing for me is sleep, then at least i can dream."
Marilyn Monroe,"Hollywood's a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty cents."
Marilyn Monroe,Hollywood is a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul.
Marilyn Monroe,Well behaved women rarely make history.
Marilyn Monroe,"Remember now, cheers, no tears..."
Marilyn Monroe,I kept driving past the theatre with my name on the marquee. Was I excited. I wished they were using 'Norma Jeane' so that all the kids at the home and schools who never noticed me could see it.
Marilyn Monroe,"I was never used to being happy, so that wasn't something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think, you know, marriage did that. You see, I was brought up differently from the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy - that's it, successful, happy, and on time."
Marilyn Monroe,"People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn't see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one."
Marilyn Monroe,"There was my name up in lights. I said, 'God, somebody's made a mistake.' But there it was, in lights. And I sat there and said, 'Remember, you're not a star.' Yet there it was up in lights."
Marilyn Monroe,"I used to think as I looked at the Hollywood night, 'there must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I'm not going to worry about them. I'm dreaming the hardest.'"
Marilyn Monroe,I'm going to be a great movie star some day.
Marilyn Monroe,They've said I want to direct pictures. I couldn't direct traffic.
Marilyn Monroe,"I used to get the feeling, and sometimes I still get it, that I was fooling somebody-I don't know who or what-maybe myself. I have feelings some days when there are scenes with a lot of responsiblity, and I'll wish, gee, if only I would have been a cleaning woman."
Marilyn Monroe,"Everybody is always tugging at you. They'd all like a sort of chunk out of you. I don' think they realize it, but it's like 'grrr do this, grr do that...' But you do want to stay intact--intact and on two feet."
Marilyn Monroe,He [Arthur Miller] wouldn't have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.
Marilyn Monroe,"People ask me if I am going on making cheesecake pictures now that I'm a star. My answer is that as long as there is a boy in Korea who wants a pinup of me, I'll go on posing for them."
Marilyn Monroe,"It stirs up envy, fame does. People...feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you--and it won't hurt your feelings--like it's happening to your clothing."
Marilyn Monroe,I never wear stockings or underclothes because I think it is important to breathe freely.
Marilyn Monroe,I always sleep with my mouth open. I know because it's open when I wake up.
Marilyn Monroe,"With fame, you know, you can read about yourself, somebody else's ideas about you, but what's important is how you feel about yourself--for survival and living day to day with what comes up."
Marilyn Monroe,"Sometimes I've been to a party where no one spoke to me for a whole evening. The men, frightened by their wives or sweeites...the ladies would gang up in a corner and discuss my dangerous character."
Marilyn Monroe,I love to do the things the censors won't pass.

Marilyn Monroe,"Say good-bye to Pat, say good-bye to Jack and say good-bye to yourself, because you're a nice guy."
Marilyn Monroe,"Unfortunately, I am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars. All we demanded was our right to twinkle."
Marilyn Monroe,The truth is I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't. When th
Marilyn Monroe,"I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent."
Marilyn Monroe,"Fame is fickle and I know it. It has its compensations, but it also has its drawbacks and I've experienced them both."
Marilyn Monroe,"With fame, you know, you can read about yourself, somebody else's ideas about you, but what's important is how you feel about yourself - for survival and living day to day with what comes up."
Marilyn Monroe,"Fame will go by and, so long, I've had you, Fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle."
Marilyn Monroe,There's only one sort of natural blonde on earth - albinos.
Marilyn Monroe,"Dreaming about being an actress, is more exciting then being one."
Marilyn Monroe,Dogs never bite me. Just humans.

Marilyn Monroe,I learned to walk as a baby and I haven't had a lesson since.
Marilyn Monroe,"I want to grow old without facelifts... I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face I've made. Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you'd never complete your life, would you? You'd never wholly know you"
Marilyn Monroe,"Some people have been unkind. If I say I want to grow as an actress, they look at my figure. If I say I want to develop, to learn my craft, they laugh. Somehow they don't expect me to be serious about my work."
Marilyn Monroe,A career is born in public -- talent in privacy.
Marilyn Monroe,"Acting isn't something you do. Instead of doing it, it occurs. If you're going to start with logic, you might as well give up. You can have conscious preparation, but you have unconscious results."
Marilyn Monroe,If you can make a girl laugh - you can make her do anything.
Marilyn Monroe,"My illusions didn't have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But, my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!"
Marilyn Monroe,"In Hollywood a girl's virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You're judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood's a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty."
Marilyn Monroe,"A wise girl kisses but doesn't love, leaves before she is left and forgets before she is forgotten."
Marilyn Monroe,"I don't know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot."
Marilyn Monroe,"Before marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him. After marriage, she has to hold him to make love to him."
Ashley Montagu,It is the mark of the cultured man that he is aware of the fact that equality is an ethical and not a biological principle
Ashley Montagu,"It is work, work that one delights in, that is the surest guarantor of happiness. But even here it is a work that has to be earned by labor in one's earlier years. One should labor so hard in youth that everything one does subsequently is easy by comparison."
Ashley Montagu,"The cultured man is an artist, an artist in humanity."

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,Solitude begets whimsies.
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"Whoever will cultivate their own mind will find full employment. Every virtue does not only require great care in the planting, but as much daily solicitude in cherishing as exotic fruits and flowers; the vices and passions (which I am afraid are the natural product of the soil) demand perpetual weeding. Add to this the search after knowledge... and the longest life is too short."

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"I wish you would moderate that fondness you have for your children. I do not mean you should abate any part of your care, or not do your duty to them in its utmost extent, but I would have you early prepare yourself for disappointments, which are heavy in proportion to their being surprising."
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"Strictly speaking, there is but one real evil: I mean acute pain. All other complaints are so considerably diminished by time that it is plain the grief is owing to our passion, since the sensation of it vanishes when that is over."
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"Nature has not placed us in an inferior rank to men, no more than the females of other animals, where we see no distinction of capacity, though I am persuaded if there was a commonwealth of rational horses... it would be an established maxim amongst them that a mare could not be taught to pace."
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"Be plain in dress, and sober in your diet; In short, my deary, kiss me, and be quiet."
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"I have never, in all my various travels, seen but two sorts of people I mean men and women, who always have been, and ever will be, the same. The same vices and the same follies have been the fruit of all ages, though sometimes under different names."
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,"'Tis a sort of duty to be rich, that it may be in one's power to do good, riches being another word for power."
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,To always be loved one must ever be agreeable.

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne,"I love those historians that are either very simple or most excellent. Such as are between both (which is the most common fashion), it is they that spoil all; they will needs chew our meat for us and take upon them a law to judge, and by consequence to square and incline the story according to their fantasy."

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne,"I speak the truth not so much as I would, but as much as I dare, and I dare a little more as I grow older."

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne,There is no conversation more boring than the one where everybody agrees.
Michel Eyquem de Montaigne,"In my opinion, the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is in conversation.

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne,"No profession or occupation is more pleasing than the military; a profession or exercise both noble in execution (for the strongest, most generous and proudest of all virtues is true valor) and noble in its cause.

Maria Montessori,"If an educational act is to be efficacious, it will be only that one which tends to help toward the complete unfolding of life. To be thus helpful it is necessary rigorously to avoid the arrest of spontaneous movements and the imposition of arbitrary tasks."
Maria Montessori,"To aid life, leaving it free, however, that is the basic task of the educator."
Maria Montessori,"There is in every child a painstaking teacher, so skilful that he obtains identical results in all children in all parts of the world. The only language men ever speak perfectly is the one they learn in babyhood, when no one can teach them anything!"
Maria Montessori,"The only language men ever speak perfectly is the one they learn in babyhood, when no one can teach them anything!"
Maria Montessori,One test of the correctness of educational procedure is the happiness of the child.
Maria Montessori,The task of the educator lies in seeing that the child does not confound good with immobility and evil with activity.
Maria Montessori,"The first idea that the child must acquire, in order to be actively disciplined, is that of the difference between good and evil; and the task of the educator lies in seeing that the child does not confound good with immobility, and evil with activity."
Maria Montessori,The first idea the child must acquire is that of the difference between good and evil.
Maria Montessori,"We cannot create observers by saying observe, but by giving them the power and the means for this observation and these means are procured through education of the senses"
Maria Montessori,"If education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated lines of a mere transmission of knowledge, there is little to be hoped from it in the bettering of man's future."
Maria Montessori,"[In her 1946 book,] Education in a New World, ... education is a natural process carried out by the human individual, and is acquired not by listening to words, but by experiences in the environment."
Maria Montessori,"And so we discovered that education is not something which the teacher does, but that it is a natural process which develops spontaneously in the human being."
Maria Montessori,"Discipline must come through liberty. We do not consider an individual disciplined only when he has been rendered as artificially silent as a mute and as immovable as a paralytic. He is an individual annihilated, not disciplined."
Maria Montessori,"Discipline must come through liberty. . . . We do not consider an individual disciplined only when he has been rendered as artificially silent as a mute and as immovable as a paralytic.  He is an individual annihilated, not disciplined."
Maria Montessori,"The teacher must derive not only the capacity, but the desire, to observe natural phenomena.  The teacher must understand and feel her position of observer: the activity must lie in the phenomenon."
Maria Montessori,"The teacher must derive not only the capacity, but the desire, to observe natural phenomena. In our system, she must become a passive, much more than an active, influence, and her passivity shall be composed of anxious scientific curiosity and of absolute respect for the phenomenon which she wishes to observe. The teacher must understand and feel her position of observer: the activity must lie in the phenomenon."
Maria Montessori,"An educational method that shall have liberty as its basis must intervene to help the child to a conquest of liberty. That is to say, his training must be such as shall help him to diminish as much as possible the social bonds which limit his activity."
Maria Montessori,"If we can, when we have established individual discipline, arrange the children, sending each one to his own place, in order, trying to make them understand the idea that thus placed they look well, and that it is a good thing to be thus placed in order, that it is a good and pleasing arrangement in the room, this ordered and tranquil adjustment of theirs -- then their remaining in their places, quiet and silent, is the result of a species of lesson, not an imposition. To make them understand the idea, without calling their attention too forcibly to the practice, to have them assimilate a principle of collective order -- that is the important thing."
Maria Montessori,"The greatest sign of success for a teacher... is to be able to say, The children are now working as if I did not exist."
Maria Montessori,"Free the child's potential, and you will transform him into the world"
Maria Montessori,The greatness of the human personality begins at the hour of birth.  From this almost mystic affirmation there comes what may seem a strange conclusion: that education must start from birth.
Maria Montessori,"We especially need imagination in science. It is not all mathematics, nor all logic, but it is somewhat beauty and poetry."
Colin Montgomerie,There's much more strength in depth than there's ever been.
Colin Montgomerie,I'm sure they still feel there is a safety issue here in Europe.
Colin Montgomerie,"It's unfortunate for the tournament. They still feel there is a safety issue here in Europe, I'm sure they do. We try and tell them it's OK but they have their own views on that one, being London and what have you."
Colin Montgomerie,I called the rules official and he told me it was okay. I wasn't quite concentrating on what I was doing and I missed the putt.
Colin Montgomerie,"He's sort of caught everybody on the hot, really, and good luck to him. He tried it last week as an experiment and it certainly worked."
Colin Montgomerie,"He's sort of caught everybody on the hot, really, and good luck to him. I think you'll find, and not just on this course, a lot of people using two drivers now. Why try and change one swing to accommodate a hole?"
Colin Montgomerie,So it`s nice to go to San Francisco in the knowledge that I am still capable.
Colin Montgomerie,"I said I'm here to win the Volvo Masters and that's my intention,"
Colin Montgomerie,"Vijay, he's playing fantastic golf tee-to-green. If he putted at all, he'd be out of sight by now but thank goodness he didn't."
Colin Montgomerie,"This is what it's all about - competition, and I thrive on competition. I'm a very, very competitive person, and I'm glad its come down to this. I'll shake his hand on the first tee and I'll shake his hand on the 18th green, but between those handshakes we are competitors and we'll be trying to beat each other as much as possible."
Colin Montgomerie,"I'm only glad that I was able to score 66 in very difficult circumstances,"
Colin Montgomerie,"The first thing is to get into the bloody things, but if I can I think I have as good a chance as I've had in the last 10 years,"
Colin Montgomerie,"The standards are improving on this Tour beyond belief. They're fitter and mentally tougher and here's me at 42 having to compete with that,"
Colin Montgomerie,"The first hole was crucial. I was anxious, obviously. I felt anxiety which was understandable. But I got rid of that in the first three holes."
Bernard Law Montgomery,"I was well beaten myself, and I am better for it."
Bernard Law Montgomery,"Decisions! And a general, a commander in chief who has not got the quality of decision, then he is no good."
Bernard Law Montgomery,"Air power is indivisible. If you split it up into compartments, you merely pull it to pieces and destroy its greatest asset, its flexibility."
Mike Montgomery,"Ike was going to have to work his way into the rotation with the guys we've got back. Any rookie needs experience. It's not something you step in and dominate. The best place for that would have been exhibitions, but that's not available to us, so we have to go to Plan B."
Mike Montgomery,"He's been well coached having Roy Williams and Bill Self. They put him in position where he understands how to do things. But again, coming in here with some pretty good players and being able to hold his own like he has, it's pretty impressive. He's not backed off. He's been tough. He's shown leadership."
Mike Montgomery,"I think in the proper context, they'll be fine. It would be unusual that the five guys that aren't starting are as good as the five guys that are starting. But I think each of the guys in their own right has things they do for you."
Mike Montgomery,We had real problems in the paint.
Mike Montgomery,At practice yesterday we could barely get 94 feet we were so tired. We just couldn't run and it carried over to today. The break really took its tool on us and Jason (Richardson) is a little under the weather. Troy is coming back from about 2 1/2 weeks of not being able to do anything.
Mike Montgomery,I think we were desperate. That's the way we've got to play every night. We don't have much margin for error.
Mike Montgomery,We've been counting on Jason to put up the big numbers and he can't do that every night. We've got to have other people playing and doing things as well.
Mike Montgomery,"In his mind, I don't think he feels like he's emerged at all. He probably just feels like he needed an opportunity."
Mike Montgomery,We got real 3-point happy when they went to the zone. We should have had the presence of mind to drive the ball.
Mike Montgomery,"He's a steadying influence, ... He just keeps the ball in his hands and guys know that he'll be able to get them the ball."
Mike Montgomery,He's a steadying influence. He just keeps the ball in his hands and guys know that he'll be able to get them the ball.
Mike Montgomery,"Kobe really hurt us. He did a great job on (Richardson),"
Mike Montgomery,"It's a tough deal. Mike got hurt early, and J.R. was not with us."
Mike Montgomery,Jason Richardson's given it everything he has. He has showed tremendous heart. But it's a team and it's a team game. We can't do it with any one guy. We've got to get a first and a second and even a third guy. You need to get guys playing well and playing with confidence.
Mike Montgomery,Everybody on our team sure liked Matt. He works hard and he makes open shots and it seems to me like he's playing with more confidence.
Mike Montgomery,It's hard. The teams we are playing are all vying for playoff spots. They all have incentives.
Mike Montgomery,"It's a cumulative thing. The last how many games, how many was there a shot to win at the end? And we didn't get any of them. I think these kids deserve a win. It's discouraging and doesn't feel very good. These guys deserve a win."
Mike Montgomery,I think our players deserved that win. We've been through so many games where at the end we haven't made a play and now Jason steps up and hits a huge shot.
Mike Montgomery,"He's been good and it helps to have another guy. Mike has come to life the past two games. He's been really good. All of a sudden, it makes a whole lot of difference when you have a second guy that can put the numbers up. He's hit some timely baskets without a doubt."
Mike Montgomery,"They win a lot of close games, that's what they do."
Mike Montgomery,"It could actually get interesting without really stretching the imagination too far. But it still depends on us winning games, as it has been all year."
Mike Montgomery,"This is the first time in recent history that the governor has declared a state of emergency because of fire conditions across the state. Any even though the conditions are not as severe as what we've seen up in north Texas, they are affecting us."
Mike Montgomery,"The experience of, for anybody, being a head coach, having to make the decisions, I just think it helps your understanding of the whole process. Just confidence and making his own decisions and being in charge, I think it helps everybody."
Mike Montgomery,"There's no excuse for playing that poorly in the first half, ... But it is two halves."
Mike Montgomery,"He's a little more relaxed (this season), I think. I think he feels like he can give us energy off the bench. And obviously, if he shoots the ball, that's a bonus. He's a good defender. We'd like him to rebound a little bit more, but he's helping us a lot right now."
Mike Montgomery,"We battled back from 20 points down. The guys were hustling, working and playing together. They had some energy. The game was right there. All we had to do was finish it and we didn't finish it."
Mike Montgomery,"The doctors say he's OK to go, the trainer says he's OK to go and he says he's OK to go. You don't put a guy out there with a restriction."
Mike Montgomery,"There was a recipe for disaster not having Jason Richardson out, getting in at 4 a.m. and playing a back-to-back. But the guys hung in there and gave us a chance. We battled hard."
Mike Montgomery,"I thought we were better on defense, and it allowed us to get out on the break more consistently. I think it was important for us to get a split just so the kids will get some confidence in themselves and what we're doing."
Mike Montgomery,"It's got us all frustrated. The first part of the game we couldn't get back on defense. Then in the second half, we couldn't guard them when they were in front of us."
Mike Montgomery,"A lot of defense is just want, just wanting to do it. It's hard work. You get tired, you've got to be able to defend and that's what we're working on. But they're working at it. It's not something that's going to happen overnight. Team defense takes a while to develop."
Mike Montgomery,The other area is certainly an area for debate. We'll just have to see it plays out. I understand both sides of the argument.
Mike Montgomery,You've got to admire his courage. He wasn't getting any lift off the ankle early and kept coming up short. You knew he was hurting but he didn't want to come out and let it stiffen.
Mike Montgomery,"Very, very surprised. We had had a 45-minute conversation, and we talked about a lot of things. So I apologized to Billy, and that's the end of the story."
Mike Montgomery,We get back ahead get control of the game but we can't sustain it. Yao is a problem for us and no matter what we did we were in trouble.
Mike Montgomery,Kobe Bryant is a monster who is extremely difficult to defend. They get so much confidence from having him out there.
Mike Montgomery,We have lost a little bit of confidence and the Spurs are not a good team to try to get your confidence back because they are a great basketball team.
Mike Montgomery,"I thought we were better on defense tonight; it gave us confidence,"
Mike Montgomery,"We ended up getting a ton of mediocre shots. The longer we did that, the more they got confidence that they could stay in the game. Then we got ourselves in a hole that we had a tough time digging ourselves out of. We got three shots at the end, but we never should have been in that situation."
Mike Montgomery,It's pretty obvious to me our confidence is shot a little bit and we're just going to have to work our way through it. We've got guys who are missing shots they can make.
Mike Montgomery,You've got to force him out of his comfort area and I don't think we did that consistently.
Mike Montgomery,"Those guys are younger than me. I did my thing in college. I had all the success I needed to have. I came here to do this, to try to get this thing going. No, I'm not going back to college."
Mike Montgomery,"In college, you're in charge of everything. In the NBA, you're in charge of nothing."
Mike Montgomery,This isn't like college where you are building character and molding people. This is wins and losses and you better figure that out pretty quick.
Mike Montgomery,"But they're really taking individual challenges personally. We've had some crummy shooting nights, yet you look up and we're in the game with a chance to win. And that's what defense will do for you."
Mike Montgomery,It (fouling) is not something I believe in.
Mike Montgomery,"He's got to fight his way through it. He's got to get rebounds, defend, (get) loose balls and pass. Eventually, it'll all work itself out."
Mike Montgomery,I think Ellis is an explosive athlete.
Mike Montgomery,Kobe's got such confidence in shooting the ball. He's got the ability to drive and the ability to shoot over the top of you as he falls away. He's certainly one of the toughest guys to defend around the league.
Charlie Montoyo,He's been doing that ever since I've known him. Thank God he hasn't hit anybody.
Charlie Montoyo,We haven't been hitting the last four games. Getting home at 5:15 isn't an excuse for that.
Charlie Montoyo,"Those two guys are lights out. (Pitching coach Xavier Hernandez) and me don't even have to talk. If we have the lead after seven, he knows who goes in."
Susanna Moodie,"What a wonderful faculty is memory! -- the most mysterious and inexplicable in the great riddle of life; that plastic tablet on which the Almighty registers with unerring fidelity the records of being, making it the depository of all our words, thoughts and deeds -- this faithful witness against us for good or evil."
Susanna Moodie,"When things come to the worse, they generally mend."
Susanna Moodie,"I have no wish for a second husband. I had enough of the first. I like to have my own way to lie down mistress, and get up master."

Dwight L. Moody,"Someday you will read in the papers that Moody is dead. Don't you believe a word of it. At that moment I shall be more alive than I am now. I was born of the flesh in 1837, I was born of the spirit in 1855. That which is born of the flesh may die. That which is born of the Spirit shall live forever."
Dwight L. Moody,"We can stand affliction better than we can prosperity, for in prosperity we forget God."
Dwight L. Moody,Where I was born and where and how I have lived is unimportant. It is what I have done with where I have been that should be of interest.
Dwight L. Moody,Preparation for old age should begin not later than one's teens. A life which is empty of purpose until 65 will not suddenly become filled on retirement.
John Moody,"Yet the railroad speedily demonstrated its practical value; many of the first lines were extremely profitable, and the hostility with which they had been first received soon changed to an enthusiasm which was just as unreasoning."
John Moody,"By 1880 four different lines of railroad were running through to the Pacific States, and a fifth, the Denver and Rio Grande, had penetrated through the mountains of Colorado and across Utah to the Great Salt Lake."
John Moody,"On July 18, 1858, the first through train passed over the entire line from Philadelphia via Mount Joy to Pittsburgh without transfer of passengers. At the same time the first smoking car ever attached to a passenger train was used, and sleeping cars also soon began to appear."
John Moody,"The railroad is sprung from the application of two fundamental ideas - one the use of a mechanical means of developing speed, the other the use of a smooth running surface to diminish friction."
John Moody,"The railroad, they said, was a natural monopoly; no private citizen could hope ever to own one; it was thus a kind of monster which, if encouraged, would override all popular rights."
John Moody,It was a simple matter to find fault with the railroad; it has always been its fate to arouse the opposition of the farmers.
John Moody,The States which form the northern border of the United States westward from the Great Lakes to the Pacific coast include an area several times larger than France and could contain ten Englands and still have room to spare.
John Moody,"In the United States three new methods of transportation made their appearance at almost the same time - the steamboat, the canal boat, and the rail car."
John Moody,"Yet, in 1850 nearly all the railroads in the United States lay east of the Mississippi River, and all of them, even when they were physically mere extensions of one another, were separately owned and separately managed."
John Moody,"Under the Thomson management, which lasted until 1874, the record of the Pennsylvania Railroad was one of progress in every sense of the word."
John Moody,The close relationship between railroad expansion and the genera development and prosperity of the country is nowhere brought more distinctly into relief than in connection with the construction of the Pacific railroads.
John Moody,"People began to understand that with the acquisition of California the nation had obtained practically half a continent, of which the future possibilities were almost unlimited, so far as the development of natural resources and the genera production of wealth were concerned."
John Moody,"With the reorganization of 1898 finished, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered a new period in its history."
John Moody,"As the contest proceeded, public interest increased and the entire country watched to see which company would win the big government subsidies through the mountains."
John Moody,Consequently many large railroad systems of heavy capitalization bid fair to run into difficulties on the first serious falling off in general business.
John Moody,"While no one railroad can completely duplicate another line, two or more may compete at particular points."
John Moody,The railroad originally was as completely dissociated from steam propulsion as was the ship.
John Moody,"The construction of extensive railways, however, and particularly the consolidation of small, experimental lines into large systems, dates from the days of the discovery of gold in California."
John Moody,The history of the Erie Railroad ever since 1901 has been a record of progress.
John Moody,The public conviction that a railroad linking the West and the East was an absolute necessity became so pronounced after the gold discoveries of '49 that Congress passed an act in 1853 providing for a survey of several lines from the Mississippi to the Pacific.
John Moody,Many of the railroad evils were inherent in the situation; they were explained by the fact that both managers and public were dealing with a new agency whose laws they did not completely understand.
John Moody,The development of railroad properties under the Vanderbilt influence was not confined to the territory east of Chicago and the Mississippi Valley.
John Moody,Great men are usually the products of their times and one of the men developed by these times takes rank with the greatest railroad leaders in history.
John Moody,"The United States as we know it today is largely the result of mechanical inventions, and in particular of agricultural machinery and the railroad."
John Moody,The financial history of the Baltimore and Ohio since the close of the nineteenth century is interesting chiefly in connection with changes in the control of the property.
John Moody,The nation did not begin to realize the extraordinary possibilities of the vast Western territory until its attention was thus suddenly and definitely concentrated on the Pacific by the annual addition of over fifty million dollars to the circulating medium.
John Moody,"Horses and mules, and even sail cars, made more rapid progress than did the earliest locomotive."
John Moody,"Farmers, merchants, manufacturers, and the traveling public have all had their troubles with the transportation lines, and the difficulties to which these struggles have given rise have produced that problem which is even now apparently far from solution."
John Moody,In this wise the Commodore not only added millions to his already growing fortune but also made himself a power in the financial world.
John Moody,"The ultimate plan, which proved too visionary, was to consolidate under one control a vast network of lines extending all over the continent."
John Moody,"When the scheme for the construction of a railroad from Baltimore to the waters of the Ohio River first began to take form, the United States had barely emerged from the Revolutionary period."
Robert Moog,He brought electronic music to the masses and changed the way we hear music.
Robert Moog,What inspires me is not so much the music as the opportunity to interact with composers. I think that has driven everything I've done.
Robert Moog,I'm an engineer. I see myself as a toolmaker and the musicians are my customers... They use my tools.
Robert Moog,"One always has to remember these days where the garbage pail is, because it's so easy to make sounds, and to put sounds together into something that appears to be music, but it's just as hard as it always was to make good music."
Robert Moog,"To those of you who are wearing ties, I think my dad would appreciate it if you took them off."
Robert Moog,"I was never worried that synthesizers would replace musicians. First of all, you have to be a musician in order to make music with a synthesizer."
Robert Moog,"My training as an engineer has enabled me to design the stuff, but the reason I do it is not to make music but for the opportunity to work with musicians."
Robert Moog,To me the synthesizer was always a source of new sounds that musicians could use to expand the range of possibilities for making music.
Robert Moog,When a pianist sits down and does a virtuoso performance he is in a technical sense transmitting more information to a machine than any other human activity involving machinery allows.
Robert Moog,I happen to think that computers are the most important thing to happen to musicians since the invention of cat-gut which was a long time ago.
Warren Moon,"Now that he's got this Collective Bargaining Agreement done for another six years, I guess he feels like his job is complete. He probably wasn't going to still be on the job when the next contract came up, so this is probably a good time for him to walk away  with the league in very good shape financially because of the new TV contracts. He's done an unbelievable job as commissioner."
Warren Moon,He always had it so easy. He was so much better than anybody else in high school. Now the competition was catching up with him and he was having trouble staying on top of the learning curve.

He's done an unbelievable job as commissioner."
Chris Mooney,"We tried to talk about [the Owls' zone], but it's hard to replicate it. It's nearly impossible to penetrate that zone. What you do get are open outside shots. You're going to have to make some of them."
Chris Mooney,"Because we have trouble scoring, we have to play really good defense. We haven't made it hard enough on them to score. The holes we dig ourselves into are too hard to get out of. St. Bonaventure played very well, and they played loose. They had a good game plan, and they executed it very well."
Chris Mooney,"He was on the bench at times he usually hasn't been, but it was just one game. Kevin will be out there against Duquesne. We need a little more consistency from him. We've seen so many individual bright spots from him, he's been terrific. He just struggled against La Salle."
Chris Mooney,"That's perfect, I guess. These days in college basketball, it's not nearly as strange. In college basketball, there's so much parity. Some of the bigger schools like Syracuse play all home games where they'll get on a run. Saint Louis will play a demanding schedule where they travel. You'll see more of those ups and downs."
Les Moonves,"I knew Jim and ESPN were talking, but I always felt that deep in my soul, he was a CBS guy, the face and voice of CBS Sports."

Les Moonves,"His biggest sin was to trust a producer whom he'd worked with very successfully in the past,"
Les Moonves,"Radio -- which has extremely valuable assets -- is our one segment that is not yet achieving acceptable growth. We have implemented a number of recent initiatives to change that, including the new Jack and Spanish formats which have shown good success. And we believe this week's announcement to add a powerful new morning show will greatly improve the performance of our drive-time programming in the nation's largest east-coast markets."
Les Moonves,We'll replace (Stern's show) with programming we think can be more profitable in the future.
Les Moonves,"Tom Kane is a consummate professional whose experience in local television, both as a general manager and in sales, has benefited us greatly since he joined our group two years ago, ... The positive growth at CBS and UPN continues to provide great advantages for us at the local level, and I'm counting on Tom to seize those opportunities to improve our positions in all the markets where we compete."
Les Moonves,This new network will serve the public with high-quality programming and maintain our ongoing commitment to our diverse audience.
Leslie Moonves,"One of the things we have done successfully at CBS is nurture talent, ... It will be an important part of my job to make these guys happy, and I think we will do that."
Leslie Moonves,"Television historically has been a combination of finding the new talent and also going with the tried-and-true guy who's been in the trenches before,"

Leslie Moonves,"There are no home runs this season,"
Leslie Moonves,"This is the first sports deal in history to extend beyond our traditional platforms into the world of new media. The future of our core business demands that we continue to bring blockbuster events to major audiences our advertisers want to reach, promoting those events across the broadest possible media platforms."
Leslie Moonves,"But any of you who have dealt with me at all know that slow growth and me don't go hand in hand so well together,"
Leslie Moonves,"Whether we get them or not, half of the nominations are ridiculous. It's fun to look at them. It's also fun to throw them in the garbage."
Leslie Moonves,"Despite what people think, network executives and network presidents to have feelings. To cancel a show that ... has been a popular show is a very difficult decision,"
Leslie Moonves,"There is absolutely nothing about this show relatable to my story, in fairness. This is about a twentysomething-year-old guy looking for the love of his life. One of the things I love about my job is the naivetÅ½ of people, thinking what things will affect me."
Leslie Moonves,"With the success of 'Survivor' and 'Big Brother,' we've seen how interactive elements can supplement the television viewing experience."
Leslie Moonves,"This is an incredibly exciting evolution for CBS and network television â€” video on demand is the next frontier for our industry,"
Leslie Moonves,"We're going to be a very stable company, but we're not going to be Con Edison."
Leslie Moonves,"This new network will serve the public with high-quality programming and maintain our ongoing commitment to our diverse audience. It will clearly be greater than the sum of its parts, delivering excellent demographics to advertisers and building a strong new affiliate body."
Leslie Moonves,He was a first-class man -- a stand-up guy. We worked together on three series.
Leslie Moonves,"This is an incredibly exciting evolution for CBS and network television  video on demand is the next frontier for our industry,"
Leslie Moonves,"The CW is going to be a real competitor, a destination for young audiences, diverse audiences, and a real favorite with advertisers. The CW will be able to do something truly remarkable: program already hit shows every single day of the week, programs that consistently rank No. 1 or No. 2 in their time slots in the most coveted young adult demographic."

Archie Moore,Very few people could make me fight out of my system. Burley was one.

Archie Moore,I'm like the drunk in the bar who wants just one more for the road.
Bruce Moore,"Somebody had to lose tonight and it was going to be a good team. The girls played hard and I couldn't be more proud of how they played. Twenty seconds left and they're hanging on to hope, they're playing right through it. They're classy girls. They've been that way all season."
Bruce Moore,We're excited and ready to go again (today). It will be fun.
Bruce Moore,"It's one of the major activities that our family automatically does in September,"
Bruce Moore,"I feel I have benefited along with all the other cancer patients with the money that the Terry Fox Foundation has given to cancer research,"
Bruce Moore,It was a tough game. Dayton comes to play. They always play good basketball against us and tonight was no exception. They're scrappy and we knew they'd come to play hard and they did. They played very well. They did a great job. Hats off to them. We're just happy to have a win.
Bruce Moore,"Stephanie has matured a lot as a basketball player in the last two weeks. The whole team has. I'm really proud of them. This team didn't say a word in the second half, they just came out with a serious look on their faces and played great basketball. They're believing in themselves and each other. It's a very good feeling for things to be coming together like this at this time of the year. It's a real good place to be right now."
Charles Moore,"Within our profession, we didn't go into this to make money. It's offensive to me."

Charles Moore,"Memphis is a great town, man. There's a great musical community here. I'm trying to fit in."
Charles Moore,My career was 100% different from what I intended to do. I thought I'd photograph nature and landscapes but I wound up photographing the changing of the times.
Dayton Moore,We want to stress having balance in their lives and making good decisions off the field.
Dayton Moore,He can be a bat off the bench for us in Atlanta at some point in time. He's got a very patient demeanor. He's always had an instinct to hit.
Dayton Moore,"He has the charm that people want to be around. No matter what your physical ability is, unless you didn't have that advanced ability and advanced knowledge of the game, you can't advance quickly."
Dudley Moore,I haven't had that many women - only as many as I could lay my hands on
Dudley Moore,The best car safety device is a rear-view mirror with a cop in it
Dudley Moore,"I certainly did feel inferior. Because of class. Because of strength. Because of height. I guess if I'd been able to hit somebody in the nose, I wouldn't have been a comic."
Fred Moore,It's more the home user who is at risk. They're the ones who most likely won't update their protections on a regular basis.
Fred Moore,"There is a growing backlash against compliance. While the big boys may be able to afford it, the majority can't. To them, the risk of deleting it is far less than the price of complying."
Fred Moore,"To have achieved core profitability and steady growth within such a short window of time is a testament to the remarkable dedication of our staff and board, as well as the community's overwhelming support of a truly local institution."
Geoffrey Moore,There is no new technology in the iPod.
Geoffrey Moore,"We were thinking about scale instead of liquidity, ... The correct move now is to redirect the race toward liquidity."
Geoffrey Moore,"And the number of ISVs is meaningless. The issue is what the power players are doing. Cisco and Microsoft have the strongest positions, so a solution that doesn't have their endorsement isn't likely to get very far."
Geoffrey Moore,"Rehnquist was a jurist who truly understood the role of the court. He did not let personal opinions cloud his interpretation of the Constitution. His opinions were grounded in the idea that he is to interpret the law, not create it."
Gordon Moore,"I really appreciate what they're doing. They found the wealth and they're giving something back, too."
Gordon Moore,It is extremely unlikely that anyone coming out of school with a technical degree will go into one area and stay there. Today's students have to look forward to the excitement of probably having three or four careers.
Gordon Moore,The technology at the leading edge changes so rapidly that you have to keep current after you get out of school. I think probably the most important thing is having good fundamentals.
Gordon Moore,I remember the difficulty we had in the beginning replacing magnetic cores in memories and eventually we had both cost and performance advantages. But it wasn't at all clear in the beginning.
Gordon Moore,"With engineering, I view this year's failure as next year's opportunity to try it again. Failures are not something to be avoided. You want to have them happen as quickly as you can so you can make progress rapidly."
Jeff Moore,"The farmers in this state have really changed their practices and have improved water quality. I've seen streams that were marginal turn around, and now there is viable reproduction in these streams where it wasn't supported before."
Jeff Moore,I might still be up there ... It's a big miracle and answer to prayer.
Jeff Moore,"Anything you want to be good at, you've got to practice,"
Jeff Moore,MLB Advanced Media is an excellent example of an organization using technology to their advantage to create superior content. MLB will be well equipped for their current and future production needs.
Jeff Moore,Our main goal is to minimize any impact to the environment and businesses.
Jerry Moore,"Some things got loose last year, and that's my fault. I take responsibility for that. But I feel good about these players. I know what kind of kids we've got. I know what they want to accomplish."
Jerry Moore,"It would be hard to be more pleased,"
Jerry Moore,"It's a double whammy. People end up wasting their money, and on top of that, they've contaminated their environment."
Jerry Moore,We'll be giving people obedience tips for their dogs and how to get their puppies started properly.
Jerry Moore,"He's just inconsistent, ... That's understandable because he's a freshman. Matt sometimes kicks it like (former All-America) Harold Alexander and sometimes he kicks it like I do. But he has an extremely strong leg."
Jerry Moore,"One thing that we encourage people to do is to begin socializing their dogs at a very young age,"
Joe Moore,"If you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people He gives it to."
Joe Moore,Floyd has received widely varied opinions on this issue and they're all being taken into account.
Joe Moore,"[The fact is, he feels bad for the geese and ducks that are often force-fed until their livers become bloated -- aficionados would say deliciously so.] The answer is very simple, ... Our culture does not condone the torture of innocent and defenseless creatures."
Joe Moore,"Micron is a beneficiary of the current weaker pricing environment from the standpoint of its relative cost position, market share, and long term profitability as marginal competitors struggle to maintain a current capital base in a weaker pricing environment, ... Further, while pricing hasn't yet bottomed, investor sentiment is likely near a bottom."
Joe Moore,"Everyone knew it was a very difficult environment for PC's and microprocessors this quarter and I think the questions really were 'Is Intel able to see enough in time to kind of clamp down on expenses and keep that from being a problem in the first quarter,'"

Joe Moore,"Everyone knew it was a very difficult environment for PCs and microprocessors this quarter. I think the question was really whether Intel would be able to see enough in time to kind of clamp down on expenses and keep that from being a problem in the first quarter, ... So, even though there is negative news here, it looks like they did clamp down on their expenses and it looks like the earnings hit isn't all that bad. Clearly the bad environment was already signaled by the stock's decline in the last few days."
Joe Moore,I like him. It's just that he has this blind spot when it comes to corruption. I don't think he ever realizes the seriousness of it.
Joe Moore,"Marriage: love, honor, and negotiate."
Joe Moore,Before borrowing money from a friend it's best to decide which you need most.
Joe Moore,The laws that we adopt embody the values and mores of our constituents.
Joe Moore,Our laws are a reflection of our culture. Our culture does not condone the torture of innocent and defenseless creatures. And we as a society believe all God's creatures should be treated humanely.
Joe Moore,It's practically impossible to look at a penguin and feel angry.
Joe Moore,"You can't trust a promise someone makes while they're drunk, in love, hungry, or running for office."
Joe Moore,A simple fact that is hard to learn is that the time to save money is when you have some.
Keith Moore,"Bill Abbott is a versatile, experienced finance executive and we are thrilled he has joined our team. His hiring completes our senior executive team and brings tremendous value to our organic and acquisition-driven growth plans."
Keith Moore,I've always loved the smell of coffee.
Keith Moore,"The IMPP work was already very important. The recent AOL action might reinforce public perception that a standard is needed, but I think the public already realized this."
Larry Moore,"They played smart ball and didn't make a lot of mistakes, but the refs favored them just a little bit."
Larry Moore,I'm proud of how the kids played. The only thing that I can complain about is that we didn't win the game.
Larry Moore,I'm not happy with the situation at all.
Larry Moore,"Anytime a storm enters the Gulf, it has the potential of threatening the Mississippi Gulf Coast. All eyes need to be watching, paying close attention to the news media. Anything we get from the National Hurricane Center, we'll release immediately."

Mike Moore,It's tough to sit there and watch and wait for somebody else to make mistakes.
Mike Moore,Sometimes it's scary to think about. It's getting kind of rough out there now.
Mike Moore,"Once your family is from there, you're born into the black and gold nation. You meet a lot of people from Pittsburgh here. Last Sunday ... was the craziest we've seen it."
Peter Moore,We are up and running here.
Peter Moore,"If the PS3 is so incredibly superior to the Xbox 360 in game quality, game quantity, game breadth, game visuals, depth of the digital entertainment experience and price, God bless them,"
Peter Moore,The supply problems are there in as much as the demand is unbelievable.
Peter Moore,"Xbox Live Marketplace puts the buying power directly into the consumer's hands, allowing each person to choose digital content they want, when they want it."
Peter Moore,"Xbox Live on Xbox 360 gives each and every player the opportunity to become a member of the world's largest online gaming community... We're excited to offer our existing 2 million members this supercharged online experience at the same retail price, as well as introduce new users to the next generation in online gaming and entertainment,"

We're excited to offer our existing two million members this supercharged online experience at the same retail price, as well as introduce new users to the next generation in online gaming and entertainment."
Peter Moore,I think the brand is an opportunity.
Peter Moore,There are ways that you need to be able to drive that linkage in the consumer's mind.
Peter Moore,A part of me still hurts from that experience.
Peter Moore,I'm sure the Ballmer boys aren't happy with that because he has to get in line at retail like everybody else. He can come to my house if he needs games to play.
Peter Moore,"We are great believers in online gaming, and this is why I believe Microsoft has a great advantage, ... They have announced their broadband strategy for the future."
Richard Moore,It's just another significant step for us and a major benefit for public safety.
Richard Moore,He turned red. (His) lips and eyes swelled to the point where he was pretty unrecognizable.
Richard Moore,"I can only imagine the frustration and anxiety I have seen on people's faces, having to move again into shelters and not knowing what they will find when they go back, ... It's devastating."
Robert Moore,The governor has a pretty solid track record on renewable energy and clean air initiatives. The coal proposal veers off the track a little bit. We aren't real thrilled with that proposal.
Robert Moore,"There were rumors that I shut some down, but they closed due to economics."
Robert Moore,I'm happy for our senior class. I didn't want them to leave here without having won this game.
Ryan Moore,"We would like to see a public service announcement that shows things like malfunctioning gates and lights,"
Ryan Moore,"Railroads should be forced to bear the responsibility of protecting us from their trains, especially when they own the tracks and have the right of way to barrel through our communities,"
Ryan Moore,"It's a good week for the rookies to get their feet wet before the veterans come out to practice. They will learn some of the things unique to Little Five, and it's just a good way for them to get comfortable."
Ryan Moore,"There are some bands that won't play with us anymore because of our costumes. It's crazy-they loved our music before, and all of a sudden they're not down."
Ryan Moore,"Androgyny and rock music are not new things. [David]Bowie, Arthur 'Killer' Kane and the Smashing Pumpkins have been doing it forever. Plus [androgyny and rock] go together really well."
Ryan Moore,"We had a couple of races where we had bad luck and didn't end up with a good finish, and the leaders haven't had that happen, ... All I can hope right now is that they have a little bad luck and I just go out and drive as hard as I can every lap."
Ryan Moore,He stayed on well there and he's come on a lot since the spring. He's a nice horse. He was a bit keen early on but I don't think it's a problem with him.
Ryan Moore,I'm just going to play golf now. All I've got is tomorrow ahead of me.
Ryan Moore,"It was just a really solid round of golf. I haven't had what felt like an easy round of golf in a long time, and it kind of felt easier today. I found something on the range last night. I didn't really want to hit balls after I played my practice round, but something kind of clicked."
Ryan Moore,"I have never had any doubts about my skill level, ... Winning golf tournaments is pretty much the same thing. You have to play well, but you also have to think well."
Ryan Moore,"It's a step in the right direction as far as making my way up the money list,"
Ryan Moore,"The innovative backbone behind Vivox's IP communication services, combined with Jeff's expertise and thought-leadership proved to be an ideal opportunity for GrandBanks Capital to extend our portfolio into the VoIP space. We look forward to working together with Vivox to build an industry leader in the VoIP market."
Charles Moose,"We recognize the concerns of the community and, therefore, are going to provide the exact language in the message that pertains to the threat. It is in the form of a postscript: 'Your children are not safe anywhere, at any time,'"
Charles Moose,"We strongly believe all of these are connected,"
Charles Moose,"Maryland police officers do not have any authority or authorization to enforce immigration laws,"
Jim Mora,"I think the way we handled this win, ... is almost as important as the victory itself. This is a mature team, and they know what's ahead. I think they understand that what we have to do now is go out and validate this victory."
Jim Mora,"I think the way we handle this win is almost as important as the victory itself,"
Jim Mora,"I've had one run-in with a reporter in Atlanta, and we later came to an understanding, but I try not to ever do that. I treat the media with a lot of respect. I take the position that a big part of my job is to help the media do their job, so they can represent what we're all about to our fans. How else are they going to get accurate information, unless I give it to them?"
Jim Mora,We struggled to stop the run. Matt Hasselbeck got into a rhythm. We were having trouble getting first downs and they really controlled the second quarter.
Jim Mora,"In the cover two, cornerbacks squat at seven or eight yards, but the rules now say you have to hit them within five yards, ... You just have to be more conscious of when you hit them. You always teach, 'Hit them at five yards and carry them for a while. Find out how far they're going to let you carry them. Let them call it, and then we'll worry about it, you know what I mean?' You have to find out what the parameters are going to be. This year, early at least, the parameters are going to be five yards. They're going to strictly enforce it."
Jim Mora,Everything's so real now. Every game has significance. Every practice matters. You can't waste a rep. You don't get it back now. There's only so many reps you get during a regular-season week. I think the sense of urgency heightens.
Jim Mora,"You know, my philosophy on injuries is they happen. I feel bad for the kid, but we have to do what's best for us and move on."
Jim Mora,One of my obligations to the players is to make sure I'm looking out for their health.
Jim Mora,You hate to lose a player like Kevin because he brings so much to the team on the field and in the locker room. We have to find a way to go on and not make excuses.
Jim Mora,"I hate to say more comfortable because that makes it sound like you're taking it easy, or more relaxed, but there's more familiarity. We know each other. They know what I expect of them on the practice field, in games, in the community and in the meeting rooms. I understand how they're going to respond in certain situations."
Jim Mora,"The only stat I care about right now is the win. I know the critics will be out in force, but we're 5-2. Here's what I know about Mike Vick. When he starts games, the Atlanta Falcons win two-thirds of them."
Jim Mora,We're fortunate to come out on the winning side today. I'm proud of our football team. I told them that I love their fight. I love their resilience.
Jim Mora,"The guy's going to the Hall of Fame, ... We might as well induct him now."
Jim Mora,He'll learn to keep his emotions in check. He's a competitor. I'd rather him get a little stuff going than to back down from people. It doesn't need to go to that level that it went to the other night.
Jim Mora,"I'm upbeat about this football team, I'm upbeat about this organization. We're putting together a culture here in Atlanta that will prove to be a winning culture for many, many years."
Jim Mora,"We were just trying to establish the culture that we wanted and the style we were going to play with. That was a high effort, high energy going after the football style of defense."
Jim Mora,"We would like to see Michael to continue to improve his consistency throwing the ball, and making good decisions on the move, which we think he has so far,"
Jim Mora,"We would like to see Mike continue to develop consistency throwing the ball, making good decisions on the move -- which we think he has so far -- and recognize the blitz a little bit better and get rid of it when he can, and that's something that Mike hasn't had a lot of experience at, but he's getting better at it. The guy's just a tremendous learner. Anything we ask him to do, he does. The next step in his progression is just continuing to learn what defenses are doing to attack us."
Jim Mora,"When you've got Ronnie and him out there, there's a real comfort zone because they're both so smart. They understand the game and they take care of the people around them. That's a real attribute you look for."
Jim Mora,"He's a quarterback. If he feels like that, that's fine. As the head coach â€“ I'm not a guy who worries about thing like that. But I also didn't have to take 65 snaps from center with a crazed defense across the field. I had a jacket on; he didn't."
Jim Mora,I have decided not to extend Mike Johnson's contract. Mike has worked hard as our quarterbacks coach for the last two seasons and we wish him the very best in the future.
Jim Mora,"It always bothers me when they ignore Mike's mental grasp of this game and his ability to win football games when they characterize him as just an athletic guy who runs around and makes plays,"
Evo Morales,"I dreamed of being with Fidel and the Cuban people in the anti-imperialist struggle. Now I have the opportunity to be with him in that struggle, in search for peace with social justice."
Evo Morales,The government will exercise its right to state ownership of Bolivia's hydrocarbons.
Evo Morales,"We will have an economy based on solidarity and reciprocity. We do not dismiss the presence of foreign investment, but we want it be real fresh investment to industrialize our hydrocarbons, all under state control."
Evo Morales,We will not allow them to take power. Now is when the national majority has to govern the country.
Evo Morales,"As long as the government is unwilling to discuss the coca issue we won't have an agreement,"
Brian Moran,"To the rest of the state, Northern Virginia is a single-cell amoeba. Those of us in Northern Virginia see its individual parts. It's far more diverse than the rest of the commonwealth thinks of us."
Brian Moran,"Mike can carry 20-25 times a game and any time you can have a quality runner like that getting those looks, it's a formula for success."
Brian Moran,Mark did a great job for us last year. He started some games as a sophomore and his quick feet and accurate arm allow us to be more diverse on offense.
Brian Moran,I think his doctrinaire approach to taxes overwhelms his appreciation of transportation needs.
Dylan Moran,It's easy to smile when you have a squirrel's intellect.
Dylan Moran,He could dismiss several schools of philosophy by shifting slightly in his chair or toting his whisky glass.
Dylan Moran,"I'm not a fighter, I'm a bleeder."
Dylan Moran,"It's true that I have spoken about doing a book before, but then everyone you speak to is planning to write a book."
Dylan Moran,We are both drawn to surreal situations so the writing was a joy.
Dylan Moran,The characters can't be wittier than people are in real life. They have to be character witty.
Dylan Moran,Jokes in sitcoms only work when they're not conspicuous and they reveal character.
Dylan Moran,"I also think it helps that Black Books has a fusty and careworn feel - it could be the 1950's, it could be the 1930s."
Dylan Moran,"Black Books adheres to a more old fashioned, traditional sitcom format, which I think works, because in its own way, it's quite theatrical."
Dylan Moran,I myself have been to book auctions.
Dylan Moran,One thing that's coming up a lot is: are you as grumpy as you appear from this Black Books thing.
Dylan Moran,"I think that women just have a primeval instinct to make soup, which they will try to foist on anybody who looks like a likely candidate."
Robert Moran,"When I found Doc May, he saved my life."
Robert Moran,"Ultimately, it came down to a choice, ... This way, I could make sure both defendants were convicted and sent away for a long time."
Robert Moran,"Doc May is a character, ... He can look at you and tell you what's wrong with you. And if he needs to spend an hour with you, he will. He has helped me tremendously."
Massimo Moratti,"I've heard some debates about the morality of this. To me, it seems like a good idea to put together people from different countries with the same objective. If it could be done outside the sports field, it would be considered fantastic."
Massimo Moratti,"I am aware that the money we have given to Emergency is nothing compared to the millions spent on players, and I feel embarrassed. I understand that these figures are worrisome. They worry me also. But when you are the head of a business like Inter, you assume the responsibility of offering a quality product. These figures that circulate are normal in the industrial world, but they are not so well known, while in football everything is public."
Massimo Moratti,"I think we have the continuity we've lacked for years, thanks to the hard work of Mancini."
Massimo Moratti,I think that in delicate games like these it's indispensable to have complete autonomy.
Massimo Moratti,I bought Inter for reasons of passion and I have handled all these years with the desire to sell the club after winning a lot of trophies. Unfortunately the team has faded in the face of the big challenges. I need to take that into account and have the duty to do so.
Massimo Moratti,"Yes, I'm a bit bored ... there is no need of protests and violence to induce someone to leave. The desire to do it already exists."
Massimo Moratti,"The defeat was unexpected and can't really be explained. I have read everything that has been written and I agree: it was a horrible game. The supporters are right to be angry, as they went all the way to see that."
Massimo Moratti,"At Inter, the doors are always open for him ... he's a champion, I would be honored to have him again."
Jeanne Moreau,You should not separate your life from what you do.
Jeanne Moreau,You don't have to be a wreck. You don't have to be sick. One's aim in life should be to die in good health. Just like a candle that burns out.
Jeanne Moreau,"When you're a mother and you have a son, you hide your feminine side. It's the fear of incest, Oedipus."
Jeanne Moreau,"When you live under the power of terror and segregation, you can't ever start a work of art."
Jeanne Moreau,"When Tony was madly in love with me, his relationship with Vanessa Redgrave was ending."
Jeanne Moreau,"When I'm acting, I'm two beings. There's the one monitoring the distance between myself and the camera, making sure I hit my marks, and there is the one driven by this inner fire, this delicious fear."
Jeanne Moreau,"What is amazing for a woman of my age is that I change as the world is changing-and changing very, very fast. I don't think my mother had that opportunity to change."
Jeanne Moreau,To go out with the setting sun on an empty beach is to truly embrace your solitude.
Jeanne Moreau,"To give and receive love, you have to be in touch with pain, you have to be capable of provoking it and feeling it."
Jeanne Moreau,"To give a character life in a short space of time, it helps if you arrive on screen with a past."
Jeanne Moreau,Success is like a liberation or the first phrase of a love story.
Jeanne Moreau,Sometimes the directors were afraid of what they brought out of me.
Jeanne Moreau,"Some gods may cross your path, but why should gods be beautiful? They could also be frightening."
Jeanne Moreau,"Some children I have met are very beautiful. Some children are imbeciles, vulgar, terrible."
Jeanne Moreau,People's opinions don't interfere with me.
Jeanne Moreau,One thing you have to give up is attaching importance to what people see in you.
Jeanne Moreau,My face has changed with the years and has enough history in it to give audiences something to work with.
Jeanne Moreau,My aim in life is not to judge.
Jeanne Moreau,It's dangerous to assert oneself.
Jeanne Moreau,"If you want to live your life through to the end, you have to live dangerously."
Jeanne Moreau,"If you get trapped in the idea that what is most important is what image of yourself you're giving to the world, you're on a dangerous path."
Jeanne Moreau,I'm always amazed when young women who are having babies want their husbands to watch the babies come out. I would never allow anything like that.
Jeanne Moreau,I think more and more people want to live alone. You can be a couple without being in each other's pockets. I don't see why you have to share the same bathroom.
Jeanne Moreau,"I need, absolutely, to be alone."
Jeanne Moreau,"I gradually work myself into a frenzy as the shoot approaches, while we're choosing the costumes or working with the make-up artist. I'm not so much interested in my character as the film itself."
Jeanne Moreau,I don't like the idea of separating life and work. That notion seems dated and a bit alien to me.
Jeanne Moreau,I don't like going where I've already been. Life is a myriad of territories to discover. I don't want to waste time with what I already know.
Jeanne Moreau,"I don't feel guilt. Whatever I wish to do, I do."
Jeanne Moreau,"I can't belong to groups. I've tried. I behave normally, but people don't look at me normally."
Jeanne Moreau,"I can be intimidating, but not within the confines of a film shoot."
Jeanne Moreau,"I am subject to very powerful lows. When you have highs, you have terrible lows. When you pinpoint that you are responsible for everything that happens to you, it is very frightening."
Jeanne Moreau,Characters who are on screen from start to finish are not necessarily the ones who have the greatest impact.
Jeanne Moreau,Being an actress is to be in tune with the fantasies of a man. What woman never dreamt of that?
Jeanne Moreau,"As a matter of principle, I always come to a film like a blank slate, I don't learn my lines in advance. With this approach, I feel clean."
Jeanne Moreau,"Although for some people cinema means something superficial and glamorous, it is something else. I think it is the mirror of the world."
Jeanne Moreau,All fiction becomes autobiographical when the author has true talent.
Jeanne Moreau,"Aging gracefully is supposed to mean trying not to hide time passing and just looking a wreck. Don't worry girls, look like a wreck, that's the way it goes."
Jeanne Moreau,"Something pretty... that's just the surface. People worry so much about aging, but you look younger if you don't worry about it."
Jeanne Moreau,"Some people are addicts. If they don't act, they don't exist."
Jeanne Moreau,"My life is very exciting now. Nostalgia for what? It's like climbing a staircase. I'm on the top of the staircase, I look behind and see the steps. That's where I was. We're here right now. Tomorrow, we'll be someplace else. So why nostalgia?"
Jeanne Moreau,"I don't think success is harmful, as so many people say. Rather, I believe it indispensable to talent, if for nothing else than to increase the talent."
Jeanne Moreau,"Women will not talk about football unless one of them is in love with a football player, and then suddenly you discover that they know everything that is to be known about it."
Jeanne Moreau,"Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age."
Eric Morecambe,We had not had time to establish ourselves as a double act before Ernie joined the Merchant Navy. I teamed up with the brother of the late Dave Morris.
Eric Morecambe,"It ran wild all right. Mind you, although we blushed every time we read the critics' columns, many viewers wrote to say they liked the shows."
Eric Morecambe,"I'm playing all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order."
Eric Morecambe,"Before the end of 1960 we were asked to do a series. We did not want to rush things, so we waited until we felt fairly sure of the scripts."
Eric Morecambe,"I am playing all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order."
Eric Morecambe,"My neighbour asked if he could use my lawnmower and I told him of course he could, so long as he didn't take it out of my garden."
Tom Morello,"The video tells a very simple story and a very real story. It's a story of a woman who loses her husband and a child who loses his father. That's the simple story. The bigger picture is that the culture of violence at home breeds a culture of violence abroad, and there's a price to be paid for that. And that price is the loss of lives and families destroyed and to sum that up in a three-and-a-half-minute video is something that was pretty incredible."
Tom Morello,"A musician's or artist's responsibility is a simple one, and that is, through your music to tell the truth,"
Tom Morello,It was a terrible natural disaster but an even greater human catastrophe.
Tom Morello,"Music is not some stuffy college lecture, ... On a good day, Rage Against the Machine is not able to just rock you like a hurricane, but also to fuel the engine with indignation and the band's activist convictions."
Tom Morello,"America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace. Once you exercise this freedom youâ€™ve lost all control over what you do, what is produced, and how it is produced. And in the end, the product doesnâ€™t belong to you. The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you donâ€™t care about making a living. Which leads to the second freedom: the freedom to starve."
Bill Morgan,The philosophy hasn't changed. The NCAA is just trying to hook up the rules to the technology.
Bill Morgan,He was very energetic. He wore himself out (Thursday) talking to friends and writing poems.
Bill Morgan,"There will be a lot of emotions, but the biggest thing I'll be thinking about is, 'Did we do all that we could to get the kids ready for this game?'  ... There will probably be a few stones left unturned, but those will be things we can build on."
Bill Morgan,"Sun delivers enterprise-class reliability and performance on an industry-standard x64 platform by offering greater choice and flexibility, especially in the areas of capacity and scalability, which are so vital for our business.

Henry Morgan,A careful driver is one who honks his horn when he goes through a red light.
Henry Morgan,"I have no place to go. If you can get something done for the people living in tents, at least give them lights, because when the moon's not full, it's so dark."
Henry Morgan,"He's appealed his case to the Supreme Court and they affirmed his conviction. He applied to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, but they refused to hear it."
Julia Morgan,Never turn down a job because you think it's too small; you don't know where it can lead
Julia Morgan,Never turn down a job because you think it's too small; you don't know where it can lead.

Victoria Morgan,The dancing is in patterns. Lines transition and fold into each other.
Wayne Morgan,"He's played a little better in practice, which is why he got an opportunity to play."
Wayne Morgan,Everything we did was legal. I did not do anything wrong.
Wayne Morgan,"We have a lot of games that we have to win, but the way our schedule is I think we'll have a chance to win our share of those games."
Wayne Morgan,That's fine. Greg McDermott is a good coach. And Greg McDermott had nothing to do with the situation.
Wayne Morgan,"In terms of his understanding of basketball, Curtis is a genius. He has the same ability Magic Johnson and Larry Bird had to see two, three plays ahead and where the ball needs to go. He sees all the possibilities right away that other kids might not see."
Julie Morgenstern,I would say that 75 percent to 80 percent of the clients I work with choose the wrong place for their files. They tuck it away in some remote location like a spare bedroom or in a basement.
Julie Morgenstern,"Once you have a baby, you can't hold all this stuff in your memory."
Julie Morgenstern,"The influx of e-mail never stops, particularly in a global economy, ... You could always check e-mail. And people are still programmed to wait for things to calm down in order to do proactive stuff: 'When it quiets down, when I get through this flood, this batch, these to-dos, I will get proactive.' But there never is a quiet time."
Marc Morial,"We stand ready to work together, where possible, in helping rebuild not only homes and businesses, but most importantly, lives of those who so desperately need our help."
Marc Morial,"The murders that took place were not directed at visitors, ... They were not acts of random violence; they were acts where the perpetrators and the victims knew each other."
Marc Morial,"Katrina has given us an opportunity -- not just to put up new buildings and stronger levees, as we must -- but to put the principles that we have aspired to for so many years into real practice,"
Marc Morial,This generation of leaders will be judged by how well we handle Katrina.
Marc Morial,"It appears that this is, in fact, the worst vehicular collision in the city's history, given the number of injuries,"
Marc Morial,A great American city is fighting for its life.
Marc Morial,We've lost our city. I fear it's potentially like Pompeii.
Marc Morial,The current elections plan is a formula for problems and disaster. There's a prospect of contested ballots.
Marc Morial,"We can't close the great divides in this country in a day, just like we can't end poverty in a night. But we're going to start by speaking truth to power. America is not America when millions of our citizens are still viewed as a fraction of a person."
Marc Morial,"We want the public to know that there's been unprecedented, multi-agency response to this collision, ... This cooperation was speedy and efficient. And at this point there are no confirmed fatalities."
Marc Morial,"We applaud Tyson for their compassion towards so many who have suffered through the Hurricane Katrina disaster,"
Marc Morial,"[Long ago, in his biography of seminal jazz composer Jelly Roll Morton, my great-uncle Alan Lomax equated the city's contribution to American music to Florence's involvement in the arts of the Renaissance. But it is another city in Italy that seems closer to the mark now.] We've lost our city, ... I fear it's potentially like Pompeii."

Marc Morial,"Money is not our primary aim. Changing the behavior and the practice of the gun industry is,"
Marc Morial,"We have to remember that Dr. King was not an idle dreamer. Dr. King was a man of action. If Dr. King were here, he would challenge us and exhort us. So Denver, as you gather . . . ask yourself and debate the question, what would Dr. King say?"
Marc Morial,"Over time, the ability of the state to be able to continue its obligations under that lease are going to require that the hospitality industry come back strong. Which I think is possible, because the infrastructure of the hospitality industry was not substantially damaged by Katrina. The tough side is that the housing market, which supported the workers that they need, was substantially damaged."
Pat Morita,the only name my parents gave me.
Pat Morita,I had to find things to laugh at.
Pat Morita,"My fame is largely due to young people, they're the first ones to discover me,"
Rob Morosi,"We have the money now, and there's no denying that the roads we're rebuilding need to be done."
Rob Morosi,"Essentially, this bridge has reached its life expectancy."
Rob Morosi,"The SPUI design is much safer, because of longer exit ramps with increased storage that eliminate the backup on the freeway. And when you exit I-94 to Telegraph, with the SPUI design, the decision of which direction you want is made on the ramp, at a slower speed. Before, that decision was made on mainline I-94 itself."
Rob Morosi,We could have easily reconstructed the existing infrastructure in one year. The (two-year) realignment is a benefit to the community and worth the wait.
Chris Morris,"If their climate heated up -- of course this is just speculation -- the flavor would come out of the wood a little quicker and they'd run the risk of building up some astringency. They'd really have to adapt to having younger whiskeys, I would think, to maintain the flavor profiles their customer expects now."
Chris Morris,"I just feel tired now if people are shocked. If it's not for you, just don't bloody watch it."
Chris Morris,The pursuit of approval usually ends in disaster.
Desmond Morris,"We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century. Our only consolation will have to be that, as a species, we have had an exciting term of office."
Desmond Morris,Artists like cats; soldiers like dogs.
Desmond Morris,"I viewed my fellow man not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape."
Desmond Morris,This unusual and highly successful species spends a great deal of time examining his higher motives and an equal amount of time ignoring his fundamental ones.
Desmond Morris,"The city is not a concrete jungle, it is a human zoo."
Desmond Morris,"Biologically speaking, if something bites you it's more likely to be female."
Desmond Morris,"No matter how old we become, we can still call them Holy Mother and Father and put a child-like trust in them."
Desmond Morris,"Clearly, then, the city is not a concrete jungle, it is a human zoo."
Desmond Morris,We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.
Desmond Morris,"No matter how old we become, we can still call them 'Holy Mother' and 'Father' and put a child-like trust in them."
George Morris,The availability of the land has really diminished over the last five years.
George Morris,These conditions are life-threatening and dangerous to the horses and the riders.
George Morris,"The riders would not jump their horses in these conditions and what is very astounding is the powers that be don't read the FEI rulebook which says welfare of the horse above all,"
George Morris,It's about the horse and that's it.
Henry Morris,"The only Bible-honoring conclusion is, of course, that Genesis 1-11 is actual historical truth, regardless of any scientific or chronological problems thereby entailed"
Henry Morris,"I don't think there will be a lot of public support for these strikes because they are seen as highly-paid industrial workers. If the union had a long strike, they will move perhaps even more production offshore."
Henry Morris,An innovative and noteworthy feature of Hyperion System 9 is integrated master data management.
Henry Morris,"We hate that conduct. It's not South Sydney, it's anti-Australian."
Henry Morris,Anyone who takes him to be a fool will be very sorry.
Henry Morris,"The macro-trends foreshadow major disruptions in the software industry. For example, enterprise solutions platform highlights a shift away from ERP suites as the center of gravity in applications. Intelligent process automation speaks to the rising importance of operational decisions as the target for improvements in business efficiency. And the pull of compliance brings renewed attention to information governance across the enterprise. IDC software analysts are teaming up across research areas to explore the implications of these disruptions to established practices and market players,"

Henry Morris,"Master data management is a discipline that goes hand in hand with information governance. Forward-thinking organizations are instituting processes to gain agreement on roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures surrounding the maintenance of a single view of the entities needed for conducting business and measuring its performance,"
Henry Morris,"We were able to give them priority based on a natural disaster preference,"
Henry Morris,"The Biblical record itself makes it plain that the days of creation are literal days, not long indefinite ages. If he wished to convey the idea of long geological ages, however, he could surely have done it far more clearly and effectively in other words than in those which he selected."
Henry Morris,I said 'good as gold'. Friendship is more important - we're not a bunch of bully boys.
Henry Morris,"The evolutionary explanation for origins, although impossible either to prove or to test scientifically, is nevertheless defended by its proponents on the basis that it is the only explanation which is naturalistic, not involving the 'supernatural' element of a divine Creator."
Jim Morris,Coach Self and Avery are going to talk after a couple of his visits are complete.
Jim Morris,He wasn't supposed to be running. He missed a sign.
Jim Morris,"If you look at him you wouldn't expect to be able to hit with power, but he can."
Jim Morris,"With a little bit of knowledge and the right mind-set, you can lead a pretty comfortable life."
Jim Morris,Sometimes it's good to have that enthusiasm of a young team.
Jim Morris,"Animals calm people down. And pet lovers usually have gentle hearts. If you go in the other shelter, people tend to sit still and idle. Here, there's a lot going on. And what's wonderful is the way our students are volunteering and helping wherever they can. For us this is a mission that helps the evacuees and their pets as well as our students who are here taking care of them."
Jim Morris,"I consider myself very lucky. God has a funny way of bringing some things around and knocking you in the head with the ultimate destination. Something I should have achieved quite easily took me a long time to get around to. It came in His time, not mine."
Jim Morris,I'd like to fly. Then I wouldn't have to wait in airport security lines.
Jim Morris,"When you lay your life out there, you want it to be as true as possible."
Jim Morris,"He's a very unique guy, with the offensive ability he has behind the plate. Something that's very intriguing to me is that his coach played in the major leagues. That should mean he has more refined tools than most kids at that age. ... We expect him to come in with his tools and compete right away for us."
Leon Morris,"There's no better way to build a sizable client base, create recurring revenue streams, and promote and maintain client trust and loyalty than to serve the best interests of your clients. Whether the homeowner is looking for a mortgage, a second opinion on a mortgage, a Mortgagor Financial Representativeâ„¢, or assistance in evaluating and retiring an existing mortgage, as a mortgage practitioner you want to be the only person the homeowner looks to before, during and after mortgage origination. These services help mortgage professionals be that person."
Leon Morris,"Homeowners often rely on generalized information they get piecemeal from various sources, sometimes getting lost in the deluge of information maybe because they find it difficult to objectively assess loan suitability or because life's hectic pace leaves little time to sift, sort, or screen all relevant data. We're showing them that for the cost of a typical appraisal or property inspection, there's a better way. We believe that independent personalized mortgage advice and representation are services that are long overdue."
Leon Morris,"If a consumer chooses to rely on the 'free' advice of a salesperson, then they should expect to be sold. However, while the mortgage practitioner is providing these advisory services the sales hat is removed. At that point they are acting solely on behalf of the homeowner as a true fiduciary mortgage advisor."
Matt Morris,"From what Matheny tells me, he has unbelievable talent. He listens and he wants to learn. I'm just throwing my two cents in at whatever situation comes up so I can help him out. I'm trying to speed up his learning curve a little bit so he doesn't have to experience it on the field. I'm helping him with some arm exercises that might keep him healthy. I've been through the gamut of surgeries and all that so you try to help a young kid get into a good routine so he can stay healthy."
Matt Morris,"I felt good physically, and it was good to get back out instead of going on 10 days' [rest]."
Matt Morris,He does whatever he's asked to. There's no complaining. He just wants to win the game ... I think it's rubbed off on a lot of guys.
Matt Morris,I gave up a bunch of 0-2 hits. I was throwing too many balls over the plate. That's not a good formula.
Robert Morris,"It's becoming more common for companies such as IKEA to locate distribution hubs in Savannah. The Savannah River International Trade Park is in close proximity to the port, and we have room to grow at the terminal."
Robert Morris,"The real trick on any buyout fund, and technology funds even more so, is balancing the company's leverage level with the use of cash. And in technology companies there tends to be an extremely high use of cash, because you are constantly investing in and developing the technology, which is not true in what I'll call stable old businesses."
Robert Morris,We've got a lot of problems. Nobody is really doing anything about it.
Robert Morris,"Our clients vary in size, so our best practice approach to Microsoft Technology solutions ensure the success of our clients projects, every time."
Robert Morris,"Mobility solutions have matured from a few years ago, so we can now deliver information anytime, anywhere. Our clients spoke to us about giving real time secure access to applications and information to all aspects of their organization that included the mobile workforce, and we can now deliver solutions that break down barriers."
Robert Morris,"Well, I don't know any piece by heart, but Mozart goes something like this... What do you think?"
Robert Morris,"The packaged food area has also been in a relative price decline now for three years, but this is another area where some companies continue toÃ¡ execute well and deserve investors' attention,"
Robert Morris,"The global economy, ... is showing a very good recovery after a very bad two years. We're seeing rising demand across the board. Two of the companies that we like a lot, Duke Energy Ã¡( DUK : Research , Estimates ) and Dominion Resources Ã¡( D : Research , Estimates ), are nuclear plays; [they are] also involved now in the natural gas industry, and I think both of these companies are set up to show above-average earnings growth for this group, above-average dividend growth. I think it is a safe place to be in this market."
Robert Morris,"We are opposed to this marina, and any effort to compromise the military security of this nation."
Robert Morris,I think Chase at 12 times forecast earnings is a very cheap stock and a very well run company. I think the probabilities are you're going to make some money here.
Scott Morris,Progress is tremendous. They're doing a fantastic job.
Scott Morris,"There are quite a few people taking advantage of making their opinions known. Let's see how many people we can get to take this survey, so the ISVs will pay attention and start porting their products to Linux."
Scott Morris,"As peoples' needs in those arenas were filled, they wanted media players for their music. An interest in graphic design and manipulation became more apparent. Pretty soon, people not only considered the possibility of Linux as a multimedia platform, but, as we can see, they are now demanding it."
Steve Morris,"They know if they wish me to attend for a specific discussion or purpose, I will be glad to attend - just as I would accept an invitation from hoteliers in other parts of the valley, or any other constituent group of the CVA that wished to have my ear on any relevant subject."
Steve Morris,I'm hopeful that the success we've been having the last two years leads to more consistency year in and year out.
Steve Morris,"The biggest thing is pretty darn simple. Corporate America, because of technology and information and bandwidth, doesn't need the kind of space they needed before."
Steve Morris,"Now that we no longer have the obligations that came with the Nielsen option agreement, we are free to focus our resources on the best PPM ratings services possible for the U.S. radio industry."
Tom Morris,Of course a mother is going to be supportive of her sons running for public office.
Tom Morris,"Socrates had a student named Plato, Plato had a student named Aristotle, and Aristotle had a student named Alexander the Great."
Tom Morris,"For true success, it matters what our goals are. And it matters how we go about attaining them. The means are as important as the ends. How we get there is as important as where we go."
Tom Morris,"Faith sir, she looks like the Old Course."
Tom Morris,"A goal is not the same as a desire, and this is an important distinction to make. You can have a desire you don't intend to act on. But you can't have a goal you don't intend to act on."
William Morris,"Simplicity of life, even the barest, is not a misery, but the very foundation of refinement; a sanded floor and whitewashed walls and the green trees, and flowery meads, and living waters outside; or a grimy palace amid the same with a regiment of housemaids always working to smear the dirt together so that it may be unnoticed; which, think you, is the most refined, the most fit for a gentleman of those two dwellings?"
William Morris,"Of rich men it telleth, and strange is the story how they have, and they hanker, and grip far and wide; And they live and they die, and the earth and its glory has been but a burden they scarce might abide."
William Morris,"It is right and necessary that all men should have work to do which shall be worth doing, and be of itself pleasant to do; and which should he done under such conditions as would make it neither over-wearisome nor over-anxious."
William Morris,"This land is a little land; too much shut up within the narrow seas, as it seems, to have much space for swelling into hugeness. . . ."
William Morris,"Had she come all the way for this, / To part at last without a kiss?"
William Morris,"[I]t is not revenge we want for poor people, but happiness; indeed, what revenge can be taken for all the thousands of years of the sufferings of the poor?"
William Morris,"Forget days past, heart broken, put all memory by! No grief on the green hillside, no pity in the sky, Joy that may not be spoken fills mead and flower and tree."
William Morris,"I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few."
William Morris,"I have the utmost respect for them. It was formed at the time of great violence and danger, particularly for African-American lawyers."
William Morris,"Love is enough: though the world be a-waning, / And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining."
William Morris,"So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on; and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die; that is to say, civilization will die."
William Morris,"There were four of us about that bed; / The mass-priest knelt at the side, / I and his mother stood at the head, / Over his feet lay the bride."
Adam Morrison,I was feeling it. This was for first place today. It's a big game for us and a big road sweep.
Adam Morrison,They kept running fresh guys at me. I took some bad shots early and I started feeling settled in the second half.
Adam Morrison,I don't know why people are concerned about my scoring - we got the win. Teams always want to shut down the other team's top scorer.
Adam Morrison,"In my mind, I passed it. But all you guys know I air-balled it, so it works out."
Adam Morrison,"It's nice to get his 3-point shot back, too. People have got to honor that. They can't sag on me and J.P. as much."
Adam Morrison,"It's kind of funny that some people make a big deal about it. It's funny, I guess."
Adam Morrison,"It's been a great process so far. It's been fun, but I've decided to try to take my game to the next level and further my career as a basketball player."
Adam Morrison,"They had lots of friends. They made everybody laugh. Itâ€™s a big loss,"
Adam Morrison,Everybody wants to talk trash. But people don't realize that just fuels the fire. You don't have to say much to me to make me get pissed off.
Adam Morrison,I wouldn't call it fear as much as you don't want the season to end. Nobody wants to be like Iowa and lose to a 14.
Adam Morrison,"I missed too many 8-footers in the lane, but part of it was Memphis' defense."
Adam Morrison,"We were in control, and it just happened in a blur."
Adam Morrison,"It just happened in a blur. I hate losing, period. I mean anything, especially basketball."
Jennifer Morrison,"I got really jealous. Being in touch with Cameron's feelings, it was kind of hard to watch."
Jennifer Morrison,Do a differential diagnosis in interpretive dance.
Jennifer Morrison,"This was a very serious offence. There were over 10,000 images of boys between the ages of 9 and 12 years of age."
Jim Morrison,I am the lizard king. I can do anything.
Jim Morrison,I think the highest and lowest points are the important ones. Anything else is just...in between. I want the freedom to try everything.
Jim Morrison,"I've always liked reptiles. I used to see the universe as a mammoth snake, and I used to see all the people and objects, landscapes, as little pictures in the facets of their scales. I think peristaltic motion is the basic life movement. Swallowing,"
Jim Morrison,"I'm always a bit suspicious when lyricists call themselves poets,"
Jim Morrison,"How can I set free anyone who doesn't have the guts to stand up alone and declare his own freedom? I think it's a lie  people claim they want to be free  everybody insists that freedom is what they want the most, the most sacred and precious thing a man can possess. But that's bullshit! People are terrified to be set free  they hold on to their chains. They fight anyone who tries to break those chains. It's their securityHow can they expect me or anyone else to set them free if they don't really want to be free?"
Jim Morrison,"How can I set free anyone who doesn't have the guts to stand up alone and declare his own freedom? I think it's a lie â€“ people claim they want to be free â€“ everybody insists that freedom is what they want the most, the most sacred and precious thing a man can possess. But that's bullshit! People are terrified to be set free â€“ they hold on to their chains. They fight anyone who tries to break those chains. It's their securityâ€¦How can they expect me or anyone else to set them free if they don't really want to be free?"
Jim Morrison,"People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but that's bullshit. Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they're afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain. But they're wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio. You feel your strength in the experience of pain. It's all in how you carry it. That's what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, you're letting society destroy your reality. You should stand up for your right to feel your pain."
Jim Morrison,the future's uncertain and the end is always near
Jim Morrison,Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality. I was curious to see what would happen. That's all it was: curiosity.
Jim Morrison,"I am interested in anything about revolt, disorder , chaos-especially activity that seems to have no meaning. It seems to me to be the road toward freedom... Rather than starting inside, I start outside and reach the mental through the physical."
Jim Morrison,A friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself.
Jim Morrison,"I see myself as an intelligent, sensitive human, with the soul of a clown which forces me to blow it at the most important moments."
Jim Morrison,"I'm interested in anything about revolt, disorder, chaos, especially activity that appears to have no meaning. It seems to me to be the road toward freedom."
Jim Morrison,"There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors."
Jim Morrison,"The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask."
Jim Morrison,"I am interested in anything about revolt, disorder, chaos-especially activity that seems to have no meaning. It seems to me to be the road toward freedom... Rather than starting inside, I start outside and reach the mental through the physical."
Jim Morrison,"Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself-and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. That's what real love amounts to-letting a person be what he really is."
Jim Morrison,The time to hesitate is through.
Jim Morrison,Some of the worst mistakes of my life have been haircuts.
Jim Morrison,"When you make your peace with authority, you become authority."
Jim Morrison,"I think in art, but especially in films, people are trying to confirm their own existences."
Jim Morrison,"Whoever controls the media, controls the mind."
Jim Morrison,"We fear violence less than our own feelings. Personal, private, solitary pain is more terrifying than what anyone else can inflict."
Jim Morrison,"I believe in a long, prolonged derangement of the senses to attain the unknown. Our pale reasoning hides the infinite from us."
Jim Morrison,This is the strangest life I've ever known.
Jim Morrison,There are things known and things unknown and in between are the doors.
Jim Morrison,Music inflames temperament.
Jim Morrison,Love cannot save you from your own fate.
Jim Morrison,Hatred is a very underestimated emotion.
Jim Morrison,It's like gambling somehow. You go out for a night of drinking and you don't know where your going to end up the next day. It could work out good or it could be disastrous. It's like the throw of the dice.
Jim Morrison,"Actually I don't remember being born, It must have happened during one of my black outs."
Jim Morrison,"I like any reaction I can get with my music. Just anything to get people to think. I mean if you can get a whole room full of drunk, stoned people to actually wake up and think, you're doing something."
Jim Morrison,"Listen, real poetry doesn't say anything; it just ticks off the possibilities. Opens all doors. You can walk through anyone that suits you."
Jim Morrison,I like people who shake other people up and make them feel uncomfortable.
Jim Morrison,"I believe in a long, prolonged, derangement of the senses in order to obtain the unknown."
Jim Morrison,"I think of myself as an intelligent, sensitive human being with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most important moments."
Jim Morrison,"Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free."
Jim Morrison,"If my poetry aims to achieve anything, it's to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel."
Jim Morrison,"Each generation wants new symbols, new people, new names. They want to divorce themselves from their predecessors."
Jim Morrison,Violence isn't always evil. What's evil is the infatuation with violence.
Jim Morrison,Where's your will to be weird?
Jim Morrison,Film spectators are quiet vampires.
Ken Morrison,"I think it was a huge success, ... It really made me feel good. Particularly such compliments as, this is the best-run tournament I've ever played in."
Ken Morrison,"I think it was a huge success, ... It really made me feel good. Particularly such compliments as, â€˜this is the best-run tournament I've ever played in."
Ken Morrison,I don't even know what a middle-class shopper is.
Ken Morrison,"If the state hadn't purchased it, the character of the Ridge would have been lost. It is a great asset."
Phil Morrison,"My mother and Myra Doernberg, the mother of our production designer, David Doernberg, were the utility infielders on the team,"
Phil Morrison,I'm not sure the state took into consideration the needs of all students. Most schools have very diverse learning populations.
Phil Morrison,"What really impressed me was that one of my friends went to a Max Ophuls retrospective at Lincoln Center  and Michael Barker was there every day. When your distributor is doing that, you know it's not just a job. They really love movies."
Phil Morrison,"What really impressed me was that one of my friends went to a Max Ophuls retrospective at Lincoln Center â€” and Michael Barker was there every day. When your distributor is doing that, you know it's not just a job. They really love movies."
Phil Morrison,"We tried to be as ready and solid as we could be, ... Filmmaking is always some form of chaos, and to what extent you're able to harness the chaos."
Scott Morrison,It's been a real struggle.
Scott Morrison,"This is an independent, self-sustaining industry that is growing (at) more than twice the rate of the pharmaceutical industry. It is here to stay."
Scott Morrison,"We will be an early warning for the rest of the world, particularly the banking and financial centers of the Northern Hemisphere."
Scott Morrison,The pharmaceutical sector is clearly looking at biotech as the innovation leader.
Tom Morrison,"He has certainly earned a healthy retirement,"
Tom Morrison,That's not something the lawyers and police have to worry about. That's something the council will have to handle.
Tom Morrison,"That's contrary to what the police department has informed us, ... I don't know that it would be appropriate to have a complete ban. If it does have that effect, we need to take another look at it. That was not the council's intent."
Tom Morrison,"We've been owed this money for a while now, but because of the fiscal crisis at the time, it was never granted to us."
Van Morrison,It was really strange for me when I started to play concerts in America where the audiences were all sitting down.
Van Morrison,My ambition when I started out was to play two or three gigs a week. And that's what I'm doing.
Van Morrison,"Even today, skiffle is a defining part of my music. If I get the opportunity to just have a jam, skiffle is what I love to play."
Van Morrison,"I write songs. Then, I record them. And, later, maybe I perform them on stage. That's what I do. That's my job. Simple."
Van Morrison,"I don't feel comfortable doing interviews. My profession is music, and writing songs. That's what I do. I like to do it, but I hate to talk about it."
Van Morrison,Being famous was extremely disappointing for me. When I became famous it was a complete drag and it is still a complete drag.
Van Morrison,Music is spiritual. The music business is not.
Van Morrison,"You can't stay the same. If you're a musician and a singer, you have to change, that's the way it works."
James Morrow,"Because they're so different, they're totally a reflection of society and where we are, but in performance they also connect us to each other and the audience. We're all different, we're all connected -- how do we unify? How do we find a social awareness that's larger than us?"
James Morrow,"But there is something about their eyes, and the way they smile at you, that tells you they're not just regular kids."
James Morrow,"The tech market was a speculators' market back then. It was a difficult environment to invest in. Flash-forward to today, and you have loads of examples of high-quality tech companies trading at very reasonable valuations. ... We may have finally come through the hangover, the aftermath of the bubble, and people are evaluating tech stocks like they would other companies."
James Morrow,"Curiosity may have killed the cat, but lack of curiosity would have killed thousands"
David Morse,"Idaho is not substantially different than the rest of the nation. What I think this data shows is that across the board, across the country, people without health insurance, are sicker and less likely to get the care they need. And when they do get care, their condition is much worse."
David Morse,"Implicitly when they make that request there's an expectation that it will be paid back,"
David Morse,"As we continue to explore the universe, we are proud that NASA's pioneering efforts keep fueling American creativity, innovation and technology development. This new product is yet another example of the additional dividends Americans reap from their investment in space exploration."
David Morse,The real future of the Hispanic targeted media and advertising is in English.
Samuel Morse,What God hath wrought?

The philosopher Schopenhauer talked about how out of the randomness, there is an apparent intention in the fate of an individual that can be glimpsed later on. When you are an old guy, you can look back, and maybe this rambling life has some through-line. Others can see it better sometimes. But when you glimpse it yourself, you see it more clearly than anyone"
Viggo Mortensen,"It brought up real emotion, real fear, a fear of not knowing what exists in me."
Viggo Mortensen,"Like most people I can be lazy, so it's nice to have a goal or deadline or reason to work out. I feel better when I get to exercise, or when I'm outdoors. I like to hike, swim and run, and I love to play soccer."

Edwin Moses,"Without a doubt, I would have [won], short of falling or being disqualified or something like that. That is a mediocre time for me. That is exhibition type of running."
Edwin Moses,"I think with this whole influx into immediacy -- everyone is short term in their outlook. I made a tremendous commitment by not being able to go to medical school and not finishing all that I wanted to do in my engineering career. So I put everything into track and field. And just the passion I have for the sport, I never imagined I would be as good as I was. Once I realized I was that great, I put everything into maintaining it."

Grandma Moses,"Now that I am ninety-five years old, looking back over the years, I have seen many changes taking place, so many inventions have been made. Things now go faster. In olden times things were not so rushed. I think people were more content, more satisfied with life than they are today. You dont hear nearly as much laughter and shouting as you did in my day, and what was fun for us wouldnt be fun now.... In this age I dont think people are as happy, they are worried. Theyre too anxious to get ahead of their neighbors, they are striving and striving to get something better. I do think in a way that they have too much now. We did with much less."

Randy Moss,"I've got to come in here and establish myself, ... Just like doing it all over again. So I'm trying to work hard."
Randy Moss,"This is probably the best offense I've been in ever, from high school all the way to the pros. To be honest with you, this offense is designed just to hit the open man."
Randy Moss,"As far as building the relationships, I think it's more just believing in one another, ... I think what I've done in my career, a lot of people are looking at me 'Oh, that's Moss, that's Moss.' That's not how I'm approaching this change. I'm approaching it as, I've got to come in here and establish myself. Just like doing it all over again. So I'm trying to work hard."
Randy Moss,"He's definitely into every moment in practice,'' said Oakland guard Brad Badger, who played with Moss in Minnesota."
Randy Moss,That was really me talking in the past.
Randy Moss,"I was getting doubled and tripled probably 95 percent of the night. I just wanted to try to work, and when I got single-safety man-to-man, I tried to pick up my game a little bit more. They called the play, the play was designed for me to go deep, and I looked up at the lights, saw the ball drop and had to put my hands on it. I can't hang my hat on that because we lost."
Randy Moss,"This offense is designed just to hit the open man. I got used to it in mini-camp very quickly, ... If a play is designed to go to me, and I'm double- and triple-covered, then Kerry's reads will take him elsewhere. I think that's what I like about this offense."
Randy Moss,"My hat is off to the Patriots, man, ... They're a good team. They run good schemes, they've got good ballplayers inside those schemes. I really think that we came out energized, enthused. Late in the game we just didn't have that same energy."

Randy Moss,I'm sticking by my friend and I'll support him and his family as he gets help battling his problem.
Randy Moss,likes the direction the franchise is moving.
Randy Moss,"Both are outstanding players, but the guy that affects the defense more than anyone is Randy Moss. I've never seen anyone who will back safeties up 20 years. And I think Minnesota is starting to see now, not only are they missing the big play potential, but the running game is affected as well because all of a sudden people play closer to the scrimmage. While T.O. is an outstanding player, I think Randy changes the game more than anyone."
Randy Moss,"But as far as me abusing it and, you know, letting it take control over me, I don't do that, no."

Randy Moss,"I've really taken it from a business standpoint, to just going out and doing my job. I just do whatever I can to help this team get back on top. I'm not looking at it as trying to find a new home. I'm just looking at it, like I said, as a business and just going out there and doing my job. It's been very, you know, mind-racking to get the plays down and knowing where to line up. But I'm enjoying myself."

Santana Moss,"[Although the 1,315 yards he produced in 2004 would satisfy many NFL runners, the total disappointed Portis, who failed to post a third straight 1,500-yard season, scored only five rushing touchdowns, and finished with career lows in most major categories.] Everything wasn't as peaches and cream as it was where he left [Denver], ... I'm pretty sure just having that under his belt now he knows what to expect."
Santana Moss,"In overtime, ... I remember our receivers coach [Stan Hixon] said to me, 'Let's go. We're going to give you the chance [to win the game].' I'm just glad to be a part of this team and have an opportunity to make those plays."
Santana Moss,"[Cultivating that diversity in the passing attack was mandatory. Moss entered the game with more than twice as many receiving yards as anyone else on the roster, catching 10 balls of 30 yards or more in the first six games, equaling Washington's entire output from 2004. But as the weeks went by, the Redskins knew those plays might dry up.] You have to know what teams are going to give you, ... and you can't just sit back and beat them with the Hawaiian punch every week."

Manny Mota,"Baseball, I think, is a good channel for reaching children. And at the same time, to convince them of the importance of education. In other words, you can combine education and sports."

Mark Mothersbaugh,"Right now I just finished writing the music for a Rugrats feature film and the third week of September I go to London, and the Orchestra is going to perform the score."

Jose Mourinho,"The reality is he is not playing well or feeling confident and this bad feeling in the hamstring coming from the spine is not good,"
Jose Mourinho,We are two completely different teams. They have great quality in one aspect. We have great quality in others.
Jose Mourinho,"We played well. We looked very confident and compact, there were no defensive problems and we used the ball very well,"

Jose Mourinho,"In my vocabulary the words are: work, be professional, do your best, work with quality, commitment and enthusiasm and respect. That's what I promise."
Jose Mourinho,"I'm very, very proud of my players, very proud them. I think in difficult circumstances they played very well, with a lot of heart."
Jose Mourinho,"For the foreign players it is even more difficult than for the English ones because they cannot have Christmas in their own country, often they are without family here and they deserve respect. They are so committed."
Jose Mourinho,This result doesn't make a champion or doesn't decide that the loser cannot be champion. It is just one game. We have dozens and dozens of matches to play.
Jose Mourinho,"I believe before his contract ends, Chelsea will offer him an agreement until the end of his career. I don't think there is any chance of Frank joining Barcelona."

Alonzo Mourning,"I know I can still play this game at a high level, ... I feel like I'm a Hall of Fame player."
Alonzo Mourning,I'm going to have a long conversation with Stu. He was once a player. He knows the intensity in the playoffs. I thought he would have made better judgment in his decision.
Alonzo Mourning,"I was very, very confident in my body. As soon as the doctors gave me the green light, I knew that I would be capable of contributing in a way that will benefit this ball club."
Alonzo Mourning,I think he has a huge upside. He has a great NBA body and now it's just a matter of him incorporating his talents into a system.
Alonzo Mourning,I can still play this game at a high level; I've proven that. I want to be home. I want to be close to my family. I want to be close to my foundation and my business interests.
Alonzo Mourning,"Once my doctor began treating my kidney disease, my greatest challenge was the constant exhaustion. Fortunately, my doctor explained that anemia was causing my exhaustion and that people with serious illnesses, like kidney disease, may be at increased risk for anemia."
Alonzo Mourning,"I've got to worry about Alonzo Mourning, because a year or two ago there was a chance that Alonzo Mourning wouldn't be standing here talking to you. That's the cold reality of it."
Alonzo Mourning,"It felt better just putting on that jersey, and at the end of all this just coming out with a win. That's what this is all about."
Alonzo Mourning,I was hurting. I had some ailments I was dealing with. It's not like I was holding out.
Alonzo Mourning,I want to live 50 more years. I'm 33 years old... and I want to live to at least be 80 and see my kids grow up and see my grandkids. That's important to me.
Alonzo Mourning,"When the new ownership came in, they made some decisions I wasn't pleased with. And when they changed the whole aspect of it, I just totally lost interest."
Alonzo Mourning,There's a disappointment there because I still feel there's an emptiness in my career that just wasn't filled.
Alonzo Mourning,"You know what? We've still got a whole summer. So, that's not really etched in stone. He's at an age right now, man, where I wouldn't put any guarantees on the future."
Alonzo Mourning,"You can hardly touch a guy. If anybody has any athletic ability and quickness, with the first step he's going to get to the basket. They don't want you to touch guys on the dribble. I remember when I came into the league, you could touch guys. You can't do that anymore."
Amr Moussa,I salute the Iraqis and wish them victory.
Amr Moussa,A deal that would conceal the truth in this affair was never even considered.
Amr Moussa,"I got the support, which made me glad,"
Amr Moussa,"This is an important, key step to achieve understanding between all the members of Iraqi society,"
Amr Moussa,"We are 100 percent for the full implementation of Security Council resolutions, ... Here we shall not hesitate to say anything that shall lead to full implementation of the Security Council resolutions."
Amr Moussa,There are no more relations to be opened until they go back to the right path of peace.
Amr Moussa,It is obvious that peace means the return of all occupied Arab lands ... what is required here is that we pass on to the Arab summit a complete suggested program to achieve this main goal.
Amr Moussa,"Our reform will not come to fruition, regionally and that everyone in this region will benefit from, except if peace prevails,"
Amr Moussa,"If the peace process moves toward ... an imbalanced peace, the Arabs must stand in one line to prevent it,"
Amr Moussa,Of course the transfer of power was decided on by the Security Council and we wish them good luck and that the Iraqi government is able to exercise its sovereignty.
Amr Moussa,"This step ... constitutes a very basic and important message, ... I hope that the Israelis understand that. We can't take it (any) more ... the aggressive acts, not only the excessive use of force but the use of force that we have seen against the civilian population, against the Palestinians in their territories."
Amr Moussa,"We are very happy this is the solution that the Iraqi government reached with the representative of international legitimacy. And now that this is done, there are no problems, ... I believe that the U.S. as a responsible country will have to agree."
Amr Moussa,There's no need to comment on it by welcoming it or giving other details about it.
Amr Moussa,"Syria has the right to preserve its security, future and territorial integrity... any attempt to harm Syria will be a big mistake.. and any incorrect policy against her could in a way lead to a large fire in the Arab nation,"
Amr Moussa,We are working so this will be the basis for Iraq's future.
Amr Moussa,"This is related to the future of this region as a whole, ... Either we have justice, peace and progress or chaos, confrontations continuously progressing and with no possibility of knowing in advance their results."
Amr Moussa,What about freedom of expression when anti-Semitism is involved? Then it is not freedom of expression. Then it is a crime.
Amr Moussa,"What is important is that Iraq is able to exercise its sovereignty and its power for the benefit of Iraq and for the benefit of moving Iraq out of the dangerous phase it is in, to a new phase,"
Amr Moussa,Iraq is now undergoing a security crisis.
Amr Moussa,"I share the concerns of many Iraqis about the lack of consensus on the constitution,"
Amr Moussa,The situation is very dangerous and sensitive. But we in the Arab world have enough awareness to behave and react to face all the big and dangerous problems.
Amr Moussa,"We share their anger, but we are here to express that anger."
Amr Moussa,"Nobody can sign (any agreement) now because he does not know exactly what he is signing,"
Amr Moussa,"Kuwait has no plan to aid any action inside Iraq,"
Tony Mowbray,"There is no truth in the fact that Chelsea want to take John Park,"
Tony Mowbray,"Players found it difficult to get going but as the game went on, the tackles came and so too did the competitive edge, that was evident in the second half when I felt that if one team was going to score it was ourselves."
Tony Mowbray,"It's a journey into the unknown, ... but we will be doing our utmost to get as much information on them as possible. We are going to be underdogs and the fact they won their group last season suggests they are a very good team. We have to be more than wary of them and we will prepare very thoroughly."
Tony Mowbray,"[The manager is hopeful of a performance tonight of which the Hibs players who embarked upon that run to the semi-finals of the European Cup 50 years ago would approve.] You still see some of that team around the stadium on match days and they are all perfect gentlemen, ... Those are the guys who laid the foundations for Hibs being an entertaining, open, passing football team, which is something I try to follow today. It's thanks to those guys that we can try and humbly follow in their footsteps."
Tony Mowbray,"He's delighted to have taken part in such a historic night, but he knows he's still a young boy who has to build up his whole game and level of fitness,"
Tony Mowbray,"Yes, we've got a few Scotland internationals who play regularly but their last game was still in front of just 1,500 people, ... So, OK, you're playing international football against decent players but European football is about the night, the occasion, the passion, the noise, the expectation, the knotted stomach before the game, so that's the experience you need, not necessarily just playing in front of 1,500 in an under-21 game."
Tony Mowbray,We have to win the game against Ayr and I will pick the best team to win it. Ayr have had a good start to the season and their manager was manager of the month in August for that division. We played them in pre-season down there and we lost on penalties. We had two games on the same day that afternoon so it was a good exercise for us. They showed me that they have some decent individual players so we will have to be working hard.
Tony Mowbray,I am excited about him. He will be a good signing for us. He brings further competition and hopefully his arrival will give us a wee lift.
Mo Mowlam,"We don't want to see the violence we have seen in previous years, because it benefits no one,"
Mo Mowlam,"If these arrangements are going to work, then everyone involved will have to give up violence for good, and decommissioning is an essential part of the package. People can't pick and choose which parts they like or dislike."
Mo Mowlam,"What we have to do, I think, is now have a little space -- a little time to talk to the parties and find out the best way we can move forward,"
Mo Mowlam,the exact impact on the peace process is not easy to ascertain.
Mo Mowlam,We have come so far in the last year that I just hope people will think twice and abide by the law.
Mo Mowlam,"I believe there is the determination and the will to do it and I believe we will have a good day,"
Mo Mowlam,"It is serious but the security forces have the situation under control, and people are going to work as normal,"
Mo Mowlam,"The integrity of the talks process and the commitment to the exclusively peaceful means are paramount and all parties must be treated fairly and equally,"
Mo Mowlam,"Those who killed Rosemary Nelson did so because they thought it would destroy the Good Friday agreement, ... (She was) a brave woman who stood up for what she believed in."
Jamie Moyer,It's feedback. I was trying to see how many times in a row I could get him to say it.
Jamie Moyer,I threw the ball decently. It seemed like I had to pitch out of trouble every inning.
Jamie Moyer,"The losses, they get old. We've got a lot of guys here that are learning the big-league situation, but at the same time, they've got to learn how to win."
Jamie Moyer,He knows what he's doing and he's a true competitor. He's got some good ideas and he's not shy about expressing them.
Jamie Moyer,"I think I pitched OK. On these low-scoring games, you've got to take advantage of what you can get."
Jamie Moyer,"He adds so much to our organization and our community as a person as well as a player, ... and as a family man."
Jamie Moyer,"He got a lot of ground balls when he needed them, ... You've got to tip your hat sometimes to the opposing pitcher."
Jamie Moyer,"To me, he's mature beyond his years. I look back to when I was his age. I don't think I would have handled things the way he does. I would have handled them completely differently ? more in a negative way. He seems to take it all in stride. It's almost like he's lived it before."
Bill Moyers,"Television can stir emotions, but it doesn't invite reflection as much as the printed page."
Bill Moyers,"There is no more important struggle for American democracy than ensuring a diverse, independent and free media. Free Press is at the heart of that struggle."
Bill Moyers,"The printed page conveys information and commitment, and requires active involvement. Television conveys emotion and experience, and it's very limited in what it can do logically. It's an existential experience-there and then gone."
Bill Moyers,"What's right and good doesn't come naturally. You have to stand up and fight for it - as if the cause depends on you, because it does."
Bill Moyers,We see more and more of our Presidents and know less and less about what they do.
Bill Moyers,This is the first time in my 32 years in public broadcasting that PBS has ordered up programs for ideological instead of journalistic reasons.
Bill Moyers,There are honest journalists like there are honest politicians - they stay bought.
Bill Moyers,"The printed page conveys information and commitment, and requires active involvement. Television conveys emotion and experience, and it's very limited in what it can do logically. It's an existential experience - there and then gone."

Bill Moyers,I work for him despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies.
Bill Moyers,I own and operate a ferocious ego.
Bill Moyers,Hyperbole was to Lyndon Johnson what oxygen is to life.
Bill Moyers,"Democracy may not prove in the long run to be as efficient as other forms of government, but it has one saving grace: it allows us to know and say that it isn't."
Bill Moyers,Creativity is piercing the mundane to find the marvelous.
Bill Moyers,As a student I learned from wonderful teachers and ever since then I've thought everyone is a teacher.
Bill Moyers,"For the first time in our history, ideology and theology hold a monopoly of power in Washington."
Bill Moyers,Democracy belongs to those who exercise it.
Bill Moyers,We don't care really about children as a society and television reflects that indifference to children as human beings.
Bill Moyers,"Our very lives depend on the ethics of strangers, and most of us are always strangers to other people."
Bill Moyers,"When I learn something new - and it happens every day - I feel a little more at home in this universe, a little more comfortable in the nest."
David Moyes,It's a man's game. He's running with his head down and gone into the boy.
David Moyes,Nuno is doing some running now. We will have to see how everybody goes this weekend and then see what happens in the last few games.
David Moyes,It could well be that he misses the rest of the season.
David Moyes,"I take full responsibility of course, but I don't think the talk should be about David Moyes."
David Moyes,"We played a really good team tonight, and we carried bits of luck. I haven't seen the goal that was disallowed, but I didn't think the referee did well for us. We were impeded lots of times."
David Moyes,"We must set our goals high, and anybody who has seen us will say we are a better side than we were last year,"
David Moyes,"The performance was great. The players were down after the 5-1 defeat but they came out tonight and they gave it a real go,"
David Moyes,We were playing a really good team and it was hard enough 11 against 11 without the decisions going against us.
David Moyes,Let's remember his age and what is expected of him.
David Moyes,"You should find out more about people in adversity but I have been saying that for three or four weeks now. We'll find out who can handle it, the ones who have enough to take the ball under pressure, who can carry on playing and doing the right things and we are beginning to see the ones who can't."
Michael Moynihan,"Our strength is that we return depth at every position and the only exception is goalkeeper. S.A. graduated last season after a great career and we don't return anyone with college experience. We do like the talent we've added, and feel very comfortable with our goalkeeping situation."
Michael Moynihan,Maria is another good athlete with a very strong leg. We expect good things from her as she gains valuable experience.
Michael Moynihan,"All our returning forwards have shown the ability to score. We hope that one will emerge this season as a consistent, game-to-game threat."
Michael Moynihan,"Our success will depend on the ability of this group to come together and play as a unit. We have the talent to stay on top in the conference and certainly return to the NCAA Tournament, but it will take awhile to see how it comes together."
John Mozeliak,"Now that we've got these problems resolved and got everybody in camp, with one exception, we're looking forward and not backward."
John Mozeliak,"He requested his release. He was looking for a Double-A opportunity. He felt he wasn't going to get that with us, which is true."
John Mozeliak,I'm extremely flattered and honored for this opportunity. But I'm also realistic. It's just an opportunity to be interviewed at this point. It's hard to put the cart in front of the horse. I'm making sure I'm doing due diligence to get to a level of comfort and awareness with the organization.
John Mozeliak,"I'm very flattered for this opportunity. It's an early part of the process, but it's also a unique opportunity, and it's a chance everyone in this business in my position is eager to get."
John Mozeliak,"Obviously, given what we saw we think he has an opportunity to make the team. Give him a full spring training as a true position player and maybe some winter ball, it's something that we think he has the ability to play in the big leagues."
John Mozeliak,"There was a delay in the process. I'm not exactly sure what that is at this moment, nor do I know if I'm even going to press for it, with the fact that they got it. So they'll be traveling to Florida tomorrow."
John Mozeliak,"The guy that was [previously] the head of the U.S. consulate, he was much more forgiving with baseball players. So even though there were some things going on there, they tried to help expedite professional baseball players. So yes, those rules existed, but now they have to be stricter."
John Mueller,"Generally, I don't think words are what matters. It's what's happening."
John Mueller,The most striking thing about the comparison among the three wars is how much more quickly support has eroded in the case of Iraq.
John Mueller,"As we have said throughout the auction process, we continue to be interested in Daewoo Motor. We regret that Daewoo lost valuable time while its condition continues to deteriorate."
Robert Mugabe,so as to enable the secretary general to understand and appreciate what we are trying to do.
Robert Mugabe,The new authorities have expressed willingness for us to continue our support. We are offering this support especially for security.

Robert Mugabe,"If the choice were made, one for us to lose our sovereignty and become a member of the Commonwealth or remain with our sovereignty and lose the membership of the Commonwealth, I would say let the Commonwealth go."
Robert Mugabe,We don't mind having sanctions banning us from Europe. We are not Europeans.
Robert Mugabe,"We have said we will never collapse, never ever. We may have our droughts, our poverty, but as a people we shall never collapse, never ever."
Robert Mugabe,"Obviously that was his purpose, yes."
Robert Mugabe,"The Cubans are being punished with sanctions in the same way we are,"
Robert Mugabe,"We pride ourselves as being top, really, on the African ladder ... We feel that we have actually been advancing rather than going backwards."
Robert Mugabe,"People are free to campaign and they will be free to vote. There won't be any soldiers, you know, at the queues. Anyone who has the right to vote is free to go and cast his vote anywhere in his own area, in his own constituency,"
Robert Mugabe,"If those men believe they need compensation, they should go to Britain,"
Robert Mugabe,"Must we allow these men, the two unholy men of our millennium, who in the same way as Hitler and Mussolini formed (an) unholy alliance, formed an alliance, to attack an innocent country?"
Robert Mugabe,"We are no longer going to ask for the land, but we are going to take it without negotiating,"
Robert Mugabe,land redistribution and land reform.
Robert Mugabe,"We will proceed with current land reform with or without sanctions, ... Let that position be known here and abroad and let the commercial farmers tell that to their constituency or constituencies overseas."
Robert Mugabe,"redressing the past gross imbalances in land ownership, which were institutionalized by British colonialism."
Robert Mugabe,"[The amendments mark] the liberation of our land, ... It's now final, and no one can question it."
Robert Mugabe,"We want the fighting to stop,"
Robert Mugabe,"Our party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white man, our real enemy!"
Robert Mugabe,"The exercise created some difficulties for individuals and families accommodated in informal settlements, ... We could not have allowed that settlement to go on any longer together with the illegal activities which thrive on such environments."
Robert Mugabe,I thank you for defying him. You have gone against the grain of some of Zimbabwe's enemies.
Robert Mugabe,"We are winning the elections, ... I hear that people are voting in their masses. Whites are also voting in masses. I don't know how they are voting, but I hope it's positive."
Robert Mugabe,lower than dogs and pigs.
Robert Mugabe,"There is no food crisis even as we speak, ... What worries us is the fact the our crop has failed us because of the rain, of the drought, and we are not the only ones that are hit."
Robert Mugabe,Cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen

Malcolm Muggeridge,On television I feel like a man playing piano in a brothel; every now and again he solaces himself by playing 'Abide with Me' in the hope of edifying both the clients and the inmates
Malcolm Muggeridge,There is something ridiculous and even quite indecent in an individual claiming to be happy. Still more a people or a nation making such a claim. The pursuit of happiness... is without any question the most fatuous which could possibly be undertaken. This lamentable phrase ''the pursuit of happiness'' is responsible for a good part of the ills and miseries of the modern world.
Malcolm Muggeridge,"The genius of Man in our time has gone into jet-propulsion, atom-splitting, penicillin-curing, etc. There is none over for works of imagination; of spiritual insight or mystical enlightenment. I asked for bread and was given a tranquilizer. It is important to recognize that in our time man has not written one word, thought one thought, put two notes or two bricks together, splashed color on to canvas or concrete into space, in a manner which will be of any conceivable imaginative interest to posterity."
Malcolm Muggeridge,One of the stupidest theories of Western life.

Malcolm Muggeridge,"The pursuit of happiness, which American citizens are obliged to undertake, tends to involve them in trying to perpetuate the moods, tastes and aptitudes of youth."
Malcolm Muggeridge,One of the peculiar sins of the twentieth century which we've developed to a very high level is the sin of credulity. It has been said that when human beings stop believing in God they believe in nothing. The truth is much worse: they believe in anything.
Malcolm Muggeridge,Surely the glory of journalism is its transience.
Malcolm Muggeridge,There is no such thing as darkness; only a failure to see.
Malcolm Muggeridge,"This horror of pain is a rather low instinct and... if I think of human beings I've known and of my own life, such as it is, I can't recall any case of pain which didn't, on the whole, enrich life."

Malcolm Muggeridge,Bad humor is an evasion of reality; good humor is an acceptance of it.
John Muir,"I never saw a discontented tree. They grip the ground as though they liked it, and though fast rooted they travel about as far as we do."
John Muir,Tug on anything at all and you'll find it connected to everything else in the universe.
John Muir,"Most people are on the world, not in it - having no conscious sympathy or relationship to anything about them - undiffused, separate, and rigidly alone like marbles of polished stone, touching but separate"
John Muir,"I only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, was really going in."
John Muir,"Nature chose for a tool, not the earthquake or lightning to rend and split asunder, not the stormy torrent or eroding rain, but the tender snow-flowers noiselessly falling through unnumbered centuries."
John Muir,"Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves."
John Muir,"Doubly happy, however, is the man whom lofty mountain tops are within reach, for the lights that shine there illumine all that lies below"
John Muir,"Any fool can destroy trees. They cannot defend themselves or run away. And few destroyers of trees ever plant any; nor can planting avail much toward restoring our grand aboriginal giants. It took more than three thousand years to make some of the oldest of the Sequoias, trees that are still standing in perfect strength and beauty, waving and singing in the mighty forests of the Sierra."
John Muir,"Of all the fire mountains which like beacons, once blazed along the Pacific Coast, Mount Rainier is the noblest."
John Muir,"Society speaks and all men listen, mountains speak and wise men listen"
John Muir,"The wrongs done to trees, wrongs of every sort, are done in the darkness of ignorance and unbelief, for when the light comes,the heart of the people is always right."
John Muir,"The battle we have fought, and are still fighting for the forests is a part of the eternal conflict between right and wrong, and we cannot expect to see the end of it ... So we must count on watching and striving for these trees, and should always be glad to find anything so surely good and noble to strive for."
John Muir,"â€œThe grand show is eternal. It is always sunrise somewhere; the dew is never dried all at once; a shower is forever falling; vapor is ever rising. Eternal sunrise, eternal dawn and gloaming, on sea and continents and islands, each in its turn, as the round earth rolls.â€"

John Muir,"Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean."
John Muir,"God has cared for these trees, saved them from drought, disease, avalanches, and a thousand tempests and floods. But he cannot save them from fools."

Pranab Mukherjee,"There is prima facie evidence of violation of clauses relating to use of undue influence and agents/agency commission, as contained in the contracts of Anti-Material Rifles (AMR) signed in 2002,"
Pranab Mukherjee,Some of them wanted to take advantage of the disturbed situation.
Alan Mulally,"We have had a lot of sales in the U.S., but when a lot of the bigger guys finish their restructuring and come back, they are going to need more airplanes for growth and replacement."
Alan Mulally,Who's got the power? We've got the power. Union power.
Alan Mulally,A strike would be devastating. It would hurt Boeing and our customers for many years out. Our customers have made it clear they have choices in the manufacturers they deal with.
Alan Mulally,"We have worked very hard on our lean production system, which means we can make the transition in production rates with more stable employment. That is good for all of us. The more we can have stability and be able to go up and down in production rates with fewer changes is good for everybody and is very good for Boeing's competitiveness. And it is especially good for our employees."
Alan Mulally,I've very pleased with how things have turned out. I could not be happier.
Alan Mulally,"disservice to every current and future employee, customer, shareholder and our communities."
Alan Mulally,We have always wanted to design in composites.
Alan Mulally,We look forward to 2006 and continuing to meet our commitments to our customers.
Alan Mulally,"When we combine higher speed, longer range, the comfort of flight at higher altitudes, and the environmental benefits of quieter landings and takeoffs, we have an airplane that will open a new chapter in commercial aviation, ... We are changing our new product development efforts to focus more strongly on this airplane that has caused such excitement among our customers."
Alan Mulally,"We continued to stay focused on bringing efficiency and value to the airlines of the world through world-class services and airplanes that fly passengers how they want to fly -- point-to-point, non-stop, with more frequencies and more choices."
Alan Mulally,"Our goal has been to work with SPEEA to reach a contract agreement that works for everyone with a stake in the future of Boeing,"
Alan Mulally,"Getting an agreement sooner rather than later is the right thing to do for our employees, customers, investors and our communities,"
Alan Mulally,Our goal throughout these negotiations was to reach an agreement that worked for our employees and the company -- one that respected their contributions and enabled continued improvements in our competitiveness.
Alan Mulally,"Our relationship with Qantas dates to the very start of the jet age, and we're thrilled to see that relationship continue with the 787."
Mike Mularkey,"The truth is different guys mature at different ages. It's really up to the individual. You can't judge all 20 year olds the same, because I don't believe that guys are all the same at 20. There are guys in this league who aren't mature at 23 or 24. And there are 20 year olds who maybe can handle it. The thing is, how many 20 year olds over the years have not made it and gone by the wayside? You don't hear about those guys."
Mike Mularkey,"I think we have enough guys to win with, ... I know I have an advantage of talent level here compared to some other new coaches. But still, it's basically the same team that went 6-10, so you've got to find a way to get them confident about themselves. That's what you do constantly from the very first time you step in front of them to present the staff and your plan. They've got to know that they are a good football team."
Mike Mularkey,"I told him he can keep our morale up and don't let it end at the halftime speech. He's probably more important now for us even though he's not on the field. We can sure use the support from him, and his teammates have so much respect for him."
Mike Mularkey,"This isn't about fining them (as a punishment), this is about making sure they're in the best shape, not just so you can perform but your health risks are higher. Extra weight is stress on them."
Mike Mularkey,It was more of being winded. We were planning on getting Duke in there more than we did. So it was give Duke a chance there at the end.
Mike Mularkey,It's learning on the run.
Mike Mularkey,"This is three games, this is not the season. We have a lot of football ahead of us. We come into work tomorrow, we're looking forward, not backwards, same as we did last year."
Mike Mularkey,"The first morning after I was hired, it was my wife ( Betsy ) who said, 'Holy (smoke), you're the head coach of the Buffalo Bills,'"
Mike Mularkey,"Due to circumstances, I am no longer able to continue as head coach."
Mike Mularkey,"Due to circumstances, I can no longer be able to continue as the head coach. I did not reach this decision lightly, but after much thought I have concluded that for my own personal reasons and in the best interests of my family, on balance, outweigh any future benefits that may accrue to me by continuing in this position."
Mike Mularkey,"I'm actually proud of these guys. I'm frustrated for them, not frustrated at them. We overcame a lot of adversity leading into this game where everyone and their brother counted us out. ... I was pretty proud of how we reacted to all that adversity."
Martin Mull,Having a family is like having a bowling alley installed in your head.
Martin Mull,Never underestimate a child's ability to get into more trouble.

Friedrich Muller,"Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five."
Friedrich Muller,"Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle, longing for pleasure."
Friedrich Muller,"Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what pleasure is there in looking at them?"
Friedrich Muller,"The channels run everywhere, the creeper (of passion) stands sprouting; if you see the creeper springing up, cut its root by means of knowledge."

Friedrich Muller,Language is the Rubicon that divides man from beast.

Brian Mulroney,"Well, a month later, my popularity jumped seven points. So whatever you do, don't deny a God damned thing!"

H. Munro,Beauty is only sin deep
H. Munro,Hors d'oeuvres have always a pathetic interest for me; they remind me of one's childhood that one goes through wondering what the next course is going to be like - and during the rest of the menu one wishes one had eaten more of the hors d'oeuvres.
H. Munro,Addresses are given to us to conceal our whereabouts.
H. Munro,A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation.
H. Munro,I always say beauty is only sin deep.
David Murdoch,It made it hard to come back.
David Murdoch,They're always a force. Canada's the most decorated nation in world curling. You always have to be up for them. They're the benchmark.
David Murdoch,"Defeating such a big curling nation as Canada, it's colossal. As far as Scottish curling goes, it's huge. There's a lot of pride at stake, making sure we do ourselves justice."
David Murdoch,"Defeating such a big curling nation as Canada, it's colossal."
David Murdoch,"I didn't enjoy losing last year. There's nothing I've got against the country (Canada). I'm doing this for myself, the team and for the coaches. We've put so much effort into it this year, committed so much time and days off, I think this team deserves a world title and hopefully we can deliver it."
James Murdoch,"The team has met or over-achieved core performance measures including sales and operating profit, notwithstanding an increase in churn."

James Murdoch,We are well positioned to sustain our growth as existing and future customers tell us that Sky is their preferred brand for new entertainment and communications services.

Rupert Murdoch,"Tony Blair ... told me yesterday that he was in Delhi last week and he turned on the BBC World Service to see what was happening in New Orleans, and he said it was just full of hate at America and gloating about our troubles. That's pretty general throughout Europe today."
Rupert Murdoch,"The reality is that we've seen the last of any serious price wars for a long time. I don't think any of the others could afford it, certainly not on a long-term basis."

Audie Murphy,And freedom is what America means to the world.
Audie Murphy,Lead from the front.
Audie Murphy,I'm glad that it didn't take as long to get Shepard off the ground as it's taken this series. I'd begun to think the Congo would be ahead of us in the space race before Whispering Smith ever got on the air.
Bob Murphy,"[Murphy won holes 12, 14 and 15 to turn a two-hole disadvantage into his fourth victory at this tournament and his second set of back-to-back wins (1999-2000).] He played better than I did, ... He hit the ball better, putted better. He's played here his whole life. I just tried to make a bunch of pars coming in."
Bob Murphy,"We didn't know how to train correctly, that's the truth. Today, we do know how. We do a lot of strengthening, a lot of stretching and it helps, even at my age."
Bob Murphy,Drivers are straightforward--I don't think that Apple is facing research problems here.
Eddie Murphy,"I've made 30 movies and for the most part my movies work. In a business where success is an exception and not the rule, I've mostly been successful."

Eddie Murphy,I don't think more concentration is required for Robert De Niro to do what he does as for Jim Carrey to do what he does.
Eddie Murphy,"If I don't die in a plane crash or something, this country has a rare opportunity to watch a great talent grow."

Eddie Murphy,"The thing about kids is that they express emotion. They don't hold back. If they want to cry, they cry, and if they are in a good mood, they're in a good mood."
Eddie Murphy,"I'm 42 and the age of a guy who has kids, so I guess I'm playing right where I'm supposed to be. I'm comfortable with that, but in the same breath I'd do something edgy. If someone came to me and offered me an edgy and funny story, then I'd do it."
Jack Murphy,"I certainly didn't think it would be broken quickly. You coach to your strength, and Gene was certainly our strength. He was so quick in picking things up, he understood how to attack defenses and he had such a great release."
Jack Murphy,I think what [state board members] have told us today is that you can't get your state money unless you violate federal laws. We think that's wrong.
Jack Murphy,"God had a sense of humor, a style of his own."

James Murphy,"UMR makes efforts to gather regular input on satisfaction but that is not as comprehensive of an exercise as is analyzing a market's preferences regarding products, services, satisfaction, and price."
John Murphy,The stock looks very oversold at this particular point. Probably worth looking at.
John Murphy,"We believe the shareholders of GM would be much better off holding on to the tangible value of a dividend for as long as possible, or until they receive something of material value in return."
John Murphy,Timing the Trade is a practical how-to trading manual written by an experienced trader. It's a book that can be understood by beginners and appreciated by market veterans.
John Murphy,"Although we think Magna is one of the best operators in the auto industry, with proprietary technology and a solid balance sheet, we believe that industry headwinds will keep a lid on results and the stock in the near-term."
John Murphy,"So if bond yields can hold in this area, I think the technology stocks can look more attractive."
John Murphy,We would not support lowering the standard in that way. We shouldn't be changing it because of somebody's view of one case.
John Murphy,The support we received from Mayor Reeves and city councilors was heartening to our members. We need all the support we can garner to get the housing authority to move in a fair direction.
John Murphy,"Although York was not explicit about the Suzuki equity stake in his January 10th speech, his aim appears to build up a cash hoard necessary to restructure GM."
John Murphy,Ford's light truck sales continue to plummet and now face the additional pressure of GM's new SUVs.
John Murphy,It is tough to gauge fleet sales in any month and following the boom in January we don't expect another upside surprise from fleet in February.
John Murphy,"GM has spent heavily to advertise these new products, which should spur sales short-term."
John Murphy,"If the parties feel they have made sufficient progress on talks, the deadline could be extended, but this could go on in perpetuity if a hard deadline is not forced."
John Murphy,That's what practice rounds are for.
John Murphy,"Normally, it is not open to the public, only to policemen and officials attached to police forces. But, in my case, they made an exception. My tour guides were the home secretary, the commissioner of Scotland Yard, the deputy commissioner and various and sundry chief superintendents. The man who operated the"

John Murphy,The EPA doesn't want the money. They want advanced treatment of wastewater.
John Murphy,It almost appears as if GM resents its dealers for making money.
John Murphy,"I look to the west over the Liberty Memorial and the north over downtown. You can talk and read about the revitalization of downtown, but I can actually see it happen."
John Murphy,It's the same that judges did before (the 1996 law). They are not required to make findings any more. We have a lot of problems with people appealing sentences with the idea the judge imposing the sentence didn't do it right.
John Murphy,"It used to be insurance was my second-highest cost, after labor, ... Now it's fuel."

John Murphy,There are always going to be cowards who use the cloak of darkness.
John Murphy,"We believe that there is more to come. Ultimately, we believe that an active downsizing of the company to a defensible market share will be necessary."
John Murphy,Neither side won. We fought to a bloody draw.
John Murphy,And perhaps more importantly the fact that other Town Council members and myself may be material witnesses in this action.
Kevin Murphy,What would get Bill Gates animated? ... There's a lot of money at stake. He's going to get excited over things that actually have very little chance of succeeding.
Kevin Murphy,I think you're a long way from profitability. We have to hear about what you're going to do with labor and how this will be a long-term fix.

Kevin Murphy,He's the best player I've coached. He's a tremendous athlete who can score in bunches.

Michael Murphy,"Dona' worry about the score so much, it's not the important thing."
Michael Murphy,"I worry about the folks who speak Spanish, who don't understand (the plans), who are indigent or who can't read. There's still a lot of confusion, and people might think it's so difficult they just don't want to bother with it."
Michael Murphy,The fact that they can make these things public gives them influence.
Michael Murphy,His philosophy on the court was always defense. Defense is all about effort and you can control that.

Pat Murphy,"It's all in the word 'waterfront,' ... ... The land's way too valuable to not have quality development."

Patrick Murphy,I don't know anything in our society that can be 100 percent.
Patrick Murphy,"Well, the closer didn't close it. She just didn't have it tonight. The cardinal sin was hitting the second batter (Bullard) in the sixth inning."
Patrick Murphy,She's always the first to practice and is always taking extra of whatever we're working on. She's worked really hard in her four years here and has earned all the recognition that comes her way.

Patrick Murphy,"Hopefully, maybe this will open the eyes of some people that the penal system does have some problems,"

Paul Murphy,"We made too many mistakes to be able to beat this team,"
Peter Murphy,Whew that was some work out there. ... We took a gamble tonight. I have raced here 4 times here this year before tonight and all 4 nights the track got slick. So we decided to go with our 360 tonight and use the less horsepower to our advantage. It figures the track would be heavy. We gave em a good run though and we feel real good about our finish.

Andy Murray,"We actually knew it before the game. We were waiting, because (the rules say) if they score a goal with him on the ice, it doesn't count. Unfortunately, the officials were doing their job."

Andy Murray,"Gonzalez makes a lot of winners but he makes a lot of mistakes,"
Andy Murray,"He's still here while we've sent some other young men back to Manchester, so we're pleased with how he's been working."
Andy Murray,We made some fundamental mistakes. Obviously we're disappointed to give up that many goals and get a short-handed goal scored on us at the end.
Andy Murray,We've got to fight through the negativity. The players know there's no excuse for not playing better than we did tonight. We're not on top of our game.
Andy Murray,"You have to love his effort, his determination. He was dogging the puck all night and battling. It wasn't the prettiest goal in the world, but it was from our eyes."
Andy Murray,"They've been good. There have been others who have been good, too. I think our final decisions here this year are going to be real tough. The thing that I've told a number of those players is, 'Whether you start the year here or not, you have to leave the camp with such a strong impression that, if something should happen, we're looking forward to getting you back up here."

Andy Murray,We took advantage of our opportunities and our penalty killers stepped up.
Andy Murray,"Sean's got some ability, no question about it. What you need to have with Sean is to identify his role for him, and he can be very effective in that role. He's one of the better skaters in the league and he's got the ability to pull away from people."
Bill Murray,"I think for a lot of women, they still don't know that. I think for a lot of women they still think breast cancer is the biggest killer, it's not. Heart disease is."
Bill Murray,"Iraq has a lot of critical needs. It's got to come up with budgetary resources to finance health care, education and other important public services. Clearly, the reduction of petroleum subsidies is an emotional issue."

Bryan Murray,This is obviously a big trade for Carolina and I guess it shows that they are going for it.
Bryan Murray,"He's a quality player. Guys get beaten up - an accident or an eye injury - but the wonderful thing about the human body is that we recover, given time. He's such a young guy, you just know he'll get better and better."
Bryan Murray,"We're getting people to shoot from the point and more importantly, they seem to be getting it into traffic in front. We're giving ourselves some chances. Earlier this season, we were not establishing control from the point."
Bryan Murray,"We knew they were going to be tough. I don't know if you should ever hate anybody, but I think that type of game was what we needed because it had a lot of intensity."
Bryan Murray,"That's what's starting to happen, thank goodness. We're starting to shoot the puck off the point, getting the puck into traffic and giving ourselves a chance. Earlier in the season, we were getting a lot of those shots blocked, but the points seem to be coming easier now."
Bryan Murray,"Obviously, we can't give up six or seven goals a night. It's almost too easy for the other team. We have two of the better goaltenders in the league, and we have a defensive corps that together is pretty solid when they play. We have to find a way to get them to do their job better than they're doing it right now."
Bryan Murray,"I just thought we got a little careless. We made some defensive mistakes that resulted in goals for them. Then, Gerber made some big saves, which I've seen him do before when I had him in Anaheim."

Bryan Murray,The idea of having a group of players do well is having them respond to a little criticism. He took advantage of it tonight to have a big night.
Bryan Murray,"I don't know. Obviously, it's a major crisis that has happened in his life. He's a young man who is very close to his mother and very close to his family. But I think I've gotten to know this young man and he's such a quality person and he cares so much about this hockey team that I believe he'll come in and do his very best to pay attention to what has to happen."

Jim Murray,"I find most people hate to be informed. People need to be amused, shocked... or angered."

John Murray,"With the ever-rising cost of wood and concrete ties, and with support from WVCO in providing urethane products like ES-50RM and CTR-100, the sooner the railroad can realize lower cost of repair to their m/w costs, because of lower frequency in the area of repairs to fixed assets, such as the wood and concrete ties,"

Patrick Murray,"[The ads] had no real effect on the race, and may in fact have come back to bite Forrester, ... Voters are fed up with negative ads. Both candidates have stepped over the line, but in this case, one might have jumped over the cliff when it comes to mudslinging."
Patrick Murray,"A key issue in this race, as in every race, will be turnout. However, by the way they have conducted their media campaigns, both major candidates seem to have done their best to ensure that many if not most voters will stay home Tuesday."
Patrick Murray,"Survey research can contribute to our knowledge base in so many different ways. We want to be a resource for state and local government. That's our job. If they need information accurately and quickly, they can turn to us."

Richard Murray,Democrats need the investigation to keep producing DeLay stories to keep the pot boiling.
Richard Murray,DeLay is benefited by a short campaign season because his challengers are unknown.

Richard Murray,"There is huge irony here. Six Democrats in Congress were eliminated, but the seventh victim may turnout to be the author of the plan."

Edward Murrow,"This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends.

Elon Musk,"It is despairing to consider that the cost and reliability of access to space have barely changed since the Apollo era over three decades ago. Yet in virtually every other field of technology, we have made great strides in reducing cost and increasing capability,"
Elon Musk,Today it costs over a billion dollars for a space shuttle flight. The costâ€¦ is fundamentally what's holding us back from becoming a space traveling civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species.

Elon Musk,"I'm very pro-environment, but let's figure out how to do it better and not jump through a dozen hoops to achieve what is obvious in the first place. There should be a categorical exclusion [for Falcon] just like airplanes that use non-toxic propellants. That would be a huge improvement,"
Elon Musk,"[He'd better be, because the new space race already is under way and competition is shaping up as fierce. Rutan's chief rival may ultimately be Elon Musk. A former Internet mogul who in 2002 sold his online payment company, PayPal, to eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, Musk now runs SpaceX in El Segundo, Calif., which is developing an orbital space vehicle. Musk notes that making it into orbit requires going eight times faster and producing 65 times more rocket energy than a suborbital vehicle like SpaceShipOne. Musk has already put more than $50 million into SpaceX and says he is prepared to invest $50 million more. He expects it to take at least five years to get passengers into orbit. In the meantime, SpaceX is generating revenue by booking orders to launch satellites; its first such launch is scheduled for January.] Our earned revenue will be $35 million after a little more than two years of operation, ... By comparison, the X-Prize was a one-off of $10 million, and it took Burt something like five years to do it."

Jack Myers,"[As the economy continues to rebound, advertising budgets continue to fatten.] All ships should rise in this market, ... It should be a record year."
Jack Myers,"With branded entertainment, it's inevitable that advertising will find its way back into the model."
Jack Myers,This creates advertising and content on demand in a very easy and relevant way that advertisers can use to push those consumers who are interested in their products to a more intimate relationship.
Jack Myers,That's the direction where all advertising is going.
Jack Myers,"Local advertising is bought more on a quarterly basis than an annual basis, ... A lot of economists have been lulled into a false sense of growth due to strength of '03 upfront [the advertising bought in the spring for the fall 2003 television season]. But that is only one-quarter in '03, and three-quarters in '04."
