Daniel Yergin,"But the key thing is that Iraq, while it's got very large oil reserves, has marginalized itself as an oil exporter and these days its exports are only about one tenth that of neighboring Saudi Arabia."
Daniel Yergin,"But that's not enough: To maintain energy security, one needs a supply system that provides a buffer against shocks. It needs large, flexible markets. And it's important to acknowledge the fact that the entire energy supply chain needs to be protected."
Daniel Yergin,"But look at Angola: The Chinese spent a lot of money to get in there, but they are among many other companies. It is a much bigger game."
Daniel Yergin,But eventually it's a question of access: Getting access to fields is on top of the oil companies' agenda. We see a substantial build-up of supply occurring over the coming years.
Daniel Yergin,A premium in the oil price of somewhere between 10 to 15 dollars a barrel reflects this heightened anxiety.
Daniel Yergin,A more relevant description would be a plateau in production capacity that might be reached in the fourth or fifth decade of this century.

Yevgeny Yevtushenko,A poet's autobiography is his poetry. Anything else is just a footnote.
Lin Yn-tang,Peace of mind is that mental condition in which you have accepted the worst.
Lin Yn-tang,"The secret of contentment is knowing how to enjoy what you have, and to be able to lose all desire for things beyond your reach."
Lin Yn-tang,"Like spring, but it is too young. I like summer, but it is too proud. So I like best of all autumn, because its tone is mellower, its colors are richer, and it is tinged with a little sorrow. Its golden richness speaks not of the innocence of spring, nor the power of summer, but of the mellowness and kindly wisdom of approaching age. It knows the limitations of life and its content."
Dwight Yoakam,The Newton Boys.
Dwight Yoakam,Control success before it controls you.
Dwight Yoakam,"At the end of the film Val suggests there may be a way to rejoin the living, when he says, 'Let's see if we're able to live among the living, walk among the living.'"
Dwight Yoakam,"A voice expressing emotion in a musical way moves on. It's like the finale of the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) - the world turns in on itself, as a universe unto itself, in the shape of one human being."
Yoda,Do or do not... there is no try.
Yoda,Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing
Yoda,May the Force be with you.
Yoda,"Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will."
Yoda,"I was not strong enough to defeat him. Like his master before him, be destroyed, he must."
Yoda,[Luke:] I canâ€™t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail.
Yoda,"Blind we are, if creation of this clone army we could not see."
Yoda,Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.
Yoda,"Yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
Yoda,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke... Luke... do not... do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father's fate you will. Luke, when gone am I... the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is... another... Sky... walker."

Maharishi Yogi,"I let people make remarks about me, but it doesn't touch me, all those remarks."
Maharishi Yogi,Where is the money going to come from?From wherever it is at the moment.
Maharishi Yogi,"Happiness radiates like the fragrance from a flower, and draws all good things toward you. Allow your love to nourish yourself as well as others. Do not strain after the needs of life. It is sufficient to be quietly alert and aware of them. In this way life proceeds more naturally and effortlessly. Life is here to Enjoy!"
Maharishi Yogi,Life finds its purpose and fulfillment in the expansion of happiness.
Med Yones,"Happiness is Not a Pursuit. Forget about the â€œPursuit of Happinessâ€and youâ€™ll become happy. Happiness is a state of mind, regardless of your goals in life or where you are going, you can travel your life's journey happy or unhappy"

Jerry York,"Steve's stock options were granted a week ago at the then-market price, and will gain value only as Apple's stock price rises, to the benefit of all shareholders, ... This grant reflects Steve's and the Board's confidence in the future value of Apple."
Jerry York,"We had trouble getting the puck out of our zone, and also trouble getting the puck into their zone. We never really got our offense set up."
Jerry York,He's the strength of their team.
Jerry York,"This is a well deserved honor for Chris. He has always been a tenacious defender, but this season he gained a great deal of poise and has showed the offensive flair that made him an impact player at both ends of the ice."
Jerry York,"We have to produce goals from other people, not just the top line."
Jerry York,I believe the shareholders will support reducing the dividend as part of an equality of sacrifice plan that can increase the value of their shares over time.
Jerry York,"This situation calls for the company's going into crisis mode, adopting a degree of urgency that recognizes if things don't break right, the unthinkable could happen, that time is of the essence."
Jerry York,I do believe the time has come to go into crisis mode.
Jerry York,They have terrific numbers defensively. They've got a real commitment to play defense.
Jerry York,"As good as Elliott, Parise and Cory are in their games, none of them have the ability that Bishop has to almost be a third defender back there."
John York,This organization has always embraced the opportunity to serve as ambassadors of the NFL. We have played in eight American Bowl games -- the second most in league history -- and we are excited about the prospect of playing the first regular-season game on foreign soil. Having this opportunity speaks to the popularity of the 49ers worldwide. The fans in Mexico are tremendous and we look forward to being a part of it.
John York,"The relationship with the 49ers Academy started before we got here. Denise and I both love coming here to be part of teaching the kids. If you can get some of the students to realize the importance of education, and you can look out and see in their eyes that they are paying attention, they have the best chance to improve their lives."
John York,Often it's difficult to comply with all of them and still run your company. But we're legally bound to comply and we are looking into what happened.
Dwight Yorke,"...We the players, we see in the training, we know what he is capable of, the management has shown a tremendous amount of patience with him, and yet he's come back, and that's a good sign, that's he's confident, he's up and running again, he's scoring on a regular basis, and people should give him a chance and support."
Dwight Yorke,"There's an expectation from the fans and the public, because of our playing roster, so if we return with anything less (than the title), then yeah, we could be considered failures."
Dwight Yorke,"So far things seem to be going in the right direction and, hopefully, we can kick it off again the next time we are together (against Peru)."
Dwight Yorke,Keep the faith. We know we are heading in the right direction.
Ned Yost,"I said, don't worry about it. He's only going to throw about 50 pitches. That's about six innings, and then he'll be done."
Ned Yost,Everybody goes through that. It's nothing to worry about.
Ned Yost,"No. 1, I didn't really have anybody (available) I can trust to bunt,"
Ned Yost,You can run into trouble in July and August if you're not careful (with the bullpen) now. We have to take some pressure off those guys.
Ned Yost,"Not only are they so good talent-wise, they're so good in every phase of the game. You come in here and play them, you know they're not going to beat themselves. They're going to play the game hard and they're going to play the game right. If you sit back and wait for them to make mistakes so you can win a game, you're going to be in trouble."
Ned Yost,"We said all along he would struggle in the first half, then take off."
Ned Yost,We knew he was going to struggle at the plate. That wasn't a surprise.
Ned Yost,We said all along that he would probably struggle in the first half and take off in the second half. That's what's happened.
Ned Yost,"It's a matter of commanding his fastball and being consistent. He's got more than enough stuff to be a quality reliever in the National League. It sets everything else up when he's throwing his fastball. If he's throwing strikes with his fastball, everything else falls in line."
Ned Yost,"They got a fine performance out of Bronson Arroyo, and that was the difference."
Ned Yost,They got a great performance out of Arroyo. He was very sharp and stayed on the attack. Ben was good tonight but Arroyo matched him pitch for pitch.
Ned Yost,"They enjoy what they're doing. But they're not a real excitable bunch, to the point where it affects their performance."
Ned Yost,"He didn't pull anything. It just felt strange to him. It was not a knifelike pain, just a dull ache."
Ned Yost,"He didn't pull anything. It just felt strange to him. It was not a knifelike pain, just a dull ache. He has some scar tissue back there, and it could be he popped some of that, which would be a good thing."
Ned Yost,He's as tough as they come. He doesn't make mistakes.
Ned Yost,"They make a living throwing the ball. It's a mental thing, it's in their heads, and don't ask me why."
Ned Yost,He's learning all kinds of stuff. He's seeing what life's like in the big leagues. He accomplished everything he needed to accomplish in Triple-A.
Ned Yost,"I think his improvement has come more on the mental side than the physical side,"
Ned Yost,He has made tremendous defensive improvement at every position. He's good at all of them.
Ned Yost,I know these guys will play with a lot of heart and a lot of pride. I knew it was matter of time before we got it going again.
Ned Yost,"We're not going to pack up and die. Key injuries happen to every team. I hate it for Benny and the team, but you have to pick up the slack and go."
Ned Yost,"[Goals in Milwaukee are appropriately modest.] We've got to find a way to get to .500 first, and if we can get there this year or next, then we can think about being competitive, ... Right now, we're battling no one but ourselves."
Ned Yost,He pitched a phenomenal game.
Ned Yost,"When things aren't going you're way, funny things happen, and it's not much funnier than that."
Ned Yost,"Our guys, what they're doing is they're fighting real hard to try to get out of it. It's defeating the purpose."
Ned Yost,"In true Bobby fashion, all he wanted to talk about was how good we were doing, ... Finally, I said, 'Bobby, look, I called you to talk about you, OK? I want to congratulate you and tell you how good you're doing.'"
Ned Yost,"They opened my eyes, offensively, to the fact that they were capable of being big league players, and they opened eyes, defensively, and showed us that they weren't ready to be big league players."
Ned Yost,I think Brady will work out whatever is going on with him. I'm just trying to get some consistency in our offense.
Ned Yost,"There's no confidence loss going on anywhere, me or them."
Ned Yost,Doug's a believer that he wants these guys playing deep into September and into October so that they can get used to it. That's a place we want to play in the near future.
Ned Yost,"Doug's a believer that he wants these guys playing deep into September and into October so that they can get used to it, ... That's a place we want to play in the near future."
Ned Yost,"Boy, the infield is like concrete out there. Ground balls get by you in a hurry. We can use the good weather to get our work in but you'd like to see a little rain at night to soften up the fields a bit."
Ned Yost,"I guess there is a little bit of an advantage, because you get to know guys a little more. But we've got a good scouting program and people out looking (at the other teams). There aren't too many guys that we haven't seen."
Ned Yost,Danny has had good downhill action. His ball is sinking good. He's going to be fine.
Ned Yost,"We have the ability to do special stuff, and we have to continue to be more consistent, and that's team-wide. It's not one single person or one single area. We do believe that we'll get better and better as the year goes on."
Kevin Youkilis,"I know my pain threshold. I'm fine, ... It's come down to that point where you got to suck up a lot of stuff."
Kevin Youkilis,"The only time it hurt was when I hit it off the end of the bat. It doesn't matter if you have 10 broken fingers ... it's going to hurt off the end of the bat. It's a little discomforting with the grip of the bat, but I have to just keep taking good cuts. Whole trick in baseball is to barrel it up. If I can do that, I'll feel good."
Kevin Youkilis,Hopefully it will be ready as soon as possible. The doctors said hopefully we can get it ready for pretty much the first playoff games.
Kevin Youkilis,"I have a lot of confidence in my teammates that they'll get us (to the playoffs). Hopefully, I'll have the chance to help out."
Kevin Youkilis,"I remember two years ago a bunch of us went out on the boat and it was my birthday. We had a great time out there. That's the little things you miss. Johnny was a great person. He was the first guy to step in front of the media when things weren't right, when things were right."
Kevin Youkilis,"It was great in the beginning. I got a lot of notoriety about it in Double-A. Now it's getting to the point where it's past that time. It's a time where whenever anyone writes something about me, it's, 'Oh, he has a great on-base percentage.' Well, in order to have a good on-base percentage you've got to hit, too."
Kevin Youkilis,"We'll see what happens, ... Baby steps."
Andrew Young,It would be no different than it is here. The Carter Center runs the programs and the parks service maintains the grounds and the buildings.
Andrew Young,That does a significant amount of damage to you. People have such negative opinions of politicians. They always assume politicians are guilty.

Andrew Young,"I like to fight poverty. For almost 10 years, I've been using in my sermons the message that fighting poverty is good business, and I've used Wal-Mart as an example. The question is how do you fight poverty with high wages or low prices? The answer is both."

Brigham Young,"Life is best enjoyed when time periods are evenly divided between labor, sleep, and recreation...all people should spend one-third of their time in recreation which is rebuilding, voluntary activity, never idleness."
Brigham Young,"All I have to do is keep my spirit, feelings and conscience like a sheet of blank paper, and let the Spirit and power of God write upon it what He pleases. When He writes, I will read; but if I read before He writes, I am very likely to be wrong."
Brigham Young,"When I look upon the faces of intelligent beings I look upon the image of the God I serve. There are none but what have a certain portion of divinity within them; and though we are clothed with bodies which are in the image of our God, yet this mortality shrinks before that portion of divinity which we inherit from our Father."

Cy Young,"Too many pitchers, that's all, there are just too many pitchers Ten or twelve on a team. Don't see how any of them get enough work. Four starting pitchers and one relief man ought to be enough. Pitch 'em every three days and you'd find they'd get control and good, strong arms."
Cy Young,"Gosh, all a kid has to do these days is spit straight and he gets forty-thousand dollars to sign."

Dean Young,"God bless my daddy, ... He was the genius who created this wonderful menagerie of characters. A monkey could do my job with the characters I have to work with. He left me this cast of characters and this dominant gene."
Dean Young,"You see, my dad grew up on Hollywood two-reelers and screwball comedies, ... His humor was very surreal and fanciful at times. I grew up on a steady diet of TV sitcoms, so my humor is more-to-earth."
Dean Young,"My dad's comedic sensibilities were uniquely his own and very different from mine, ... But he was very good. He said if I should ever inherited the strip, he wanted me to infuse my own sense of humor into the strip. He wanted me to make it my own."
Dean Young,"As a kid, I remember my dad working on the strip, ... There'd always be just roars of laughter coming from his studio. The strip was fun for him and I think that sense of fun was infectious."
Dean Young,"Wealthy playboys and flappers just weren't funny anymore, ... So (dad) got them married, and (Dagwood) was disowned by his millionaire daddy. When they got into the kitchen and started having kids, it took off like a rocket."
Dean Young,"How could he not? ... Look at his head: He's got all that hair sticking out. My dad realized he had certain intrinsic qualities, his hair, his eating habits. A lot of funny idiosyncrasies."
Dean Young,"As they settled into marriage, 'Blondie' started to resonate with more people, ... Dagwood wasn't too different than a lot of guys. He forgets to take out the garbage. He'd rather eat one of his huge sandwiches than go out to any fancy restaurant. Hopefully, most people don't have bosses like Mr. Dithers but they could definitely relate to some of the challenges at the workplace."
James Young,We have 10 Super Fund sites. We do see potential impact to development if the remediation does not go along faster.
James Young,"When he first came here, he looked like a kid who had given up on life. There was some resentment. The first three years, he still wasn't sure that he had a home."

James Young,We think Cyclorama - our most recent studio album - is a great record and everyone that has taken the time to listen to agrees with me.
James Young,We always got a strong response but I think in this day in age there is less of a marijuana fog at concerts and more of people just more naturally exuberant - it seems to me.
James Young,There is absolutely no doubt that I am a more mature individual and Tommy Shaw is a more mature individual and that we learned a lot.
James Young,There are a lot of people using technology that are playing to a click with backing vocals already stuck in there on some computerized thing that runs along in time to the show so they have these amazing vocals that are only partly the guys on stage producing them at the time.
James Young,The studio that we mix in is still in Chicago.
James Young,The band we have now on stage is the band I always wanted to be in.
James Young,"Ten years ago, in 94, we thought maybe nobody would ever care about Styx again."
James Young,Sometimes that mantle is hard to adjust to wearing but we are at a stage that we are comfortable with it and we recognize how we are perceived and how the real core individual that each one of us has apart from the facade that the public believes that we are.
James Young,"So, We're really L.A. based with a secondary base in Chicago."
James Young,"So, maybe you don't see blues so much in Styx's music but it is definitely part of Tommy's early music."
James Young,"So, it's a matter of that I want to take our music around the globe."
James Young,Seeing our VH-1 Behind the Music shows just how dysfunctional some of the moments of the band were but this new line-up has put the fun back in dysfunction.
James Young,People tell us they have been inspired by our music to do great things.
James Young,People like to let loose at rock concerts and it gives them an excuse to do it in a way that is not destructive to others and not really destructive to the band.
James Young,It is something we have always excelled at and prided ourselves at - the excellences of our stage performance.
James Young,"In my own mind, we are a much happier and much more functional family and a much more well balanced group of individual s both off and on the stage - in the current incarnation."
James Young,I'll play until they have to scrape me off the stage.
James Young,I don't quite have the energy for extra curricular activities. I have to pace myself a little bit more.
James Young,"I don't know, I think the crowds are even more responsive now because the audiences are skewing younger."
James Young,"But, there was a time when we all had a great thing going but one person just became very uncomfortable with it and he had to try to change it around to suit him more and then it suited no one else but him."
James Young,"But there are rock and roll fans all over this continent and all over the globe, really, and we're just set at marking the planet with Styx music until the day we die."
James Young,Being in the studio is okay but sitting in a room by yourself composing is a discipline that takes a certain type of mind set and Tommy has a great gift for that as did the previous guy.
James Young,Being in a rock band is about touring. It's about writing songs and it's about making records but it's also about taking a wonderful smile onto that stage and making the people feel good about themselves.
James Young,"And in an era where radio stations that are inclined to play Styx music are your classic rock stations and the stations that play current music look at us as dinosaurs - the only way we could reach people with our new music, generally, is to perform live."
James Young,And I said - Styx - as a musical group it is our place to reflect the light that is shining on us back onto this place and say - this is where so much great stuff started.
James Young,And for REO - they get to play for some Styx fans and then we get to play in front of some REO fans. It helps spread the new music to the following of other bands.
James Young,"Yes, indeed, in fact I would tell you that we go out of our way to be true to the original feeling and sort of sonic and musical pallet that we painted with back then."
James Young,"You know the puritan ethic that started out four centuries ago in this country, needless to say - at least for the moment - a thing of the past - from what I can tell."
James Young,Whereas with us - what you hear is what's happening right then and there on the stage - so we don't need no stinking technology.
James Young,We're seeing that at the classic rock station in Chicago that they have teenagers and people in their 20s calling in for this music.
James Young,"We're gonna release a studio album probably a year from now and we've got these recordings that we did with Coco Taylor and Johnny Johnson, who was Chuck Berry's piano player."
James Young,"It's our technology, with their knowledge of the preclinical side and our ability to ultimately go through the regulatory process and manufacture large quantities of vaccine that would make this marriage work."
Kevin Young,"When you can incorporate a medical device to an existing technology, it's a logical step. Patients will already be very familiar with it because it exists in their lives."
Kevin Young,We have quite a bit of talent at that position and we will try to do it using our depth.
Kevin Young,"We're lucky that we have several real quality backs,"
Kevin Young,"When we made records in the past, it was all about how fast we could play, how hard, how much I could scream. But this time ... we felt like we could keep our edge, but sing melodies. We felt like we could write a hook."
Kevin Young,We're ecstatic to have it. It's a great opportunity. We feel very confident we can put on as good of a state tournament that has ever been held.
Kevin Young,It was a bad night for us. It was definitely us. You can look at the statistics.
Kevin Young,"It's nice, but I don't think it will be that big of a deal. The kids are excited, though."
Kevin Young,But you never really know until they get into the game.
Kevin Young,When we were making our run it was fun. Everybody's game changed. Everybody was playing together. If this team can get that it would be awesome.
Kevin Young,I don't know what it's going to be like on New Year's. People are always looking for something fun and different to do.
Kevin Young,It does take away all the distraction and all the negative energy around us. We're just going to leave town and try to get a good win.
Kevin Young,"What we wanted to do is basically design in a social stigma,"
Kevin Young,This design works with that site. It assumes that development would still take place.
Kevin Young,We are on scholarship to play basketball. We're not on scholarship to go to journalism school and write papers. We're here to play basketball. It's like a job. You have a choice. You can either quit or keep playing and I hope everybody keeps playing.
Michael Young,"I'm just trying to have a very simple approach in that situation,"
Michael Young,"They inoculated themselves against the worst part of it. Legislators around the state are huffing and puffing, trying to keep up with their constituencies and trying to do damage control. The Bucks delegation looks pretty smart."
Michael Young,There is a lot of talent in this clubhouse.
Michael Young,"It means a lot to have the support of your teammates and coaches, and the feeling is definitely mutual, ... I love the guys I play with. We play hard together and we play to win. Obviously, we haven't had the year we've wanted, but that isn't going to change our effort level. With the kind of support they are giving me, I'll return that to them every day."
Michael Young,"No sleep is no problem,"
Michael Young,It hasn't really hit me yet. But I know it's something I can carry with me the rest of my life.
Michael Young,"We take a lot of pride in being productive and helping the team win, ... Fortunately, we have been able to stay healthy and duplicate the success we had last year. I think the one thing we all have in common is [that] we want to get better. We all know we can improve and we are looking forward to doing it."
Michael Young,"Don't get me wrong, there was bad stuff going on in the streets, but the police is dirty."
Michael Young,"This is a great opportunity for 3S because we can provide a very cost-effective signal conditioning ASIC chip for a variety of industries. Our technology uses a digital approach, simplifies setting trim values for sophisticated applications, and is ideal for mass production, especially in the automotive market."
Michael Young,It sounds just like the sumo drumming I heard on ESPN last night.
Michael Young,"The players love it because you can measure yourself against other top prospects,"
Michael Young,"It's never happened before (in Pennsylvania), to my knowledge. It raises questions about his preparedness for office."
Michael Young,I think there is a horrible stereotype that suggests that minorities are lacking in terms of their knowledge of the fundamentals of baseball.
Michael Young,"There are no controls on (legislative spending). One of the problems is accountability. There is not enough information about what they are spending money on, and how much they are spending."
Michael Young,I just hope she doesn't fail.
Michael Young,We hope that we will be able to hit the goal of 847 on Thursday.
Michael Young,"Hopefully, we can find a happy medium,"
Michael Young,"I told him he should give half of the Gold Glove to me for all the balls I threw in the dirt that he had to scoop up and made him look good. There's a lot of great first basemen in our league, but no one like Tex."
Michael Young,"Most of us have been in All-Star Games before. At the All-Star Game, it's kind of a one-day event â€“ you meet guys, shake hands and go your separate ways. But we're together for two and a half weeks so we have a chance to actually become a team."
Michael Young,We don't expect him to go eight innings every night. But if he keeps us in games as the No. 5 starter that's going to be big.
Michael Young,"The first half of 2001 is clearly the peak of the oil industry earnings cycle for the foreseeable future, ... The second quarter is a blowout quarter for the industry, but the outlook for the second half of the year will be sharply lower."
Michael Young,"People not only are surprised by how good healthy food can taste but they get so much out of Jennifer's talks. She truly cares about people, and that message gets across."
Michael Young,He's nasty. I'll guarantee you 30 teams will be fighting over him if he comes over.
Michael Young,The fear of God is going to be gone.
Michael Young,"There's no doubt about it, we need to go on a run, ... We need to put ourselves in position to capitalize if some clubs in front of us tail off."
Michael Young,"Today we frankly recognize that democracy can be no more than aspiration, and have rule not so much by the people as by the cleverest people; not an aristocracy of birth, not a plutocracy of wealth, but a true meritocracy of talent."
Michael Young,We're not expecting him to be Roger Clemens. The stuff has always been there. It's just a matter of consistency and we're starting to see that now.
Michael Young,You had to make sure that you came to work with clothes that were appropriate to the weather.
Michael Young,"To provide world-class patient care, we need everyone involved in the surgical process to have an accurate view of what is happening at any point for any patient. Now we can also bring better metrics to management. For example, we can immediately identify delays in OR turnaround times, investigate the cause, and develop solutions to reduce these types of delays."
Michael Young,This is what our country is all about. Everybody is proud of their American citizenship and they want to do the best they can to represent that.
Michael Young,This was a character win for us.
Michael Young,Roger's experience in new business development and strategic partnerships will help 3S grow its business both domestically and internationally. His drive and enthusiasm coupled with a strong technical background make him a great addition to our existing senior staff. We are pleased to welcome Roger to our team.
Michael Young,"That's the only way to look at it. If you don't feel strongly about it, then you really don't believe it. There is a lot of talent in this clubhouse, now it's a matter of going out on the field and letting it loose."
Michael Young,"It was her inner beauty that first attracted me. She is just a warm, caring person who has so much to give."
Michael Young,"Besides that, the weather is great, the travel is a piece of cake, you can focus entirely on baseball and the facilities are first-class because games are played at Spring Training stadiums. I had a blast. Whoever thought of the AFL, it was a great idea."
Michael Young,"Obviously, we're interested in getting the highest ratings we can - that's a primary goal along with making sure our advertisers are successful. But we didn't make these changes because of the shows on the air. We made the changes because of the shows we want to put on the air."
Robert Young,"I'm a quiet person. I don't really believe in demonstrations, but I wanted to come here to support my son."
Robert Young,"I see it as money in my pocket,"
Robert Young,What we have to do as a nation is to step back and look at the economics of the situation and decide whether it?s worth it to keep all of that infrastructure there.
Robert Young,These arrests are the result of the continued great cooperation we get working with the Maine Warden Service.
Steve Young,The trick is educating the public about the technology.
Steve Young,"Brett is going to have a huge burden to try and lift the rest of the team. I think that burden is too much. I think for the first time in the last six or seven years, I think the burden actually will pull him backwards, maybe into the abyss."
Steve Young,"The principle is competing against yourself. It's about self improvement, about being better than you were the day before."
Steve Young,"The players seem more into it. We have new coaches, enthusiasm. We want to see the new style; see if it works."
Steve Young,"It's like anything in life: If you have a passion, and a commitment to something, you do it very well. You don't have to be in a big city to do it well. This is something Canton has obviously a passion for, and a commitment to. ... If I ever get in trouble, or needed to live somewhere in the world because of a situation, I would come here. I think they'd take me in, and I'd be all right here."
Steve Young,There's no way I would fill up our cars with gas once a week any more. We're not using a full tank of gas even once a month.
Steve Young,"I think we should do reasonably well. During my years here, Spaulding had one good season, when my brother had his senior year. That one year, we had real team unity, not just individuals. I kind of feel like we have that this year."
Steve Young,I want to be able to come home once in a while. It's nice to sleep in your own bed.
Vince Young,It just makes me go out and work harder to showcase my talent.
Vince Young,"I didn't want that to happen, ... I started focusing in more on sports."
Vince Young,"Coach Brown came back five minutes later and said a snowstorm came in and it shut their whole school down, ... I said to myself that's way too cold, I'm not going there."
Vince Young,"He's a gifted athlete, and just came out and played the game. Him coming in at running back shows what kind of talent he has. He's getting better with his receiving routes, and getting better running the ball."
Vince Young,"There are some great guys in the running, ... I just want to keep playing and keep winning .... may the best man win."
Vince Young,"[When the team broke from spring practice, Young wrote on a grease board in the locker room,] Anyone who wants to win this season, meet me back here June 1 ... We're going to be outside on the practice field every night at 7 p.m. Be there."
Vince Young,"Everybody's looking for something negative. I just want to continue being a positive person. ... That is motivation for me. When it's my time to come out and show 'Vince,' then you will get the truth."
Vince Young,"To me, mistakes happen, ... I don't really think about last year's game. It's all about now."
Vince Young,"Coach Brown has let me be me more, laughing, joking around, playing with the guys, listening to our music."
Vince Young,"[Yet here is Texas, a year after benefiting from the BCS numbers, potentially being hurt by them. How does 13-0 and no national championship sound? Ask Auburn.] We've learned, ... that you have to take care of yourself."
Vince Young,"Being back here is a big honor. We have worked so hard to get here, through 100 degree heat, injuries and challenges. This season has been fun and we are excited to be preparing to play for a chance at the National Championship. Enjoying the moment is the most important thing; this is what it's all about."
Vince Young,I just hate that everyone thinks it's me. It's not just me.
Vince Young,"I'm very proud of him, how much hard work he did to get to this point. I'm proud of him a whole lot."
Vince Young,"I try to volunteer as much as I can during the week, even if it means weekends. I take giving back to the community very seriously."
Vince Young,"I feel like (everyone's) just giving them the national championship, but we haven't played a down yet. It doesn't really bother us because they know we're coming to play."
Vince Young,"It feels like they're giving them the national championship, and we haven't even played a down. I guess they believe we aren't going to give them any competition."
Vince Young,He had some rapid-fire stuff for me. I think he wanted to keep me on the move. It's a good thing I've continued to work out hard.
Vince Young,"They've been fighting with us since we lost 12-0. They've been there when we were down 35-7 to Oklahoma State [Texas scored 49 straight points in 2004 to win]. They've been there. They wanted to touch me. I wanted to touch them, too."
Vince Young,"There were trials and tribulations that my brother went through. But just to see him keep fighting - he could have just quit, but he was still here, still on the sidelines with his little hopping ankle and still coaching the guys. You've got to respect a guy like that."
Vince Young,"He's been through a lot. Just to see him keep fighting ... I'm proud of him, proud of all the hard work he's done to get to this point."
Vince Young,"I accept what God blessed me to be: a leader, a quarterback. It comes with a lot of fame, a lot of awards, a lot of things."
Vince Young,"That's the expectation on this team, getting back to the Rose Bowl, ... There's plenty more work to do. But we're almost halfway home."
Vince Young,"I'm honored to join TNT's coverage of the All-Star events. As an ambassador for Houston, I look forward to interacting with players, celebrities and fans visiting our city."
Vince Young,"Man, Coach Brown, he's so relaxed. We've seen that guy dancing this week at practice and he's dancing in the locker room. It brings tears to guys' eyes and brings happiness to everybody."
Vince Young,"I don't really care about the criticism, because I'm pretty much used to it. There's always something about Vince. ... I feel like I've overcome all of that, turned out pretty good, so I want to continue to do that in the NFL as well."
Vince Young,It keeps college kids from going into debt.
Vince Young,"We came in as a class with standards we set, ... and we're starting to realize them now."
Vince Young,He's the Heisman. All hats off to him. He's a phenomenal athlete.
Vince Young,"It comes with age, ... more years, more experience and more working with players on my team."
Vince Young,"He has that play-making ability, ... We looked at film of him all summer, and a lot of great teams couldn't tackle him."
George Younger,"But when ill indeed, Even dismissing the doctor don't always succeed."
George Younger,Mum's the word.
George Younger,Like two single gentlemen rolled into one.
Yang Yuanqing,This should help improve the overall environment.
Yang Yuanqing,"Our first priority has always been to provide highest-quality, innovative products to our customers. Working together with Microsoft, we have made it easy for our joint customers to get the reliability, service and support only available from genuine software, at great competitive pricing. As a global corporate citizen, we want to lead the efforts to make it possible for ordinary users to enjoy genuine software and to help foster the healthy and orderly development of the IT industry in every country in which we do business."
Yang Yuanqing,"We are a new unified culture, more efficient, more profitable and with better service for our customers."
Yang Yuanqing,Our current cost structure and competitiveness has not been optimized and our product portfolio is not complete enough. We should have higher aspirations.
Yang Yuanqing,"The decline in profit margin reflects an increase of market competition, and shows that we haven't optimized our cost and expense structure. We need to broaden our product portfolio and increase our market coverage."
Lawrence Yun,"Nationwide, the numbers clearly indicate the market is cooling, but cooling from the record sales pace in 2005. Now, we're experiencing what we characterize as healthy levels."
Lawrence Yun,"All housing market indicators are pointing to a move away from the frenzied record sales pace to, I would say, a more healthy rate of activity."
Lawrence Yun,"Prices have doubled in some Florida markets over the past four or five years, so the 10 percent increase we're forecasting for the state this year might seem kind of small compared to recent trends."
Lawrence Yun,"A typical household in the past two years saw about a $20,000 gain in equity. That's not an insignificant chunk. Homeowners see that wealth and use it to buy additional goods."
Lawrence Yun,"What we had in the past couple of years was an unprecedented frenzy of activity. That's what we're seeing: A decline from a frenzied, unsustainable rate."
Lawrence Yun,You need a strong job market with people in their 20s moving out of their parents' homes before rents recover.
Lawrence Yun,"The supply of homes is very tight for new and existing homes. We will continue to see healthy home-price appreciation. For non-home owners, that's bad news. But for home owners, that's building wealth."
Lawrence Yun,"In the Midwest, where homes are very affordable and where home prices have risen much slower than the national average, sales are more dependent on job growth in the overall economy."
Lawrence Yun,I am confident in saying Atlanta will continue to see growth over the next year. The Atlanta area is less sensitive to changes in the housing market right now.
Lawrence Yun,"Our experience says prices do not go down when there's job creation in the local economy. In local markets where they are flat on jobs, they could see prices decline. But we're projecting 2.3 million new jobs this year. The job market is providing a buffer. It's a counter force to rising rates."
Lawrence Yun,"Any time there's job creation, historically prices don't go down."
Steve Yzerman,"But I think the job he's done is overlooked, just because of the talent we have."
Steve Yzerman,"I'm not a big fan of the shootout, but it's in the rules now and you have to make the best of it,"
Steve Yzerman,I'm getting one more opportunity to play for the Stanley Cup so I'm pretty thrilled about that.
Steve Yzerman,"You're so wrapped up in the game, and then they score with a minute to go, I don't really have a whole lot of thoughts other than, it just came to a quick end. As far as my personal situation, it's best to wait a few days, then I can pretty much make a quick decision."
Steve Yzerman,His work ethic is really a good example for the younger guys. Just the experience of being through three Olympic Games will really help settle things down.
Steve Yzerman,"We've always developed it with the close proximity and the Ohio-Michigan thing. There's a lot of enthusiasm at games, and that will just add to it, I'm sure."
Steve Yzerman,"I had 15 months there to debate it and back forth. At times, I was certain I was going to play and there were other times I was certain I wasn't going to play, ... Until the lockout ended and I had a chance to sit down with Kenny Holland to kind of discuss, 'Does it make sense for me to come back, economically, for the organization, personnel wise? What do you want to do with this team?'"
Steve Yzerman,I'm exhausted trying to stay healthy.
Jared Zabransky,"When you see a big safety back there, it's more of a threatening presence."
Jared Zabransky,"You just keep giving it to him. He's a huge weapon for us, and he's a good player. Players go into slumps sometimes."
Jared Zabransky,A couple of those balls were a little more jump balls than I wanted them to be. The rain kind of got me a little bit. ... We felt we could exploit them that way.
Jay Zagorsky,Looking at net worth it's really devastating for both.
Jay Zagorsky,Getting married and staying married is a wonderful way to increase your wealth - but the key is stay married.
Jay Zagorsky,Some people may also be working less and not trying as hard to build wealth as they have marriage troubles. Divorce is often a long and messy process.
Jay Zagorsky,"Couples' wealth disagreements arise because men report higher values for the family assets, while women report larger values for the family's debts."
Jay Zagorsky,"While men come out slightly ahead, divorce destroys wealth dramatically for both sexes."
Jay Zagorsky,"Many of these people may have separated before the divorce became official, which would help explain why wealth starts falling so early. Some people may also be working less and not trying as hard to build wealth as they have marriage troubles. Divorce is often a long and messy process, and you can see this in the four-year decline in wealth."
Jay Zagorsky,"Many of these people may have separated before the divorce became official, which would help explain why wealth starts falling so early. Divorce is often a long and messy process, and you can see this in the four-year decline in wealth."
Jay Zagorsky,"If you really want to increase your wealth, get married and stay married. On the other hand, divorce can devastate your wealth."
Jay Zagorsky,Divorce looks like one of the fastest ways to destroy your wealth.
Jay Zagorsky,"Even a decade after divorce, the median wealth stays below $10,000."
Mahmoud Zahar,Their money will only bring them pain and agony and they will lose.
Mahmoud Zahar,The leaders of these services became multimillionaires. We are going to reform these services. This is our mission.
Mahmoud Zahar,"If not, then I think we will have no option but to protect our people and our land."
Mahmoud Zahar,This convoy is the size of our joy.
Mahmoud Zahar,"Negotiations is not our intention, negotiation is a method,"
Mahmoud Zahar,We must sit down and discuss the cease-fire. We are talking and discussing the cease-fire.
Mahmoud Zahar,It seems like nobody can win the election among the Israelis without dipping his hands in the blood of the Palestinians.
Mahmoud Zahar,"one authority, one weapon."
Mahmoud Zahar,I wish America would cut off its aid. We do not need this satanic money.
Mahmoud Zahar,"If [the Israelis] are going to stop their aggression, by all means -- targeting, demolishing, conquering and others -- we are going to declare that we are committed to a quietness."
Paula Zahn,"I am so excited about what lies ahead here at CNN, ... I am delighted."
Paula Zahn,"Sir, you're not telling me that you just learned that the folks at the convention centre didn't have food and water until today, are you? You had no idea that they were completely cut off?"
Paula Zahn,"Threatened to withhold cooperation, cancel certain issues, or shut the magazine down if G+J did not accede to your demands."
Paula Zahn,"I'm excited by the complete shift in attitudes. Twenty years ago, when I did my first report on colorectal cancer, there was tremendous resistance (from news directors)."
Paula Zahn,"I'm excited by the complete shift in attitudes, ... Twenty years ago, when I did my first report on colorectal cancer, there was tremendous resistance (from news directors)."
Paula Zahn,"My challenge was even greater as a journalist, because this was happening in my own backyard."
Paula Zahn,"I'm a mother, I'm a journalist, I'm an American; I'm all of those things, and it really complicates your job when you have all these things come into play."
Paula Zahn,We're just delighted that management has come around to my way of thinking.
Mark Zaid,"It sounds better than the truth, which is that DOD is not cooperative."
Mark Zaid,"Recreational marijuana use is a fact of life nowadays. It doesn't stop Supreme Court justices from getting on the bench and doesn't stop presidents from getting elected, so why should it stop someone from getting hired by the FBI?"
Mark Zaid,"Suddenly, they were asking for dozens of redactions of the exact same language they'd cleared before."
Mark Zaid,"If those latter two events don't take place within an eight-month period, another million will be provided."
Abbas Zaidi,It is state-level security. Their visit is basically to coordinate with our security officials. The venues are acceptable to them.
Abbas Zaidi,They are welcome to send their delegation but we have prepared a security plan for the Indian team which is already much more effective than what they are asking for.
Abbas Zaidi,"PCB would like to clarify that its management, captain and coach had unanimously agreed to commission 'hard bouncy pitches' for the India series."
Abbas Zaidi,It's now up to him to decide whether to accept our offer or decline it. But our information is that he'll get back to us after first speaking and getting clearance from the United Board of South Africa.
Abbas Zaidi,The President complimented both the teams for playing excellent cricket. He also appreciated both the teams for playing cricket in its true spirit and displaying themselves as true ambassadors of their respective countries.
Gerrit Zalm,I think ministers of finance should not comment on interest rates.
Gerrit Zalm,"is no longer a partner we can trust, and we want new elections, preferably as soon as possible. It's gone far enough with all this bickering. It's time to let the people speak."
Gerrit Zalm,I want elections as soon as possible. ...The most natural formula is that the cabinet resigns and we have elections this year.
Gerrit Zalm,"It is interesting to have the competition commissioner with us. I think there are still some barriers,"
Carlos Zambrano,"I think I was out of the game mentally, ... I was fighting with the umpires, and I was mad at (Murton). ... I apologized to him. I have five years in the big leagues. I don't have to do that."
Carlos Zambrano,"I've been working hard on strength and conditioning. When you do a good job and take care of your body, at the end of the season you feel strong."
Carlos Zambrano,"I like a challenge, and I would like to pitch against the Dominican Republic at the World Baseball Classic."
Ed Zander,"Sun's vision is, and always has been, to deliver services everywhere on the Net."
Ed Zander,We will continue to devote the best technical and service resources of Sun Microsystems to ensure the level of service the eBay community demands.

We're leading the way with new and compelling devices that work together to erase the barriers between places and services and empower people to connect with personalized entertainment and information.
Ed Zander,I think we have better products. We have to get them out there to our customers when we say we will and our products will win on the shelves.
Ed Zander,Most users don't want to focus on operating systems. This is the architecture that companies such as ours are focusing on.
Ed Zander,Congress has taken an important step toward completing the transition to digital television. This will help keep America on the cutting edge by freeing up spectrum for new wireless technologies.
Ed Zander,"Through the MOTOFWRD competition we are inspiring rising innovators to inspire us, ... The ability to dream, to imagine the possibility, is one of the greatest assets of today's youth and this program allows the next generation of scientists, inventors and designers to show us their best."
Frank Zappa,It would be easier to pay off the national debt overnight than to neutralize the long-range effects of our national stupidity
Frank Zappa,"Some scientists claim that hydrogen, because it is so plentiful, is the basic building block of the universe.  I dispute that.  I say that there is more stupidity than hydrogen, and that is the basic building block of the universe."
Frank Zappa,"The manner in which Americans ''consume'' music has a lot to do with leaving it on their coffee tables, or using it as wallpaper for their lifestyles, like the score of a movie --it's consumed that way without any regard for how and why it's made."
Frank Zappa,Stupidity has a certain charm - ignorance does not
Frank Zappa,Jazz is not dead - it just smells funny
Frank Zappa,"Everybody believes in something and everybody, by virtue of the fact that they believe in something, use that something to support their own existence."
Frank Zappa,"I believe that people have a right to decide their own destiny; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only as long as) individual citizens give it a temporary license to exist - in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself. In a democracy you own the government - it doesn't own you. Along with this comes a responsibility to ensure that individual actions, in the pursuit of a personal destiny, do not threaten the well-being of others while the pursuit is in progress."
Frank Zappa,"A composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will on unsuspecting air molecules, often with the assistance of unsuspecting musicians."
Frank Zappa,"Everybody believes in something and everybody, by virtue of the fact that they believe in something, uses that something to support their own existence."

Frank Zappa,"Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible."
Frank Zappa,Art is making something out of nothing and selling it.
Frank Zappa,"Without music to decorate it, time is just a bunch of boring production deadlines or dates by which bills must be paid."

Frank Zappa,"Some scientists claim that hydrogen, because it is so plentiful, is the basic building block of the universe. I dispute that. I say there is more stupidity than hydrogen, and that is the basic building block of the universe."
Frank Zappa,I searched for years I found no love. I'm sure that love will never be a product of plasticity.
Frank Zappa,"The computer can't tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what's missing is the eyebrows."

Frank Zappa,"There is more stupidity than hydrogen in the universe, and it has a longer shelf life."
Frank Zappa,I never set out to be weird. It was always other people who called me weird.
Frank Zappa,All the good music has already been written by people with wigs and stuff.
Frank Zappa,No change in musical style will survive unless it is accompanied by a change in clothing style. Rock is to dress up to.

Frank Zappa,"Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read."
Frank Zappa,Music is always a commentary on society.
Frank Zappa,"It isn't necessary to imagine the world ending in fire or ice. There are two other possibilities: one is paperwork, and the other is nostalgia."

Frank Zappa,"If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to the library."

David Zaslav,"The overwhelming majority of people are still going to watch television in a linear fashion. But there's a growing group of people who aren't looking to see what's the best show on in that time slot, but what's the best show available. We need to stay ahead of that."
David Zaslav,There's momentum in the marketplace with portability. Everyone is getting more comfortable with VOD.
David Zaslav,We expect Start Over will help deliver more engaged viewers to our advertisers.
Emil Zatopek,"One day the factory sports coach, who was very strict, pointed at four boys, including me, and ordered us to run in a race. I protested that I was weak and not fit to run, but the coach sent me for a physical examination and the doctor said that I was perfectly well. So I had to run, and when I got started I felt I wanted to win. But I only came in second. That was the way it started."
Emil Zatopek,It's at the borders of pain and suffering that the men are separated from the boys.
Emil Zatopek,"A runner must run with dreams in his heart, not money in his pocket."
Gregg Zaun,"We had a real young team and the young guys made a lot of progress. I don't anybody expected us to be a pennant winner, but I think we got better as an organization this year."
Gregg Zaun,"He's been a good guy and steady performer all year, just giving us one good start after another."
Gregg Zaun,"I've got my pick, but I'm not giving anyone any bulletin-board fodder."
Gregg Zaun,I thought overall he was pretty darn good today. He really showed a lot of character after giving up three in the first inning to keep us in that ball game.
Mao Zedong,Long distance running is particularly good training in perseverance.
Mao Zedong,"So long as a person who has made mistakes... honestly and sincerely wishes to be cured and to mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his sickness so that he can become a good comrade. We can never succeed if we just let ourselves go and lash at h"

Mao Zedong,Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for promoting the progress of the arts and the sciences and a flourishing culture in our land.
Mao Zedong,"Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history; such is the history of civilization for thousands of years."
Mao Zedong,To read too many books is harmful.

Mao Zedong,"An army without culture is a dull-witted army, and a dull-witted army cannot defeat the enemy."
Mao Zedong,"I do not agree with the view that to be moral, the motive of one's action has to be benefiting others. People like me want to satisfy our hearts to the full, and in doing so we automatically have the most valuable moral codes."
Mao Zedong,"A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another."

Alan Zemaitis,I really don't bask in the glory of the 'W'.
Alan Zemaitis,"Even though we've had bad fortune in the past, we've always played O-State tough -- always. They know that, and we know that. I can't wait. This is what college football is all about -- two great schools going against each other."
Alan Zemaitis,"The thing about it is, Michael Robinson, Matthew Rice and me, you would think that we are fortune-tellers, the way we scripted the season up to this point. We predicted it all."
Alan Zemaitis,We're beginning a dynasty. We want to have something like USC. The way we (taught) the underclassmen I think we have a real good shot at doing that.
Alan Zemaitis,"It's very important. From the beginning of the season, I always told the media and the young guys understood this that it is up to us to teach these guys how to do it. Don't even worry about it. We're going to get our wins and we're going to make sure that these younger guys understand that we can build a legacy here and that it's not going to stop with just this season."
Alan Zemaitis,"I feel wonderful. It's something when you put your mind to it, battle all adversity and nobody giving us respect _ when you get what you wanted at the end, it makes it that much better."
Alan Zemaitis,"Him not being here last year, you could really feel the absence. Hats off to him, that's just the first game. The kind of player that he is, he can just play all out. Next week he's just going to play better and better and better."
Alan Zemaitis,I didn't believe in my own ability. I didn't have confidence.

Elias Zerhouni,"These rules are the most restrictive of any rules we know about in the world of biomedical research, ... The rules as you see them today are extremely stringent. With the ban on consulting for paid activities, I think Congress should be very fully reassured we've addressed the fundamental issue of public trust in the integrity of the science."
Elias Zerhouni,"This atlas of genomic changes will provide new insights into the biological basis of cancer, which in turn will lead to new tests to detect cancer in its early, most treatable stages; new therapies to target cancer at its most vulnerable points; and, ultimately, new strategies to prevent cancer."
Elias Zerhouni,"We have a balanced set of conflict of interest rules that protect the integrity of NIH and its ability to provide the American public with an unbiased and trusted source of scientific and health information, while preserving our ability to recruit and retain world class scientists and staff."

Dieter Zetsche,We are in a difficult business situation and we know the only way to initiate change effectively is by working together. The true test of a strong relationship is measured during times such as these.
Dieter Zetsche,DaimlerChrysler made significant progress in 2005. But our earnings are still not where we want them to be.
Dieter Zetsche,"Industry sales actually came out higher than expected. In January, we lost some momentum in the marketplace because of the uncertainty surrounding our recovery. By announcing a major portion of our turnaround plan earlier this week, we will recapture that momentum."
Dieter Zetsche,We are not satisfied with last year's results. We can only safeguard the future of our company and the jobs of our employees if we achieve profitable growth.
Dieter Zetsche,We are seeing whether there are more possibilities to intensify our cooperation. We're talking about a whole bunch of projects. We meet each other regularly.
Dieter Zetsche,"DaimlerChrysler made significant progress in the year 2005, but our earnings are still not where we want them to be. We intend to grow profitably and to create added value over the long term - for the benefit of our customers, employees and shareholders."

Zinedine Zidane,The England team must always be respected. They always fight to the end.
Zinedine Zidane,"My family are very proud of me, but I am very proud of them and where they come from. I am proud that they come from Kabylie. It is a special place."
Zinedine Zidane,Music was important. Football was the easy part.
Zinedine Zidane,"I'm very inspired by him-it was my father who taught us that an immigrant must work twice as hard as anybody else, that he must never give up."
Zinedine Zidane,I was lucky to come from a difficult area. It teaches you not just about football but also life. There were lots of kids from different races and poor families. People had to struggle to get through the day.
Zinedine Zidane,"I may have had a lot of luck in my life, but I still need to find a challenge in the game."
Zinedine Zidane,I love Madrid. I am happy to be here. I have been here three years and hope to be here longer. But I am proud of where I come from and never forget the people I grew up with.
Zinedine Zidane,I have no message.
Zinedine Zidane,"I have never had the opportunity to play in England, so I know little about it."
Zinedine Zidane,"I have a need to play intensely every day, to fight every match hard."
Zinedine Zidane,I don't know if we are the best team in the world. I am lucky to be playing alongside some of the best players around. It's a dream.
Zinedine Zidane,We were a family who had come from nothing and now we had respect from French people of all sorts.
Zinedine Zidane,My passion for the game comes from the city of Marseille itself. Unfortunately I can't go back there as much I want to because I play a lot here and abroad.
Zinedine Zidane,"Before it was hard to talk about certain things, especially if, like me, you came from a difficult area or an immigrant background."
Zinedine Zidane,A Mediterranean city is really my culture.
Zinedine Zidane,I have decided to come back for Les Bleus.
Zinedine Zidane,"It's the first time it's happened to me and maybe the last. It's a strange sensation, not normal for me. I can't remember scoring three goals, even when I was a kid."
Zinedine Zidane,It will be a physical encounter but we must not respond in kind.
Zinedine Zidane,"After the World Cup, I will stop playing football."
Zinedine Zidane,"It's simple. If we want to have our destiny in our own hands, we need to win our four matches."
Zinedine Zidane,think -- and I stress my words -- about the consequences of voting for a party that does not at all correspond to the values of France.
Zinedine Zidane,The only important thing I have to say is that my father never fought against his country.
Harriet Ziefert,"Since I am both the author and the publisher of this book, I must, of course, take full responsibility for the text."
Harriet Ziefert,"Teachers and parents should try to get these feelings out in the open, down on paper and let them be talked about."
Harriet Ziefert,I have no recollection of ever seeing Ms. Barrett's book -- though it would be foolish of me not to consider the possibility that I might have seen it decades ago and that its structure and some of its language imprinted somewhere on my subconscious.

Andrew Zimbalist,I'm sure there will be thousands of new jobs. But the question is whether they subtract jobs from people working nearby.
Andrew Zimbalist,My best guess is they won't strike. They know they'll hurt the game and themselves too much if they strike. I don't think they'll tip their hand right now - I'm sure they'll make it sound like they're willing to strike. But my best guess is players will fight the owners with litigation.

Andrew Zimbalist,"You also then have to acknowledge that when the team performs poorly, it'll go in the opposite direction."
Andrew Zimbalist,"I don't think it's going to happen, and I don't think baseball wants it to happen. I think baseball would be inviting congressional ? possibly severe congressional ? response to it. They also would have to negotiate the effects of contraction with the players union."
Andrew Zimbalist,He's innovated baseball management. He's shown the way to exploit a big city market by spending heavily on players.
Andrew Zimbalist,"He's innovated baseball management. He's shown the way to exploit a big city market by spending heavily on players,"
Andrew Zimbalist,"I don't think baseball can abandon the Miami market. If MLB does let that market go vacant, I think it'll be one of the biggest mistakes they ever made."
Andrew Zimbalist,"Baseball does have some slack here. When they were losing $20 million a year in Montreal, there was some pressure to get rid of it. But as long as they are [profitable] in Washington, there is less pressure. They've got eight bona fide $450 million offers to buy the team, and those offers aren't going to go away soon."
Andrew Zimbalist,"Attorneys General in various states looking to get baseball or keep teams would sue baseball on grounds that they're a monopoly and restricting output,"

Andrew Zimbalist,"The market's been soft, ... and I think that's mostly a result of the new provisions in the collective bargaining agreement."

Philip Zimbardo,The line between good and evil is permeable and almost anyone can be induced to cross it when pressured by situational forces.

Philip Zimbardo,One can't live mindfully without being enmeshed in psychological processes that are around us.
Philip Zimbardo,"My first formal research, published in 1953, was on trying to understand the dynamics of prejudice, of interaction between blacks and Puerto Ricans."
Philip Zimbardo,"My early childhood prepared me to be a social psychologist. I grew up in a South Bronx ghetto in a very poor family. From Sicilian origin, I was the first person in my family to complete high school, let alone go to college."
Philip Zimbardo,"I was discriminated against because I was Jewish, Italian, black and Puerto Rican. But maybe the worst prejudice I experienced was against the poor. I grew up on welfare and often had to move in the middle of the night because we couldn't pay the rent."
Philip Zimbardo,I started studying shyness in adults in 1972. Shyness operates at so many different levels. Out of that research came the Stanford shyness clinic in 1977.
Philip Zimbardo,"I have been primarily interested in how and why ordinary people do unusual things, things that seem alien to their natures. Why do good people sometimes act evil? Why do smart people sometimes do dumb or irrational things?"
Philip Zimbardo,"Human behavior is incredibly pliable, plastic."
Philip Zimbardo,"Heroes are those who can somehow resist the power of the situation and act out of noble motives, or behave in ways that do not demean others when they easily can."

Philip Zimbardo,Being hurt personally triggered a curiosity about how such beliefs are formed.
Philip Zimbardo,"At North Hollywood High School, I was shunned by everyone. I would sit down in the cafeteria, and students would get up from the table and walk away. They thought I was from the Mafia."
Philip Zimbardo,"After doing psychology for half a century, my passion for all of it is greater than ever."
Philip Zimbardo,Academic success depends on research and publications.
Philip Zimbardo,"Evil is knowing better, but willingly doing worse."

Mark Zimmerman,"Depressed patients clearly have different perceptions than researchers running clinical trials about what it means to stop feeling depressed. Clinical researchers have identified a patient as being in remission from depression, based on certain behaviors or symptoms, but the patient may not feel any better. We may need to broaden our definition of remission from depression."
Mark Zimmerman,"For other medical conditions, there are clear-cut treatment goals. For epilepsy, it is eliminating seizures. For high blood pressure, it is to reduce blood pressure to a normal range. It is equally important to clearly outline goals of treatment for depression."
Mark Zimmerman,"(The Burros) stay in the game and don't give up, so I'm please with how we played."
Ryan Zimmerman,"I am going to struggle. That's going to be a big part of my year is how I can handle that and how I respond to that, and am I doing it as well as I can?"
Ryan Zimmerman,"I wouldn't say I am a power hitter. I am a gap-to-gap guy. If I hit one like I did today, so be it."
Ryan Zimmerman,"I can't complain. I am 20 years old up here learning, getting to hang out with these guys and getting to run around with them."
Ryan Zimmerman,"Those kind of comments, you take them in and let them go right out, ... It's certainly an honor to be compared to great players, but I can't be thinking about that when I'm on the field. I just want to relax and play."
Ryan Zimmerman,It barely got me. It didn't do anything. It was funny.
Howard Zinn,"I'm worried that students will take their obedient place in society and look to become successful cogs in the wheel - let the wheel spin them around as it wants without taking a look at what they're doing. I'm concerned that students not become passive acceptors of the official doctrine that's handed down to them from the White House, the media, textbooks, teachers and preachers."

William Zinsser,"Four basic premises of writing: clarity, brevity, simplicity, and humanity."
Barry Zito,"I knew coming in, with Colon being a potential Cy Young winner, there'd be very little room for error, ... He was amazing."
Barry Zito,I'm just frustrated with the up-and-down nature of [my] April.
Barry Zito,"So I'm going to get some grief about this. I don't say a word when I strike him out, but I'm sure I'll hear about this."
Barry Zito,"Brown was way out in front of a changeup, ... That's just the baseball gods there. ... I haven't seen their games, but I figure they hadn't gotten breaks like that."
Barry Zito,There were some strange balls that were pop ups and they kept going. I was throwing to the inside part of the plate better and throwing the change. I just felt like a couple of them weren't really hit that well.
Barry Zito,"I think in the bullpen you can tell during your warmups, if you have a good feel for it. But anything can happen once you get into a game. Sometimes you just wind up throwing it better than ever before one day without knowing why."
Barry Zito,"Some people pray to a totem pole, some people pray to a sun, some people pray to a god. It all works for them. It all comes back to what you think."
Barry Zito,I just write mechanical things.
Barry Zito,Big league defense is going to get outs most times.
Barry Zito,Meyer and I have a bit in common because we're both left-handed. I think it's great that he seeks out that advice because he's not too cool or too uncomfortable to ask for it.
Barry Zito,"I do look forward to keeping in touch with the guys, because we'll always be connected in people's minds."
Barry Zito,"I'm OK being the veteran, but I'm still just a kid."
Barry Zito,I hadn't focused on mechanics since I signed professionally.
Barry Zito,"The outfield is solid, so is the catching and the infield."
Barry Zito,"It's not like I'm some kind of veteran and there is this huge age gap. I identify with them more off the field. I need to set an example, which is great, and I look forward to doing just that."
Barry Zito,"Maybe I was a little lethargic mentally, instead of being pumped up. I think that works to my advantage when I'm lethargic. It helps me not trip out on everything."
Barry Zito,I was kind of lethargic mentally. But that works to my advantage. It helps me not freak out because you're not attentive to every little hit or what a fan is saying. It's better just to be in a little bit of a daze.
Nick Zito,I'm just thankful to be in a situation that at least we can try. And we're trying.
Nick Zito,He ran an unbelievable race. He hasn't run in four months. He just came up a tad short.
Nick Zito,"He's coming up to this race as good as he ever has. I'm expecting him to duplicate what he did in the Belmont. I don't know if that's good enough to win, but he should have a good run."
Nick Zito,"Either race is very, very tough. Let me just think about it for a couple of days. I want to make sure I'm doing the right thing."
Nick Zito,"I salute the winner, and Johnny rode a tremendous race. My jock rode a great race, too. I want to take care of this horse as well as I possibly can, because he gave his guts for us. They had to run to beat this horse today. I've got a real treasure in Bellamy Road."
Nick Zito,"She should like getting back to Belmont. She's a quality filly and she never runs a bad race. She hit the side of the gate coming out in the Test and we've schooled her a bunch of times, so I think she'll be different."
Nick Zito,She deserved this because she's run well in big races but had some tough luck. Today she broke good and was a different filly.
Nick Zito,"I love my jockey. Put it this way, if anybody can (relax the horse), he can."
Nick Zito,I guess it's the law of averages. We had the reputation for getting 3-year-olds ready and everyone kept rooting for us but we never broke through.
Nick Zito,We're getting close. I like that. We usually find a length or two (improvement) when we come to Kentucky. He's got to be first or second. That's what we need.
Nick Zito,They are the only two horses left standing. It's great to have a rematch. It should be a lot of fun.
Nick Zito,"The reason we're going forward is if you look at his last race, he stayed with his [herd]. Sometimes horses will take a left turn or a right turn. He didn't have a jock on him, but he ran with his horses."
Nick Zito,"I'll be happy to have just one, but I hope I have more."
Nick Zito,You have to be excited about Great Point. He ran a great race and you just hope he keeps going forward and comes around.
Nick Zito,Bellamy Road ran his heart out.
Nick Zito,"Usually trainers are good to each other and volunteer, but I've had it happen with trainers who hate my guts, and there's trainers who I've lost horses to who I hate their guts. It's uncomfortable, but you have to act like a pro."
Nick Zito,"It's going to be interesting because I don't want to take him out of his game, ... But we don't want him in a speed duel to set up for that other horse."
Nick Zito,Rabbits have been going on forever. That's the game. It certainly spices things up and makes it fun.
Nick Zito,"No doubt, he likes it here."
Nick Zito,"I don't think the competition is as good. ... If he can duplicate his Wood Memorial, you'll see what kind of horse he is."
Nick Zito,He's an amazing horse. 'He's gotten taller and longer. He's got the ability.
Robert Zoellick,We consider Australia an extremely strong ally. Clearly there's a security basis ... But we also want to strengthen the economic relationship. That's what this free-trade agreement is about.
Robert Zoellick,"The Philippines copyright enforcement is weak and and we are concerned it has the potential of becoming a center of pirate optical media production in Asia given the doubling in the number of production lines for compact discs (CDs) and other optical media during the past year,,"
Robert Zoellick,"It's clear that the different elements of the SLM are going to have to come together in some fashion, which only they can determine, if the Abuja peace negotiations can proceed successfully,"
Robert Zoellick,the proliferation of danger will undermine the benign security environment and healthy international economy that it needs for its development.
Robert Zoellick,I believe we can get this done.
James Zogby,Our silence in the face of the horrific abuses that are taking place on a daily basis in fact are causing people throughout the Middle East to ask serious questions about America and about its commitment to its values.
James Zogby,"It was a very good meeting. He's listening and he's setting a good tone. We've still got some problems to work through, especially detention and profiling."
James Zogby,As long as these kids grow up not only in an economic underclass but excluded from being French or Dutch it's problematic. When people in my community get angry about American foreign policy they get angry as citizens and they fight back as citizens. The process is more open to including them.
James Zogby,a coherent policy that can punish the regime while offering sustenance and hope to the people of Iraq.
James Zogby,We continue to oppose the use of military force and think that there's a very significant risk of grave unrest in the Arab world.
James Zogby,"And the reason why people are afraid is because leadership led them down this path, it exploited the fear, the concern, and it used an Arab bogeyman to do it."
James Zogby,"We see Arabs as an objectified problem. We see the culture as less than ours, we see them as more violent than we are."
James Zogby,"The fact is, this creates more of a chill than cooperation."
James Zogby,"When you have members of Congress literally tripping over themselves to run to a microphone and they're saying, 'The Arabs are coming, the Arabs are coming,' preying off that fear because it's an Arab country, that constitutes bigotry."
James Zogby,"NSEERS was so poorly conceived and badly managed that it created chaos and fear. Trust between the immigrant community and law enforcement was severely strained and, in the end, there was no evidence that any terrorists were apprehended as a result of the effort."
James Zogby,"If we expect credit, or expect that this somehow is responsive to the anger of those who have become alienated from the United States, it's not."
James Zogby,"He was a revolutionary fighter for justice, and he sought a radical transformation of America and the world,"
John Zogby,"He now leads among independents, and that's because of the lead that he holds among independent women, ... Face the Nation."
John Zogby,He may be seen as one of the architects of an illusion. Or he may be seen as one of the architects of global stability. That needs at least a decade to play out.
John Zogby,"Tom DeLay may be gone, but he's not forgotten."
John Zogby,"Gore has made significant gains since the debate. Voters clearly do not like it when Bradley goes negative,"
John Zogby,"It isn't important until there's a crisis on the radar screen. Otherwise, it's really like an orphan."
John Zogby,Those scenes are not going to go away. Bush can recover a bit through damage control but those early impressions could be devastating for him and could hurt his party.
Emile Zola,The truth is on the march and nothing will stop it
Emile Zola,I am an artist... I am here to live out loud.
Emile Zola,"If you shut up truth, and bury it underground, it will but grow."
Emile Zola,The thought is a deed. Of all deeds she fertilizes the world most.
Emile Zola,"I am little concerned with beauty or perfection. I don't care for the great centuries. All I care about is life, struggle, intensity."
Emile Zola,Perfection is such a nuisance that I often regret having cured myself of using tobacco.
Emile Zola,"If I cannot overwhelm with my quality, I will overwhelm with my quantity."
Emile Zola,One forges one's style on the terrible anvil of daily deadlines.
Emile Zola,"If you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts through it will blow up everything in its way."
Emile Zola,In my view you cannot claim to have seen something until you have photographed it.
Emile Zola,"There are two men inside the artist, the poet and the craftsman. One is born a poet. One becomes a craftsman."
Emile Zola,The fate of animals is of greater importance to me than the fear of appearing ridiculous; it is indissolubly connected with the fate of men.
Emile Zola,"If you ask me what I came into this life to do, I will tell you: I came to live out loud."
Emile Zola,The truth is on the march and nothing will stop it.
Emile Zola,"The artist is nothing without the gift, but the gift is nothing without work."
Shanna Zolman,"She made an inside-out move from the 3-point line, drove in and made a little scoop shot. Running back down the court, I was laughing. I thought to myself, 'Wow, that was pretty athletic.' She's capable of doing that kind of stuff when she's on the floor, and that is exciting."
Shanna Zolman,They were like glue on me at Notre Dame. That's how people are going to guard me from here on out. That is something I have to be a lot more aware of and keep a more conscious effort to just keep moving continuously.
Shanna Zolman,The thought never crossed our mind that we were going to lose.
Shanna Zolman,We tried not to come out flat because we were extremely hurt after the Duke game.
Shanna Zolman,"We've lost three games this season, but it feels like we've lost 15. I'm sick and tired of losing, sick and tired of feeling this way, sick and tired of not playing up to our potential and my potential."
Shanna Zolman,"What bothers me most is that we knew our defense would carry us. One game, we'll play 40 minutes of defense, and 20 minutes in another, and in another. It's not a top priority. Until it's a top priority, who knows?"
Ron Zook,"It's a little bit like our situation in that all three of our running backs are a little different in the way that they run, the way they attack, the power, that kind of thing, ... When you look at what they've done running the football, I think you've got to feel like they're doing something right."
Ron Zook,I was just glad to see him practicing and running around out there. I think everyone was.
Ron Zook,"It looks to me like they have just truly reloaded. The offensive line is huge. The running back is huge. They lost their receivers (to graduation), and they've got a guy (Jordan) who's got 11 catches in one game. They'll be obviously the best receivers we've seen to date."
Ron Zook,"I know there will be an all-out assault on running backs a year from now, and there are some really good running backs in the vicinity."
Ron Zook,"It was not bad, it was really a pretty good practice, but we can be better. We're at the point where we need to stress to be as good as we can be all the time."
Ron Zook,You have to get guys in there who make fewer mistakes.
Ron Zook,"Vince has done everything I thought he would do in learning our package. He's spent time with the defensive line and linebackers, and I help a lot in the secondary. We've made great improvement on defense, which we should."
Ron Zook,"Vince has done everything that I thought he would in terms of coming in, learning our package. I've been very, very happy with the way that's going. We've made great improvement on defense, as we should. We've just got to continue to improve there."
Ron Zook,"He's done an unbelievable job with their program. When you go back and you look, up until just maybe two three years ago, his staff was pretty much intact for such a long period of time. To me, that really says a lot. You look at the record and you can see what he's done, but when you see coaches that stay there for a long period of time, I think it says a lot about the way he runs the program."
Ron Zook,"It all was going their way, ... But you have to keep fighting."
Ron Zook,We didn't play with emotion. We didn't play with the free rein and the emotion you need to be a good team.
Ron Zook,The doctors are very optimistic. We're sure we'll have him.
Ron Zook,"The way we handle adversity is going to determine what kind of team we are. I told them last night that this is our first true test of adversity and how we bounce back, how we handle it, and how we compete against a good Iowa football team will determine what kind of football team we are, and where we are at."
Jim Zorn,He could have lashed out or just gone in the tank or been so frustrated and demanded a trade. That's not how Matt reacted.
Jim Zorn,We're kind of out there.
Jim Zorn,"Year in and year out he just continues to get better. This wasn't a dramatic improvement year, though it was his best from a media standpoint. They finally noticed how well he played. But he inches toward greatness all the time and he's played very well this year."
Sha Zukang,Disarmament should be conducive to the enhancement of every country's general security instead of becoming the instrument and means for a few countries to strengthen their military superiority by weakening or restricting other countries.
Sha Zukang,"Controlling tobacco is a long-term, difficult and complicated public health task, it is also a social and economic issue that needs a strong policy."
Sha Zukang,We hate the idea. We condemn the idea. The transfer of TMD would certainly touch off a strong reaction from China. That is not good for peace and stability in that part of the world.
Sha Zukang,"We hate the idea. We condemn the idea. The transfer of TMD would certainly touch off a strong reaction from China. That is not good for peace and stability in that part of the world,"
Sha Zukang,"Currently only the Unites States is against the new resolution, which is actually the best possible compromise among UN members and reflects a fragile balance of all members' concerns."
Sha Zukang,"The resolution is not perfect, but it is a compromise that can be accepted by all UN members, so Chin a hopes it can be adopted."
Jacob Zuma,"An understanding has been reached,"
Jacob Zuma,"We are united as ANC. Comrade Msholozi is a disciplined cadre of the movement, therefore we'll show that support today and tomorrow and forever,"
Jacob Zuma,"Can there be a manipulation of justice by democracy...no, it should not, and it cannot, and I'm sure we all believe in that, and therefore, that's why I have understood people saying we will never allow the manipulation of justice."
Jacob Zuma,I had to do things with caution when I had to deal with this thing.
Jacob Zuma,There is no reason why there should be any doubt that the principals should accept the agreement.
Jim Zwerg,It was the most incredible period in my younger life.
Jim Zwerg,"He pulled out a paperback of Dr. King's book, 'Stride Toward Freedom,' about the Montgomery bus boycott. He said, 'Read this.' He was bright enough to realize violence was not the answer."
Jim Zwerg,Dr. King encouraged me to finish my education and pursue the ministry.
Gennady Zyuganov,"It is completely incomprehensible why the British have the necessary technology, but we don't. If we can't make effective rescue equipment ourselves, we need to buy it abroad."
Gennady Zyuganov,We had 60 percent of support in Dagestan (in the first round) and now they say we have lost. I want to find out how the figure could have changed so dramatically in just a few days.
Gennady Zyuganov,We will support the package of laws which ease the tax burden and develop our industry ... but financial and economic measures alone will not save the country.
Gennady Zyuganov,Many achievements of the Soviet epoch laid the foundation for modern society. All this should be remembered. The repeal of the Nov. 7 holiday will bring nobody the laurels of a hero.
Gennady Zyuganov,It's enough that Marko lost his father. He doesn't need to lose his mother as well.
Gennady Zyuganov,It defies the nation's history and commonsense. With their filthy hands and drunken heads they are crawling into the sanctuary of the state.
Gennady Zyuganov,"I don't think you have to be a specialist to see what his state of health is ... if during the crisis the captain is not on deck, that means he is seriously ill."
Gennady Zyuganov,"We are ready for elections,"
Gennady Zyuganov,"People who gathered here share different opinions, but when it comes to basic values such as culture, health, economic revival, the support of all forms of property, they unite their effort."
Gennady Zyuganov,"The situation is spinning out of control ... and the government is unable to solve any of the problems. We support the initiative of coal miners, scientists, students and teachers who demand the resignation of the president."
Gennady Zyuganov,have become hostages to a dead constitution and an absolutely incapable president.
Gennady Zyuganov,but on an even greater scale and with even more dramatic consequences.
Gennady Zyuganov,Promises given during the election have not been fulfilled. Instead we have a conflict that has grown into the bickering of generals.
Gennady Zyuganov,Common sense has prevailed in our state.
Gennady Zyuganov,The forms of warfare are changing. It's strange that not a single duck has yet died in America - they are all dying in Russia and European countries. This makes one seriously wonder why.
Gennady Zyuganov,"If we fail to reach an agreement here, everything will spill out to the streets."
