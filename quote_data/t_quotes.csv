Gay Talese,"For example, many colleges in their writing programs teach some of my work."
Gay Talese,"Even after they had stopped modeling for Playboy and had settled down with other men to raise families of their own, Hugh Hefner still considered them his women, and in the bound volumes of his magazine he would always possess them."
Gay Talese,"Better that you should take the chance of trying something that is close to your heart, you think is what you want to write, and if they do not publish it, put it in your drawer. But maybe another day will come and you will find a place to put that."

Amy Tan,Writing is an extreme privilege but it's also a gift. It's a gift to yourself and it's a gift of giving a story to someone.
Amy Tan,Words to me were magic. You could say a word and it could conjure up all kinds of images or feelings or a chilly sensation or whatever. It was amazing to me that words had this power.
Amy Tan,We are the kind of people who obsess over one word... but we have only one shot to get it right in concert. It was hard the first time I practiced with them. I was so nervous that my vocal chords were paralyzed for about a half-hour.
Amy Tan,"There are a lot of people who think that's what's needed to be successful is always being right, always being careful, always picking the right path."
Amy Tan,The forbidden things were a great influence on my life. I was forbidden from reading A Catcher in the Rye.
Amy Tan,"That was a wonderful period in my life. I mean, I didn't become an artist, but somebody let me do something I loved. What a luxury, to do something you love to do."
Amy Tan,"She said 'I'm by commission. You don't have to pay anything until you sell anything.' I said, 'Well fine. You want to be my agent and not make anything.' I thought, 'Boy, is she dumb.'"

Amy Tan,My parents had very high expectations. They expected me to get straight A's from the time I was in kindergarten.
Amy Tan,My mother said I was a clingy kid until I was about four. I also remember that from the age of eight she and I fought almost every day.
Amy Tan,It's both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success.
Amy Tan,"I would still like to have that luxury, to be able to just sit and draw for hours and hours and hours. In a way, that's what I do as a writer."
Amy Tan,"I would find myself laughing and wondering where these ideas came from. You can call it imagination, I suppose. But I was grateful for wherever they came from."
Amy Tan,"I was intelligent enough to make up my own mind. I not only had freedom of choice, I had freedom of expression."
Amy Tan,I wanted to write stories for myself. At first it was purely an aesthetic thing about craft. I just wanted to become good at the art of something. And writing was very private.
Amy Tan,"I used to think that my mother got into arguments with people because they didn't understand her English, because she was Chinese."

Amy Tan,"I think I've always been somebody, since the deaths of my father and brother, who was afraid to hope. So, I was more prepared for failure and for rejection than for success."
Amy Tan,I started a second novel seven times and I had to throw them away.
Amy Tan,"I saw my mother in a different light. We all need to do that. You have to be displaced from what's comfortable and routine, and then you get to see things with fresh eyes, with new eyes."

Amy Tan,"I learned to forgive myself, and that enabled me to forgive my mother as a person."
Amy Tan,I have a writer's memory which makes everything worse than maybe it actually was.
Amy Tan,I didn't fear failure. I expected failure.
Amy Tan,I also thought of playing improvisational jazz and I did take lessons for a while. At first I tried to write fiction by making up things that were completely alien to my life.
Amy Tan,"God, life changes faster than you think."
Amy Tan,"It's a luxury being a writer, because all you ever think about is life."
Amy Tan,"I did not lose myself all at once. I rubbed out my face over the years washing away my pain, the same way carvings on stone are worn down by water."
Amy Tan,"Who knows where inspiration comes from. Perhaps it arises from desperation. Perhaps it comes from the flukes of the universe, the kindness of the muses."
Amy Tan,In America nobody says you have to keep the circumstances somebody else gives you.
Paul Tang,"Our patients know that we have access to the information we need to make the best possible medical decisions. Further, they appreciate having online access to their records."

Alex Tanguay,"A lot of the rules, at first I felt bad for the defensemen,"
Alex Tanguay,"Even though the potential is there, I don't think he was playing nearly as well as he's been this year. He's good saving the puck, and playing it too."
Alex Tanguay,"I watched the last couple days. It was good hockey. A lot of guys have their opinions about who should be on the team and who shouldn't. I have mine, some other guys have theirs. I get paid here, and I know what I have to do. I know I can do a lot more in the last 23 games, and it's time for me to play better."
Serj Tankian,"As a kid, you see something that you know in your heart is true. Its such a huge hypocrisy that it makes you think, Well, if this is a truth that I know about thats not officially accepted, at least in this country, then how many other truths are there that are under the surface that need to come out?"
Serj Tankian,"Forgivness is The ultimate sacrifice.Eloquence belongs, To the conqueror."
Serj Tankian,"Nations are like people. Once you understand the interactions between nations, it's easy to understand why things are done, in terms of foreign policy, in a certain way. But nations are not like people in the sense that we are cumulatively represented by others - and their interpretations of what our interests are may not be the same as what they really are. And that's what's dangerous, even in a democracy."
Serj Tankian,"those that have prescribed the solution through the good feeling of the music itself, like the Beatles and Bob Marley and Bob Dylan."
Serj Tankian,"That's been a strength in some ways, but it's also an understanding of the dynamics of music and the different beats and melodies that wouldn't be common to a non-Armenian."
Serj Tankian,"Iâ€™d rather let the music speak for itself,"
Serj Tankian,They're great songwriters in the tradition of the Beatles and Pink Floyd. Their songs are beautiful and filled with all sorts of wonderful textures. It's all very emotional and moving. It's the first outside project I've ever produced.
Serj Tankian,"There's a commonality there, a common denominator culturally,"
Serj Tankian,"I could definitely use a little time at home. It's been about two months on the road. The tour has gone really well, but I wouldn't mind coming home to relax for a little while."
Serj Tankian,"I've had people come up to me with the strangest interpretations of what lyrics might mean, and I'm like, 'You go! I never thought of that, but that works,' ... I think true art is a universal reflection, and true artists are just messengers of that reflection - or, at best, skilled presenters."
Serj Tankian,It was kind of luck or destiny that it ended up this way.
Serj Tankian,"Forgivness is The ultimate sacrifice. Eloquence belongs, To the conqueror."
Serj Tankian,"Making two possibilities a reality. Predicting the future of things we all know. Fighting off the diseased programming Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries. Science fails to recognise the single most Potent element of human existence. Letting the reigns go to the unfoldings faith, Science has failed our world. Science has failed our mother earth."
Serj Tankian,"It's got the whole melodic thing still, but it's little more progressive, a little more emotion here and there, ... But they both come from the same sessions."
Serj Tankian,"It was kind of luck or destiny that it ended up this way,"
Serj Tankian,"By allowing this vote, and allowing the will of Congress to be freely expressed, you will be doing the right thing morally and, at the same time, encouraging Turkey to deal honestly with its past and more openly with its future,"
Serj Tankian,Civilization is a failure. We need to think what we can do together in love and peace.
Serj Tankian,Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive.
Serj Tankian,"I'm not comfortable with just entertaining. Although I like entertaining, I also like bringing forward the truth of our times as minstrels used to in the old days."
Serj Tankian,It's probably a combination of personal and non-personal matters that have led us to where we are musically.
Serj Tankian,"People think our music's very aggressive or angry or whatever, and it's just the opposite, really... I like laughing. And I like being really calm before a show, and smiley."
Serj Tankian,I'd rather let the music speak for itself.
Deborah Tannen,Saying that men talk about baseball in order to avoid talking about their feelings is the same as saying that women talk about their feelings in order to avoid talking about baseball.
Deborah Tannen,"Many of us dismiss talk that does not convey important information as worthless - meaningless small talk if it's a social setting or empty rhetoric if it's public. Such admonitions as Skip the small talk,  Get to the point, or Why don't you say what you mean? may seem to be reasonable. But they are reasonable only if information is all that counts. This attitude toward talk ignores the fact that people are emotionally involved with each other and that talking is the major way be establish, maintain, monitor and adjust our relationships."
Deborah Tannen,"[T]he seeds of [the Argument Culture] can be found our classrooms, where a teacher will introduce an article or an idea . . . setting up debates where people learn not to listen to each other because they're so busy trying to win the debate."
Deborah Tannen,"The biggest mistake is believing there is one right way to listen, to talk, to have a conversation -- or a relationship."
Deborah Tannen,Saying that men talk about baseball in order to avoid talking about their feelings is the same as saying that women talk about their feelings in order to avoid talking about baseball
Deborah Tannen,"When people realize that in the long run you may be turning off the audiences more, even though they will look temporarily--in the end they turn away, we really need to develop other metaphors and not talk about two sides, but talk about all sides."
Deborah Tannen,"The biggest mistake is believing there is one right way to listen, to talk, to have a conversation - or a relationship."
Deborah Tannen,"For most women, the language of conversation is primarily a language of rapport: a way of establishing connections and negotiating relationships."
Deborah Tannen,We tend to look through language and not realize how much power language has.
Deborah Tannen,Each person's life is lived as a series of conversations.
Deborah Tannen,"Communication is a continual balancing act, juggling the conflicting needs for intimacy and independence. To survive in the world, we have to act in concert with others, but to survive as ourselves, rather than simply as cogs in a wheel, we have to act alone."
Deborah Tannen,"We all know we are unique individuals, but we tend to see others as representatives of groups."
Deborah Tannen,Part of the reason (motherly advice) bugs us as daughters is because our mothers are so powerful in our lives. They loom like giants. The reason mothers keep at it is because they're so powerless. They cannot get you to do what is so obvious to them you should do.
Deborah Tannen,Relationships are made of talk - and talk is for girls and women.
Deborah Tannen,Each underestimates her own power and overestimates the other's.
Carl Tannenbaum,We're nowhere near the same economy as we were in the 1970s. We're more service-based. We're much more energy efficient.

Mike Tannenbaum,He's been throwing. He's the same Chad we've all known since 2000. He's making good progress according to all our medical people. Whether or not he plays will be a coaching decision.
Mike Tannenbaum,"Our intention all along was to have Chad remain with the Jets and we never wavered from that. Chad is a courageous and talented leader. Throughout this process, he put the interests of the team ahead of his own, enabling us to reach an agreement on terms beneficial to both parties."
Mike Tannenbaum,"I had a great conversation with him. It was a private conversation, but he was very happy for me."
Henry Ossawa Tanner,"My efforts have been to not only put the Biblical incident in the original setting, but at the same time give the human touch which makes the whole world kin and which ever remains the same."
Henry Ossawa Tanner,My effort has been not only to put the Biblical incident in the original setting... but at the same time give the human touch to convey to my public the reverence and elevation these subjects impart to me.
Henry Ossawa Tanner,"Many of the artists who have represented Negro life have seen only the comic, ludicrous side of it, and have lacked sympathy with and appreciation for the warm big heart that dwells within such a rough exterior."
Henry Ossawa Tanner,"It seemed to me that this might be a great pageant, which would give a chance for a very interesting picture."
Henry Ossawa Tanner,I will preach with my brush.
Henry Ossawa Tanner,"I decided on the spot that I would be an artist, and I assure you, it was no ordinary artist I had in mind."
Henry Ossawa Tanner,"I believe the Negro blood counts, and counts to my advantage - though it has caused me at times a life of great humiliation and sorrow."

Ray Tanner,"I don't think we have awesome talent, but we have very good talent."
Ray Tanner,"I was impressed with the quality of Elon and I wasn't surprised by that. This was a good weekend for us to get better, and I think we learned a few things about this club. We won the series, but couldn't win them all but I look at it as a positive weekend."
Ray Tanner,"Alabama is really good. They have quality pitching, and have couple of guys in the bullpen, and their hitting has really, really picked up since the beginning of the year. Coach Wells and his guys have just gotten better and better since Day 1. They may have the best starters in the league."
Ray Tanner,We're trying to make some changes. We're at the point in the season that we need to get some quality innings.
Ray Tanner,Baseball's a tough game. We're making a lot of progress.
Ray Tanner,"He's a guy we sort of identified has the potential to eventually be a weekend guy or battle for some weekend innings. He makes a case for himself a little bit, but we're not making any changes right now. We're going to leave him where he is. But he's building a resume for himself."
Ray Tanner,Our pitchers once again did a great job.
Ray Tanner,"I just hate doubleheaders in general. But it had nothing to do with what happened today. We played a team today that's very, very good and we caught them at a time when they're playing their best baseball."
Ray Tanner,"He's been doing a good job for us. Beverly's been giving us five or six good innings each time, and we've been able to keep his pitch count down. He could go longer, but we want to make sure we use everybody in the bullpen and try not to wear ourselves down before the end of the year."
Ray Tanner,I told our guys after the game that for almost three weeks we've done almost everything in an execution situation to win the game. But tonight we just came up a little short.
Ray Tanner,"This is an outstanding class with numerous potential draft choices. The talent level in this group will make an immediate impact as we continue to compete for SEC championships, postseason NCAA berths and a return to the College World Series."
Ray Tanner,We were a little more comfortable offensively and we did swing the bats better. Baseball's a hard game and we have to be more comfortable when we play it. Scoring early today helped us relax a little bit.
Ray Tanner,"We were patient and got some walks and didn't strike out but once, so we took advantage of some things. Today we got some extra outs and were able to score guys that got on base other ways than with hits. We hit balls hard, but again we didn't have a lot to show for it."
Auggie Tantillo,The United States can no longer allow China to use predatory trade practices to destroy U.S. jobs and factories.
Auggie Tantillo,"These filings show the Chinese that if you don't make progress, we are going to exercise our rights. We are going to moderate trade."
Auggie Tantillo,Our understanding is that there was absolutely no progress. A mutual agreement does not appear to be on the cards in the near future.
Auggie Tantillo,This bilateral agreement represents a necessary and welcome step towards addressing China's unfair trade practices and highly disruptive levels of textile trade.

Lewis Tappan,The curiosity to see the prisoners appears to be unabated.
Lewis Tappan,"The Anti-Slavery public have generously responded to our appeal, and sent the means to enable us to fit them out well, to pay their passages, supply them with many useful articles and give the Missionaries money to sustain themselves for a while."
Lewis Tappan,The African prisoners are orderly and peaceable among themselves.
Lewis Tappan,"Indeed, the whole company, although thin in flesh, and generally of slight forms, and limbs, especially, are as good looking and intelligent a body of men as we usually meet with."
Lewis Tappan,"If you wish to draw off the people from a bad or wicked custom, you must beat up for a march; you must make an excitement, do something that everybody will notice."

Lewis Tappan,Most of the prisoners told the interpreter that they are from Mandingo.
Quentin Tarantino,"If there's another level of heaven, that's where I'm at,"
Quentin Tarantino,"His movie is called 'Planet Terror,' and mine is called 'Death Proof,' ... Mine is sort of a slasher film, but instead of a knife, it's a car. ...

Quentin Tarantino,"If I really considered myself a writer, I wouldn't be writing screenplays. I'd be writing novels."

Booth Tarkington,"Boyhood is the longest time in life for a boy. The last term of the school-year is made of decades, not of weeks, and living through them is like waiting for the millennium."
Booth Tarkington,An ideal wife is any woman who has an ideal husband.
Booth Tarkington,Cherish all your happy moments: they make a fine cushion for old age
Donna Tartt,"You are - all your experience just kind of accumulates, and the novel takes a richness of its own simply because it has the weight of all those years that one's put into it."
Donna Tartt,"When I'm writing, I am concentrating almost wholly on concrete detail: the color a room is painted, the way a drop of water rolls off a wet leaf after a rain."
Donna Tartt,"Well, I do have some maiden aunts that are not quite like the aunts in the book, but I definitely do have a couple of them, and a couple of old aunties."
Donna Tartt,"To really be centered and to really work well and to think about the kinds of things that I need to think about, I need to spend large amounts of time alone."
Donna Tartt,"There's an expectation these days that novels - like any other consumer product - should be made on a production line, with one dropping from the conveyor belt every couple of years."
Donna Tartt,There's also a bit of family echo in the character of Harriet. Harriet is kind of a recurring state of mind in my mother's side of the family.
Donna Tartt,"The trick of creating character is to try to see all people, even unsympathetic ones, without projecting one's own personality and values on them."
Donna Tartt,The storytelling gift is innate: one has it or one doesn't. But style is at least partly a learned thing: one refines it by looking and listening and reading and practice - by work.
Donna Tartt,"The novel is about five students of classics who are studying with a classics professor, and they take the ideas of the things that they're learning from him a bit too seriously, with terrible consequences."
Donna Tartt,"The Little Friend is a long book. It's also completely different from my first novel: different landscape, different characters, different use of language and diction, different approach to story."
Donna Tartt,"The job of the novelist is to invent: to embroider, to color, to embellish, to entertain, to make things up. The art of what I do lies not in research or even recollection but primarily in invention."
Donna Tartt,The books I loved in childhood - the first loves - I've read so often that I've internalized them in some really essential way: they are more inside me now than out.
Donna Tartt,"Taking on challenging projects is the way that one grows and extends one's range as a writer, one's technical command, so I consider the time well-spent."
Donna Tartt,Storytelling and elegant style don't always go hand in hand.
Donna Tartt,Sometimes you can do all the right things and not succeed. And that's a hard lesson of reality.
Donna Tartt,"So I'm not a Southern writer in the commonly held sense of the term, like Faulkner or Eudora Welty, who took the South for their entire literary environment and subject matter."
Donna Tartt,"People always want to call me a Southern writer but though I grew up in the South, I don't feel that the label quite fits my work."
Donna Tartt,"On the other hand, I mean, that is what writers have always been supposed to do, was to rely on their own devices and to--I mean, writing is a lonely business."
Donna Tartt,My novels aren't really generated by a single conceptual spark; it's more a process of many different elements that come together unexpectedly over a long period of time.
Donna Tartt,"It's hard for me to show work while I'm writing, because other people's comments will influence what happens."
Donna Tartt,"In order for a long piece of work to engage a novelist over an extended period of time, it has to deal with questions that you find very important, that you're trying to work out."
Donna Tartt,"I've written only two novels, but they're both long ones, and they each took a decade to write."
Donna Tartt,I'd rather write one good book than ten mediocre ones.
Donna Tartt,I think it's hard to write about children and to have an idea of innocence.
Donna Tartt,I think innocence is something that adults project upon children that's not really there.
Donna Tartt,I really do work in solitude.
Donna Tartt,"I love the tradition of Dickens, where even the most minor walk-on characters are twitching and particular and alive."
Donna Tartt,"I just finished writing an essay about William Maxwell, an American writer whose work I admire very much."
Donna Tartt,"I believe, in a funny way, the job of the novelist is to be out there on the fringes and speaking for an experience that has not really been spoken for."
Donna Tartt,Everything takes me longer than I expect. It's the sad truth about life.
Donna Tartt,Children love secret club houses. They love secrecy even when there's no need for secrecy.
Donna Tartt,Children have very sharp powers of observation - probably sharper than adults - yet at the same time their emotional reactions are murky and much more primitive.
Donna Tartt,Children - if you think back really what it was like to be a child and what it was like to know other children--children lie all the time.
Donna Tartt,"Character, to me, is the life's blood of fiction."
Donna Tartt,"But romantic vision can also lead one away from certain very hard, ugly truths about life that are important to know."
Donna Tartt,"But it's for every writer to decide his own pace, and the pace varies with the writer and the work."
Donna Tartt,"Actually, I enjoy the process of writing a big long novel."
Antonio Tarver,"It is with great regret that I must inform you that I have concluded that the best route for me and my family is to fight Glen Johnson on December 18, 2004,"
Antonio Tarver,"When I show up ready and prepared, I'm undefeated. I've never lost. I'm hard-headed in some ways and have to learn my lesson the hard way, ... It's the best lesson learned, unfortunately, but it costs you."
Antonio Tarver,"I got a question, ... Do you got any excuses tonight, Roy?"
Antonio Tarver,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Do you have any excuses tonight Roy Jones? And seven punches later - seven is the number of completion - seven punches later is Roy Jones no more. So you have to look back, it's a powerful, powerful statement. I told Roy Jones when he was the heavyweight champion, You're not even the best fighter in Florida. And I got to prove it. So it's a spiritual thing when you think about it, man. And I'm just so thankful. Going through the transition from amateur to the pros - they can't deny me no more. I refuse to be denied. And I told the world that it will recognize, before it's all over, they will recognize. And now they do."
Nina Tassler,"The truth is, you can't sort of bottle and prepackage a show like Desperate Housewives. But I think the nice thing is, we know that audiences are making a commitment to serialized drama. And absolutely, we're going to continue to develop in that genre."
Nina Tassler,"We trust our producers to be creative in their storytelling and follow their creative path,"
Nina Tassler,"These series are the foundation of a schedule that is broader and deeper than any on television. From the start of the night through 11PM, from Monday through Sunday, CBS is populated with successful programs on every night and in every time period - many of which are number one in their time period, and some even number one on the entire night."

Nina Tassler,Survivor' is that rare television breed -- a show with seemingly endless audience appeal. Part of that is testament to a concept with inherent drama that features different faces and places; the other part is the ability of Mark Burnett and his talented team to inject new ideas and new wrinkles to keep the format fresh.

Nina Tassler,"As long as there is a way to keep the audience current or refreshed in terms of the events in a character's life, they'll stay connected."
Nina Tassler,"I?m part Latin, so everything in the Latin culture is ? there?s a lot of hyperbole and there?s a lot of melodrama. I think we?re going to modify it for our audiences."
Nina Tassler,"Comedy was really our first priority heading into development season, and we wanted to reinforce Monday. And with Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jenna Elfman, we have two big star vehicles for midseason."

Nina Tassler,"Our attitude is: There is something for everybody, and the audience seems to be onboard,"
Nina Tassler,"We're going back to our original form. . . . We know that our audience loves that brand. We just tried something different, and we're going back to what I think everybody is really looking forward to."
Geoff Tate,"I worked over the last year and a half with a Hollywood screenwriter named Mark Shepherd. He developed a screenplay out of the story. It's incredible; I hope that it can be made into a movie soon. Our agency is shopping it around Hollywood. I think it's going to be an incredibly powerful film. It starts with one part, and then we have plans for a sequel as well."
Geoff Tate,"We are sorry to lose Mark as he is a superb person, with extraordinary skill, experience and integrity. We understand corporate conflicts have arisen for Mark at his company that were not foreseeable at the time of his appointment. While we regret his decision to withdraw from the board, we nevertheless defer to his judgment as to the need to do so."
Geoff Tate,The business climate in 2001 was marked by an extreme decline in memory prices and a very difficult economic environment.
Geoff Tate,"At the beginning, it can be devastating. But to be honest, you learn more from a bad set than you do from a good set; if you never have a bad set, you never get better. Sometimes they just don't get you, and sometimes you have to be able to adjust."
Tomi Taterka,The market reached a saturation of sales.
Tomi Taterka,The market's weak without much attraction. We didn't get the news about the debt swap that everybody was waiting for.
Tomi Taterka,"The market could see some profit taking, but it is showing a certain consistency. It is staying above water and volume is rising."
Lofa Tatupu,"It's easier to get 11 guys on the same page and not having to worry about hanging on to the ball. On defense, above all, you got to love to run and hit."
Lofa Tatupu,He is somebody you really have to worry about and you have to know where he is at all times.
Lofa Tatupu,I think it kind of got out of sight by going there. And that's why I wanted to transfer to a Division I team. Then it became a reality.
Lofa Tatupu,"I would like to say that's all I know. But like I said, situation, circumstances, they worked well for me and I am just grateful to be here."
Lofa Tatupu,I just couldn't believe it. I am just grateful and very thankful that I am to represent the Seahawks with all the other guys.
Diana Taurasi,"I really don't care about scoring as long as we win, ... That's all that gets us going is winning. It doesn't matter how many points you score. If you have a 'W,' you did your job."
Diana Taurasi,"I'm not surprised because obviously he deserved it for a while now. But just for him to actually be told he's actually in the Hall of Fame, I think, means a lot to everybody. When we all found out (Saturday) morning, we all got a smile on our face. We're just happy for him because he does so much for us and for the game and for Connecticut that it really is a great honor for him that he deserves."
Diana Taurasi,"The bottom line is we've got good basketball players so we make good basketball decisions and play really good basketball and we just got to keep that same focus and intensity,"
Audrey Tautou,"I'm not sure I'm quite ready to have someone be a prospector of jobs for me, because I believe there's some kind of destiny involved with meeting people... some things are just meant to happen."
Audrey Tautou,I never want to do the same things twice. I like surprises.
Audrey Tautou,"I don't know where I'm going to be in three years. Because I have the feeling that the future is so full of possibilities, to stop being an actress, to do something else... for me, the future is just a huge bunch of discoveries."
Audrey Tautou,"After each experience, you grow up, you get enriched with something, and you don't know how you're going to be in six months, you don't know what you're going to want, what you're going to need."
Audrey Tautou,"I wouldn't mind being in an American film for a laugh, but I certainly don't want to be in Thingy Blah Blah 3, if you know what I mean."
Audrey Tautou,"In France we have a law which doesn't allow the press to publish a photo that you didn't approve. It lets the paparazzi take the picture, but if they publish this picture, you have the choice to sue the newspaper. So me, I always sued them."
Audrey Tautou,"People in France are very intrusive when they recognize you. In New York, they are very polite, with quick words, so it's great."
Audrey Tautou,"When I wanted to do this job it was for making movies not for the glitter. Of course with the fame I got more offers from different countries so it is great to have huge luxuries for an actor to work and to have the choice. But after, in life, I can't enjoy anonymity. But I can hide myself."
Julian Tavarez,"This past year I couldn't wait to get to Spring Training, to get another shot, ... I'm not looking to be the division or National League champion. I am just looking to be the World Series champion. That's what I am looking for now with my older age. Hopefully, it will happen this year."
Julian Tavarez,"Of course I would like to stay here. It's not fun, I can tell you that, playing one year here and one year there. I just hope they can bring me back, but if they don't I guess I'll have to go someplace else."
Julian Tavarez,"I'm not a fighting guy. I get along with my teammates and everybody, but when you're on the field, things happen. Then people see you as a bad guy, a very emotional guy. I'm very calm, but when you're on the field, little things can go south."
Julian Tavarez,"I?m not a fighting guy. I get along with my teammates and everybody. When you?re on the field, things happen. People say ?you?re a bad guy, a very emotional guy.? They don?t see what kind of person you are, they see the reaction. I?m a very calm person, but when we?re on the field, little things like that get big."
Julian Tavarez,"It was my choice. I wanted to be able to pitch. They said they could give you shots to numb it and you'll be able to pitch and I said OK. The hand is fine, I still have five fingers, I just don't think about it."
Andy Taylor,Premiering the show online a week before its television transmission is a first for Channel 4 and what better show could we start with than this? The IT Crowd is a surreal look at the underclass of a company and we're giving people the chance to see it first.
Andy Taylor,"In the end, she (Stovall) did justice."
Andy Taylor,Everybody around this table has been hurt (by canker). We need to look beyond the four corners of this table.
Andy Taylor,"[Mobile TV] offers hugely exciting opportunities for viewers, but in order to create a truly first-class service we need greater insight into what consumers actually want, ... This trial will help us to develop an offering that genuinely serves viewers by providing content and services to mobile phones that can be watched when and how our viewers want it."
Bill Taylor,He accepted responsibility for his conduct.
Bill Taylor,"They've pre-positioned a lot of stocks of food and water and medicine, ... They have been preparing to start up on small reconstruction projects, in particular those that will restore essential services."
Bill Taylor,"It's long hours, it means giving up holidays with your family for what's not a really lucrative job. But at least you have the satisfaction of creating something beautiful."
Bill Taylor,It's not child's play. It comes from a warrior culture where people are coming from the harshest conditions. One of the reasons that the traditions are so powerful is that it's a direct response to the impoverished conditions they live in.
Brian Taylor,"It's all heart, I give all the credit to these kids for the win."
Brian Taylor,A lot of people think it's not hard work.

Brian Taylor,Confidentiality is huge out here and we have unique challenges that make this a good fit.
Cecil Taylor,"See I'm not interested in appealing to the larger masses of people, because what the White man shows us is that he will do anything to make money."
Cecil Taylor,"To me, the piano in itself is an orchestra."
Cecil Taylor,"If you take the creation of music and the creation of your own life values as your overall goal, then living becomes a musical process."
Cecil Taylor,Rhythm is the life of space of time danced through.
Cecil Taylor,I discovered very early that it wasn't quite enough for me to imitate people.

Dave Taylor,"You used to need a high school degree to get a decent job, but now that's changed to a (post-secondary) degree or trades ticket. Perhaps we have to change our perspective and funding to meet that new requirement."
Dave Taylor,This conference is long overdue. The staggering progress in PC rendering and simulation technology that has been relentlessly driven by the game industry for years is now poised to turn the entire adult entertainment industry on its ear.
Dave Taylor,"We assured the fire department that if there's anything they need the city will step forward and help them, ... I have confidence that John Callaghan will be a good chief -- he's experienced and I believe he will serve the city well as acting fire chief."
Dave Taylor,This will enable enterprises to quickly integrate Intel-based Macs into their existing environment with minimal impact.
Dave Taylor,A lot of other places I've worked at are incredibly ego-driven.
Dave Taylor,"We are aware of Anze's desire to play at least one more year in Europe this coming season, ... He has a very good development situation in Sodertalje and it is quite probable he will be assigned back to Sweden."
Dave Taylor,I truly believe that the culture we've generated in the past 50 years positions us for a bright future.

He is a very gifted offensive player who, at just 23 years of age, has already made significant contributions to our organization.

Dave Taylor,We felt this was the appropriate course of action.
David Taylor,"The residence is a national demonstration model offering affordable, safe housing with an array of support services for both the grandparents and their grandchildren,"
David Taylor,There should not be a problem. I have got a security system and shutters which will hopefully take care of that.
David Taylor,"The standard practice of a not-for-profit operation is that service fees are not refunded, but the face value of a ticket is, ... Funding for the arts has gone down, as everyone knows, and so it's used as a contribution, for lack of a better term."
David Taylor,The effectiveness of that is in question. You need to reconnect the training to actual Pennsylvanians in actual jobs. There is a more pressing need to upgrade the training of the existing workforce so that they have the cutting-edge skills and are keeping up with the technology.
David Taylor,"I have a job,"
David Taylor,You can't put a price on that kind of publicity. There aren't many tournaments that give a golf course national attention for a whole week. This is one of them.

Elizabeth Taylor,"She belongs to a Temperance Society and wears one of those badges in the shape of a bow of ribbon to show that she would never take a drink, not even brandy if she were dying. Of course by temperance they all mean the opposite - total abstinence."
Elizabeth Taylor,"Some guys yells out, 'Why are you here promoting your perfume when your mother is in the hospital dying?' She burst into tears and ran off the stage. He got the reaction he wanted."

Fred Taylor,"If we can develop a better sense of discipline, I think we'll be fine, including myself. I'm not just talking about one individual, just the whole team."
Fred Taylor,"As much bad stuff as they say about (Coughlin), I'll give him that much. You take away the little nitpicky things, but he wanted to win. You can't get upset about him being passionate for wanting to win. Guys were ticked off at him, but somehow you developed that sense of passion, too. We didn't feel (his tactics) were necessary, but you were scared to go out. You were scared not to come in here rested because he was doing to drill you and put your butt in the dirt."
Fred Taylor,"As much bad stuff (as) they say about T.C., I'll give him that much. You take away the little nitpicky things, but he wanted to win.

Fred Taylor,"And it is in fact changing in the direction towards being more like Venus, more CO2 (carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere, higher temperatures. Iâ€™m not saying the Earth will ever become as extreme as Venus, but itâ€™s moving in that direction."
Fred Taylor,"The point is, we're moving in that direction and many of the constituents and mechanisms involved are the same. Even a few degrees change in temperature can be a disaster on Earth."

Jack Taylor,The group consists of a bunch of young and inspired musicians who are enthusiastic about learning how to play good jazz.
Jack Taylor,"I am very disappointed, ... More jobs mean more people, and that equates to more housing and more retail sales. Stagnation in the local economy means no prosperity. I and many others, particularly Colleen Towns, worked very hard and did an excellent job representing the City of Liberal."
Jack Taylor,"Weiskopf is a great musician with good communication skills, something most jazz musicians have a lack thereof."
Jack Taylor,"I have been to a lot of college banquets and you couldn't get a better lineup of people coming to this, because they believe in the concept and they believe in the program themselves. Just take a look at the people who are handing out awards and the emcee."

James Taylor,"Yes, but it's my life has been wasted, And I have been the fool, To let this manufacturer use my body for a tool, I can ride home in the evening, Staring at my hands, Swearing by my sorrow that a young girl, Ought to stand a better chance, So may I w"

Jason Taylor,"I'm not a Patriots fan, either. I know I sound like one [but] I tell everyone not to sleep on the Patriots in the playoffs."
Jason Taylor,There's a lot of guys that haven't been here in years past for all the streaks and the things we've had going on with them. There's an obvious rivalry there that adds to it a little bit. ... But the way that we approach each game will be the same way regardless of who the opponent is.
Jason Taylor,"It was a mistake by me,"
Jason Taylor,"If I was a betting man, I'd bet on them being in Detroit."
Jason Taylor,"I'm good now, ... I'm back among the living."
Jason Taylor,"That's not the team that they are. We are rivals. We do have a bad history against each other, but that's a team that I have always respected and they play well. Herm knows what he is doing up there. What they did Sunday was an aberration. It won't happen again."
Jason Taylor,"We saw him in college down here, and he's been doing a great job in the league,"
Jason Taylor,"I don't know what they're going to do. It's going to be a tough choice who they keep and who they don't. We've got a bunch of veterans I know they're going to keep. After that, it's going to be difficult."
Jermain Taylor,Every boxer that puts on the gloves dreams of someday hearing the words 'and new champion...'
Jermain Taylor,"That fight was way too close for comfort,"
Jermain Taylor,"To me, he's not a true champion,"
Jermain Taylor,"I don't know if it's his age, ... I think it's his skills, period. He has nothing left."
Jim Taylor,"In the early stages of wealth, up to 10 years after individuals became very rich, they display a bit of reluctance to spend money. It's a lot easier rationalizing spending a lot for a house."
Jim Taylor,"The surveys are really trying to understand what our existing spending habits are and what's the base we have to work from,"
Jim Taylor,We have not cut any sports. We are going to do everything we can to keep from cutting any programs at all.

Jim Taylor,"Offering our more dramatically styled, greatly refined and higher performance all-new Escalade at a starting price equal to the current generation Escalade should certainly attract luxury consumers' attention and help Cadillac continue to dominate the large luxury utility segment. The new 2007 Escalade boldly begins the next phase of Cadillac's renaissance."
Jim Taylor,"You have to have a love for the game. I always have. Shoot, my dad was 50 years old and out here playing tackle football with us when I was younger."
Jim Taylor,We're all having a good feeling about 2006. There are lots of fun things to do in this city and in Cobb County.
Ken Taylor,"We are pleased with the financial performance and operational improvements that are demonstrated by our first quarter financial results, ... Our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential revenue growth and net earnings in the quarter of $2.8 million reflect a continuation of the momentum that was generated last fiscal year and put the company on pace to achieving our annual guidance."
Ken Taylor,"We've had a number of people calling us and giving us descriptions,"
Ken Taylor,"It's hard to believe it unless you see it, everything is completely wiped out."
Lisa Taylor,"Even without her running abilities, Annie would have many options at some of the nation's finest universities because she's very strong academically and has had a wealth of community involvement through volunteering."
Lisa Taylor,We'll have a magician who teaches the magic tricks and shows how they involve science.
Lisa Taylor,"She stated that she wanted a pastor to pray with her so she could thank God for saving her life, ... She's 8 years old. Isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever heard?"
Lisa Taylor,"It takes a lot of planning. It involves teachers, staff, parents, students, alumni and a lot of business who donate a lot of services."
Martin Taylor,"I stand 100 per cent by those [reports]. Show me a better way to work and I'll do it. The way the analyst community works is, you have to pay them."
Martin Taylor,"Internally, we have got a strategy for all of our products of how we deliver value to customers via the cloud. Stage two is how we monetise that value. If we are number one on delivering that value and delivering customer satisfaction, that is a good definition of winning."
Martin Taylor,"Microsoft continues to be open to working with partners and competitors, alike, to jointly commission research that helps all our customers engage in an informed and respectful debate on the facts."
Mary Taylor,"If she could get work in Roanoke comparable to what she could get there, she'd be here. I think that goes for a lot of people. I think we need to provide more upscale jobs to keep our young people in Roanoke."
Mary Taylor,The purpose of the forums is to stimulate thinking and discussion about how communities can incorporate innovation and technology as components of their economic growth strategies.
Mary Taylor,The kids on this team have a lot of heart and motivation to succeed.
Mary Taylor,All three singles played great (Monday). I thought both teams played well. It was a fun match.
Mary Taylor,"We're fortunate that we had family to help us evacuate. If not for them, we'd probably be in a shelter somewhere with all those other people. My father wired us money from Maine and Robert's grandparents and parents also wired us money for the trip. Everybody in the family wanted us to leave Gulfport."
Mick Taylor,The one thing perhaps I do regret is not making more albums. I have written a lot of music that should be recorded... that will be recorded.
Mick Taylor,The most important thing is to follow your instinct and get involved with some friends who have similar tastes and aspirations and like music as much as you do.
Mick Taylor,I've never stopped learning.
Peter Taylor,It'll be a great opportunity for the players involved.
Peter Taylor,"It was a great game at Hull, we had a tremendous night but conceded a late goal when we should have beaten them,"
Peter Taylor,The exchange we had was quite funny. Iain said his player had been elbowed and I said 'no way.' But I think they do try to waste time. If they have done it today then they have probably done it before.
Peter Taylor,"Environment Australia will now move to the next stage of the process and I look forward to further cooperation and negotiations with stakeholders, in particular, the fishing industry,"
Peter Taylor,It's going to be a big test but the boys will be resting up in preparation for it.
Randy Taylor,"Greg was the bridge in the program. He was a bridge to the past from our state championship years to now. He's a warrior. He makes mistakes sometimes, but that's because he's always going 100 percent and doing whatever he can to help his team win."
Randy Taylor,We were dressing nine or 10 kids on the whole roster. But I think that helped him. At the JV level there is no pressure. He could just go out and play his game and since then we have actually seen him elevate his game.
Randy Taylor,We had a lot of young guys play tonight and our execution wasn't that good. It's tough when you start off by giving up 14 points.
Randy Taylor,We're a company that's built on brands.
Randy Taylor,"We, of course, want to raise awareness, but we also want to raise funds so we can help find a cure for this disease and improve people's quality of life."

Robert Taylor,Here's a picture of the singlewide trailer we were living in.
Robert Taylor,The University is beholden to follow New York State law.
Robert Taylor,There's nothing closer to indoor golf than here in November and December because you have that air conditioned air feel with no bugs and no wind. It literally feels like you're playing in a dome. It's that good.
Robert Taylor,"We brought everything we have, so it's a much heavier load to carry, but it's a much more enjoyable experience."
Robert Taylor,"They would like to see the Burmese economy develop more rapidly and more effectively, so they could make more money."
Robert Taylor,Ashley also played really outstanding defense (at second base). The defense played well and our pitching was good.
Robert Taylor,The idea of Internet control is an oxymoron.
Steve Taylor,"We're extremely optimistic [about the game]. Early sales look great, and it's extremely popular."
Steve Taylor,it's going to be a benefit to everyone.
Steve Taylor,"Since meeting Tony Jones in April 2002, BLBC has been able to provide tangible support from initial business planning advice through to interventions aimed at developing an investment ready business plan suitable for a high growth start up business."
Susan Taylor,"When it comes to security, McDowell is at the top of the list of the worst places, just because the courthouse is so open and there are so many entrances, ... In other counties where there is no security, everyone is confined to a smaller space."
Susan Taylor,"He was very concerned about atomic science, ... He took one of the first classes ever offered in the subject. It was then that he became concerned about the long-term effects of science - after all, you can't undo an A-bomb."
Susan Taylor,"The research being discussed here is critical to solving the problems affecting millions of consumers and patients worldwide, ... L'Oreal is helping to focus the rigorous science of skin and hair on the needs of ethnic people. This science improves our knowledge of skin and hair diseases, treatments and products. This exciting meeting lays critical groundwork for the future."
Susan Taylor,"Ron loved his time at GW, ... It's an honor for us to be near the school."
Susan Taylor,Thoughts have power; thoughts are energy. And you can make your world or break it by your own thinking.
Susan Taylor,Seeds of faith are always within us; sometimes it takes a crisis to nourish and encourage their growth.
Susan Taylor,Use missteps as stepping stones to deeper understanding and greater achievement.
Tim Taylor,No one is happy. No one (has) a smile on his face.
Tim Taylor,I personally believe that the budget has areas that are questionable. It is the staff's responsibility to look at that and back it down.
Tim Taylor,"Absolutely. This was about pride and it showed our players that if we work hard in all aspects of the game, good things happen and you have good outcomes."
Tim Taylor,"These road trips are not easy. They wear on you and go into the next week of practice. You don't want to blame things on outside [factors], but the road might have something to do with it."
Tim Taylor,"We had the game in our hands with seven seconds left. If we don't make mistakes, we win."
Tim Taylor,It is a matter of Iowa code and following the law of the state. There are due process procedures outlined for disciplinary action and termination.
Tim Taylor,I saw some improvement tonight defensively. I don't think anybody really had an outstanding individual performance but I think as a team we got better tonight.
Tim Taylor,"It's deflating, absolutely. I'm not going to say it doesn't hurt. It does."
Tim Taylor,It's hard. You have the hype and you sit there.
Tim Taylor,"We're not getting any less scoring chances than when we were scoring 3.5 goals a game. We've had some injuries that have messed up the line combinations, but that is not an excuse. I think now sometimes it's a case of the guys squeezing on the stick a little too tight."
Tim Taylor,"We have (defensive) team goals, ... Our goals are stopping yards, stopping long drives and forcing turnovers."
Tim Taylor,That's why he was a spectacular force in the playoffs (in 2003-04). That's the guy we need.
Tim Taylor,"Last week we were set up for failure from the get go. We had three games in four nights. Monticello played really well. There guards really pushed us to the limits, but we need games like that. We need to be in those situations to understand how to win."
Tim Taylor,"He's coming into this knowing he'll be a fresh voice and pair of eyes in evaluations. I think he's going to be able to start from scratch, in terms of evaluations of goaltenders. Hopefully he'll allow us to make the right choices and select a starter."
Tim Taylor,"Without a doubt, I don't think we played very well. That may be a tribute to Heritage, I'm not real sure. We didn't play well."
Tim Taylor,"There's some questions surrounding both teams, no doubt. They'll be answered in the first round."
Tim Taylor,"It's all about intensity and discipline. If you don't want to work hard and do the little things it takes to be successful, you won't play. We're still working on that, but we've come a long way."
Tim Taylor,Dave is a very proud individual. He's a great character guy. It would be disrespectful to him if we let this be a distraction. He has instilled a good attitude within this hockey team - and that is to push forward. He would want us to get better and prepare for Friday's game.
Tim Taylor,"I watched him play for Russia in the [World Junior Championships in 2005] finals against Canada, and I didn't think he would make that much of an impact when he got over here. And obviously he has done that."
Tim Taylor,But I'm in my own bed at the end of every night. That wasn't always the case at Virginia. Life on the road doesn't allow it.
Wade Taylor,That's why I'm so happy and thankful that Tony took his time to host this.
Wade Taylor,"On paper, it looked like we would have a rough time, but these girls came to run today."
Wade Taylor,"When it comes to someone who wants to try and compete in everything, she is someone that is capable of doing that. She might even be as good if not a better athlete than some of our boys."
Julie Taymor,"One of the reasons I love to jump back and forth between mediums is that film does allow me to be more literal. I can go to the real place. I can go to the Coliseum, and I don't have to fake it."
Julie Taymor,"There's never been a woman that won it, so we don't know, there may never be. But there have not been that many women on Broadway directing, period."
Julie Taymor,"I had spent a lot of my life in other cultures. I spent four years in Indonesia. I traveled through Japan. ... I have seen theater practiced in these ways before: mask theater, puppet theater."
Julie Taymor,You program music with an image and then people are desensitized.
Julie Taymor,"You know, I went to Oberlin. At that time, grades were - you elected to have them or not. It was all of that era where grades were out the window. But I did very well in school. I didn't really study the arts; I practiced the arts."
Julie Taymor,"When I was thinking about The Lion King, I said, we have to do what theater does best. What theater does best is to be abstract and not to do literal reality."
Julie Taymor,What I don't have in theater is editing.
Julie Taymor,"We took Beowulf, the epic poem in Old English, and put it right together with John Gardner's contemporary retelling. If you bring it into today, we really feel that it has something very fresh to say now."
Julie Taymor,"We feel that Grendel is very, very potent as to where we are today, which may not be any different than where we were in the 10th Century."
Julie Taymor,There is incredible power in the arts to inspire and influence.
Julie Taymor,"Theater is far superior to film in poetry, in abstract poetry."
Julie Taymor,People will justify whatever for a good cause.
Julie Taymor,It's people who are repressed and cannot express their fears that are dangerous.
Julie Taymor,I'm not going to spend two years on a film or four years on an opera if I don't feel like I can put my own self into it. That doesn't mean it has to be about myself.
Julie Taymor,"I use cinematic things in a theatrical way on stage, and in film I use theatrical techniques in a cinematic way."
Julie Taymor,"I received from my experience in Japan an incredible sense of respect for the art of creating, not just the creative product. We're all about the product. To me, the process was also an incredibly important aspect of the total form."
Julie Taymor,"I really do believe that if you don't challenge yourself and risk failing, that it's not interesting."
Julie Taymor,I have never had a problem with people not being able to understand the words and the meanings in Titus.
Julie Taymor,"I have had a lot of experience directing actors so although this is my first feature film, it's certainly not my first time directing with big stars."
Julie Taymor,I have directed good actors and have gone through the process which is more detailed in theater in a way. You have to get people to stay for two or three hours in a performance. They need more talk and rehearsal than in films.
Julie Taymor,"I am, to be quite honest, sick of hero stories."
Julie Taymor,But I don't think there has ever been anything written on the nature of violent man as deep and as thorough as Shakespeare's Titus. I think it puts all modern movies and modern exploitations of violence to shame.
Julie Taymor,"And I just think that to introduce an unknown Shakespeare is thrilling, too - not to do Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet, to do the richer Shakespeare. People will come to this and not know the story."
Julie Taymor,"Americans in particular are myopic. They're not traveling as much. When you were a college student, the next thing you would do on graduation was to take a year off and travel. That's what I did. I went to Indonesia."
Julie Taymor,"After I had received the Watson Fellowship and had been two years in Indonesia on this traveling fellowship, I stayed to start my own theater company."
Julie Taymor,"We have often been attracted to the story of the other, the outcast. And he and I just loved working together, so it just kept happening, and our relationship is completely bound up with our work. We enjoy each other's art."
Grant Teaff,What will come out of this is there will be uniform rules set.
Grant Teaff,What will come out of this is there will be uniform rules set. What'll most likely happen is that they'll put in a rule: Here's the standard. You either accept it or you don't accept it. And I think nationally they'll accept it.
Grant Teaff,"The I-A coordinator jobs, in the last four or five years, primarily in the upper echelons, have escalated greatly (in salary). On the other hand, it's not all about the money. It's about opportunity. I don't think whether the salary is the same as a coordinator or not should deter people from considering it."
Sara Teasdale,And taken in exchange - my youth.
Sara Teasdale,No one worth possessing - Can be quite possessed

Sara Teasdale,"Though I know he loves me, tonight my heart is sad; his kiss was not so wonderful as all the dreams I had."
Sara Teasdale,It is strange how often a heart must be broken before the years can make it wise.
Sara Teasdale,I have no riches but my thoughts. Yet these are wealth enough for me.
Sara Teasdale,I found more joy in sorrow than you could find in joy.

Sara Teasdale,I shall make the most of all that comes: And the least of all that goes.
Sara Teasdale,Of my own spirit let me be in sole though feeble mastery.
Sara Teasdale,"There's nothing half so real in life as the things you've done... inexorably, unalterably done."
Sara Teasdale,"Then, like an old-time orator impressively he rose; I make the most of all that comes and the least of all that goes."
Sara Teasdale,Oh who can tell the range of joy or set the bounds of beauty?
Sara Teasdale,I make the most of all that comes and the least of all that goes.
Sara Teasdale,Wisdom is not acquired save as the result of investigation.
Sara Teasdale,"Beauty, more than bitterness, makes the heart break."
Sara Teasdale,I shall make the most of all that comes: And the least of all that goes
Sara Teasdale,"When I can look life in the eyes, grown calm and very coldly wise, life will have given me the truth, and taken in exchange - my youth."
Sara Teasdale,"Life has loveliness to sell, all beautiful and splendid things, blue waves whitened on a cliff, soaring fire that sways and sings, and children's faces looking up, holding wonder like a cup."
Sara Teasdale,Life is but thought.

Jeff Tedford,Each game we learn new things. By no means did we come close to our potential tonight.
Jeff Tedford,There's a lot of potential there. We have some skill and we have some holes to fill. The spring will be really important to us.
Jeff Tedford,"People have said he was injured (that night). It's unclear what type of injury, ... It was a scratch on his wrist, a little bitty scratch, it wasn't even bleeding ... None of our players have been implicated in any wrongdoing."
Jeff Tedford,"People have said he was injured (that night). It's unclear what type of injury. It was a scratch on his wrist, a little bitty scratch, it wasn't even bleeding ... None of our players have been implicated in any wrongdoing."
Jeff Tedford,"[1. The integrity of the polls comes into question. That Texas is playing in the Rose Bowl instead of Cal is not by itself an injustice. You can make plenty of arguments in favor of either 10-1 team. What is ridiculous is the way the Longhorns got in, sitting on their couch while Cal traveled across the country and won at Southern Miss -- but apparently not by enough for the tens of voters who moved Texas up and the Bears down in their final poll, knowing exactly what the ramifications were when they did it.] If you have to go in and blow people out, ... that doesn't serve the integrity of the game."
Jeff Tedford,Everybody enjoys being around him. He's got a great sense of humor and can always make people laugh.
Jeff Tedford,He was hounded hard by practically everyone.
Jeff Tedford,You cannot give them a short field. We've seen games where the score gets crazy early because they force turnovers down deep and score.
Jeff Tedford,We've lost quite a few guys but that's no excuse. Football is a rough game and we all have had our share of the injury bug.
Jeff Tedford,He has done well. He has a little bit of experience from those two games. It probably gave him a little boost of confidence coming into the spring.
Jeff Tedford,"Absolutely, ... It's one of those events you can mark off the checklist."
Jeff Tedford,Absolutely. It's one of those events you can mark off the checklist.
Jeff Tedford,I see a group that's playing with a lot of energy. They have a lot of passion for what they're doing. They fly around. They play very hard. It's obvious coach Zook has done a good job of creating a mind-set of enjoying playing the game.
Jeff Tedford,I think last year consistency was an issue with him.
Jeff Tedford,"Each game has a different set of circumstances,"
Jeff Tedford,He made some big plays on third down with his scramble ability and those were the things that we saw when we recruited Joe.
Mark Teixeira,"There's a ton of room for me to grow, ... I'm still working on a lot of things and trying to get better."
Mark Teixeira,"It's tough when your No. 2 starter goes down, and you trade the most popular guy in the clubhouse. A lot of things happen over the course of the year. Hopefully, good things will happen."
Mark Teixeira,"I want to win more than anybody. You put us up against the rest of the world, and I'm going to want to win even more."
Mark Teixeira,"When the swelling goes down and the pain goes down, we'll see how it goes."
Mark Teixeira,"It's a real honor to be included among the list of finalists, when you see the names that are there, ... Some of the guys who won the Hank Aaron Award in the past are thought of as some of the best players in the history of the game, so just to be included with those guys is really gratifying."
Mark Teixeira,"It doesn't mean that much unless the team wins, ... Individual goals are great, but when I'm watching the playoffs, it won't mean that much."
Mark Teixeira,"The way the first 10 games have gone, I've done a pretty good job of swinging at good pitches. That shows in the lack of strikeouts. Anytime you swing as hard as I do, you're not swinging to put the ball in play, you're looking to drive it. Anytime you do that, you're going to swing and miss. But if I swing at better pitches, my whole game will be better."
Mark Teixeira,It's great to be in a real game.
Mark Teixeira,"It's crazy and it's funny. It's an outrageous comment, an outrageous claim."
Mark Teixeira,It's not a fun process. There is no need for the team and a player to be on opposing sides a week or two before spring training. It's good to be on the same page.
Mark Teixeira,"David's my best friend on the team, a great teammate, a great player. Everyone's going to miss him. I guess you can never have too much pitching, but it's tough to lose David."
Mark Teixeira,"I'm still going to be playing baseball, still getting my work in. The team might miss me a little bit, but at the same time, when we get back, it will be like we've never left."
Mark Teixeira,"I'm always ready on Opening Day. It's been the weirdest Spring Training that I've ever had. The World Baseball Classic didn't help, but I feel great and my body feels great."
Mark Teixeira,Maybe that's it. Either that or there was a flaw or defect in the baseball. I hit it hard but ... I don't know if I could take credit for that.
Mark Teixeira,"There's a lot of talent around the world. Anybody playing major league baseball, you look to your left there might be a player from Korea, you look to your right there might be a player from the Dominican Republic or Mexico."
Mark Teixeira,"It's just about being in the zone, in any sport, be it football, basketball or baseball."
Edward Teller,"When you get to the end of all the light you know and it's time to step into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing that one of two things shall happen: either you will be given something solid to stand on, or you will be taught how to fly."

Edward Teller,"I tried to contribute to the defeat of the Soviets. If I contributed 1%, it is 1% of something enormous."
Edward Teller,The science of today is the technology of tomorrow.
Edward Teller,"A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty. A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective."

George Tenet,"lawless zones, veritable no man's lands ... where extremist movements find shelter and can win the breathing space to grow."
George Tenet,"If one side does something, and the other side does something within the span of a security meeting, we can say we are into Tenet."
George Tenet,rendered 70 terrorists to justice.
George Tenet,"Let me say this. I'm the Director of -- I'm the Director of Central Intelligence. The President of the United States sees me six days a week, every day. I tell him what the American intelligence community believes,"
George Tenet,raised several concerns about the fragmentary nature of the intelligence with National Security Council colleagues. Some of the language was changed.
George Tenet,"By no stretch of the imagination am I going to tell you that I've solved all the problems of the community in terms of integrating and in lashing it up, ... But we've made an enormous amount of progress."
George Tenet,"We know that they will continue to plan, ... We know that they will hurt us again. We have to minimize, we have to minimize, we have to minimize their ability to do so because there is no perfection in this business."
George Tenet,still dedicated to striking the U.S. homeland.
George Tenet,"I'm in the middle of a big debate,"
George Tenet,this is the largest release of formerly classified CIA documents ever. It reflects my commitment to be as forward-leaning as possible in releasing information that with the passage of time no longer needs to be protected.
George Tenet,"This did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches, and CIA should have ensured that it was removed,"

Lord Alfred Tennyson,"Locksley Hall Like a dog, he hunts in dreams"
Lord Alfred Tennyson,Like glimpses of forgotten dreams.
Lord Alfred Tennyson,More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.

Lord Alfred Tennyson,"I must lose myself in action, lest I wither in despair."
Lord Alfred Tennyson,"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
Lord Alfred Tennyson,The happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions.
Mother Teresa,There must be a reason why some people can afford to live well. They must have worked for it. I only feel angry when I see waste. When I see people throwing away things that we could use.
Mother Teresa,One must really have suffered oneself to help others.
Mother Teresa,"Smile at each other, smile at your wife, smile at your husband, smile at your children, smile at each other -- it doesn't matter who it is -- and that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other."
Mother Teresa,"The trouble is that rich people, well-to-do people, very often don't really know who the poor are; and that is why we can forgive them, for knowledge can only lead to love, and love to service. And so, if they are not touched by them, it's because they do not know them."
Mother Teresa,Don't let your sins turn into bad habits.
Mother Teresa,Anyone who truly loves God travels securely.
Mother Teresa,For prayer is nothing else than being on terms of friendship with God.
Mother Teresa,"Everybody today seems to be in such a terrible rush, anxious for greater developments and greater riches and so on, so that children have very little time for their parents. Parents have very little time for each other, and in the home begins the disruption of peace of the world."
Mother Teresa,I know the power obedience has of making things easy which seem impossible.
Mother Teresa,Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. A joyful heart is the inevitable result of a heart burning with love
Mother Teresa,"Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is a beauty, admire it. Life is a dream,realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game,play it. Life is a promise, fulfill it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, singit. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure,dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is life, fight for it!"
Mother Teresa,"Being unwanted, unloved, uncared for, forgotten by everybody, I think that is a much greater hunger, a much greater poverty than the person who has nothing to eat."
Mother Teresa,"There is hunger for ordinary bread, and there is hunger for love, for kindness, for thoughtfulness; and this is the great poverty that makes people suffer so much."
Mother Teresa,I know God will not give me anything I can't handle. I just wish that He didn't trust me so much.
Mother Teresa,It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving.
Mother Teresa,"There are no great things, only small things with great love. Happy are those."
Mother Teresa,Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.
Mother Teresa,"If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it."
Mother Teresa,"We, the unwilling,led by the unknowing,are doing the impossible for the ungrateful. We have done so much,for so long,with so little,we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."
Mother Teresa,"We can do no great things, only small things with great love."
Mother Teresa,"The success of love is in the loving - it is not in the result of loving. Of course it is natural in love to want the best for the other person, but whether it turns out that way or not does not determine the value of what we have done."
Mother Teresa,Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home.
Mother Teresa,"If we want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it."
Mother Teresa,"Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go."
Mother Teresa,We are all pencils in the hand of God.
Mother Teresa,"Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand."
Mother Teresa,Good works are links that form a chain of love.
Mother Teresa,"We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature -- trees, flowers, grass -- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence. We need silence to be able to touch souls."
Mother Teresa,It is not the magnitude of our actions but the amount of love that is put into them that matters.
Mother Teresa,The most terrible poverty is loneliness and the feeling of being unloved.
Mother Teresa,It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish.
Mother Teresa,God doesn't require us to succeed; he only requires that you try.
Mother Teresa,"Intense love does not measure, it just gives."
Mother Teresa,"I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love."

Mother Teresa,"Much more is accomplished by a single word of the Our Father said, now and then, from our heart, than by the whole prayer repeated many times in haste and without attention."

Mother Teresa,One of the greatest diseases is to be nobody to anybody.

Mother Teresa,"I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I don't know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will NOT ask, How many good things have you done in your life?, rather he will ask, How much LOVE did you put into what you did?"
Mother Teresa,"Everytime you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing."
Mother Teresa,I never add up. I only subtract from the total dying... . . . It is not the magnitude of our actions but the amount of love that is put into them that matters.
Mother Teresa,"People are unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered. Love them anyway."
Mother Teresa,"We can cure physical diesases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread, but there are many more dying for a little love>"
Mother Teresa,"I try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money. No, I wouldn't touch a leper for a thousand pounds; yet I willingly cure him for the love of God."
Mother Teresa,In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love
Mother Teresa,Do not think that love in order to be genuine has to be extraordinary. What we need is to love without getting tired. Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
Mother Teresa,"We ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But if that drop was not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be less because of that missing drop. I do not agree with the big way of doing things."
Mother Teresa,There is more hunger in the world for love and appreciation in this world than for bread.
Mother Teresa,"Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace. Money will come if we seek first the Kingdom of God --the rest will be given."
Mother Teresa,"We cannot do great things on this Earth, only small things with great love."
Mother Teresa,Peace begins with a smile.
Mother Teresa,"If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."
Mother Teresa,The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.
Mother Teresa,"Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love."
Mother Teresa,Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
Valentina Tereshkova,"I would not say that female cosmonauts are not welcomed in the Russian space program. I must say, however, that all spaceflight hardware, including spacesuits and spacecraft comfort assuring systems, were designed mostly by men and for men."
Valentina Tereshkova,"To tell her that I joined the parachute club was too hard for me. I didn't want to trouble her; besides, I was not completely sure about the success of my new adventure."
Valentina Tereshkova,I felt fine after 24 hours and asked the state commission to prolong my stay in space to three days. And I carried out the entire schedule. Could I have done that if I had been half-dead?
Valentina Tereshkova,"Again the pressure pushes me in the chair, shuts my eyes. I notice the dark red tongues of the flame outside the windows. I'm trying to memorize, fix all the feelings, the peculiarities of this descending, to tell those, who will be conquering space after me."
Bryn Terfel,Good acting is about being as natural and calm as possible. These days producers have such definite ideas that you have to be prepared to do whatever they ask.
Bryn Terfel,"I think every singer should be able to jump in for a singer who has been sick, for instance, and learn an opera in two days. I know people who can do it."
Bryn Terfel,"People think top singers are overpaid, but opera houses have a top fee, which is a good thing. Of course concerts are different- everyone wants to make as much money as possible."
Bryn Terfel,I work on my voice through what I have to sing.
Bryn Terfel,It was imperative when I started my training to have a teacher who would really look after whatever talent I had as a youngster.
Bryn Terfel,"I've asked Tom in the past, but I don't know what was wrong with him as Tommy boy didn't return any of my calls,"
Bryn Terfel,"If you have a recital to do, you have to memorize the songs. I never use music when I do recitals. It produces an instant barrier, both for yourself and the audience."
Bryn Terfel,"I know many people find Wagner boring, and I'm no different, but by not being pretentious I hope to make it accessible."
Bryn Terfel,I enjoy all aspects of singing and I'm luckily given the choice to be part of different styles of music.
Bryn Terfel,"I missed out on seeing my two boys being born, because of my profession, ... I was rehearsing 'Don Giovanni' in Salzburg when the first one was born, and I was in New York rehearsing 'Figaro' when the second was born."
Bryn Terfel,"They're big boys now. But they're getting older, so they don't need to be molly-coddled as much, and lifted up and down so."
Paul Tergat,Ask yourself: 'Can I give more?'. The answer is usually: 'Yes'.
Paul Tergat,It was my dream to race against Haile again. But to have started the race and then be forced to stop would not have made sense.
Paul Tergat,It was my dream to race against him again. But to start the race and be forced to stop wouldn't make sense. We are human and this is the human body. I have to accept it.
Paul Tergat,I had to give all that I had at the end. It was very hard.
Paul Tergat,"This is a wonderful way to wrap up the year. Yesterday was a dramatic, painful experience."
Paul Tergat,The foundation was born out of conviction that our society is rich in the potential found in its people.
Paul Tergat,I'm so disappointed. I have worked so hard for it and not to be in the action is cruel.
Studs Terkel,Most of us have jobs that are too small for our spirits.
Studs Terkel,"His ingenuity and his faith in the good taste of people are what made WFMT, ... He believed the public--and by that he meant ordinary people--deserved the best in broadcasting."
Studs Terkel,His ingenuity and his faith in the good taste of people are what made WFMT. He believed the public ? and by that he meant ordinary people ? deserved the best in broadcasting.
Studs Terkel,I'm seeing something and I'm not standing silent about it. Humans are pushed out to make room for cars.
Studs Terkel,"When you become part of something, in some way you count. It could be a march; it could be a rally, even a brief one. You're part of something, and you suddenly realize you count. To count is very important."
Studs Terkel,"We use the word 'hope' perhaps more often than any other word in the vocabulary: 'I hope it's a nice day.' 'Hopefully, you're doing well.' 'So how are things going along? Pretty good. Going to be good tomorrow? Hope so.'"
Studs Terkel,"That's why I wrote this book: to show how these people can imbue us with hope. I read somewhere that when a person takes part in community action, his health improves. Something happens to him or to her biologically. It's like a tonic."
Studs Terkel,"That's what we're missing. We're missing argument. We're missing debate. We're missing colloquy. We're missing all sorts of things. Instead, we're accepting."
Studs Terkel,So people are ready. I feel hopeful in that sense.
Studs Terkel,So here we are. We have a choice to make.
Studs Terkel,I hope for peace and sanity - it's the same thing.
Studs Terkel,I always love to quote Albert Einstein because nobody dares contradict him.
Studs Terkel,"But once you become active in something, something happens to you. You get excited and suddenly you realize you count."
Studs Terkel,Chicago is not the most corrupt American city. It's the most theatrically corrupt.
Studs Terkel,"Why are we born? We're born eventually to die, of course. But what happens between the time we're born and we die? We're born to live. One is a realist if one hopes."
Studs Terkel,"With optimism, you look upon the sunny side of things. People say, 'Studs, you're an optimist.' I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what's the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven."
Studs Terkel,"People are ready to say, 'Yes, we are ready for single-payer health insurance.' We are the only industrialized country in the world that does not have national health insurance. We are the richest in wealth and the poorest in health of all the industrial nations."
Studs Terkel,"I thought, if ever there were a time to write a book about hope, it's now."
Studs Terkel,I hope that memory is valued - that we do not lose memory.
Studs Terkel,You happen to be talking to an agnostic. You know what an agnostic is? A cowardly atheist.
Studs Terkel,"We are the most powerful nation in the world, but we're not the only nation in the world. We are not the only people in the world. We are an important people, the wealthiest, the most powerful and, to a great extent, generous. But we are part of the world."
Studs Terkel,"Nonetheless, do I have respect for people who believe in the hereafter? Of course I do. I might add, perhaps even a touch of envy too, because of the solace."
Studs Terkel,"If solace is any sort of succor to someone, that is sufficient. I believe in the faith of people, whatever faith they may have."
Studs Terkel,"I've always felt, in all my books, that there's a deep decency in the American people and a native intelligence - providing they have the facts, providing they have the information."
Studs Terkel,"I want, of course, peace, grace, and beauty. How do you do that? You work for it."
Studs Terkel,"I want to praise activists through the years. I praise those of the past as well, to have them honored."
Studs Terkel,I want people to talk to one another no matter what their difference of opinion might be.
Studs Terkel,I want a language that speaks the truth.
Studs Terkel,"I think it's realistic to have hope. One can be a perverse idealist and say the easiest thing: 'I despair. The world's no good.' That's a perverse idealist. It's practical to hope, because the hope is for us to survive as a human species. That's very realistic."
Studs Terkel,promising authors in a range of fields who share Studs' fascination with everyday life in America.
Kraig Terpstra,"To tell the truth, that's not even something we are focusing on. We might throw it in there as extra motivation, but this is a new season and we just look at it as a game we have to win."
Kraig Terpstra,"I don't know if it's ever happened where a school has gotten three players on the first team in this conference. That just shows you what type of balance we had on this team, and I'm very pleased for all the kids."
Kraig Terpstra,"We continually shot ourselves in the foot with mistakes. I'm stunned, and I have to take some of the blame."
Kraig Terpstra,"The kids played hard. This was a great opportunity for us to get some extended time for our bench, and they did well."
Kraig Terpstra,I thought the girls individually really picked up the slack with Katie out of the lineup. We showed a lot of intensity and played with enthusiasm.
Kraig Terpstra,The biggest key was the determination of the kids. You don't need to say much to them. They know when they're not playing well. We just picked up the pace.
Kraig Terpstra,"I was very pleased with what I saw today. We had some timely hitting and played good defense, and I think the kids are starting to gel as a group."
Kraig Terpstra,"Katie has great leadership ability, and did a great job of running our offense."
John Terry,I just tried to go in the dressing room to see him but security wouldn't let me.
John Terry,They've shown on TV four or five other clubs doing the same and there was no punishment. We've had 80% of our games on telly and it's been highlighted a little more.
John Terry,"He is a fantastic player -- he scored a great goal the other night and is going to be a threat. I hope, having played against him a couple of times, I'll know a bit about him and be able to stop him."
John Terry,I struggled... because my Mum and Dad didn't have any money. I had to borrow where I could for things like driving lessons.
John Terry,The players are still behind the manager. He's the man in charge. He picks the squad and the team and the players respect him.
John Terry,the worst I've ever felt after a football match.
John Terry,"I bought a few copies of the DVD and dished them out to the family. Obviously it was very pleasing to get the winner against such a great team, but the most important thing was to go through. It was fantastic for me."
John Terry,He's been different class ever since he came. He's slotted in perfectly. The lads get on very well with him.
John Terry,He's been a different class since he's been here. It was going to be difficult but he's fitted in with everyone and has been outstanding on the pitch.
John Terry,"We've got the Portuguese boys who have won a few things and the rest of us who are hungry for a taste of it. It's the right combination to win things. I think we are quite popular at the moment because people like to see a new team coming through, but maybe our aim is to be hated because we keep on winning."
Randall Terry,"In my wildest dreams, I could never have pictured this."
Randall Terry,You don't know how to love God and your neighbor unless you look to the law to define it.
Randall Terry,"What kind of America do people want to leave for their children? What horrors are down the road, stuff that was unthinkable 30 years ago?"
Randall Terry,"We are saved by grace, not by the works of the law. But don't be so quick to write the law off."
Randall Terry,"We are not at the same place we were in 1973. This country today is drifting, moving steadily towards the pro-life position because the data is with us."
Randall Terry,"The Law of God reaches into every area of life, and it brings about incredible blessing and incredible freedom."
Randall Terry,"The homosexual community has more acceptance in America than it ever has, and the suicide rate is as high as it's always been."
Randall Terry,"The government forces you to give your money to things you don't believe in, to have your money go to projects that might be inherently immoral."
Randall Terry,The early Church had nothing but the Old Testament. The New Testament lies hidden in the Old; the Old Testament lies open in the New.
Randall Terry,"Once you depart from the Ten Commandments, you have relativism, humanism, the abandonment of absolutes. You have anything. How long before child pornography is mainstream?"
Randall Terry,"Once you depart from the Ten Commandments as being the foundation of right and wrong, you are in a free fall."
Randall Terry,Most of the Ten Commandments are negative. The purpose of law is not to mandate good behavior. That concept comes from the French Revolution.
Randall Terry,It's interesting to note that all revolutionary literature was written by pastors. These guys were involved in a revolution against the mightiest power that the world had ever seen.
Randall Terry,"In a world without the law of God, you have chaos, oppression, tyranny, and everyone doing what is right in their own eyes."
Randall Terry,"If we don't believe in moral absolutes and then we get into a cultural-political debate, how are we going to win?"
Randall Terry,"If someone doesn't know their Old Testament, they don't know right doctrine, right correction, and they can't be equipped for good works."
Randall Terry,"If my duty does involve heralding His law in every arena, then the Church in America is failing radically today."
Randall Terry,"If it squares with the Scripture, then let's go. If it's in conflict with the Scripture, then it's heresy."
Randall Terry,"I've traveled all over the country for years speaking in churches, teaching the Ten Commandments. It's amazing if 2 percent of any congregation knows the Ten Commandments."
Randall Terry,"I have to believe that people can change, otherwise I deny the Gospel, and I will not do that."
Randall Terry,"I didn't run off with the secretary. It made it seem like I had committed adultery and then ran off with a secretary, neither of which happened."
Randall Terry,I believe that Clinton is the most wicked and vile President that this nation has ever had.
Randall Terry,"How long before we have, not just homosexual marriage, but homosexual unions between adult men and small boys?"
Randall Terry,Homosexuals reject the process of healing because it's too painful and time-consuming.
Randall Terry,He who frames the question wins the debate.
Randall Terry,Behaviors are a choice. Feelings are sometimes out of our control. Behavior has to do with choices.
Randall Terry,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
Nikola Tesla,Like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand the diagrams of my motor. A thousand secrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally I would have given for that one which I had wrestled from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence.
Nikola Tesla,"If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search.I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor."
Nikola Tesla,"Before I put a sketch on paper, the whole idea is worked out mentally. In my mind I change the construction, make improvements, and even operate the device. Without ever having drawn a sketch I can give the measurements of all parts to workmen, and when completed all these parts will fit, just as certainly as though I had made the actual drawings. It is immaterial to me whether I run my machine in my mind or test it in my shop. The inventions I have conceived in this way have always worked. In thirty years there has not been a single exception. My first electric motor, the vacuum wireless light, my turbine engine and many other devices have all been developed in exactly this way."
Nikola Tesla,"The spread of civilisation may be likened to a fire; First, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power."
Nikola Tesla,"I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything."
Nikola Tesla,"Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."
Nikola Tesla,"Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more."
Nikola Tesla,"The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane."
Nikola Tesla,"Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine."
Hashim Thaci,I am optimistic that this co-operation will help us to accelerate the process of determination of final status.
Hashim Thaci,The General Headquarters of the KLA at this moment is continuing its final discussions about the agreement.
Hashim Thaci,We will have an agreement very soon. We arrived at clear conclusions which are acceptable and they will get defined very clearly very soon.
Hashim Thaci,We have signed an agreement to bring peace to Kosovo. We hope that the force of the international community will make Yugoslavia sign. We say: the violence must stop.
John Thain,"It feels good. Now, of course, we have to demonstrate to our shareholders that there's real value to be had here."
John Thain,"I think there needs to be more consolidation in the U.S. marketplace, and we will be a public company with a public currency and a big marketplace."
John Thain,"Amy led the drive to improve efficiencies, modernized the exchange's financial systems and processes, and helped reinvent our business and pricing models. I am especially grateful to Amy for her invaluable work on the NYSE/ Archipelago merger."
Gagan Thapa,"The youth of Nepal have awakened in great numbers, we will continue our battle on the streets against monarchy. It's democracy that we strive for; victory no matter what. So support our movement."
Gagan Thapa,"Monarchy is the root cause of the crisis plaguing the country. Therefore, for the country to come out of this crisis, a complete demolition of monarchy is a must. Only then is a solution possible."
Gagan Thapa,We want the end of autocratic monarchy and there should be no compromise with the King.
Shashi Tharoor,"We need to scale up what exists in Africa, in various parts of Asia. There has been remarkable progress in China and that's a reflection of the booming economy there, there's been less of that progress elsewhere."
Shashi Tharoor,"In the modern globalizing world, information sows the seeds of prosperity, and those who are without access to information are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to building a better future for themselves and for their children."
Shashi Tharoor,"This week's summit will be the single largest gathering of world leaders in human history. If world leaders rise to their responsibilities, the rebirth and renewal of the UN will be at hand. With its renewal, we will also renew our hope for a fairer and safer world."
Shashi Tharoor,"The exhibition serves as a poignant caution to us all to remember the base savagery of which human beings are capable, and as a call to arms to ensure that we all act to prevent such horrors."
Twyla Tharp,"Dance has never been a particularly easy life, and everybody knows that."
Twyla Tharp,"With each piece I've completed I have worked to make it intact, and each of them has been an equal high. It's like children. A mother refuses to pick out one as a favorite, and I can't do any better with the dances."
Twyla Tharp,"There's this expression called postmodernism, which is kind of silly, and destroys a perfectly good word called modern, which now no longer means anything."
Twyla Tharp,"In those days, male dancers were a rarer breed than women. as they are still today, A good male dancer, one as strong as we were, was very difficult to come by if you couldn't afford to pay them."
Twyla Tharp,"I'm not one who divides music, dance or art into various categories. Either something works, or it doesn't."
Twyla Tharp,"I would have to challenge the term, modern dance. I don't really use that term in relation to my work. I simply think of it as dancing. I think of it as moving."
Twyla Tharp,"I was privileged to be able to study a year with Martha Graham, the last year she was teaching."
Twyla Tharp,I thought I had to make an impact on history. I had to become the greatest choreographer of my time. That was my mission. Posterity deals with us however it sees fit. But I gave it 20 years of my best shot.
Twyla Tharp,I think people want very much to simplify their lives enough so that they can control the things that make it possible to sleep at night.
Twyla Tharp,"I started formal piano training when I was 4. From there I had little violas, and I had dancing lessons of every sort and description, and painting lessons. I had German. And shorthand."
Twyla Tharp,"I often say that in making dances I can make a world where I think things are done morally, done democratically, done honestly."
Twyla Tharp,"I never studied with Balanchine, but his work was very important to me."
Twyla Tharp,I learned very early that an audience would relax and look at things differently if they felt they could laugh with you from time to time. There's an energy that comes through the release of tension that is laughter.
Twyla Tharp,I have the wherewithal to challenge myself for my entire life. That's a great gift.
Twyla Tharp,I have not wanted to intimidate audiences. I have not wanted my dancing to be an elitist form. That doesn't mean I haven't wanted it to be excellent.
Twyla Tharp,"I don't think politicians should be allowed into power who are not familiar with their bodies, because that's where our bottom line is. And I know that they would make totally different decisions if they felt responsible simply for their own bodies."
Twyla Tharp,"I don't mean this, but I'm going to say it anyway. I don't really think of pop art and serious art as being that far apart."
Twyla Tharp,"Any comic is a tragic soul. Comedy is one of the things that allows one to survive. Particularly if one has been in the process of separating off the emotions, it's one place you can process them."
Twyla Tharp,A lot of people insisted on a wall between modern dance and ballet. I'm beginning to think that walls are very unhealthy things.
Twyla Tharp,The rewards of dancing are very different from choreographing.
Twyla Tharp,The only thing I fear more than change is no change. The business of being static makes me nuts.
Twyla Tharp,"The necessity to constantly turn in an excellent performance, to be absolutely wedded to this dedication and this ideal means that as a child you're going to pay for it personally."
Twyla Tharp,The formal education that I received made little sense to me.
Twyla Tharp,Optimism with some experience behind it is much more energizing than plain old experience with a certain degree of cynicism.
Twyla Tharp,"My mother was a dominant force in my life. She had a very specific idea about education, which was: you should know everything about everything. It was quite simple. There was no exclusivity, and there really was no judgment."
Twyla Tharp,"It was not until I had graduated from college that I made a professional commitment to it. Frankly, I didn't think it wise. I was my own interior parental force, and it's very difficult to justify a profession as a dancer."
Twyla Tharp,It is extremely arrogant and very foolish to think that you can ever outwit your audience.
Twyla Tharp,"In terms of individuals who actually inspired me, very few of the academic people that I had access to had that power over me. Maybe it's simply because I wasn't that committed to geometry."
Twyla Tharp,I think that anyone who's pushed to do the very best that they can is privileged. It's a luxury.
Twyla Tharp,Art is the only way to run away without leaving home.
Margaret Thatcher,Why do you climb philosophical hills? Because they are worth climbing. There are no hills to go down unless you start from the top.
Margaret Thatcher,Most women defend themselves. It is the female of the species -- it is the tigress and lioness in you -- which tends to defend when attacked.
Margaret Thatcher,Most women defend themselves. It is the female of the species / it is the tigress and lioness in you / which tends to defend when attacked.
Margaret Thatcher,"One only gets to the top rung of the ladder by steadily climbing up one at a time, and suddenly all sorts of powers, all sorts of abilities which you thought never belonged to you--suddenly become within your own possibility and you think, ''Well, I'll have a go, too.''"
Margaret Thatcher,I shan't be pulling the levers there but I shall be a very good back-seat driver.
Margaret Thatcher,"[Straw] had ample power to put an end to this shameful and damaging episode, ... He has chosen instead to prolong it."
Margaret Thatcher,It pays to know the enemy / not least because at some time you may have the opportunity to turn him into a friend.
Margaret Thatcher,I want my money back!
Margaret Thatcher,I don't mind how much my ministers talk - as long as they do what I say.
Margaret Thatcher,"There is no such thing as society: there are individual men and women, and there are families"
Margaret Thatcher,I wasn't lucky. I deserved it.
Margaret Thatcher,No one would remember the Good Samaritan if he'd only had good intentions - he had money too
Margaret Thatcher,I owe nothing to Women's Lib
Margaret Thatcher,"If you want something said, ask a man...if you want something done, ask a woman."
Margaret Thatcher,I'm not quite sure of his place in history. History will determine that.
Margaret Thatcher,It is only when you look now and see success that you say that it was good fortune. It was not. We lost 250 of our best young men. I felt every one.
Margaret Thatcher,"I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near."
Margaret Thatcher,Of course it's the same old story. Truth usually is the same old story.
Margaret Thatcher,Nothing is more obstinate than a fashionable consensus.
Margaret Thatcher,"It's passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town, in a very modest home, are just the things that I believe have won the election."
Margaret Thatcher,"You don't tell deliberate lies, but sometimes you have to be evasive."
Margaret Thatcher,It's a funny old world.
Margaret Thatcher,"Disciplining yourself to do what you know is right and importance, although difficult, is the highroad to pride, self-esteem, and personal satisfaction."
Margaret Thatcher,"I'm fine, I'm fine. I feel fine. The doctors assessed her this morning and say she is OK."
Margaret Thatcher,The desire to win is born in most of us. The will to win is a matter of training. The manner of winning is a matter of honour.
Margaret Thatcher,"If you lead a country like Britain, a strong country, a country which has taken a lead in world affairs in good times and in bad, a country that is always reliable, then you have to have a touch of iron about you."
Margaret Thatcher,"I had the patriotic conviction that, given great leadership of the sort I heard from Winston Churchill in the radio broadcasts to which we listened, there was almost nothing that the British people could not do"
Margaret Thatcher,"I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together."
Margaret Thatcher,Europe was created by history. America was created by philosophy.
Margaret Thatcher,Her guidance and advice are always most acute and as prime minister I was privileged to benefit from both enormously.
Margaret Thatcher,"A well ordered society would be one where the State only had a negative action, comparable to that of a rudder: a light pressure at the right moment to counteract the first suggestion of any loss of equilibrium."
Margaret Thatcher,"Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's when you've had everything to do, and you've done it."
Margaret Thatcher,"One hopes to achieve the zero option, but in the absence of that we must achieve balanced numbers."
Margaret Thatcher,I've got a woman's ability to stick to a job and get on with it when everyone else walks off and leaves it.
Margaret Thatcher,I owe nothing to Women's Lib.
Margaret Thatcher,"What is success? I think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing; knowing that it is not enough, that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose."
Margaret Thatcher,"Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't."
Margaret Thatcher,"It is not the creation of wealth that is wrong, but the love of money for its own sake."
Margaret Thatcher,Any woman who understands the problems of running a home will be nearer to understanding the problems of running a country.
Margaret Thatcher,"To wear your heart on your sleeve isn't a very good plan; you should wear it inside, where it functions best."
Margaret Thatcher,A world without nuclear weapons would be less stable and more dangerous for all of us.
Margaret Thatcher,The battle for women's rights has been largely won.
John Thaw,"You can't say to someone with a brain like Morse, This is the way you do it, regardless of the circumstances; this is the way it is done."
John Thaw,"When he's solved that particular clue, then he's back to reality and he doesn't like it. I think that's why he drinks more than most."
John Thaw,"We were using a hand-held camera to film the scene when Morse collapses. The camera wouldn't start. Three times they said action and it still wouldn't work. To this day, they still don't know what was wrong."
John Thaw,"We all know that somebody did it, but how did they find the answer?"
John Thaw,"The writers have built up the Morse and Lewis characters, and their relationship. You're fascinated how these two men get to the result they get to."
John Thaw,Parts like Morse don't grow on trees. He's a great character.
John Thaw,I'm not an instinctive actor.
John Thaw,I'm an introspective person. I'm not an extrovert.
John Thaw,"I was involved in school plays, but when I left school I did a couple of odd jobs as a baker's apprentice and then as a fruit market porter in Manchester."
John Thaw,I think sadly that Morse thinks that he can exist on his own and he only realises at the end that he can't and never really has been able to. I feel sorry for him.
John Thaw,I think Morse's thing about being a poor policeman but a good detective is a very good description of him.
John Thaw,"I feel very proud to have created a character that is so respected. On the other hand, as an actor, I have more freedom now to do other things."
John Thaw,"Watch the mouth, it reveals what the eyes try to hide."
Gary Thayer,Yields have risen to levels where buyers looking for yields are willing to take a risk and buy.
Gary Thayer,We have the potential for that.
Gary Thayer,The lower-than-expected number of new jobless claims shows that the labor market is continuing to improve. It suggests that the economy is strong and that companies are feeling more comfortable about hanging on to workers.
Gary Thayer,"Fewer people are worried about jobs right now, more people think that jobs are easy to get, and I think that's supporting confidence despite the high energy prices."
Gary Thayer,It speeds up the time that the Fed will probably think about raising rates and that's negative for fixed-income.
Gary Thayer,"We were anticipating that we could see a little bit of an improvement in October because the rebuilding after the hurricanes appears to have started and energy prices have stabilized, but it appears that it will take a little longer for consumers to feel better about things."
Gary Thayer,We've been seeing improvement in the non-manufacturing side since late last year. We're seeing more activity in the travel sector and others that were hit really hard last year after the terror attacks.
Gary Thayer,The jobless claims drop shows good strength in the labor market at the end of the year. It shows that the economy has recovered after the hurricanes and is heading into the new year with good momentum and good job prospects.
Gary Thayer,"The Fed may be looking at oil prices as a reason for the economy to falter and not a reason for it to overheat, so they won't want to raise rates yet."
Gary Thayer,"It suggests the drag on the economy from the trade deficit in the third quarter will not be as great and could help revise up third-quarter GDP a bit,"
Gary Thayer,But it looks like Mr. Greenspan is saying the slowdown in the economy will be short-lived and that suggests that the Fed will probably continue to raise rates.
Gary Thayer,"The longer Congress delays helping the economy out, the longer the economy will remain weak."
Gary Thayer,It still shows a pretty healthy economy at this point. The manufacturing side of things and business spending will be good this year.
Joe Theismann,Guys there would never want to say they are rebuilding because they are competing. But the truth is they are totally retooling that operation.
Joe Theismann,"Over the last three years, I found myself getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. After a while, I began to accept that going to the bathroom so frequently was simply part of aging after hitting 50."
Joe Theismann,"Everybody I talk to, the thing they say that impresses them most about Cadillac is his humility. All I ever hear is how he's never gotten caught up in the notoriety and the status that he's earned."
Joe Theismann,Today's helmets are a lot different. The league has really worked hard to protect the players from head injuries.
Joe Theismann,"There are excellent football coaches out there, and excellent assistants that could do a good job. But it's going to take time. With Tice, you have an excellent football coach. I think he should be given a chance to come back and coach that football team."
Joe Theismann,"He's playing the best football now. Maybe he doesn't get the records, maybe he doesn't have the yards or have the most touchdown passes, but from a game operational standpoint, I think Tom Brady throws the ball as well as anybody in football, manages the game as well as anybody in football, and has three rings on his fingers in the last four years, and he's a winner."
Joe Theismann,"When I can 10 or 11, my mom was the one out there catching passes for me. She was my prime receiver."
Joe Theismann,"This is a game, first and foremost. There was only one Vince Lombardi, and he died."
Joe Theismann,Rugby is great. The players don't wear helmets or padding; they just beat the living daylights out of each other and then go for a beer. I love that.
Joe Theismann,"No matter how great you are, the next great one is already sitting there waiting to take your place."
Joe Theismann,I worked hard. I worked late. I went in early. I did everything I could to gain an advantage.
Joe Theismann,"I was always told that I was too small, too skinny, too slow, not tough enough, and I never ever believed what people told me."
Joe Theismann,Nobody in football should be called a genius. A genius is a guy like Norman Einstein.
Charlize Theron,"We don't go through life with it all being smooth sailing. ... We all understand situations where you know it's swim or drown. It's a choice you have to make, and sometimes we surprise ourselves, when we actually make that choice and start swimming, with how well we can do it."
Charlize Theron,I'm happy for people who want to get married. It's not my thing.
Charlize Theron,She's not based on anybody real. The events of the story are based on real events.
Charlize Theron,"because thanks to women like her, I get to work and live in a very safe environment. I respect women who come from harsher landscapes, where survival is much harder than in cities, because they don't wallow in self-pity. They have to survive, so they get up and move on."
Charlize Theron,"I had big dreams when I came here, but this is an incredibly amazing gift ... two cherries on top of the cake."
Charlize Theron,"I am a huge fan of the show, and I'm very picky with my comedy. I don't get to do comedy very often, and when they asked me, I jumped at the opportunity. I was ready to do something for fun."
Charlize Theron,"a very unique girl, a free spirit. I see all the beauty and childlike innocence in life."
Charlize Theron,"It's a landmark case, and it changed the face of sexual harassment laws in corporate America,"
Charlize Theron,"I think today women are very scared to celebrate themselves, because then they just get labeled."
Michel Therrien,"We're a team that our work ethic has to be 100 percent, our concentration has to be 100 percent and our desperation has to be 100 percent. At the moment that we slip away a little bit, we are going to be in real trouble. (Saturday) all the things I just mentioned were not there at all and it was embarrassing. An embarrassing performance. That's all I have to say."
Michel Therrien,"This is not only for a weekend. It's probably for the rest of the season, because we want to make sure of that when we make decisions."
Michel Therrien,We want him to be back. I hope he has some good performances.
Michel Therrien,"We found a way. That's a good thing, especially after the way we played at home. I think guys have a lot of things to prove to themselves and their teammates. We needed a strong game, and we got a strong game."
Michel Therrien,"We'll have some quality practice time. This year, the schedule is so compact with so many games in such a short period of time that will be nice to get to work on our system."
Michel Therrien,There's no doubt in my mind we are going to play a better game. I think the players have some pride. They want to bounce back. It's all about attitude and what kind of attitude the players display. I'm confident they have what it takes.
Michel Therrien,I'm anxious to see how we're going to react. There's no doubt in my mind we're going to play a better game. I think the players have some pride and they want to bounce back and give them a good game.
Michel Therrien,"I think we are in the right direction and it's going to be positive, but I know they can play better. Eventually."
Michel Therrien,"We made some bad decisions. When you don't win, you're tense. You probably don't think the same way. You're rushing things because the confidence is not there. We rushed some decisions. That was a big part."
Michel Therrien,It's not a matter of confidence. It's a matter of trying.
Michel Therrien,I liked the way he played; that's why we called him up. He played with confidence. We wish him the best in Atlanta.
Michel Therrien,"It's tough to have a four-goal lead, sometimes, because you lose your concentration and the other team takes a lot of chances. They got a lot of shots. We wanted to keep them on the outside as much as we could, and Marc-Andre was phenomenal."
Michel Therrien,Eventually I want to get back as head coach of an NHL team; that's my goal. I'd rather be a head coach in the AHL than an assistant in the NHL.
Michel Therrien,Anyone with good character wants to give it another shot.
Michel Therrien,"I believe that was a horrible call, but there's nothing we can do. I don't think it was a clear breakaway. I didn't believe that. Interpretation is always different. It was a tough night. The referees were tough on us."
Alan Thicke,The Seavers would have properly registered all firearms. They would have obeyed all the rules about firearms. And they would also have gotten training. ... Growing Pains
Alan Thicke,He was kind enough to take me under his wing.
Alan Thicke,"If it is a first offense, you ground them and have a talk. The second offense would call for counseling."
Alan Thicke,"As a father, my first priority is to help my sons set and attain personal goals so they will develop self-confidence and individual strength. Engaging in regular fitness activities with my children helps me fulfill those responsibilities."
Alan Thicke,"I'll be on my third honeymoon, so I'm more of an authority than I care to be."
Alan Thicke,"We look for opportunities to play together including basketball, tennis, swimming, riding bikes and touch football. I try to provide a loving environment where we can play. I think that's good on so many levels - emotionally, for family interactions and, of course, physically."
Alan Thicke,There are psychological repercussions to illness and we need a little more help to get through the effects not only on the afflicted but on the family. And I think there's even a place for humor in that.
Alan Thicke,"So we had psychiatrists and counselors and therapists around the set regularly, especially for those scenes in which Jason would be dealing with a patient to make sure we were doing it all appropriately."
Alan Thicke,"So there was a constant flow and a thin line there between reality and television and yes, much of what I was experiencing in my real life was also what was going on in the television show to the extent that I had to take writers' advice and from the counselors around."
Alan Thicke,"On a selfish basis, I really enjoy sports and activity."
Alan Thicke,My two boys were the same ages as the kids in the show. In real life or in between the breaks I was raising two kids off camera who were not unlike the two kids who were being paid to be my kids.
Alan Thicke,"My priority is to turn people - especially kids - on to sports and being active so they don't even have to think about it being good for their health. If people participate for the fun of it, and believe me - it is fun, then fitness programs will be much more successful."
Alan Thicke,It's always been said that comedy comes mostly out of the dark side anyway.
Alan Thicke,"If one tends to be a humorous person and you have a sense of humor the rest of your life then you can certainly lighten the load, I think, by bringing that to your trials and tribulations. It's easy to have a sense of humor when everything is going well."
Alan Thicke,I'm not able to go in with an act that I use month to month year to year all the time. It's constantly evolving and changing and that keeps me on my toes but certainly adds to the challenge.
Alan Thicke,I'm a big proponent of having a mental health component go along with whatever the physical realities are.
Alan Thicke,"I wouldn't call myself a standup in the presence of Jerry Seinfeld or Chris Rock, but I do my share of it and it has been and remains part of my activity and I like it."
Alan Thicke,Family members can help support each other to make significant improvements in their exercise and eating habits. It begins with basic awareness.
Alan Thicke,And introduce an element of cynicism and darkness into it and just realize that we're all vulnerable. We are humans. There is a finite end to this life and we're all going to face it and a little silliness can help.
Alan Thicke,"About 100 things that your kid will do that will surprise you and break your heart and it will be a combination of fact based therapy, medically advised kinds of passages accompanied by celebrity anecdotes and just some funny stuff to lighten the load."
Alan Thicke,My first one was called How Men Have Babies which is the pregnant father's survival guide and this will be about the first time your kid does things.
Alan Thicke,"I'll be on my third honeymoon, so I'm more of an authority than I care to be,"
Alan Thicke,"Family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the '90s version of it. Instead of just watching, you can do it together... something we don't spend enough time on. We can motivate and excite each other about fitness."
Alan Thicke,Fitness needs to be perceived as fun and games or we subconsciously avoid it.
Ann Thomas,"If they don't want to leave, they are staying at their own risk."
Ann Thomas,they are staying here at their own risk.
Ann Thomas,"We've always asked people to leave earlier, but because of Katrina, they are now listening to us and they're leaving as we say,"
Ann Thomas,We only see our public officials when it's time for a vote. The only time you see law officers is when they're making an arrest.
Ann Thomas,"I consider it an honor to have a park in my neighborhood named after her, for what she stood for."
Ann Thomas,"[Businesses aren't yet complaining of a paucity of pennies.] I haven't noticed any shortage, ... We go to the bank in the morning and get our two or three dollars' worth every day."
Dave Thomas,The rest of the team picked up the slack.
Dave Thomas,One of the reasons for choosing Peace is that it is compliant with Full Retail Contestability (FRC) in Australia.
Dave Thomas,"Peace Software emerged the clear leader from our rigorous selection process based on its successful track record in the Australian market, the rich functional footprint of the Peace 8 product, and a clearly defined product roadmap."
Dave Thomas,We worry like any parents do.
Dave Thomas,It's been my head ever since. He had a great sense of humor.
Dave Thomas,If you want it bad enough...and try hard enough...you can get it ? you can make your dreams come true.
Dave Thomas,"Think about it. Any time you have family and you have people sitting around the table, normally our business should be good."
Dave Thomas,"As long as our boys learn from the experience, I'll be happy."
Dave Thomas,It was the closest to purgatory that I've ever experienced while I've been living.
Dave Thomas,What people forget is that every movie that gets made keeps making money for somebody FOREVER.
Dave Thomas,"I think the harder you work, the more luck you have."
Dave Thomas,You can do what you want to do. You can be what you want to be.
Dave Thomas,"If there are things you don't like in the world you grew up in, make your own life different."
Dave Thomas,There's no one to stop you but yourself.
Dave Thomas,"It all comes back to the basic. Serve customers the best-tasting food at a good value in a clean, comfortable restaurant, and they'll keep coming back."
Dave Thomas,"In the beginning there was nothing and God said 'Let there be light', and there was still nothing but everybody could see it."
Gareth Thomas,"He's on fire, I've seen other tries of his against Wasps and Cardiff, and it's good news for Wales."
Gareth Thomas,There is no doubt people have started to think seriously now about Christmas spending.
Gareth Thomas,"We know from experience that the absence of sexual and reproductive health services results in an increase in unintended pregnancies and, inevitably, a greater number of unsafe abortions."
Isiah Thomas,"This is not the place for the weak-minded guy, regardless of your talent."
Isiah Thomas,"We have obstacles in front of us, but my goal and my job[as coach] is to continue to develop our younger players, to get the most and the best out of our veteran players, to not have a losing record, to make the playoffs every year and to lead this organization and this team to a level that it has yet to reach, I always look forward to the challenge and opportunity and I am looking forward to continuing the success of Indiana basketball."
Isiah Thomas,You have no idea how it hurt. It finally was coming together. That night (against All Saints) -- it was amazing. They heard everything I said.
Isiah Thomas,No one is happy with our record but I can tell you we're going to get better. That's what everybody is working toward. That's what we all want.
Isiah Thomas,"Out of respect for his privacy and what he and his family are dealing with, we won't comment on any of his personal issues or things that are happening."
Isiah Thomas,"He never really was diagnosed with what everyone said he had, what Hank Gathers had. No doctors said he had that. Everyone said, 'If he has that, then this could happen.' All of a sudden they quit saying 'if' and said he had it."
Isiah Thomas,"The situation was addressed in-house, and we gave Coach the option to suspend Marbury, fine him. Whatever discipline he felt was necessary, we were willing to take. He said he didn't think that would be appropriate because he didn't want to single [Marbury] out and it was a good opportunity to coach him."
Isiah Thomas,"My job is to make sure in all the chaos you can still see the flowers, you can still see the good things happening."
Isiah Thomas,Not often can you say with certainty that you've added one of the best to your organization in any position.
Isiah Thomas,"This is a trade that we all feel makes us a better basketball team for both now and in the future. In Steve, we add an All-Star caliber player to our team without giving up core assets that are key to our future."
Isiah Thomas,You have to develop your whole game to completion.
Isiah Thomas,"Where we sit now, I don't think we have the luxury of the 20 teams before us. I think we are going after the best players we can get on the board."
Isiah Thomas,"We were going to have to experiment, and we needed to develop our younger players. And a lot of the changes were because of injuries. But that's where I give a lot of credit to the group in terms of being able to maintain things."
Isiah Thomas,We needed Larry Brown. Me more so than anyone. I wanted Larry to do a great job for us and I thought he would and I thought he could.
Isiah Thomas,We decided to go the way of trading and getting younger players.
Isiah Thomas,We decided to either try trades or just go with older players. If you do that and let contracts expire you can be in the lottery for about four or five years and expect your fans to be patient.
Isiah Thomas,"There is not a player on this roster now, who doesn't understand or believe that if he is not performing, I don't have problems getting rid of them."
Isiah Thomas,"The type of athletes we draft still need types of versatility on the defense side of the ball, run the offense. You should still be concerned on the offense side of the ball."
Isiah Thomas,The biggest difference is in the leadership. It was better for us. We had more coaches and mentors to help us. A lot of the younger players today suffer from a lack of direction.
Isiah Thomas,"That challenge of working through it, keeping guys motivated, keeping the group together, overcoming obstacles, all of that; I really got into it."
Isiah Thomas,"One word is passion. They are passionate about their team. We win we're great, lose and we're the worst. But you can't overreact to the fans."
Isiah Thomas,"My thought has always been completion. Maybe you have to rebound better, shoot better, hit free throws, handle the ball, defend better. You have to do all those things in the course of a game."
Isiah Thomas,My first choice was to work it out with Larry Brown. I needed Larry and I gave him 50 million bucks. This is a situation that I'm in and I'll handle it and I'll make it work.
Isiah Thomas,Most players in this league say they want consistency.
Isiah Thomas,Larry Brown thought Steve Francis was a Larry Brown type of player.
Isiah Thomas,It's hard to get people to overcome the thought that they have to take care of themselves first. It's hard to get players to give in to the group and become selfless as opposed to selfish.
Isiah Thomas,"It wasn't about the X's and the O's and the strategy; it was more about keeping 12 guys focused and committed to a task. That group dynamic, and then helping them to grow as people and basketball players."
Isiah Thomas,"It was important to me to believe, because if I don't believe, how can I expect them to believe?"
Isiah Thomas,"Instead of me telling them what they need to work on, I wanted to hear from them what they needed to work on."
Isiah Thomas,"If you want consistency, then you perform. This is a performance job. You get paid to perform. Your money is guaranteed, but your minutes are not."
Isiah Thomas,"I've been in pressure situations before. All my life it's been about pressure and having to get it done. Just because you say it publicly, it does not make me afraid of it or make me shy away from it."
Isiah Thomas,I'll continue to try to make changes to better improve the team.
Isiah Thomas,I would still like to get more athletic and have players that can really cover what's going on in the game.
Isiah Thomas,I want to see if the player communicates with his teammates and how he responds to coaching. Another thing to remember is players' bodies can develop better than their skills.
Isiah Thomas,I love what I'm doing.
Isiah Thomas,I can't think of any NBA team over the last few years that lost three starters. And we replaced them basically with three guys who really haven't played in this league.
Isiah Thomas,I believe in the players and what I've put together and we'll make it work.
Isiah Thomas,"How can I tell the eighth or ninth man on the team that I want you to work hard every day and I want you to improve and get better, but while you're doing that you're not going to get any minutes?"
Isiah Thomas,Everybody wants to be perfect.
Isiah Thomas,"All of those things had been talked about, suggested, rumored, as a manager and as a member of the Knicks organization, I couldn't allow myself to think that way or believe that."
Isiah Thomas,"If it fills a need, if it fills a rebuilding situation. And my goal is to fill and rebuild and I am not going to be shortsighted."
Isiah Thomas,It's been made clear to all of us that a player should never leave the playing field and go into the stands.
Isiah Thomas,My greatest gift that I have in life is basketball.
Isiah Thomas,"If all I'm remembered for is being a good basketball player, then I've done a bad job with the rest of my life."
Jeff Thomas,All the seniors want to worry about in their golden years is what color bathing suit they're going to wear to the clubhouse that night.
Jeff Thomas,Everybody would be better off if we could find a way to work together instead of battle in the courts. It's a lose-lose situation really to even go through the battle.
Jeff Thomas,"They do a good job. They're big and athletic at every spot, and we had trouble getting into a good flow with our offense."
Jeff Thomas,"Unless the fall rains come, we are in a bit of trouble."
Jeff Thomas,We had a good performance from the girls that came off the bench.
Jeff Thomas,The girls have played hard every game all season. I appreciated the work of our five seniors this year. They set a good example for the youngsters coming back next season.
Jeff Thomas,The girls did a great job tonight. We did an excellent job getting the ball down the floor.
Jeff Thomas,He's got a lot of athletic ability and he's learning fast.
Jerry Thomas,"We haven't had any yet. That's not to say it won't happen. We always worry about it, and we keep a close eye on things. I'd like to catch them trying."
Jerry Thomas,I support the replacement of (patrol) cars. But I would like to see a detailed fleet management plan.
Jerry Thomas,I used to work with horses myself back in the old days. And I must say he has some very well-trained horses.
Joe Thomas,"From an air quality impact, there are definitely going to be benefits."
Joe Thomas,"I'm going to run and get my head to the outside and try to reach whoever the contain man is. If he plays so far outside that you can't hook him, then you've just got to kick him outside as far as you can to spread the hole."
Joe Thomas,"There's a lack of disclosure in the city, information about where our funding is going, actual costs. I think those things need to be opened up."
Joe Thomas,It's never sad. It's always upbeat. You want to dance to it. It's fun â€” that's what it's all about.
Joe Thomas,We're not sure Steve (Champlin) will be ready so that's why we threw different kids in different events. I'm very pleased with the way the kids performed. I wanted to see what the kids could do for the county meet.
Joe Thomas,as good at their positions as anyone in the country.
Keni Thomas,You have to find something in your life that makes a difference.
Keni Thomas,You live your life with a sense of guilt. You have to do something good. You have to earn the right to be here.
Keni Thomas,I am driven by a fear of mediocrity and a sense of purpose.
Kurt Thomas,Unbelievable. We just got some tough calls. But we can't worry about that.
Kurt Thomas,"He gets it down out there every night. He's a big guy who really has a great outside touch, real quickness for putting the ball on the floor and getting to the rack and the way he is on the boards offensively and defensively. I've just got to try to stay a step ahead of him."
Kurt Thomas,It was crazy last night. I think it definitely brought a lot more pride.
Kurt Thomas,I don't think I fouled him. Everybody makes mistakes.
Kurt Thomas,We just hate to lose tonight on a tough call that could have gone either way.
Lowell Thomas,"The ability to speak is a short cut to distinction. It puts a man in the limelight, raises him head and shoulders above the crowd."
Lowell Thomas,Do a little more each day than you think you possibly can.
Lowell Thomas,The man who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he really possesses.
Lowell Thomas,"Separately there was only wind, water, sail, and hull, but at my hand the four had been given purpose and direction."
Lowell Thomas,"After the age of 80, everything reminds you of something else."
Lowell Thomas,He [T. E. Lawrence] had a genius for backing into the limelight.
Mark Thomas,I don't know why all of a sudden the holy grail of security and safety is now closing records.
Mark Thomas,"I don't know why all of a sudden the holy grail of security and safety is now closing records. It seems to me we would be more secure if we knew what was going on around us. ... Apparently there are those in government who want to close all these records and say, 'We'll keep you safe, trust us."
Mark Thomas,"In this region we have major problems, especially Cambodia, Thailand, but progress is being made."
Mark Thomas,We anticipate a federal law for nutrition labeling at retail at some point.
Mark Thomas,"We just have a heart for the people,"
Mark Thomas,"When God puts things on your heart, you don't ask questions. You just go to work."
Mark Thomas,"Gloucestershire police must be the envy of the human rights-abusing cop world. From Turkey to Indonesia they will say, 'Kidnapping peace protestors! How did they get away with that one?"
Mark Thomas,We expect both income and costs in Barclays Capital to be rising strongly and the continued good market environment may encourage further investment.
Mark Thomas,"The biggest issue in India obviously remains the regulatory environment, which makes the near-term investment in India likely to be significantly less than the investment which we see in China."
Mark Thomas,Middleton is not particularly liked in the City and it will also delay the appointment of a finance director.
Mark Thomas,"We have no other choice. It's bad for emissions, it's bad for safety. But it is what it is."
Mark Thomas,"Were British protesters, armed with little more than a frisbee and a bag of plastic toy soldiers, really in danger of being shot by the US military in Gloucestershire?"
Mark Thomas,"The whole world is out of step, apart from me."
Mark Thomas,The only deadline is the one I give myself.
Mark Thomas,The law is immoral.
Mark Thomas,People either leave or they stay.
Mark Thomas,"Maybe... there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for unlawfully detaining 120 people. Maybe they just got carried away with last year's idea of pre-emptive strikes and thought, 'Let's not wait for an actual crime to occur. Let's get the innocent."
Mark Thomas,"One can only guess the amount of magic mushrooms a sane person would have to consume to believe that a frisbee constituted a genuine threat to roughly 3,000 police officers."
Norman Thomas,"After I asked him what he meant, he replied that freedom consisted of the unimpeded right to get rich, to use his ability, no matter what the cost to others, to win advancement."
Norman Thomas,"If you want a symbolic gesture, don't burn the flag; wash it."
Norman Thomas,The secret of a good life is to have the right loyalties and hold them in the right scale of values.
Norman Thomas,I always get more applause than votes.
Norman Thomas,I walk where I choose to walk.
Norman Thomas,"To us Americans much has been given; of us much is required. With all our faults and mistakes, it is our strength in support of the freedom our forefathers loved which has saved mankind from subjection to totalitarian power."
Norman Thomas,I'd rather see America save her soul than her face
Peter Thomas,It was heart-wrenching and humiliating. We were unbelievably bad.
Peter Thomas,Giving them the opportunities to learn that natural give and take we all need is probably very important. But I don't think you have to go out of your way.
Peter Thomas,"The form of the water [for example, liquid, permafrost, or impregnated in minerals] depends on many things, such as the distance that the asteroid formed from the Sun (and therefore its temperature) and what internal heat the asteroid has since generated,"
Peter Thomas,"Improving global economic conditions have prompted raw materials cost increases. We have seen escalating raw material, energy and transportation costs over an extended period."
Peter Thomas,We each have our own challenges.
Peter Thomas,It's not a matter of intelligence; it's a matter of changing their patterns of behavior and creating an environment where they have nothing else to do but learn.
Rob Thomas,"Ever since I can remember, I've always wanted to tell stories, but I never had the patience to sit down at a typewriter and write short stories or anything like that. I started writing songs as a way of communicating ideas the best way I could."
Rob Thomas,Today I tattoo politicians and doctors. I even tattooed an 84-year-old man with his late wife's name entwined in a rose. I gave him that one for free.
Rob Thomas,You cannot fail without your consent. You cannot succeed without your participation.
Zach Thomas,We're definitely going to be running our tails off because of today. We just got outplayed. They really dominated us.
Zach Thomas,"They got it done right from the opening drive. We didn't have any momentum because we didn't get off the field and when we finally scored and got back into the game, two plays and we let them score."
Zach Thomas,"Seems like every year at this time I give you an excuse. Then I say what has to be done, and we do it, and the next year there's a different excuse. But what they've done this year is pack the team with so much talent that we won't be able to blow it. We're so loaded that there just won't be any excuses."
Zach Thomas,The man has a plan. He knows exactly what he's doing. He has total confidence in his ability to make the right moves.
Bob Thompson,"I watch a lot of sports, and so far that's been what's driven the big-screen phenomenon. It's a status symbol; a lot of people get a lot of pleasure being able to show off this enormous piece of hardware."
Bob Thompson,The lower Olympic numbers are predictable and inevitable. Many people used to watch the Olympics because it was the best thing to watch. Now they have so many more choices.
Bob Thompson,"We thought it probably would be a glance for us, but as it turned out it was even lighter. It stayed offshore, to our benefit."
Bob Thompson,"This was clearly an Olympics that says that the broadcast era, the old days when the Olympics were pretty much guaranteed to plow over the competition and draw these huge audiences, that Olympics of the broadcast era is really over. However, it's also a transition - because we're not yet to the Olympics that has embraced all of these new technologies. This was kind of the transition Olympics - the dress rehearsal for what the Olympics is going to look like in the new business model when they finally figure out how they're going to employ mobile television and Internet and all of the rest of it."
David Thompson,"I don't think we're going to find too many running backs, whether it's 1-A, 2-A, 3-A or 4-A that are as good as that kid. He reads his blocks well. He's a strong kid. He's got good speed, and he's elusive. That makes for the total package for a running back."
David Thompson,"I don't see b-to-b being greatly impacted, because right now there are not ad hoc relationships forming around extranets and exchanges. And this legislation may not be enough to make up for the technology that is missing to do that and the trust it would involve."
David Thompson,"I don't see b-to-b being greatly impacted, because right now there are not ad hoc relationships forming around extranets and exchanges, ... And this legislation may not be enough to make up for the technology that is missing to do that and the trust it would involve."
David Thompson,"Affluent baby boomers have unique challenges when it comes to retirement planning and represent one of the largest opportunities for financial services firms. Mass marketing to this group of high net worth individuals simply doesn't work and requires a more thorough understanding of the affluent lifestyle, attitudes and behaviors. It's obvious from our research that there's lots of low hanging fruit yet to be picked."
David Thompson,"We kept fighting, ... We just kind of dug ourselves too deep a hole to crawl out of. That was the bottom line. But they put up a fight."
David Thompson,"Counties are grateful that the State Board of Elections listened to our concerns, and we appreciate the efforts of Gov. Mike Easley and his office to help resolve this situation."
David Thompson,A lot of these kids haven't been pushed out of their comfort zone.
David Thompson,"This site is an interesting example of a class of little-understood monuments which are numerous across Wales, but which are often overlooked."
David Thompson,"These immigrants that come here, their dream is to cross the border, get their citizenship and actually live here."
David Thompson,world-class scientists and engineers and surround them with the creative environment and speed of action that will make it happen.
Greg Thompson,"So he's pretty much groomed for stand-up. He's a funny guy, and he's kind of coming back."
Greg Thompson,"He'll say some pretty funny stuff at the expense of a lot of people in the audience, but then he'll come back and redeem himself five minutes later."
Greg Thompson,"We are seeing more juveniles involved in more violent crimes, ... I think that's a trend nationwide."
Greg Thompson,"It means people will have greater choice. If we didn't have that, there would be 475 fewer doctors they'd be able to see."
Greg Thompson,"There is something Canada can do because the ships would have to travel through internal Canadian waters and if the government of Canada says 'no' to the transport of those tankers through those waters, the project would not go ahead,"
Greg Thompson,"It simply indicates a level of denial that was going on in the Liberal Party and the Parliament of Canada, if you will in terms of the government because this issue was brought to the floor of the House of Commons back four years ago now."
Jim Thompson,"We think it's very important we work through the proper channels in this case, ... because of the massive amount of individuals affected by this disaster. We want to make sure those individuals receive all the aid that they're entitled to and in the proper fashion."
Jim Thompson,"We escaped with a victory in this match. This was a match where they had the lead, we caught up and went ahead, and then we tried to give away."
Jim Thompson,It really gives you a feeling of power ... It is an unbelievable feeling.
Jim Thompson,"You get more smirks. These are the all-mighty and they're making mistakes,"
Jim Thompson,Bob figured on living longer.
Jim Thompson,"I'd like to get a couple of our girls in (districts) as individuals. It should be a good, fast meet and real good competition. Division I and Division II are getting closer and closer. It raises the bar a little bit and pushes everybody to do their best."
Jim Thompson,We're definitely making progress. Just the reaction to that guy is progress. Ten years ago his behavior wouldn't have even been noticed.
John Thompson,We can't allow trust to continue to erode. We as an industry must join together to create a trusted online community.
John Thompson,"This technology addresses the growing need to protect sensitive data stored in databases, particularly in the area of compliance for the health care and financial service industries."
John Thompson,"The parity, from top to bottom, is terrific. It's unlike any other league with quality teams, quality players and quality coaches from top to bottom."
John Thompson,"She understands the problems we have up here. I know she doesn't have the solutions, but she's willing to look for them. I'm a supporter - 100 percent. One thousand percent."
John Thompson,He reminds me so much of Dikembe [Mutombo]. I call them instinct runners. He doesn't think about it. He's just goes. So many guys his size have to process it - I must run - but it just comes natural for him.
John Thompson,"Motorola designed this integrated suite of emergency dispatch applications in a highly configurable format, giving each public safety agency the flexibility to configure business rules and display options to meet their individual needs."
John Thompson,It is not unknown for gentlemen to come in and purchase two of the same items.
John Thompson,"He was one of the guys who helped make tournaments like this famous. He had to go through it when it was tough, really tough."
John Thompson,that you're only as good in business as your last response to an attack. You always have to be one step ahead of the bad guys.
John W. Thompson,"While there have been terrific advances in the state of technology around heuristics, behavior blocking, and things like that, technology is only a part of the approach to solving the problem with the more important aspect involving putting the right process in place."
John W. Thompson,"What we are seeing now is customers shifting their attention from security products like firewalls and intrusion sensors, to the policies that need to be in place, and the technologies that help them enforce policy compliance."
John W. Thompson,Well Web services are nothing more than a way for users to interact with applications.
John W. Thompson,"Well we have a good working relationship with Microsoft at the development level. But let's not kid ourselves, this is a company with enormous resources and talented people, and there is a certain pride that comes along with that for them and for us."
John W. Thompson,"We think the managed security services opportunity is enormous and so we have been an active participant and probably the largest firm in this space outside of an IBM or EDS, which does large outsourcing contracts."
John W. Thompson,We need to shift the paradigm from reactive technologies to more integrative solutions that deal with the variety and complexity of the threats that are out there today.
John W. Thompson,We need to do a better job of creating processes for large and small companies on a new vulnerability and what actions they should take.
John W. Thompson,There has been no appreciable improvement in our country's ability to produce the kind of talent we need in this space. There have been some small initiatives around the country that have been noteworthy.
John W. Thompson,The first issue is the awareness level the general public has of things they can and should do to protect their systems and network connections.
John W. Thompson,So you will see us continue to advance the state of the art or take information that we have in our response data bases and have that drive automation or an automated response by some of our products.
John W. Thompson,So ensuring the integrity of the data and integrity and validity of the connection is a very important element in any company's strategy that is moving towards a Web service paradigm.
John W. Thompson,"Second issue is the rapidly accelerating increase in the number of vulnerabilities that get discovered every day. And, equally importantly, is the shortening of time between the discovery of the vulnerability and the release of an exploit."
John W. Thompson,Right now we have a closure rate between discovery and exploitation of four to six months. We need to be more in the realm of seven to 10 days. That is an enormous challenge.
John W. Thompson,Over the near term there is clearly the opportunity to work with Microsoft to do to a better job of creating a more secure Windows experience for users around the world.
John W. Thompson,"One of the things that has been truly incredible to observe though, is the amount of venture investment that has gone into early stage security technology."
John W. Thompson,"If you accept that security is a process, and if you can eliminate the human interaction or intervention in that process by automating more, that is a good thing."
John W. Thompson,I don't think there is any franchise more powerful than ours around securing the consumer experience and we will not concede that to anyone including Microsoft.
John W. Thompson,"First, our focus on security is on the infrastructure itself. So it is all about how you protect the network, the device, and the application that is riding on the server."
John W. Thompson,"First, I do not think there is any silver bullet to solving the technology side of the security equation."
John W. Thompson,"But what Web services suggest is that the connection is always there between an application that is resident somewhere in the cloud, and a user who is somewhere on the other end of a connection."
Ken Thompson,"Today's outcome is a tremendous victory and a major milestone within the merger process, ... It is clear that Wachovia shareholders have strongly endorsed the compelling strategic rationale behind the Wachovia-First Union combination."
Ken Thompson,"Their laws aren't a good fit for escrow companies outside of California, and I think they're overly strict. They're trying to apply a law written for real estate escrow companies in California to any Internet escrow company based outside California."
Ken Thompson,THAT'S THE trouble with wildlife gardening. For so long it's been a refuge for anecdote and old wives' tales that get handed down and trotted out. No-one's had anything original to say about wildlife gardening for years.
Ken Thompson,We are seeing the problems across the board. The fungus took advantage of the rain quicker than the grass.
Ken Thompson,He had a passion since he was a little kid to fly.
Ken Thompson,Nature conservation can seem so remote. But in your own garden you can make a difference and you can enjoy that difference.
Ken Thompson,"But if you really want to know how to live on one income, you might have to move back with your parents,"
Ken Thompson,Jerry is an extraordinary leader who has the experience and talent to help propel this division forward. He is known among his peers and team as a thoughtful and analytical leader who brings a strong base of diverse banking experience to the role. I am confident that Jerry will continue to manage this division efficiently and partner effectively with other Wachovia leaders to support our customer service and business growth goals. We are incredibly fortunate to have an individual with Jerry's talents assume this position for Wachovia.
Ken Thompson,"The only way we can overcome the tragedy of an immense disaster like this one is by pulling together as a nation and doing all we can to help out our fellow citizens in great need, ... The people of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are not alone. Like the rest of our nation, the people of Wachovia want to lend them a helping hand so they can begin rebuilding their lives and their communities."
Ken Thompson,"I am confident that Tom's direction and guidance will ensure strategic continuity and sustained financial discipline, and he is already well known to our investor community."
Ken Thompson,"Modern intensive farmland is a biological desert. Whereas if you tried to design a small nature reserve, you couldn't do better than the average garden - it's got all the required elements."
Ken Thompson,Today's announcement reflects our board's confidence in Wachovia's performance and prospects for consistently growing earnings while maintaining a strong capital position.
Ken Thompson,"Bob has been an outstanding leader at Wachovia for the past five years, which have been pivotal for our company."
Ken Thompson,We are confident we are positioning the company for superior growth. This is what we want to be known for.
Ken Thompson,"My wife was working for a biotech company in San Diego when she walked away to become a mom, ... We have two children now and she plans to go back part-time someday. Any investing I do for her right now would be in education, to keep herself updated, ahead of the curve, especially since technology is moving so fast right now."
Ken Thompson,"The more I think about the nettle argument, the more it makes me laugh. This country's awash with nettles. Butterflies that eat them are not in any difficulty at all."
Ken Thompson,"We have made significant progress toward completing the regulatory approval process, and we look forward to seeing the results from the Wachovia shareholder meeting later this week,"
Ken Thompson,"Look at it from the point of view of the animals that live in your garden. They did not evolve in a tidy landscape, they evolved in a landscape where leaves and branches and whatever fell off the tree and just lay there."
Ken Thompson,"When in doubt, use brute force."
Ken Thompson,"We have a binding legal agreement with Wachovia that we intend to vigorously pursue to consummation, ... We plan to continue the constructive merger integration dialogue which we've had over the past month and look forward to completing our merger with Wachovia."
Kenneth Thompson,"It's a risk, especially when the hiring is done by the dean over there, who is not an expert in all these different fields in which courses will be offered, ... I assume that in a well-run academic institution the people who are hired to teach the various areas are selected by peers in those areas."
Kenneth Thompson,"When I was chairman of the [philosophy] department, one of the reasons some faculty applied to Loyola was precisely because of the opportunity to teach at the Rome Center,"
Kenneth Thompson,"For me, the saxophone is a way of expression,"
Kenneth Thompson,"We have a good strong nucleus of sophomores and have a really nice freshman class,"
Larry Thompson,"Considering the risk I am about to take, I will require a minimum payment of 13 million U.S. dollars. There are many people from movie stars to athletes in the U.S. who receive tens of millions of dollars a year for their trivial contributions,"
Larry Thompson,"He quit working out, and he quit doing anything. He lost 15 pounds and wasn't ready to play football out there in California. Luckily, he found a way to turn it around or it would have been a waste of talent."
Larry Thompson,"(Trustees) all say the same thing, it's only a few teachers that are upset. Well, the events of today expose that as mythology."
Larry Thompson,"We tried different things on defense (in the first half) like traps and pressing. We settled on man-to-man (in the second half) and it seemed to work out for us. Once we settled on one thing, we committed to it and did a nice job on it."
Larry Thompson,"The conspiracy...allowed Enron to exploit and intensify the California energy crisis and prey on energy consumers at their most vulnerable moment,"
Larry Thompson,"One of the issues that we are wrestling with in our eight counties is crisis services, and ensuring that crisis services are available. We don't have that in place yet for adults or for kids, but we're working to try to put it in place."
Larry Thompson,will enable our government to assess fully the scope and consequences of Hanssen's activities.
Larry Thompson,It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that serious charges have serious consequences. It would be unfortunate if any individual or entity [said] it was so big or so important that it couldn't be indicted.
Mark Thompson,"If your father didn't work there, chances are an uncle of yours did."
Mark Thompson,"That's just part of how this generation has been raised. You add a $40,000 price tag for a school like Colgate, and you have high expectations for what you get."
Mark Thompson,"We had a strong finish to 2005, a year of major transition for Fairchild, by delivering solid fourth-quarter sales and gross margin growth."
Mark Thompson,"We effectively managed our distribution channel to closely match our shipments in with distributor sales out. Channel re-sales were seasonally down about 3% during the first quarter but were more than 17% higher than a year ago. We managed our sales into the channel to this level of re-sales, resulting in a slight decrease in absolute inventory levels for approximately flat weeks of supply in the channel compared to the prior quarter."
Mark Thompson,"We weren't prepared to take the risk last week with David Johnson, in saying that he's had about two weeks of really solid training where we've really given him a huge amount of work, tried to put match conditioning into him to see if we got through last week, and we have to wait and see whether we choose to play him this week."
Mark Thompson,"However, some specific remarks were inappropriate and ran the risk of calling into question John's own impartiality and, by extension, that of the BBC. We've made it clear to him that this must not happen again."
Mark Thompson,I don't think the game has any problems at all. We shouldn't keep trying to predict how the game might be played in three or four years. Everybody is happy how the game is going now.
Mark Thompson,"We made excellent progress in 2005 by improving our management of the distribution channel, reducing inventories throughout the supply chain and reducing our capital spending and ultimately depreciation expense."
Mark Thompson,We would love to put (a trophy) in there. We played off for one a couple years ago. We played reasonable footy but we lost the game. We didn't handle the loss well.
Mark Thompson,"(The BBC) doesn't have to take cynical or commercial decisions, it should really put its money where its heart is"
Mark Thompson,"I'm happy that he's not playing. Very, very happy."
Mark Thompson,"I don't think Steven King did anything wrong and he shouldn't feel guilt even though he would because of the injury sustained,"
Mark Thompson,"I don't think Steven King did anything wrong and he shouldn't feel guilt even though he would be because of the injuries sustained, but he shouldn't really feel guilty because it could have easily been Steven smothering the ball and Jeff White kicking the ball. That's how simple and quick this game is. It can happen to anyone at any time."
Mark Thompson,"We set some aggressive operational and financial goals in the middle of last year, and I'm pleased to report that Fairchild has delivered impressive first-quarter results, ahead of our expectations."
Mark Thompson,"We remain committed to our gross margin improvement goals that have us reaching 30 percent in 2006 and mid-30 percent in 2007. Our focus in 2006 is on improving our product mix, delivering more new leadership analog and integrated power products while reducing our exposure to lower margin standard products."
Mark Thompson,"My vision for the future of the BBC has three parts: a bold new program and content strategy based above all around the idea of excellence; a transformation of the BBC into a state-of-the art digital broadcaster; and an irreversible shift in the culture of the BBC toward simplicity, opportunity and creativity,"
Mark Thompson,"A couple of years ago I was out with some friends and all they had on the boat was a wakeboard, so I thought, â€˜Why not?'"
Mark Thompson,"The fire had some unusual items that we noticed right away. There were no signs of forced entry, the fire started exterior from the house and there were no normal igniting sources that were in the area."
Mark Thompson,"Even though we haven't got the momentum that we did last year, we've got the experience from last year, which I think is probably more important."
Mark Thompson,"Eventually you know as a coach of a club that you've got to experience these types of games in this type of pressure,"
Mark Thompson,"Even though we have not got the (winning) momentum of last year, we have the experience from last year and that's probably more important. It's a huge difference (to play in Melbourne). We haven't been a team that's travelled well and to play a final in Melbourne is significant even though it's against a team playing at home as well."
Mark Thompson,"What we probably needed to do was not put that expectation on that he's going to kick four goals every game,"
Mark Thompson,"We're very pleased that Mark is joining Fairchild's management team. His strong financial acumen will significantly contribute to the execution of our strategy. We had a strong finish to 2005 and enter 2006 with great momentum, focused on improving our gross margins and increasing the mix of higher-value new products. This is an exciting time for Fairchild, and we look forward to Mark's contributions as we continue to improve the quality of our business and drive stronger financial results."
Mark Thompson,"We are going to review the game on Monday morning and it will be the best education tool you could possibly give,"
Mark Thompson,The plant really touched the life of virtually every person in the country.
Mark Thompson,We've got the confidence that he'll get through the game.
Mark Thompson,"You know if you want to win and want to compete in this competition, this is what you have to do in the finals."
Mark Thompson,"Risk and reward tend to be symmetrical. If you want to be a high-value company, you have to take more risks."
Mark Thompson,Ronnie Barker will be numbered amongst a select band of comedy greats who shaped British comedy in the 20th century.
Mark Thompson,We have lost a giant of comedy. Ronnie Barker will be numbered amongst a select band of greats who shaped British comedy in the twentieth century.
Mark Thompson,"Documentary is quite good at putting on the clothes of other genres, ... But (we) still want a genre that is true to itself -- it takes a lot of will power to say 'that's enough, let's try something else."
Mark Thompson,the choice of commercial providers (would be) fair and open.
Mark Thompson,Like we said ... he's got a bit of a sore knee and sore body basically.
Mark Thompson,"We've just got to wait and see what happens with his body, and it's certainly been a big week for him, it's been a big week in the media."
Mark Thompson,We should aim to deliver public service content to our audiences in whatever media and on whatever device makes sense for them whether they're at home or on the move.
Mark Thompson,"We should do what's right for a strong, independent BBC and its audiences in the long term, not what's politically convenient now,"
Mark Thompson,"We can deliver much more public value when we think across all platforms and consider how audiences can find our best content, content that's more relevant, more useful and more valuable to them."
Mark Thompson,The audiences of tomorrow currently get too little of real value from the BBC and the BBC needs to think how it engages them and reflect their lives better.
Mark Thompson,"All they'll be playing for is to have a win in their last game and it just gives them something to look forward to next season,"
Marvin Thompson,"This has the potential to be a signature type of project, ... I'm not aware of anything else like it in the area."
Marvin Thompson,"I think that's great, ... The greatest commodity we have is the children and they are the future of the valley."
Marvin Thompson,"It is very apparent to me that is not what we want for our children,"
Paul Thompson,We practiced our free throws for an hour and a half after school. I guess it helped.
Paul Thompson,"The years I've had at quarterback have helped me a lot, being able to see a safety spinning down, things like that. It gives me an edge, I can kind of tell where the quarterback is going with the ball a lot of times."
Paul Thompson,"She had a great game. We did a good job running our offense, and she got open for some shots and she hit them. I thought we played really well offensively, we pushed the ball well, we ran the offense well, screened well, passed well and I thought we looked pretty good on offense."
Paul Thompson,"She has done a real nice job this season. She does a nice job running the floor, she's fast, she hustles and she's strong and can finish plays. And she's just a freshman. That's a great combination of things for us to have. We are very excited to see her develop."
Paul Thompson,"She got hot when we needed her to. But she ran the floor well all night, she controlled the offense, she played good defense and showed me a lot of leadership on the floor all game long."
Paul Thompson,"The growth in the city, at least from a housing standpoint, is north and west, and it would make sense for us as a primarily residential home lender to be located in those areas."
Paul Thompson,We had four powerplay goals tonight and we moved that puck around. That was something that I wanted to improve on last year and I have two units that can do that now. I am overjoyed.
Paul Thompson,"We won't go out and score 30 goals against them, we have to be realistic and the first thing is to go for a win."
Paul Thompson,We had to battle from behind all game long. And these girls just kept coming. They never quit.
Paul Thompson,Games between Coventry and Belfast are always close affairs and this was no exception.
Paul Thompson,"Anybody that works hard and puts time and effort and dedication toward something and doesn't seem like they're getting anywhere, it's frustrating at times,"
Richard Thompson,"The great thing about this stuff is you don't have to worry about maintaining it. All we have to do is replace it every 10 years or so, and even then our expenses won't be nearly as high as the first time around. We're just having to pay a lot more this time because of our drainage problems. To us, this is just a smart move."
Richard Thompson,A thousand opinions by a court that a particular scientific theory is invalid will not make that scientific theory invalid. It is going to be up to the scientists who are going to continue to do research in their labs that will ultimately determine that.
Richard Thompson,"Music is a great healer, a great diffuser of things like racism. It cuts through boundaries, and it's a very positive force in the world."
Richard Thompson,"Lenders now feel the agenda has changed, with inquiries looking at virtually every source of income. Some aspect of these inquiries appears to be based upon an assumption of excess profitability. This seems dubious when you look at the numbers."
Richard Thompson,This is the kind of surveillance system that really allows us to first identify how far the disease is spreading and then to rapidly move in and cull birds that might have been exposed and to clean areas to reduce the possibility that humans can become infected even from the droppings of these birds.
Richard Thompson,"Intelligent design is now being adopted by a number of credible scientists. If the Dover school district wins this case, you're going to see intelligent design popping up on school board agendas all over the country."
Richard Thompson,"We were attempting to restore the culture of Britain for the British, ... But the English, in particular, aren't comfortable with their own culture. To be taken seriously, it has to come from somewhere else. So we remained a cult band."
Richard Thompson,But music can save your life sometimes. It probably saved me from working in a bank or something. That's a kind of salvation right there.
Richard Thompson,It's amazing what some people read into songs.
Richard Thompson,I want people to come to my music without prejudice. I want them to get the music first. And who I am isn't that important. If they like the songs to me that's a good thing.
Richard Thompson,"There's a part of me that wishes I'd never said one single solitary word on any subject publicly. Then I could have been the tortured poet, and there's so much mileage in that. But it's too late to stop now."
Richard Thompson,I just like to entertain myself by sitting down and writing songs.
Richard Thompson,"It's an honor to have this job and, to me, the greatest thing is to be up on stage and to feel that connection with an audience."
Richard Thompson,I'm always making a conscious effort to be viable and accessible.
Richard Thompson,"Amplifying acoustic instruments more than a little is really cheating, and everything becomes a compromise."
Richard Thompson,It's fun to sing sad songs. And it's fun to listen to sad songs. Enjoyable. Satisfying. Something.
Richard Thompson,"What I wanted to hear didn't exist, so it was necessary for me to go out and create it."
Richard Thompson,I probably wrote three-quarters of the songs without an instrument in my hands.
Richard Thompson,"As the writer, you're always a presence in the song. If you get close to what human beings are like, you're writing about common experience. We all do much the same things, so if you nail somebody, then you've also nailed yourself."
Richard Thompson,"Well, first of all it's entertainment. That stops us becoming too pretentious or thinking we're great artists."
Richard Thompson,"When you stand up acoustic in front of an audience, you really are a man without any clothes on. And that can be fun - it depends how much of an exhibitionist you are, I suppose. I quite enjoy it."
Richard Thompson,The best thing you've got going for you is individuality.
Richard Thompson,"I'm glad there are a lot of guitar players pursuing technique as diligently as they possibly can, because it leaves this whole other area open to people like me."
Richard Thompson,"I try to look for the good in everybody, regardless of the way they're labeled."
Richard Thompson,It's hard to tell where one tour ends and the next begins. I'm generally touring most of any year. I'm just generally out there doing it.
Richard Thompson,I have to remind myself not to set boundaries.
Richard Thompson,All audiences should be slightly off balance.
Richard Thompson,"People want to hear about the extremes of human nature. They want things that are larger than their own lives, and more romantic, and not necessarily of their own experiences."
Richard Thompson,I like the idea of playing in unison with yourself.
Richard Thompson,I'll try to imagine something and see what happens. But it usually winds up being about something fairly concrete and close to home.
Richard Thompson,To stand up on a stage alone with an acoustic guitar requires bravery bordering on heroism. Bordering on insanity.
Richard Thompson,You want the audience to be uncomfortable.
Richard Thompson,"I suppose the mindset for a band show is more that you overpower the audience. That sounds rather totalitarian, doesn't it?"
Richard Thompson,"We're out to change America, ... Cats are hiding in homes and dogs are out on the street causing trouble. We're going to bring cats to the forefront."
Richard Thompson,I try to make songs visual and tactile to kind of put you into the action.
Richard Thompson,"The thing I do, really, is a communication with audiences more than any achievement through records."
Robert Thompson,"To have a public intellectual host the Oscars, that doesn't happen too much. My biggest worry would be that he'd upstage the entire night."
Robert Thompson,There's a place for what Geraldo does in the universe of journalistic commentary. I'm just not sure they've always found the right place for him to be . . . including this new show.
Robert Thompson,"The only difference is that television is such a predominant medium. ... Radio used to have sitcoms and doctor shows and cop shows and game shows and all the different genres, and television wrestled that primary entertainment away from it. But I think in terms of its impact on the medium of radio, yes, this is going to be a very big deal."
Robert Thompson,It shows just how good television can be.
Robert Thompson,"It's the only television entity of any kind that ever had a generation named after it,"
Robert Thompson,This is new technology serving an old idea. You build up all this cultural equity in a hit TV show and you want to spread that equity value to as many places as you can.
Robert Thompson,"Star Search' was an old-fashioned 'Ted Mack Amateur Hour' kind of a talent show. This is three dramas in one: the drama of the judges, the drama of the old becoming a rock star [and] grabbing the brass ring, the drama of the whole vote in, and all the rest of it."
Robert Thompson,Technology Enterprise Park is the latest addition to the successful and ongoing efforts to foster the commercialization of research at Georgia Tech through Georgia Advanced Technology Ventures.
Robert Thompson,"So many of these reality shows sound so egregious on paper. The automatic response when you hear this is to think, 'Oh man, how low can we sink?' But it's all going to depend on how it's executed."
Robert Thompson,These reality TV shows are a way in which some of these subjects can be explored. The reality TV format is the sacrifice and price you pay to get a big audience to watch it.
Robert Thompson,Reality TV comes along and it proceeds to marry with every other type of program and have offspring. We've got reality TV married to a talent show ? 'Nashville Star' and 'American Idol.' And now I think the same is happening with home improvement shows.
Robert Thompson,"Reality has taken a major hit. But it's far from dead, and some form of this stuff is going to be on television for at least the next century, if not longer."
Robert Thompson,"It really kind of works in its absolute, utter simplicity, its kind of stripped down Zen-like quality."
Robert Thompson,"I think to some extent the opportunity to go and take the place of an iconic figure of rock and roll, well, what's the psychology of not wanting to do that? You'll see a kid play air guitar in a garage. It's the same thing, ... It's easy for these people to get teased, and some behave in ways that they invite it. But I don't think it's intrinsically sick or strange. What is colonial Williamsburg but people in historical drag?"

But I don't think it's intrinsically sick or strange. What is colonial Williamsburg but people in historical drag?"
Robert Thompson,"The way new music combined and recombined was an exciting story,"
Robert Thompson,"Then, all of a sudden, it was big money. It went from small stakes to huge stakes, but at the same time, it was still very challenging."
Robert Thompson,You could have men landing on Mars and Idol would beat it.
Robert Thompson,The first round goes to management.
Robert Thompson,"If you were to take that away, it wouldn't be March Madness. It turns it into the same kind of fun like playing the lottery."
Robert Thompson,"There are two revolutions taking place. One revolution is taking place in the living room with high definition, bigger and wider screens. The second revolution is portable television."
Robert Thompson,"From the outside you look at these contestants and think 'get a life,' but within certain subcultures Ã¹ and we're all in one that looks strange to the outside Ã¹ if you're a part of that rabid fan community, this is one of the ways you express it and rise to the top of that subculture."
Robert Thompson,"You're seeing law enforcement falling apart and a modern, industrialized city brought to a complete breakdown, and these stories about the looting and the sniper fire are very much playing into this."
Robert Thompson,You can see how real this was. You can't fake that kind of joy.
Robert Thompson,"It's a policy to honor donor intent. It's a double-edged sword and it's one we don't like to have to encounter, but we understand and do our best to let people know we've reached our fund-raising goals in those instances."
Robert Thompson,"This is like Casey at the Bat , except instead of striking out, Jason hits a home run. And it gets better. He keeps hitting shot after shot."
Robert Thompson,"Clinton playing the sax -- that's the gold standard. Number one -- because very few candidates had made such appearances before and -- number two -- because he did it on Arsenio Hall, which was kind of a cool, late night thing at the time. But most importantly, he played the sax. That would even be unusual today."
Robert Thompson,Thank God that somebody did find it. I grew up with her father -- we all kind of grew up together -- so I've known them forever.
Robert Thompson,"The genius of Nickelodeon is that they figured a couple things out, ... They knew that especially among the very young, it was the parent that chose to turn on the TV, so Nickelodeon came up with a program that would appeal to their targets and the parents. They had shows that were cool enough that even the older sibling would watch."
Robert Thompson,These are the things that make the Oscars fun.
Robert Thompson,"Pure and simple, these things are promotional tools. They're more fun to consume than 30-second ads, but they're still advertising. If you can get people to go to a show like 'Lost' or 'The Office' every week, why not get them to participate at other times? You exploit the existence of this universe you've created and squeeze out more audience participation."
Robert Thompson,There's no way that (anyone) comes up with a (family) tier that in any meaningful way accomplishes what it's supposed to because you have to include the broadcast networks.
Robert Thompson,I think what NBC has figured out is what the model of doing big events is going to be.
Robert Thompson,"How television and the culture are absorbing Katrina is certainly different than how they absorbed Sept. 11. Four years ago, all culture was put on pause. But people have continued to watch comedies and dramas and reality shows throughout, even when things were at their grimmest."
Robert Thompson,You can redefine the place of Mars in pop culture. It's close enough to interact with.
Robert Thompson,It's totally possible for this thing not to hit the mass-culture radar screen.
Robert Thompson,Mozart is one of the few great masters who has truly penetrated pop culture. He's the universal donor Ã» you could find something of his to use just for just about anything.
Robert Thompson,"These kinds of characters are so satisfying to male viewers because culture has told them to be powerful and effective and to get things done, and at the same time they're living, operating and working in places that are constantly defying that."
Robert Thompson,"These are fundamental, foundational themes in American culture. And they all get played out here in ... the journalistic perfect storm."
Robert Thompson,"When Ellen came back with the Emmys [in November 2001], she was coming back to a culture that had been put on total and complete hold, ... a felicitous coincidence."
Robert Thompson,"When Ellen came back with the Emmys (in November 2001), she was coming back to a culture that had been put on total and complete hold, ... a felicitous coincidence."
Robert Thompson,"As soon as distilled spirits were discovered and their effect on one's consciousness known, they became an important part of the tradition."
Robert Thompson,rough contrivance to lift from the social conscience a burden that should not be either lifted or lightened in any way.
Robert Thompson,An Oscar is not a charm that's going to keep bad things from happening to you anymore than it's a curse that's going to guarantee them. I don't think there's anything about getting an Oscar that should make you more vulnerable to having your career tank.
Robert Thompson,"It sounds so cruel but some of these telethons - even though you're doing it completely for charity - are very important gigs for your career,"
Robert Thompson,"New Year's Day was the perfect time for football because you could roll out of bed and you could start watching football, even before you manage to mix your aspirin and water. The second (of January) is just not the same. Some people are going to have to get up. The dynamic gets broken. The whole calculus changes."
Robert Thompson,"Farrah Fawcett was in the prime of her big-haired, buxom beauty. She was the kind of person who could completely make 'Battle of the Network Stars' work. She was kind of goofy and she was such a huge star and you really wanted to see what she was like. And what you saw was a little peculiar and that made it fun."
Robert Thompson,They have the biggest audience of the year. And what we watch is the modern version of a 1950s variety show.
Robert Thompson,"Now, I think candidates realize that they've got to collect these constituencies, these audiences, like you would assemble a patch-work quilt,"
Robert Thompson,The star approval in OK! makes it less sleazy on one level and therefore less interesting.
Robert Thompson,There are two things people love in America: attention and money.
Robert Thompson,The '50s and '60s were an enormous golden age.
Robert Thompson,"By the time this happened, the whole Martha Stewart style was beginning to show its age. What is strange is her being elevated beyond her fan base to world-class celebrity, thanks to a trial and conviction, and brought to a place in our culture that is much bigger than before."
Steve Thompson,They're absolutely for real. They have talent and Tom has made a big difference.
Steve Thompson,My problems start when the smarter bears and the dumber visitors intersect.
Steve Thompson,We've just not gathered the points our consistency of performance has deserved but everyone did their jobs and this time we were rewarded.
Steve Thompson,"Cody Powell and Eddie, all the linebackers played exceptionally, and I can't say enough about the secondary. (Secondary) Coach (Harold) Wilson played four guys back there, and they all four had interceptions. Replacing eight guys, yeah, they've done a super job."
Steve Thompson,There are a whole host of challenges. The simple fact is that more demands have been put on the river than it can support.
Steve Thompson,"Flu viruses are typically respiratory, but bird flu has been shown to attack intestinal tracts in animals as well. That affects the way pets can pass the virus to each other."
Steve Thompson,"It's a great sport for a young shooter to get into. My advice is to practice, have a lot of patience and a lot of persistence. Remember that you're working against an adversary that has better hearing, better sight and better smell than any animal out there. And he uses all three, all the time."
Steve Thompson,"Anything that enhances our ability to serve the public in case of emergency is a good thing,"
Steven Thompson,"I really am excited, but I am in no way going to rest on my laurels. Now, there's light at the end of the tunnel."
Steven Thompson,"One of our concerns about playing in the southern Caribbean is the quality of the playing surface. However, I have played at that stadium before and at that time the surface was exceptional. At the end of the day our focus has to be on what we do between the white lines on game day."
Steven Thompson,"The impact of Latin America on the United States is extraordinary, but sometimes ignored by policy makers. This program will help Latin America receive the recognition it deserves in the formation of our country."
Ted Thompson,"He still runs around, still plays with passion. I don't see anything diminished there."
Ted Thompson,"I think he can still play, and I think he still has the passion to play."
Ted Thompson,"Decisions like this are never easy. They require a lot of thought and consternation, but at the end of the day I felt like we needed to go in a different direction."
Ted Thompson,"It was a brief conversation. Naturally, he was disappointed. I thanked him for all he has done for the Green Bay Packers over the last six years. I think he's done a fine job under some difficult circumstances and maintained a winning tradition of the Green Bay Packers."
Ted Thompson,We practiced against that play during the week. They do a lot of different things with him. He's a marvelous athlete. He's got speed.
Tom Thompson,He told me some of our guys were having trouble hitting the goalie in warmups.
Tom Thompson,"I just think sometimes you have to have patience with these things, ... I go back to my lawyer days, doing all those big insurance claims [in Manitoba], and sometimes you are close but you just don't know it. It's hard to predict these things. And sometimes it's not so much a money matter as it is the timing. Sometimes things happen a little slower than you'd like, and that's the way it is. It's nothing personal at all -- you just have to be patient."
Tom Thompson,"I know he had 11 goals [as a freshman], but 10 of them were on the power play. For the shooters on the power play, some years those shots get through and some years they don't. He doesn't have to be a power-play quarterback to make our team."
Tom Thompson,"The landscape is still very hazy for next year, but clearly Patrick's stock has certainly gone up. The consistency of his performances is what has been most pleasing for us."
Tom Thompson,"If something happens, it's going to be sociological rather than technological. We won't see Y2K problems because of computers. It's just not going to happen."
Tom Thompson,"We are very proud to be recognized by Yellow Ribbon America and the National Guard for our support of American troops and their families. As a veteran myself, I understand the importance of local, neighborhood-level support for military families. We feel it is a privilege and honor to be in a position to make a direct, positive impact on the lives of those who are in service to their country."
Tommy Thompson,Corporate America is like everybody  they read it and see it on television but they really can't completely digest it.
Tommy Thompson,"We've lost 3,000 jobs in Beaufort County . We've lost half of our manufacturing workforce."
Tommy Thompson,"Employers are increasingly turning to consumer-driven health plans to reduce costs and help workers and their families make better health care decisions. Not only do companies protect their bottom lines, they help make employees better health consumers."
Tommy Thompson,We're asking the fast food industry and all of the restaurants to start looking at their menus and see if they can diversify and put healthier foods on there and help to promote them.
Tommy Thompson,"Weyauwega is a microcosm of how to handle a disaster. This was an example of an emergency situation that would have been a disaster save for the fact we moved quickly and, I believe, correctly."
Tommy Thompson,"In view of the rapidly rising rates of obesity and diabetes in America, this good news could not have come at a better time, ... So many of our health problems can be avoided through diet, exercise and making sure we take care of ourselves. By promoting healthy lifestyles, we can improve the quality of life for all Americans, and reduce health care costs dramatically."
David Thomson,"It's funny - writing the afterword required a lot of digging and research, and was ultimately harder than editing the actual novel,"
David Thomson,"There's a funny thing to when you're writing something that's not quite yours. You feel unburdened. There's a strange liberty to it, although I was still trying to be faithful to them."
David Thomson,"There had never been such a display of dangerous, brutal male beauty on an American stage -- its influence can still be felt, in fashion photography and sport as well as acting."
David Thomson,"It's not profound literature, but it's an adventure story and quite a good adventure story, very unexpected coming from Brando. It tells us a lot about him."
David Thomson,We have more (potential) sites than the ability to fill them.
Peter Thomson,"A light, tender, sensitive touch is worth a ton of brawn"

Henry David Thoreau,"Men are born to succeed, not to fail."
Henry David Thoreau,Youth gets together with their materials to build a bridge to the moon or maybe a palace on earth; then in middle age they decide to build a woodshed with them instead.

Henry David Thoreau,All good things are cheap: all bad are very dear.
Henry David Thoreau,There is no more fatal blunderer than he who consumes the greater part of his life getting his living.
Henry David Thoreau,"Most men would feel insulted if it were proposed to employ them in throwing stones over a wall, and then in throwing them back, merely that they might earn their wages. But many are no more worthily employed now."
Henry David Thoreau,The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement.
Henry David Thoreau,It is characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.
Henry David Thoreau,Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.
Henry David Thoreau,A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone.
Henry David Thoreau,Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only
Henry David Thoreau,"All voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong."
Henry David Thoreau,The broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested virtue to sustain it.

Henry David Thoreau,That virtue we appreciate is as much ours as another s. We see so much only as we possess.
Henry David Thoreau,The universe is wider than our views of it.
Henry David Thoreau,We shall see but little way if we require to understand what we see. How few things can a man measure with the tape of his understanding! How many greater things might he be seeing in the meanwhile!

Henry David Thoreau,"Between whom there is hearty truth, there is love."
Henry David Thoreau,Where there is a lull in truth an institution springs up.
Henry David Thoreau,I think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere.
Henry David Thoreau,"Far travel, very far travel, or travail, comes to almost the worth of staying home."
Henry David Thoreau,Only the traveling is good which reveals to me the value of home and enables me to enjoy it better.
Henry David Thoreau,"He who is only a traveler learns things at second-hand and by the halves, and is poor authority. We are most interested when science reports what those men already know practically or instinctively, for that alone is a true humanity, or account of human experience."
Henry David Thoreau,"To him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning."
Henry David Thoreau,Each thought that is welcomed and recorded is a nest egg by the side of which more will be laid.

Henry David Thoreau,"However intense my experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of me, which, as it were, is not a part of me, but a spectator, sharing no experience, but taking note of it, and that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it may be the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It was a kind of fiction, a work of the imagination only, so far as he was concerned."
Henry David Thoreau,I have never found a companion so companionable as solitude.
Henry David Thoreau,"I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone, I never found the companionable as solitude."

Henry David Thoreau,I have been breaking silence these twenty-three years and have hardly made a rent in it.

Henry David Thoreau,A man sits as many risks as he runs.
Henry David Thoreau,That man is richest whose pleasures are the cheapest.
Henry David Thoreau,"The rich man is always sold to the institution which makes him rich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue."

Henry David Thoreau,"Make the most of your regrets; never smother your sorrow, but tend and cherish it till it comes to have a separate and integral interest. To regret deeply is to live afresh."
Henry David Thoreau,"Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured and far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple tree or an oak."

Henry David Thoreau,"To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically."
Henry David Thoreau,"What sort of philosophers are we, who know absolutely nothing about the origin and destiny of cats?"
Henry David Thoreau,"Yet some can be patriotic who have no self-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less. They love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in their heads."
Henry David Thoreau,"Do what you love. Know you own bone; gnaw at it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw it still."
Henry David Thoreau,"We can never have enough of nature. We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and titanic features, the sea-coast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees, the thunder-cloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks and produces freshets. We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander."
Henry David Thoreau,There is more of good nature than of good sense at the bottom of most marriages
Henry David Thoreau,Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself.

Henry David Thoreau,"If we knew all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the description of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular results at that point. Now we know only a few laws, and our result is vitiated, not, of course, by any confusion or irregularity in Nature, but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation. Our notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances which we detect; but the harmony which results from a far greater number of seemingly conflicting, but really concurring, laws, which we have not detected, is still more wonderful. The particular laws are as our points of view, as, to the traveler, a mountain outline varies with every step, and it has an infinite number of profiles, though absolutely but one form. Even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended in its entireness."

Henry David Thoreau,"If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood.

Henry David Thoreau,"A broad margin of leisure is as beautiful in a man's life as in a book. Haste makes waste, no less in life than in housekeeping.

Henry David Thoreau,There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.
Henry David Thoreau,"In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of the ages. Time is but a stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it, but when I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away but eternity remains."

Almost every shrub and tree has its gall, oftentimes esteemed its chief ornament and hardly to be distinguished from the fruit. If misery loves company, misery has company enough. Now, at midsummer, find me a perfect leaf or fruit."

Henry David Thoreau,"If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment."

Henry David Thoreau,"I belive that there is a subtile magnetism in Nature, which, if we unconsciously yield to it, will direct us aright. It is not indifferent to us which way we walk. There is a right way; but we are very liable from heedlessness and stupidity to take the wrong one. We would fain take that walk, never yet taken by us through this actual world, which is perfectly symbolical of the path which we love to travel in the interior and ideal world; and sometimes, no doubt, we find it difficult to choose our direction, because it does not yet exist distinctly in our idea."

Henry David Thoreau,"True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard of one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core of truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if it were a revelation to him.

Henry David Thoreau,How earthy old people become --moldy as the grave! Their wisdom smacks of the earth. There is no foretaste of immortality in it. They remind me of earthworms and mole crickets.
Henry David Thoreau,"The youth gets together his materials to build a bridge to the moon, or, perchance, a palace or temple on the earth, and, at length, the middle-aged man concludes to build a woodshed with them."
Henry David Thoreau,None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm
Henry David Thoreau,"As for the pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs."

Henry David Thoreau,"The man who is dissatisfied with himself, what can he do?"
Henry David Thoreau,"All endeavor calls for the ability to tramp the last mile, shape the last plan, endure the last hours toil. The fight to the finish spirit is the one... characteristic we must posses if we are to face the future as finishers."

Henry David Thoreau,What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?
Henry David Thoreau,"If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer. But if he spends his days as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time, he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen."
Henry David Thoreau,Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.

Edward Thorndike,"Colors fade, temples crumble, empires fall, but wise words endure."
Edward Thorndike,"When, instead of merely associating some act with some situation in the animal way, we think the situation out, we have a set of particular feelings of its elements."
Edward Thorndike,To the intelligent man with an interest in human nature it must often appear strange that so much of the energy of the scientific world has been spent on the study of the body and so little on the study of the mind.
Edward Thorndike,"This growth in the number, speed of formation, permanence, delicacy and complexity of associations possible for an animal reaches its acme in the case of man."
Edward Thorndike,"There is no reasoning, no process of inference or comparison; there is no thinking about things, no putting two and two together; there are no ideas - the animal does not think of the box or of the food or of the act he is to perform."
Edward Thorndike,The un-conscious distortion of the facts is almost harmless compared to the unconscious neglect of an animal's mental life until it verges on the unusual and marvelous.
Edward Thorndike,The restriction of studies of human intellect and character to studies of conscious states was not without influence on a scientific studies of animal psychology.
Edward Thorndike,The real difference between a man's scientific judgments about himself and the judgment of others about him is he has added sources of knowledge.
Edward Thorndike,"The intellectual evolution of the race consists in an increase in the number, delicacy, complexity, permanence and speed of formation of such associations."
Edward Thorndike,"The function of intellect is to provide a means of modifying our reactions to the circumstances of life, so that we may secure pleasure, the symptom of welfare."
Edward Thorndike,"The dog, on the other hand, has few or no ideas because his brain acts in coarse fashion and because there are few connections with each single process."
Edward Thorndike,"Some statements concern the conscious states of the animal, what he is to himself as an inner life; others concern his original and acquired ways of response, his behavior, what he is an outside observer."
Edward Thorndike,So the animal finally performs in that situation only the fitting act.
Edward Thorndike,"Psychology is the science of the intellects, characters and behavior of animals including man."
Edward Thorndike,Psychology helps to measure the probability that an aim is attainable.
Edward Thorndike,"On the whole, the psychological work of the last quarter of the nineteenth century emphasized the study of consciousness to the neglect of the total life of intellect and character."
Edward Thorndike,Nowhere more truly than in his mental capacities is man a part of nature.
Edward Thorndike,"Just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany, so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology."
Edward Thorndike,"It will, of course, be understood that directly or indirectly, soon or late, every advance in the sciences of human nature will contribute to our success in controlling human nature and changing it to the advantage of the common weal."
Edward Thorndike,Human folk are as a matter of fact eager to find intelligence in animals.
Edward Thorndike,"Human education is concerned with certain changes in the intellects, characters and behavior of men, its problems being roughly included under these four topics: Aims, materials, means and methods."
Edward Thorndike,Human beings are accustomed to think of intellect as the power of having and controlling ideas and of ability to learn as synonymous with ability to have ideas. But learning by having ideas is really one of the rare and isolated events in nature.
Edward Thorndike,From the lowest animals of which we can affirm intelligence up to man this type of intellect is found.
Edward Thorndike,For origin and development of human faculty we must look to these processes of association in lower animals.
Edward Thorndike,Dogs get lost hundreds of times and no one ever notices it or sends an account of it to a scientific magazine.
Edward Thorndike,"Amongst the minds of animals that of man leads, not as a demigod from another planet, but as a king from the same race."
Scott Thornton,"We've got a spare room, and he can come and go as he pleases. He won't have to worry about a hotel, and he'll get a few home-cooked meals from my wife. ... He's bigger than me, though, so I can't lay down the law too much."
Scott Thornton,"It was a little bit of a transition year for me learning how to play Ron Wilson-style hockey. It's different than anything I was ever used to. It's a lot of hard work, but I think I got a handle on it by the end of the year. This year I'm looking forward to a great start."
Scott Thornton,We had the heart and we knew that we could beat them. We showed that in the fourth quarter like that they had that 10-point lead to start the second half. We knew that if we just kept working at it that we could beat them and we almost did. It's just a really tough loss.
Scott Thornton,"At times we worked hard, we had some individuals working hard, but we also had some passengers. We can't have that at this time of the year."
Scott Thornton,"Today, fitness is the norm, especially on a team like ours and the style we play, ... You have to be in the best shape you can just to keep up."
Ian Thorpe,It was tough but I was able to produce a pretty good performance and I'm ecstatic about the result.
Ian Thorpe,"I'm excited about swimming the event because I won my first Olympic gold medal in the event,"
Ian Thorpe,I don't know which events are really going to be right for me at the moment. I've got to work that out and I'm not going to rush it.
Jim Thorpe,"[Thorpe had always known that to be true, but he had never done anything about it. Singh's words were a wake-up call. From that day on, despite being Singh's senior by 14 years, he gradually took Vijay's lead about how to practice. Since turning 50 in 1999, Thorpe has won seven times on the senior circuit and earned $7.8Â million.] I owe Vijay, ... His attitude is, 'As hard as Tiger works, I work harder and I'm going to beat him.' I'm trying to do the same thing on my tour."
Jim Thorpe,"The integration of the two networks in the Lexington area gives our valued customers increased coverage, improved call quality and the ability to make calls in more places, whether they are on the road, at work, or at home. Our network is the foundation of our business, and we are continually working to make it even stronger than it already is."
Jim Thorpe,"Man, ... I've had enough of this s---."
Jim Thorpe,There's nothing wrong with giving.
Jim Thorpe,You have to use a lot of creativity out there.

Grant Thrall,"Typically, you don't go vertical until the land values are so high you can't go horizontal anymore."
Grant Thrall,"If we're going to have access to higher education in the state, there will have to be more branches of already existing campuses or new campuses."
Grant Thrall,There are various areas in the state where students don't have good access to higher education.
Grant Thrall,It is a necessity if our objective is to provide higher quality education. It's not uncommon that a very good student has to go away to Orlando or South Florida.
Jeff Thredgold,Money will go back from real estate to stocks.
Jeff Thredgold,"Per capita measures of income are always a little bit distorted when you talk about places like Utah or Idaho, mainly because we have substantially more children per adult. We have in Utah 50 percent more children per adult than the national average, so any per capita or per-person measure of income, we'll always be on the low side."
Jeff Thredgold,"The economy is still doing extremely well. We're declining, but declining from a high level."
Jeff Thredgold,Colorado's economy is clearly doing better.
Jeff Thredgold,"We've got strong in-migration, strong job creation, and the jobs are being created in as many high-income areas as in low-income areas."
Jeff Thredgold,"Statewide, Utah should remain among the top 15 among states in appreciation and maybe even break into the top 10 by the end of the year."
Jeff Thredgold,"The economy is firing on all cylinders. Construction is very strong. Home price appreciation is very strong. The commercial real estate sector is very strong. Utah ? right now, its performance is about as good as at any time, ever."
Thucydides,History is Philosophy teaching by examples.
Thucydides,"Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong;  the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior"
Thucydides,"The superior gratification derived from the use and contemplation of costly and supposedly beautiful products is, commonly, in great measure a gratification of our sense of costliness masquerading under the name of beauty."
Kevin Thuman,"Ian has a load of potential. This is really his first big scoring game for us. It came at a great time for us. He showed flashes of this before. Hopefully this is a beginning for him. Maybe he was lacking a little confidence, like our team was."
Kevin Thuman,"It was a positive, heart-felt exchange about coming out and trying to do things a little differently. (Gardner) thought we could press more and distribute the ball a little better and it's something that really lifted the team."
Kevin Thuman,"Our captains did a great job of setting an example for our younger kids. They could have easily letdown, but they really embraced their role as leaders and came to practice ready to work hard and improve."
Kevin Thuman,(Central) played exceptionally hard. We had to focus our energy to Murray to make him work hard on his shots.
Kevin Thuman,"Confidence-wise for us, that was very good. We have struggled getting out. In the last three games, we've been down at the end of the first quarter."
Kevin Thuman,"When you?re 4-16, gaining a little confidence is everything and getting ahead early really gave us a boost and allowed us to play our tempo."

Johnny Thunders,No one really knows me. People think they know me.

Johnny Thunders,"I've got three boys. They look like me. They're called Dino, Guido and Little Johnny. They're my whole life. They mean more to me than music."
Johnny Thunders,I wouldn't change a thing - except my bank balance.
Johnny Thunders,I was in Sweden for 10 days. They put me on the front page of the daily papers eight days in a row. I did nothing to warrant any of the attention. It was ridiculous.
Johnny Thunders,I take smack because I enjoy it. I enjoy all it makes me feel. I don't do it to be in with the in crowd. I can rock out with it.
Johnny Thunders,I met Sable when she was 15 and I was 18. I sent her home to New York while we carried on the tour. When we got back the police were looking for her at the airport and everywhere!
Johnny Thunders,I don't eat cereal actually... Frosted Flakes... that's as close as I can get.
Johnny Thunders,A lot of people want to die for a lot of reasons.
Johnny Thunders,"A lot of people don't think they can count on me, but I've never missed a gig in my life."
Lars Thunell,"But the growth is uneven, and there is a huge unfinished agenda."
Lars Thunell,Emerging markets as a group have proved they can sustain high growth and attract capital. There is tremendous dynamism but there is a huge unfinished agenda.
Lars Thunell,"The new IFC standards are stronger, better, and more comprehensive than those of any other international finance institution working with the private sector. We aim, with these new policies, to increase the development impact of projects in which we invest. We also seek to give companies operating projects in emerging markets the capacity to manage fully their environmental and social risks and to compete better in a global economy."
Lars Thunell,"As the government privatization program gains momentum, IFC will be placing greater emphasis on the broader infrastructure sector including electricity, ports and logistics."
Lars Thunell,"The DRC has been successful recently at turning its economy around, from contraction in the early 2000s to estimated growth of seven per cent in 2005. This is particularly impressive considering the challenges this country has faced. The DRC is rich in human and natural resources, and IFC will continue to promote private sector development in support of the country's economic regeneration."
James Thurber,Some American writers who have known each other for years have never met in the daytime or when both were sober.
James Thurber,"When all things are equal, translucence in writing is more effective than transparency, just as glow is more revealing than glare."
James Thurber,A pinch of probability is worth a pound of perhaps
James Thurber,A burden in the bush is worth two on your hands
James Thurber,The vivid images that are coming across the television are really destroying his image as a leader.
James Thurber,"But those rare souls whose spirit gets magically into the hearts of men, leave behind them something more real and warmly personal than bodily presence, an ineffable and eternal thing. It is everlasting life touching us as something more than a vague, recondite concept. The sound of a great name dies like an echo; the splendor of fame fades into nothing; but the grace of a fine spirit pervades the places through which it has passed, like the haunting loveliness of mignonette."
James Thurber,"I love the idea of there being two sexes, don't you?"
James Thurber,"Every man is occasionally visited by the suspicion that the planet on which he is riding is not really going anywhere; that the Force which controls its measured eccentricities hasn't got anything special in mind. If he broods on this somber theme long enough he gets the doleful idea that the laughing children on a merry-go-round or the thin, fine hands of a lady's watch are revolving more purposely than he is."
James Thurber,"We are a nation that has always gone in for the loud laugh, the wow, the yak, the belly laugh, and the dozen other labels for the roll- em-in-the-aisles gagerissimo. This is the kind of laugh that delights actors, directors, and producers, but dismays writers of comedy because it is the laugh that often dies in the lobby. The appreciative smile, the chuckle, the soundless mirth, so important to the success of comedy, cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it."
James Thurber,"The laughter of man is more terrible than his tears, and takes more forms / hollow, heartless, mirthless, maniacal."
James Thurber,Hundreds of hysterical persons must confuse these phenomena with messages from the beyond and take their glory to the bishop rather than the eye doctor.
James Thurber,"The past is an old armchair in the attic, the present an ominous ticking sound, and the future is anybody's guess"
James Thurber,"The dog has got more fun out of Man than Man has got out of the dog, for the clearly demonstrable reason that Man is the more laughable of the two animals"
James Thurber,Whether it's a crisis or not depends on how long these high prices are sustained.
James Thurber,"One has but to observe a community of beavers at work in a stream to understand the loss in his sagacity, balance, co-operation, competence, and purpose which Man has suffered since he rose up on his hind legs. He began to chatter and he developed Reason, Thought, and Imagination, qualities which would get the smartest group of rabbits or orioles in the world into inextricable trouble overnight."
James Thurber,Early to rise and early to bed  Makes a male healthy and wealthy and dead
James Thurber,"Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness"
James Thurber,"The laughter of man is more terrible than his tears, and takes more forms hollow, heartless, mirthless, maniacal."
James Thurber,"Sophistication might be described as the ability to cope gracefully with a situation involving the presence of a formidable menace to one's poise and prestige (such as the butler, or the man under the bed - but never the husband)."
James Thurber,"My opposition to Interviews lies in the fact that offhand answers have little value or grace of expression, and that such oral give and take helps to perpetuate the decline of the English language."
James Thurber,"Man has gone long enough, or even too long, without being man enough to face the simple truth that the trouble with man is man."
James Thurber,There is no exception to the rule that every rule has an exception.
James Thurber,You might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backward.
James Thurber,The nation that complacently and fearfully allows its artists and writers to become suspected rather than respected is no longer regarded as a nation possessed with humor or depth.
James Thurber,The wit makes fun of other persons; the satirist makes fun of the world; the humorist makes fun of himself.
James Thurber,"I am not a cat man, but a dog man, and all felines can tell this at a glance - a sharp, vindictive glance."
James Thurber,"With sixty staring me in the face, I have developed inflammation of the sentence structure and definite hardening of the paragraphs."
James Thurber,"The past is an old armchair in the attic, the present an ominous ticking sound, and the future is anybody's guess."
James Thurber,Early to rise and early to bed makes a male healthy and wealthy and dead.
James Thurber,"The dog has got more fun out of Man than Man has got out of the dog, for the clearly demonstrable reason that Man is the more laughable of the two animals."
James Thurber,"It is better to have loafed and lost, than never to have loafed at all."
James Thurber,"Don't get it right, just get it written."
James Thurber,"One martini is all right. Two are too many, and three are not enough."
James Thurber,Nowadays men lead lives of noisy desperation.
James Thurber,"Laughter need not be cut out of anything, since it improves everything."
James Thurber,Last night I dreamed of a small consolation enjoyed only by the blind: Nobody knows the trouble I've not seen!
James Thurber,"The sanity of the average banquet speaker lasts about two and a half months; at the end of that time he begins to mutter to himself, and calls out in his sleep."

James Thurber,"The appreciative smile, the chuckle, the soundless mirth, so important to the success of comedy, cannot be understood unless one sits among the audience and feels the warmth created by the quality of laughter that the audience takes home with it."
James Thurber,Man is flying too fast for a world that is round. Soon he will catch up with himself in a great rear end collision.
James Thurber,Why do you have to be a nonconformist like everybody else?
James Thurber,You can fool too many of the people too much of the time.
James Thurber,A drawing is always dragged down to the level of its caption.
James Thurber,"I'm 65 and I guess that puts me in with the geriatrics. But if there were fifteen months in every year, I'd only be 48. That's the trouble with us. We number everything. Take women, for example. I think they deserve to have more than twelve years between the ages of 28 and 40."
James Thurber,Sixty minutes of thinking of any kind is bound to lead to confusion and unhappiness.
James Thurber,Love is the strange bewilderment that overtakes one person on account of another person.
James Thurber,"There are two kinds of light - the glow that illuminates, and the glare that obscures."
James Thurber,"The animals that depend on instinct have an inherent knowledge of the laws of economics and of how to apply them; Man, with his powers of reason, has reduced economics to the level of a farce which is at once funnier and more tragic than Tobacco Road."
James Thurber,"I used to wake up at 4 A.M. and start sneezing, sometimes for five hours. I tried to find out what sort of allergy I had but finally came to the conclusion that it must be an allergy to consciousness."
James Thurber,"Unless artists can remember what it was to be a little boy, they are only half complete as artist and as man."
James Thurber,Women are wiser than men because they know less and understand more.
James Thurber,Comedy has to be done en clair. You can't blunt the edge of wit or the point of satire with obscurity. Try to imagine a famous witty saying that is not immediately clear.
James Thurber,"There is no safety in numbers, or in anything else."
James Thurber,It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers.
James Thurber,"But what is all this fear of and opposition to Oblivion? What is the matter with the soft Darkness, the Dreamless Sleep?"
James Thurber,"Speed is scarcely the noblest virtue of graphic composition, but it has its curious rewards. There is a sense of getting somewhere fast, which satisfies a native American urge."
James Thurber,"There is something about a poet which leads us to believe that he died, in many cases, as long as 20 years before his birth."
James Thurber,"The dog has seldom been successful in pulling man up to its level of sagacity, but man has frequently dragged the dog down to his."

James Thurber,Discussion in America means dissent.
James Thurber,"Sophistication might be described as the ability to cope gracefully with a situation involving the presence of a formidable menace to one's poise and prestige (such as the butler, or the man under the bed -- but never the husband)."
James Thurber,I think that maybe if women and children were in charge we would get somewhere.
James Thurber,Love is what you've been through with somebody.

Mike Tice,I still remember Marcus running down the left sideline to beat us one time at Soldier Field. Having him on the No. 1 offense in the NFL [in 2003] gives us an opportunity to really stretch the field and take pressure off of Randy.

Mike Tice,"The players right now, like the coaches, are searching for an identity, ... With new players on defense, they are trying to find a balance of what we want to do and what the players do best. I think that is still, unfortunately, a work in progress and will be for a number of weeks."
Mike Tice,"It's all just paper. Consistency is what it's all about. We have enough talent, but are we consistent? If we are, then, yeah, we're going to have some fun."
Mike Tice,"I was like, 'I guess that means everything's OK, ... And I'll tell you as a coach, when your kicker clanks the field goal, walks up and winks at you, you feel pretty good about it. I really like Paul. I think he is doing a great job."

Mike Tice,I thought last week's game was ugly and this was even uglier.
Laura Tichy,"The meet was outside, and a lot of the kids were sick. So things were a little different."

Laura Tichy,"We changed things around a little, and it worked to our advantage. It was interesting how things turned out."

John Tierney,contributed to a sense that GM problems are very deep.
John Tierney,"[Tierney also said that he did not have any more information on the case than any other Times reader, so he was reluctant to give an opinion. When asked if he could have at least acknowledged the issue in a column and written about how it is affecting the media or Washington, he dismissed such an approach.] An awful lot of my columns are not about Washington, ... I don't have inside knowledge of this case and when I write a column, I try to say something that is original."
Lars Tiffany,Josh has the potential to be an impact player at the Division I level given his size and shooting skills. We look forward to working with Josh so that he can realize his potential.
Lars Tiffany,I feel like we missed an opportunity to get better.
Lars Tiffany,Virginia played extremely well and we made a bunch of early season mistakes. We will work on those mistakes in practice to get ready for Harvard next weekend.
Lars Tiffany,Mike is a tenacious competitor. He has a field general personality and truly understands the importance of hard work and team chemistry.
Lars Tiffany,Alex is one of the top goalie recruits in the high school class of 2006 and we are very happy to have him join our program. He has the talent and attitude to compete for playing time early in his career.
Lars Tiffany,"The parents have been supportive without intruding on decisions that belong to the coaching staff. The boys have worked hard. Our style of play on offense will be nifty this year. I wouldn't say this to every team, but this group is good enough to throw the behind-the- back-pass, the no-look pass, open things up a little. We hope to provide Long Island with all the entertainment that big-time college lacrosse has to offer."
Lars Tiffany,"It's great for our fans, but it's right up there with preseason polls and preseason All-America lists. At the end of the day, you have to prove it."
Sulejman Tihic,"Because of the victims, the truth and justice I regret that the trial against Slobodan Milosevic at the UN tribunal has not been concluded."
Sulejman Tihic,"Because of the victims, truth and justice, it would have been better if he lived to the end of the trial."
Sulejman Tihic,I still believe that we have enough evidence to prove that he (Milosevic) was deeply involved in wartime events in Bosnia in our genocide and aggression lawsuit against Serbia and Montenegro.
Joe Tiller,"Much has been said about who we're not playing, ... Now that they've heard all this nonsense all summer long Æ’ we'd better worry about who we're playing."
Joe Tiller,"From what Bill told me, I didn't have to worry."
Joe Tiller,"From our point of view, he's very poised. He has very good vision. He's very comfortable with the offense, and he looks like a relaxed player out there. He makes a lot of plays and doesn't seem to hurry things. He executes the offense like a very confident, experienced quarterback would do."
Joe Tiller,We feel like we've got enough talent at the position that it's possible that we wouldn't designate starters.
Joe Tiller,"As a coach, it takes time to mesh with the rest of the staff and the players. It will take some time, but the players are starting to understand what he expects."
Joe Tiller,"He did a great job of managing the game and executing the offense. We're always looking for perfection, but he played awfully well once again."
Joe Tiller,Bill is an accomplished coach who has been a coordinator in the past and understands the responsibilities that go along with the position. He has experience and is very capable.
Joe Tiller,The wholesome stuff that we do is boring to you guys. But that is life.
Joe Tiller,"I think the NFL is in Brandon's heart, and he should follow his heart. We wish him the best of luck."

Joe Tiller,I think the NFL is in Brandon's heart and he should follow his heart. We wish him the best of luck.
Joe Tiller,"I think the NFL is in Brandon's heart, and he should follow his heart."
Joe Tiller,"I would say it's the single most important factor of (a team), ... You hate to put it all on one position, but if you told me, 'OK Tiller, you're going to graduate 21 of your 22 starters. Which one don't you want graduating?' It'd be the quarterback."
Joe Tiller,We have added a couple players on to the roster that have the ability to stretch the field vertically. And we know we have the arm.

Rex Tillerson,"I don't think people should look for much to be different. It's a culture that started many, many years ago. It's a culture familiar to me since I joined the company, now almost 32 years ago."
Rex Tillerson,"Simply put, it works. The Exxon Mobil culture is something that a lot of people would like to understand better. I'm not really going to help them understand it, because it's the source of our competitive advantage."
Rex Tillerson,"Our industry remains massive and very much a long-term, capital-intensive business."

Charles Tillman,"What can I say? ... Every kid dreams of being in that situation and I was in it. I just tried to take advantage of it. He had one hand on it, then I just kind of yanked it out of his hand and that was pretty much it. I wanted it more than him on that particular play."
Charles Tillman,"This defense can take it to the next level, meaning the sky's the limit. We can be as good as we want to be. We can be as good as we want to be if we don't hurt ourselves."
Charles Tillman,"I don't think anyone in this locker room solely puts the blame on Kyle Orton. As a defense, we didn't make any plays. I gave up 14 points. I think the blame is on ourselves, the team, not just one particular person."
Charles Tillman,"The age on our team is perfect. When you're old, that experience comes in a lot. You're a little slower, but you're smarter too. With us being so young and having a little experience, and this being the second year with the defense [under coordinator Ron Rivera], we're more focused in and we're a better defense now."

Jennifer Tilly,The doctors are saying it will take a miracle to wake her up.
Jennifer Tilly,"You get to a certain age, and you start to rethink your life and rethink your priorities, ... Traveling to exotic locales like Romania is not as appealing as it used to be. When I was younger, you would go on a set and you would have affairs and you'd drink and it was just like summer camp. When you get older, it's like, 'Uh, I'm in another hotel room, in another town I really don't want to be in.'"

We are in a very competitive industry, and we take nothing for granted."

Nevertheless, we remain fully committed to the goals of the United Airlines Union Coalition in achieving labor cost savings that will enable us to secure federally backed loans."
Justin Timberlake,"That's her baby and those are her baby pictures. It's a little crazy when a person like her, who's obviously a sweet person, and having her first child...it's like leave the girl alone, let her have the baby, ...

Mike Timlin,It's not any different until we get a significant lead and it becomes different when our magic number is zero. Then it becomes different. Then you can take a deep breath and concentrate on the next step.
Mike Timlin,He's learning. He doesn't know the hitters yet. He made a mistake and paid for it. He's going to get guys out more often than not. He's got great stuff.
Mike Timlin,"As you get up in age, you're a little more prideful of the fact that you can keep up with the younger guys,"
Mike Timlin,Maybe I'm not as old as I think I am. It's an accomplishment. It's a nice stat to have.
Dave Tippett,"He sees them as well as anybody, and I trust what he has to stay."
Dave Tippett,Everybody in the NHL knows what everybody else does anyway. There's not a lot of big secrets out there about the game.
Dave Tippett,He's a tremendous player who does everything so well. And he's going to be especially important under the new rules.
Dave Tippett,I like what they're doing with the rules. The rules are taking players out of the game whose primary job is fighting and forcing teams to consider using players who can skate and play.
Dave Tippett,I like what they're doing with the rules.
Dave Tippett,The reality is we needed a slap in the face â€“ hard.
Dave Tippett,"This team has worked hard to get to this point in the season, and you have to give them a lot of credit for that. But I think we realize that this work is just the preliminary work you have to put in if you want to be successful in the playoffs."
Dave Tippett,There were poor decisions on our part. You can't give away goals like that. Those are frustrating ones for a coach.
Dave Tippett,He's been real good in training camp and the preseason games. He's got a real determined work ethic right now and I think part of that is because of the injury. He wants to make sure that he's all the way back.
Dave Tippett,"It's funny, the phone hasn't rang the last few days."
Dave Tippett,"It made them rework their plan. He's just so good. If we can clog up the neutral zone and force them into bad dumps, Marty will clean up a lot of that."
Dave Tippett,"From an entertainment factor, we held up our end tonight."
Dave Tippett,"Very rarely do you see a circumstance in the game where a player has such an impact on both sides of the game. Brenden had a huge impact in that game for us in a positive way. But just like everything else in human nature and life, we're all talking about the negatives (Thursday) and that's what he would draw on I'm sure."
Dave Tippett,"It's very hard choices. It's not as if somebody is not capable or not getting the job done. But at the end of the day, it makes us a better team."
Dave Tippett,"He's one of our young guys who has the ability to score and put points on the board. There's always a transition coming over here, but we'll see how he adjusts as the level goes up through the exhibition games."

Chris Tocq,"Microsoft would no longer have guaranteed placement on users' desktops. That would mean its ability to leverage the desktop in terms of selling other services would be severely reduced, or it would have to negotiate directly to get that leverage."

Mike Todd,"Everybody who was there is in agreement that we should do this. We've already reached consensus, now it's a matter of working out the details."
Jean Todt,"We will try to do a better job by trying to do the best as possible, as we always did but that simply, we did not achieve in 2005."
Jean Todt,"It was just the tyre temperatures after the (four) safety car interventions. We didn't have enough temperature. With this kind of tyre, we need to have much more temperature. We lose grip. Without temperature we don't have grip, we don't have the right pressure."
Jean Todt,"This was a chaotic and confusing race. We hoped to exploit the unusual weather conditions but this year, it seems that even the luck that can be a fundamental part of motor racing will not come our way. Maybe we have had too much of it in the past few years, but I hope we can now get back in credit on this score as quickly as possible. At the start of the race, Michael was a front runner, while Rubens who had started from further back, was struggling a bit. When the Safety Car came, out we tried to gamble on dry tyres on Michael's car, but very quickly, he realised the car was impossible to drive in these conditions. So another stop was needed to go back to rain tyres, but Michael's race lasted just one more lap, when he was hit by Sato in the braking area for La Source. This meant all our hopes rested with Rubens, who had moved into the points by this stage. His race was going normally, but when his rain tyres began to go off significantly, he had to pit again to fit dry ones with just a few laps remaining. The time he lost doing this and in getting the dry tyres up to temperature cost him fourth place."
Jean Todt,"It was a disappointing qualifying session. The result does not reflect out potential, but we have to accept what happen."
Jean Todt,"In the past years, we have developed the nice tradition of winning races on a new track, but today that run has come to an end. I am very disappointed, especially for the large number of Ferrari fans we could see in the grandstands at this great facility. We must get back to work immediately, along with our partner Bridgestone, to analyse the situation. Our aim is to be as well prepared as possible for the race in Monza and those that follow in what has turned out to be a particularly tough season."
Jean Todt,"Michael is normally quite cool, but the way he reacted is quite significant, ... He missed an opportunity, and we know that we haven't had so many opportunities this year."
Jean Todt,"Honestly, I think the most we can hope for is to get our cars home in the points."
Jean Todt,The successes we have enjoyed have not been down to three people. It is also true that each history has an end.
Jean Todt,We are working hard for the future and will try to leave 2005 as a bad year in the whole period and start with a good year again in 2006.
Jean Todt,"Again, a funny question. I said to you that Rubens is with us until the 31st of December, so does that mean I put Rubens with you in Istanbul not doing something and just for the pleasure of having him? No, he will drive and honestly he is doing a very good job. He's very motivated, very dedicated. We have been very fair to him and I'm expecting him to be very fair to Ferrari."
Jean Todt,"The problem was in the piston area, a specific failure in that component. However, sometimes the final problem is the result of a combination of factors. So before saying anything definitive, we need to have some very precise answers."
Jean Todt,"We will go into this season with a great motivation, great humility and also a great determination to get back to the top. We have the team, we have the means and we have the drivers, so there is no excuse not to return to where we were, and this will be our aim."
Jean Todt,I had a few opportunities at the beginning when he took over Minardi to meet him. I will not miss him.
Jean Todt,I got the document which was signed by the 11 team principals so we can say that an agreement has been made regarding testing for 2006.
Jean Todt,"We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Red Bull Racing to supply them with our F1 engines,"
Jean Todt,So we can say that an agreement has been made.

Kristi Toliver,"I was just in the zone. I was trying not to force anything, and my teammates had confidence in me, which helped a lot."
Kristi Toliver,"In the beginning, I didn't know what to expect. I was kind of overwhelmed. I think youth played a part in that. But I grew up pretty quickly."

Kristi Toliver,We don't think we're that young. We don't think we're that inexperienced. We've been playing basketball forever.
Kristi Toliver,"We don't think that we're that young. We don't think that we're that inexperienced. We have all been playing basketball forever. ? As long as we come out with a lot of confidence and keep playing the way we have been playing offensively and defensively, we'll be fine."

Leo Tolstoy,True science investigates and brings to human perception such truths and such knowledge as the people of a given time and society consider most important. Art transmits these truths from the region of perception.
Leo Tolstoy,"The sobs and tears of joy he had not foreseen rose with such force within him that his whole body shook and for a long time prevented him from speaking. Falling on his knees by her bed. He held his wife's hand to his lips and kissed it, and her hand responded to his kisses with weak movement of finger. Meanwhile, at the foot of the bed, in the midwife's expert hands, like the flame of a lamp, flickered the life of a human being who had never existed before..."
Leo Tolstoy,"Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of children recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it may be disguised."
Leo Tolstoy,The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity.
Leo Tolstoy,History would be an excellent thing if only it were true.
Leo Tolstoy,Pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.
Leo Tolstoy,"Happiness does not depend on outward things, but on the way we see them"
Leo Tolstoy,"In historic events, the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself. Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity."
Leo Tolstoy,Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us.
Leo Tolstoy,"Truth, like gold, is to be obtained not by its growth, but by washing away from it all that is not gold."
Leo Tolstoy,"In the name of God, stop a moment, cease your work, look around you."
Leo Tolstoy,"It is true, I deny the incomprehensible Trinity, and the fable regarding the fall of man, which is absurd in our day. It is true, I deny the sacrilegious story of a God born of a virgin to redeem the race."
Leo Tolstoy,"Joy can be real only if people look upon their life as a service, and have a definite object in life outside themselves and their personal happiness"
Leo Tolstoy,All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
Leo Tolstoy,"Man discovers truth by reason only, not by faith."
Leo Tolstoy,"In saying that without the power of the state, evil men would rule over the good. It is taken for granted that the good are precisely those who at the present time have power, and the bad the same who are no subjugated."
Leo Tolstoy,Conceit is incompatible with understanding.
Leo Tolstoy,Conceit is incompatible with understanding
Leo Tolstoy,"Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies."
Leo Tolstoy,It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness.
Leo Tolstoy,"What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness!  A beautiful woman utters absurdities:  we listen, and we hear not the absurdities but wise thoughts"
Leo Tolstoy,What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness.
Leo Tolstoy,"It is not beauty that endears, it's love that makes us see beauty"
Leo Tolstoy,"The anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without authority, there could not be worse violence than that of authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that a"
Leo Tolstoy,"The greater the state, the more wrong and cruel its patriotism, and the greater is the sum of suffering upon which its power is founded."
Leo Tolstoy,Music is the shorthand of emotion.
Leo Tolstoy,"If so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so many kinds of love."
Leo Tolstoy,"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself."
Leo Tolstoy,"To say that a work of art is good, but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the same as saying of some kind of food that it is very good but that most people can't eat it."
Dick Tomey,We wanted to set a firm foundation so we wouldn't be on a two-year track. And the truth is the NCAA rules have changed dramatically in the past 15 years so it's difficult to get JC guys in and ready to go.
Dick Tomey,"We wanted to sign a couple of receivers who can give us a bigger presence, offensive linemen that would give our line a chance to take the next step, and a running back that can compete for playing time right away. Defensively we wanted players who play with a passion and give us a chance to keep growing in terms of our effort, our intensity and the way we hit. The players we signed certainly fit into these categories."
Dick Tomey,"I think he's as good a lineman as there is in college football. He plays so hard, consistently. I think an awful lot of Larry and he can do anything he wants in football. I just know there's not an overabundance of guys that play as hard as he does and have the athleticism and want-to that he does."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"We needed a victory bad, ... We needed to get back to even so we could feel good about ourselves and the direction we were going. It just happened to be the Super Bowl champs and their 21-game home winning streak on the line."
LaDainian Tomlinson,I am just a player trying to do what I'm told.
LaDainian Tomlinson,"I don't have to sleep with Eli,"
LaDainian Tomlinson,I always take pride in throwing touchdowns because that's not something a running back is supposed to be able to do.
LaDainian Tomlinson,I always take pride in throwing a touchdown because as a running back it's not something you're supposed to do. So I really enjoy throwing the football.
LaDainian Tomlinson,I really get my work in practice. Preseason is not really where I need to get in a rhythm. Obviously it helps some; that was some (help) out there. It felt good to stretch them legs with the ball in my hand.
LaDainian Tomlinson,"Everything speeds up and it's blurry for a minute, ... But you've got to have a little patience sometimes to just find a soft spot. There's always a soft spot in the defense, and it's your job to find it."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"I know how hard it is,"
LaDainian Tomlinson,I really get my work in practice. Preseason games are not where I need to get in rhythm. It helps to play some preseason. There was some right there today.
LaDainian Tomlinson,"I don't think about the playoff loss anymore. I think about the team we had, the fun we had together the whole season. We had a great time."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"It's tough because you're fighting against yourself during a game: 'Should I be playing? No, I can't quit.' You know you're not 100 percent, so it's hard. .Â .Â . I guarantee you he's hurting."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"She went in for a checkup, and the doctors realized there wasn't a heartbeat. We still aren't really sure what caused it. They said it could have been a couple of things."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"I don't want to make it sound like I'm complaining I'm not getting the ball. I had the ball 19 times in both of the last two games. Anytime I touch the ball that much, I've got to make something happen. I haven't done that."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"I went to the Senior Bowl and told myself I'm going to answer the question about this competition thing once and for all,"
LaDainian Tomlinson,"My goal is 2,000 yards, ... My goal is to break [Dickerson's NFL season] record. I believe it's 2,105. That gives me something to shoot for."
LaDainian Tomlinson,"I'm so used to catching some balls out of the backfield, ... Even in a game like yesterday, they were playing well against the run. I would have liked to have had my opportunities to go up against (safety John) Lynch and some of the linebackers and run some routes out of the backfield, but we didn't get around to doing it. I'm not blaming anyone. I understand, it's hard to call plays and try to make things work."
Al Tompkins,"When the governor himself seems to confirm the information, there are not many among us who wouldn't go with it."
Al Tompkins,"Unless there's overwhelming reason to withhold the information, the public's need to know should come first."
Al Tompkins,The Society of Professional Journalists in their code of ethics says that journalists should avoid conflicts of interest real or perceived. Clearly it would be a conflict of interest for anyone acting in a journalism capacity to simultaneously be serving as a public servant.
Al Tompkins,"In journalism, anything that we do as journalists that confuses the public about our ability to be independent in our reporting is obviously harmful to journalism."
James Toney,I was not thinking about the stuff still being in my system. But I can't look at the past. It was my fault. I wanted Ruiz. So I don't blame anybody but myself. Bottom line.
James Toney,"We'll have the two best heavyweight fighters Saturday night _ me and Chris Byrd, ... When that bell rings, don't put your track shoes on."
James Toney,"I promise you I will be better in my next fight, ... I want to be a fighting champion, a great champion."
James Toney,It's all right here. And heart and determination. I'm 37 years old and I feel like I'm 27. I'm getting better with age.
James Toney,"Look at this body, ... Do I look like I use steroids?"
James Toney,I didn't run from the situation. I didn't hide the ordeal from the reporters like the sissy baseball players. I fought it head-on. â€¦ We dealt with it. It's over. And now we're moving on.
Jim Tonte,IU has done a great job of keeping some in-state talent lately. Purdue was doing a good job before that. It seems to go in cycles.
Jim Tonte,"I was speaking at the middle school wrestling banquet in 2002 after we'd finished second in the state tournament. I passed around my (runner-up) ring and told them that we were going to get the other ring, the champion ring, before they left high school."
Jim Tonte,"Eric is on a roll. He's wrestling as well as I've seen him wrestle in high school, and it's happening at the right time."
Jim Tonte,"I told them that they were champions. They had a great year, and they're state champions in my mind."
Jim Tonte,We tell our kids that every round in every tournament gets tougher. The good thing about having a tougher match so early is that you get one of the pressure situations out of the way. Now you know you're going to be standing on the podium at the end of (tonight). Now you can go out and go after a championship.
Jeffrey Toobin,This was a total rout. The story she told investigators after she made the stock trade simply didn't add up.
Jeffrey Toobin,"There's a contradiction between the two, and as always, the Supreme Court wins, and that bodes ill for the California case."
Jeffrey Toobin,There is no legal requirement of any public disclosure of a justice's health. And justices are very cagey and very limited in what they disclose.
Jeffrey Toobin,"The experience of O.J. convinced (news) management that there is tremendous interest in high-profile legal cases,"
Jeffrey Toobin,What really matters is who wins presidential elections.
Jeffrey Toobin,"The point is that the judge is determined to keep this thing moving, and he's getting rid of jurors who are impediments."
Jeffrey Toobin,"Elections have consequences, and one of them is the winners get to pick the justices."
Jeffrey Toobin,"What appears to be going on here is some sort of compromise. The court feels strongly about national security and the president's ability to conduct foreign affairs and military affairs, yet also responsible for the rule of law."
Jeffrey Toobin,"This Supreme Court nominee presents extraordinary circumstances, requiring a filibuster."
Jeffrey Toobin,"I have never seen a case that was more clearly won on a closing argument,"
Amani Toomer,I wish Kurt luck every week but this one.
Amani Toomer,This is practice. We don't want anyone to get hurt.
Amani Toomer,the best wide receiver in Giants history.
Amani Toomer,I don't want to get into my emotions. Eli just threw a great ball and gave me an opportunity to make a play in it. It was just a fade [pattern]. The ball was in such a good spot. And I made a play.
Amani Toomer,"Eli, he's progressing. You can see flashes. He's definitely going in the right direction."
Amani Toomer,"I think when we went to San Diego and he had all of that adversity, it really brought out the best in him. I think now he knows how good he can be, and he is doing a great job throwing the ball down the field and getting everybody involved."
Carrot Top,There's nothing wrong with trying to reach out to new fans.
Carrot Top,The blessing is that everyone knows who I am because of the commercials.
Carrot Top,So I try not to look too far into the future because I think that everything happens and will happen for a reason.
Carrot Top,People do give me a hard time about my hair because it's orange and it's big.
Carrot Top,People always want to put a label on you; they always want to compare you to something.
Carrot Top,"On the weekends, I would go down and play these clubs in Key West or West Palm Beach or surrounding areas of Florida and then I'd go back to school for the week."
Carrot Top,My way of making people like me was to make 'em laugh.
Carrot Top,My way of fitting in was through jokes and making people laugh.
Carrot Top,"My real name is Scott Thompson. I could have gone by that name, but when I started doing comedy I thought I needed to go by something that has a little more of a hook."
Carrot Top,"Like I told Howard, I can't help it that I'm beautiful."
Carrot Top,"I was the class clown at school, but at home, my family wasn't very funny."
Carrot Top,"I think, over the years, I've kind of evolved."
Carrot Top,"I think the more you do this and the more comfortable you become on stage, you start speaking more and becoming more of a character in yourself."
Carrot Top,I think it's the fact that I do something different and that I actually have some success with it. That bothers a lot of people... especially comics.
Carrot Top,I never looked at Gallagher like he was a threat to me.
Carrot Top,I didn't really have a plan of attack when I got in college.
Carrot Top,I always thought marketing in general was an interesting kind of thing. I always liked commercials and billboards.
Carrot Top,I always make fun of KISS because I don't particularly think their music is anything.
Carrot Top,Comics don't like to see other comics do well.
Carrot Top,Carrot Top is a nickname that people call me and I thought that it was more marketable.
Carrot Top,"Video games are so popular these days, getting the opportunity to star in one is something special. More people should do it."
Carrot Top,"When I told my friends I was going to be a comedian, they laughed at me."
Carrot Top,It's our nature: Human beings like success but they hate successful people.
Carrot Top,"It's weird, I never wish anything bad upon anybody, except two or three old girlfriends."
Adam Topper,"It was a great race for Emma. She looked very strong the entire race. I was a little worried she was going out too fast, but she was able to maintain fairly well and win comfortably."
Adam Topper,The idea of bringing that title home for Florida State is amazing.
Adam Topper,"She's tough, smart, and has a strong desire to make the varsity team in her final season."
Adam Topper,"Times were a little faster this year, however, so I wasn't too disappointed that the boys didn't take all of the top five spots. We ran a very patient race... it was really more of a warm-up for us."
Joe Torre,The rewards are so enormous that it's certainly worth what you put in here. That's why I'm back here.
Joe Torre,I want him to catch the ball. I don't worry too much about his arm.
Joe Torre,There were a lot more liberties you could take years ago. Now you have to worry that someone (whether Ortiz or the umpires) will take it the wrong way.
Joe Torre,It was tough. Normally when you don't get a 1-2-3 inning you don't come away with a victory.
Joe Torre,I trust him from what we've seen.
Joe Torre,I have a great deal of trust that has been built up in the early season.
Joe Torre,"I trust him. If I don't use Flash there, at what point in the postseason do I go to him?"
Joe Torre,"I trust him, ... If I don't use Flash there, at what point in the postseason do I go to him?"
Joe Torre,"I trust him so much, because I know one thing, above anything else, whether it works or not, you know that he's going out there with the biggest heart in the world. He certainly doesn't shy away from the pressure."
Joe Torre,Shawn apologized to me. He just had trouble with his command. He slipped on the mound at one point.
Joe Torre,"The one thing I found out about him, when he gets in trouble he seems to be tougher, which is a very good trait to have for a pitcher. He's a big cheerleader for our ball club. He sits on the bench in between starts and he's one of our main guys as far as keeping everybody going."
Joe Torre,"The thing I really get a kick out of with him is that when he gets in trouble, he finds a way to wiggle out. It's not always going to happen, but he doesn't melt. That's important."
Joe Torre,He seems to be relaxed. He has a great deal of talent.
Joe Torre,Something happened because he had so many ground balls early. He may just be gaining arm strength. He threw the ball really well. He just wasn't consistent with his location.
Joe Torre,He said he felt like he was in the middle of Spring Training. So basically strength is what we are looking for. We're probably dealing with a couple of weeks away.
Joe Torre,"You couldn't ask for a better scenario if you're a sports fan,"
Joe Torre,"Whenever you saw him, he had a smile on his face and something nice to say. Ironically, the way I remember him is full of life."
Joe Torre,There was a big smile on his face. He wasn't hurting.
Joe Torre,"He's as intelligent as anybody; knowing and self-assured. He's very well prepared, for the managing job and for what we have the rest of the way here."
Joe Torre,"Again, it's another safety net for us. We have a little more depth now at some spots. ... It's more insurance for us than any immediate plans."
Joe Torre,We're not going to put him at risk physically.
Joe Torre,"He wanted to pitch. He didn't campaign, ... I just sensed that I wanted to take that responsibility away from him because I didn't think it was fair to him, because I knew what the decision would be."
Joe Torre,He's as good as we've seen him this early in the year. He's taken on a great deal of responsibility.
Joe Torre,"I think he certainly understands his responsibility. More than anything, it was the fact that he hadn't pitched more so than the mental aspect."
Joe Torre,"The only way they're going to get better is to do more research. That's where the cures are, that's where the abilities to extend people's lives are."
Joe Torre,"It's a tough situation. Obviously our situation is different. Everywhere we go, the stadium is filled. ... The reality of it has to be hard for them."
Joe Torre,"We'll see what we see. I know he's been pleased with the quality of his stuff, but until you get out there on a regular basis, it's going to be tough to refine what he does. He's a competitor who will go out and challenge the situation."
Joe Torre,"I know one thing, Bernie is seizing the moment. He's having some quality at-bats and he seems to be in a great frame of mind. There's no question it's going to be an emotional time when that's the case, when he's not here anymore."
Joe Torre,If you don't make quality pitches you can't expect good results. We didn't pitch very well.
Joe Torre,"It certainly doesn't feel good as it's happening, but if you're a team of quality, there's no carry-over. It was just a bad start, and there's not a lot of romance attached to it. Right now we're a little flat, and we need a little pick-me-up."
Joe Torre,"Pride takes over at some point, ... There's a lot of pride in that clubhouse."
Joe Torre,It's up to our pitcher to keep the game close so we can have patience knowing we just need a run.
Joe Torre,I just don't want him to rush because of the nature of his surgery. He just seems like a likeable young man. There's a big up-side to him.
Joe Torre,The light switch went on for him.
Joe Torre,"Mel has taken on the role of Gator. He'll volunteer stuff, but he knows that's not his job. Last year, it was vice versa."
Joe Torre,"He went to see Dr. [Robert] Watkins and there was marked improvement. He going to see his therapist in Georgia [Brown's home] and continue doing what he's doing. He's not throwing yet, but if he improves, he could pitch for us in September."
Joe Torre,"There was a lot of hunger on that bench tonight. Everybody was pulling for everybody. The volume was up a little bit tonight. A lot of it was because [Tuesday night] wasn't a good feeling to go home from, especially scoring nine runs and coming away empty."
Joe Torre,"There was a lot of hunger on our bench, ... Everybody was pulling for everybody, their volume was up. I think it was because [Tuesday] night wasn't a good feeling."
Joe Torre,"Whatever there is for him there, he'll handle it fine. He has a sense of humor about this stuff, and that's important."
Joe Torre,code of honor when so much is on the line.
Joe Torre,"Jason has come up in situations and you say, 'We need a home run' and he's hit one. That's storybook stuff."
Joe Torre,"This is a very big win, obviously. To go home with a winning road trip after coming here and losing the first night the way we did is big."
Joe Torre,He's a young man. It's pretty remarkable when you figure out how many home runs he has.
Joe Torre,It's time to properly honor the Yankees' place in this country's history and create a true Monument Valley large enough for all Americans to see. The Magnificent Seven will join the original four just as soon as someone can figure out a way to carve a 40-foot-high Yogi face.
Joe Torre,"We're not hitting. When you say that, you hate to take anything away from the way they pitched. They were certainly good up and down the line. We didn't get many opportunities."
Joe Torre,"I think Randy was getting a little upset that they weren't swinging. He was throwing hard, and he had a couple that were close shaves."
Joe Torre,He seems to be happy melting into the woodwork. He doesn't seem to be high-maintenance.
Joe Torre,You certainly don't want to get in the habit of falling behind and expecting to catch up. We need to be able to control the game better than we did tonight.
Joe Torre,"We certainly don't want to get in the habit of falling behind and expecting to catch up. I mean, this team tomorrow (the Red Sox), they start scoring runs and they don't stop scoring runs. We need to control the game a little bit better than we did tonight."
Joe Torre,"If you have to say goodbye he certainly leaves you with good memories, ... But the most important thing is if the fit is going to be right. I still think he?s got baseball left. It depends on the makeup of this club."
Joe Torre,It's good for the game. It's bad for my stomach.
Joe Torre,"He's been a mainstay, no question, ... Every single playoff game, once he started. But this is something I know he has no resentment towards. Really, it's no blow to his ego."
Joe Torre,"I think he's just fighting himself more than anybody else or any other team. It's just all about him. He's just trying to find that comfort zone, which he hasn't had for a while."
Joe Torre,They're fighting. They seem to be going after it as opposed to waiting for it to happen.
Joe Torre,"I don't want to say we're 'fighting' because that [suggests] we didn't care last year. But I see a lot more going out and getting it, as opposed to sitting back and waiting for things to turn around."
Joe Torre,"I think everyone understands we've been fighting uphill, ... It's down to a countable number now. This is a big stretch."
Joe Torre,"I think everyone understands we've been fighting uphill, ... This is a big stretch."
Joe Torre,"We have no idea years ago what was going on with the players who are in the Hall of Fame now. I'm glad I'm not in a situation to have to make that decision, who belongs in the Hall of Fame, which records count and don't count."
Joe Torre,"It was a no-win situation - you have to (win), you're supposed to, and if you don't, you're a failure. It's tough to live with that kind of scrutiny. But that's the nature of the beast."
Joe Torre,We had a little shot of energy today.
Joe Torre,I don't want him to reel in his emotions.
Joe Torre,"I want him to pitch with emotion, and I can't reel in that emotion."
Joe Torre,I just think he pulled the trigger too quickly. I don't want him not to show emotion.
Joe Torre,A lot of times I shake my head. I never in my wildest dreams â€” and I'm sure George feels the same way â€” could have envisioned my being here this long.
Joe Torre,"Just when you think you have everything rolling in your direction, and then something that doesn't figure happens. That's what happened tonight."
Joe Torre,It's strange; this game is very unpredictable. You think everything is rolling in your direction and something that doesn't figure happens. That's why you play.
Joe Torre,I can't get concerned about what we are against the Devil Rays.
Joe Torre,"There's definitely a danger of not being challenged, and that's stuff that your players may not even be conscious is happening,"
Joe Torre,"The biggest danger is all the hype, ... It's a lot to expect from a young person, but at the same time, it's tough to downplay it."
Joe Torre,"There's a danger that if you don't get in enough, ... he'll hit it out of the ballpark."
Joe Torre,"It's just something that was important for him to do after last year. All the criticism that he had gotten, he has put that behind him. He's certainly a big-game guy."
Joe Torre,The last two times he's been lighting it up as far as his consistency and his release point.
Joe Torre,We just haven't made a commitment to that. We haven't broached it with the shortstops.
Joe Torre,I think he just settled in. It just looked like he had a little more comfort out there.
Joe Torre,We have a lot of guys that need to send their clothes to dry cleaning.
Joe Torre,I don't apologize for taking seven Yankees. I think they all have numbers that make their choice appropriate. ... I'd like to be a little greedy here.
Joe Torre,"The only thing I can say is that when you've had cancer you realize more than ever ? even though you should probably realize it before ? how important raising money for research is. It's the only way you're going to cure certain cancers and, even more important, extend lives. It was 1999 when I was diagnosed. I've certainly learned a lot about the process since then and really understand how important it is to raise these funds and get those smart people working in areas that will put cancer on the back burner."
Joe Torre,"That's usually what happens. I turn around [he feigns turning around], and there's nobody else to blame, ... I just felt in my heart and soul that was it for him."
Joe Torre,That's usually what happens. I look around and there's no one else here to blame.
Joe Torre,You don't see that happen two days in a row. You have to believe something [good] is coming.
Joe Torre,"I believe that in a short series, once you have momentum it tends to stay with you. And he certainly knew what to do with it."
Joe Torre,"When he's talking about baseball, he's right on. He doesn't miss a trick. He wants to make every road trip, he watches little things that Jorge [Posada] does behind the plate, and it comes back to him. It's wonderful."
Joe Torre,"Baseball is not like football or basketball, ... There are 27 outs to get and whichever team is best suited to get those 27 outs, to control that tempo, is going to be there at the end. We've gotten a huge lift from Chacon and Wright and I still believe in my heart of hearts the big guy is going to be dynamite for us down the stretch."
Joe Torre,"The shape of his stuff was the big thing. I wasn't concerned about strikeouts, because there weren't many balls hit on the fat of the bat. That's the key with Randy."
Joe Torre,"It's disappointing. I think the final score doesn't indicate what kind of game it was. Both sides, balls hit good, good plays, weird plays."
Joe Torre,"On both sides, balls were hit good, good plays, weird plays, just a lot of things, and they were the better club tonight."
Joe Torre,"He throws hard, and he's just a baby -- 19 years old. The thing that's unusual for a kid as young as he is, his curveball is really impressive. His stuff is very real."
Joe Torre,"You don't know what is going to happen. You know everyone has some anxiety at this time of year, and the ability to play through that is an ability."
Joe Torre,"It's huge. You win the first game of the series, you want to win the series."
Joe Torre,"It's something you hope doesn't happen. When you sign on to do a job, you hope you'll be able to get it done. But that's not always in your control."
Joe Torre,"When we lost, I couldn't sleep at night. When we win, I can't sleep at night. But, when you win, you wake up feeling better."
Joe Torre,"We just allowed them too many outs in that inning, and they took advantage."
Joe Torre,"He's got so much ability and he's capable of doing so many things, he asks himself to do too many things. Slumps are something you have to endure and fight your way through, and there's no quick way to get out of one."
Joe Torre,"You know his stuff is outstanding; the ability to mix his pitches, that's the toughest thing for any team,"
Joe Torre,"I think he'll pitch for as long as he wants to, because he has the ability to make adjustments as his ability changes. There are a lot of pitchers and players who get a little stubborn and try to do the same things."
Joe Torre,"It's going to benefit everybody. He knows how to pitch, he's not overpowering, he relies on his ability to throw strikes and get ahead of hitters. It's good to have him and the Big Unit to carry it."
Joe Torre,"He's got so much ability and he demands so much of himself, that's where he runs into some potholes. He won't allow himself to not succeed, he puts so much pressure on himself."
Joe Torre,I think it just tells you about his confidence in his ability to get people out. He's not afraid of falling behind in the count. He's been a winner everywhere he's pitched.
Joe Torre,"We still have to stress the fact that in spite of having the ability to hit a lot of home runs, we've got to have a different mind-set, or continue to think small and let the big things happen. Sometimes when you have a club like we have, you tend to wait around for boom, boom, boom, and sometimes it doesn't happen."
John Tortorella,"All we can worry about is the next game. We can't get caught up in the big picture and what's down the road and all that. Our goal has to be that day. If it's a game, then we need to worry about that. If it's a practice, we need to worry about that. One day. That's all we can think about."
John Tortorella,"I've tried to work with him this year. I remember I told him a few weeks ago, I said, 'Arty, don't worry about anything, just go and hit as hard as you possibly can.' He proceeded to go out and take four penalties. So, it's kind of a give and take here. But we want him to play hard. And the book on Arty is that he goes up and down as far as his readiness to play. But remember, he is a raw talent. And still a very young man, and you have to live with some of those bumps."
John Tortorella,"I think he is great for our game. He has some jam to his game to add to his talent and the dynamic player he is he's the total package. He can be a one-on-one player, but he can also make a play and make another player look good. With that talent and that type of jam, he has the full package."
John Tortorella,I'm not going to bulls--- you; we're in a tough situation. We're down 3-1 to a real quality hockey team.
John Tortorella,"That's a calm influence from the goaltender on out, and that does feed out through the team."
John Tortorella,It was cheap. There is no honor in it.
John Tortorella,"That's a part of the game now. I hate it, but it's part of the game and our guys are going to have to produce."
John Tortorella,"I don't care how it looked, it's about finding a way and it starts with your goaltending giving you a chance and the past two nights we have definitely got that."
John Tortorella,"Your best players need to be your best players and almost dominate games. Or your goaltending dominates a game. You just need some dominating performances, and if you're going to have dominating performances, it's going to come from your best guys. And if you sprinkle two or three of those in six games, and you find a way to win four or five games, that's when you start getting that swagger back."
John Tortorella,"I just couldn't wait to start another game. That was probably, to me, one of the toughest losses I've gone through. I'm glad they responded."
John Tortorella,We just have to keep fighting. We have to stay together as a team.
John Tortorella,Real cute hockey team. We [stunk].
John Tortorella,"We came back three times. It was tremendous as far as that's concerned. But as far as our concentration level and what we have to do to continue to get better, I thought we were a sloppy team."
John Tortorella,"I'm not down on the players. I'm down on the circumstances we're in, but I'm not down on the players. It is frustrating though."
John Tortorella,"We're all going to miss Rammer, there's no question about that. But we have to go about our business. He has always been a very steady influence to everything and we'll miss him."
John Tortorella,"I knew there was going to be a ton of adversity and a lot of ups and downs, and that's what's happened. We've gone through some now for 41 games. Now we have to learn to fight through it and just try to find a way to get points. We are not in a situation where, and I'm trying to stress to the guys, don't look at the standings or projections or this, that or the other thing. We're taking it a game at a time and I think that really has to be our concentration. One game at a time and try to find a way to get points each and every game."
John Tortorella,I'll put him up against anyone in this league as far as skating ability.
John Tortorella,"He's a real interesting project. I'll put him up against anybody in this league as far as skating ability, as far as speed and the strength that he brings, bringing pucks to the net."

Linus Torvalds,Software patents are a huge potential threat to the ability of people to work together on open source. Making it easier for companies and communities that have patents to make those patents available in a common pool for people to use is one way to try to help developers deal with the threat.

John Toshack,"Although we lacked a little bit in quality, we did go all the way to the final whistle looking to try and get that goal. I was pleased with that."
John Toshack,"Rooney has those things that you cannot teach players - the positions he takes up just behind the front men is a European trait,"
John Toshack,"We don't man-mark anybody. I have never, ever done it in 27 years as a manager and I would never do it,"
John Toshack,"We don't man mark anybody,"
John Toshack,"It's one thing to tell a front man to drop off and fill in the hole behind, but if they don't know why they are doing it, it is not an easy thing to teach. But Rooney's just got it."
John Toshack,"What I'm not in the habit of doing, and I'm not going to do, is go around cap in hand pleading with players to play for their country,"
John Toshack,"It's a lot easier to destroy than to create and if you look at Azerbaijan's games they're difficult to beat,"

Kevin Towers,We were more at risk taking Castilla on than they were with Lawrence.
Kevin Towers,"I saw no fall-off in Castilla last year. He did have some knee problems, but our reports are good. I think he'll play 120 to 130 games."
Kevin Towers,He takes a lot of pride in calling a game.
Kevin Towers,"For one of those coaching jobs, we should pull somebody from the organization -- and possibly both of them, ... We'll probably try to get something done on this next week."
Kevin Towers,There's nothing I can do about that ? we'll have to find a way to get him out. I'm happy to hear that he does have something. That's good.

Kevin Towers,"In our ballpark, the emphasis is as much on defense as it is on offense with our outfield, ... We saw it. We got out-doubled and out-tripled in our park. We really have to have somebody really go out and get the ball."
Kevin Towers,Ramon is not an easy guy to replace. We plan to get our offense elsewhere. I've heard the criticism about our catching. These guys are not chopped liver.
Kevin Towers,"The best thing is, we're going to go in and face good competition. That's when we're at our best. This is a team that plays to the level of its competition. It's been like that all year."
Kevin Towers,"Let's relax, have a good time and prove that we're better than people think. We play to our competition. All year long, we've done that. The Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals, if we're fortunate enough to get there, I don't think they're going to take us lightly."
Kevin Towers,Mike Piazza is one of the greatest-hitting catchers in the history of baseball and has his name written all over the major league record books. This is an exciting addition to our club and we are thrilled to see him add to those numbers while wearing a Padres uniform.
Kevin Towers,He's a tremendous athlete -- we've only seen the tip of the iceberg. Last year was his breakout year. He's had some success at the big-league level now -- and he's going to get better.
Kevin Towers,"He's had to learn in the big leagues, which is tough. He's faced probably as much adversity as any young player in the game is going to face."
Kevin Towers,"He's mentally strong, keeps the ball down, has the ability to change speeds, holds runners ... he's just a fundamentally sound pitcher. His fastball is 88, 89 [mph], and he's got a great changeup and curveball. The guy knows how to pitch."

Robert Townsend,"Compromise is usually bad. It should be a last resort.

Robert Townsend,"All organizations are at least 50 percent waste - waste people, waste effort, waste space, and waste time."

Jim Tracy,"In Spring Training, I talked a lot about the value of guys on the bench. If they're going to be productive players, you've got to find spots for them."
Jim Tracy,"I felt like we had a very good meeting. I think that the foundation is there from an understanding of what it is that we're trying to accomplish. If you were in there and you were paying attention, it should be pretty clear to you as to the direction that we're headed."
Jim Tracy,We've always had trouble with him.
Jim Tracy,"He gets himself in trouble if his arm doesn't get up where it's supposed to be, and he ends up leading himself to home plate with his elbow. You may throw from a slope downhill but, because of the position of your elbow, you're pushing the ball out of your hand uphill -- and, when you do that, the ball will go up."
Jim Tracy,"Oliver potentially pitched his way into deep trouble. But he pitched out of it, too."
Jim Tracy,"When he throws strikes and you have to figure out what he's going to do next -- you're in trouble, he's going to get you out."
Jim Tracy,"I saw a guy, when I watched on television, who really liked the arena he was in. He had a face on him that said, 'I accept this challenge here.' You like that."
Jim Tracy,He's done a great job. And there's more of it to come. He's a terrific talent.
Jim Tracy,"This kid just has an eye at the plate, a talent for the game."
Jim Tracy,"There is strength in numbers, and we've got those. And you're not going to hear me say that, just because we're young, we can't go out and pitch well or play the game at the level you need to be successful."
Jim Tracy,I think it's very clear to our players that there is no safety net. Our guys have heard enough messages where they understand ... the direction I want to head with this club. Production has to be a part of it. That's what this business is all about.
Jim Tracy,He's progressing as you would like to see a young catcher progress. He's making some very nice strides.
Jim Tracy,"He's made great progress as far as him starting fresh in the big leagues. If it continues, this is a guy who becomes a weapon that I'm not shy about using in significant situations."
Jim Tracy,He's shown me some things in batting practice and some of the other skill work that we've done that this kid has a chance to be a player. He handles the bat very well. There's a lot to like about his approach. He's very fast. He's one of those guys that he walks fast when he's just walking. He's going to get an opportunity.
Jim Tracy,"Everyone has their own philosophy,"
Jim Tracy,We had a very poor -- poor -- pitching performance. We pitched poorly -- right from the get-go. We ... pitched ... poorly.
Jim Tracy,He had a shooting pain that was really bothering him.
Jim Tracy,"When he was down on the ground, he was having shooting pain that was really bothering him, but beyond that I don't know."
Jim Tracy,He could hardly lay still. That's how much pain he was in.
Jim Tracy,"He is not swinging completely pain-free, ... He does have some soreness and stiffness."
Jim Tracy,"Good at bat, Jason, ... I just love watching you up there with Runners in Scoring Position."
Jim Tracy,"The language in there, I think, is fairly telling as far as his opinion of what occurred there, and how it occurred, and what action we should or should not have taken,"
Jim Tracy,It's important to realize that we have two special major-league players here. I kind of want to find playing time for both. It's a wonderful trade off.
Jim Tracy,That's not really my intention. I have a very good job.
Jim Tracy,We're to the point where you'd like to see some improvement. I don't really think we'll see any improvement from him sitting on the sideline.
Jim Tracy,I'm seeing good signs of improvement.
Jim Tracy,He's made improvement defensively. Is it finished yet? No. Is it making headway? Absolutely.
Jim Tracy,"It wasn't a ploy, it was heartfelt and something I felt that from a continuity standpoint, I have strong ideas on what is necessary. Familiarity and continuity are certainly two intangibles that are absolute musts for a club to be successful."
Jim Tracy,I can sit here and know wholeheartedly that I've given it everything I could possibly give. I've put my heart and soul into this.
Jim Tracy,"I couldn't be happier for Jeff Weaver, looking at the job that he's done here over the last two years, being the workhorse of the staff and pitching deep into games more times than not. To see this guy grow into what he's becoming now, you feel awfully good about that."
Jim Tracy,"I couldn't be happier for Jeff Weaver, looking at the job that he's done here over the last two years, being the workhorse of the staff and pitching deep into games more times than not, ... To see this guy grow into what he's becoming now, you feel awfully good about that."
Jim Tracy,It was a great pitch. There's only one guy in the game that could have hit it.
Jim Tracy,"He's been fighting to win, which says a lot about who he is as a person, ... I know how he would want and expect me to react to this ? to keep right on working, to keep right on fighting."
Jim Tracy,He deserved a much better fate.
Jim Tracy,"It has been tremendous. The work ethic that has been put forth has been just great. The environment was very loose, which is what I like to see, and yet within the framework of that looseness was a very businesslike approach."
Jim Tracy,"Of course, there is going to be some emotion on my part when I look over to the other dugout and see some people who I have great feeling for."
Jim Tracy,Very important. You're hopeful this win can jump-start you and head you in the direction you know this club is capable of going.
Jim Tracy,"We had an opportunity in the first inning to get the game headed in the direction we wanted to and they got Jeff [Kent] to hit into the double play. From that point on, Jae Seo was in control of the game. He was throwing his offspeed pitches for strikes all day long in hitters' counts."
Jim Tracy,We still have not determined some things as far as how we're going to line our pitching up.
Jim Tracy,"With the little bit of conversation I heard that took place between Sean and (head trainer) Brad Henderson, you knew it was something more than a guy getting the wind knocked out of him. Each of the first three times he got up, he felt shooting pains going down his back."
Jim Tracy,"It's not just one conversation. We've talked an awful lot about what a leadoff hitter is all about, in my opinion, and the role he plays in setting a table."
Jim Tracy,"Stuff-wise, it doesn't get much better than what you see from this guy, ... The consistency of what's thrown for strikes has improved. ... Sanchez obviously has stepped up."
Jim Tracy,"There was no way to expect how well he's done. The consistency of his at-bats have been eye opening. He's a guy that when you look beyond just the here and now, ahead to 2006 and beyond, he's obviously become a very valuable piece for us."
Jim Tracy,If there are two areas right now that you'd like to see us [improve] it's the consistency of our starting pitching and our execution in game-changing at-bats.
Jim Tracy,"He made a very good pitch to Linden. In other circumstances, it's a bat that's broken in half and a soft single to right field, but as a result of the sacrifice bunt that followed a walk, it was a game-winning hit."
Jim Tracy,I don't think it's any more daunting than some of the challenges we have faced up to this point. We have seen some awfully good pitching.
Jim Tracy,"Our approach is that at this early juncture of the spring, you're going to err on the side of caution. Right now, I'm not thinking about anything other than let's find out what we're dealing with so we can move forward."
Jim Tracy,Our approach in any situation like that this early in the spring is to err on the side of caution.
Jim Tracy,"When you face guys of that caliber, your starters have to believe they are equal to the task. One thing I know about both Oliver and Zach is they believe that. They do more than just believe that -- they expect to go out there and match those guys. The situation could become very interesting if it plays itself out."
Jim Tracy,"We've got a tremendous amount of baseball to play in 2006. If you get effort like that every night from that group of players, things are going to get going here and we're going to be all right."
Jim Tracy,"He has a tremendous baseball mind. When I have someone like that sitting next to me, I feel confident there is not too much that's going to get by us during the course of a game."
Jim Tracy,There's not any timetable yet for him to swing off a tee or swing at balls.
Jim Tracy,"He played terrific. Like he hadn't missed a beat. He handled the ground balls in the field flawlessly, just like I've seen him do for a number of years."
Jim Tracy,"I know him very well. From that standpoint, when you have a sense of awareness about a guy, you have a better understanding of him than a guy you're seeing for the first time."
Jim Tracy,"For a kid his age, he's off the charts. He's going to be a good -- make that really good -- Major League baseball player some day."
Jim Tracy,"We're encouraged by that. We can form a definitive course of action for his rehabilitation and strengthening, so when we get to Spring Training, we won't have to deal with it."
Jim Tracy,"It just makes sense, ... The way he runs and his ability to steal a base; if he gets on base it sets the stage                                                                                                                         for a Robles at-bat."
Jim Tracy,This guy has got a lot of mileage out of the ability he possesses. He becomes a better player when you're able to work within the framework of his ability.
Jim Tracy,"I think that is a prerequisite in considering a guy (to pitch) late in the game. Also, the ability to be able to bounce back after you've had a tough day, and realize you can't have too many bad days in a row because that's not good for a baseball team."
Jim Tracy,You'd be blind if you didn't look at this guy and say there's a lot of ability. And you know what? He's an even better person.
Paul Tracy,I think I just want to finish the race.
Paul Tracy,"I think I just want to finish the race. I think if we don't get involved in any crashes that happen and don't have any problems and our stops go OK, then maybe we can finish inside the top 15. That would be great."
Paul Tracy,"This is the biggest race of the year, Daytona. This is the one that everybody wants to be at, this is the one every sponsor wants to be involved in."
Paul Tracy,"I've got to get out on the track and test and race and see how it all goes. Obviously it's something I'm interested in, but we'll just see how it goes, see how things progress."
Paul Tracy,"Hopefully, I can run 10 to 11 races in Busch and maybe a (Nextel Cup Series) race or two."
Paul Tracy,"We have to treat every race like its our last and at the end of the year, if it's enough, it's enough. If not, at least we'll know we put everything into it."
Paul Tracy,"The team that wins this race is the one that doesn't have any unscheduled pit stops. Some of these guys, they might be tempted to make this into a sprint race and try to show how fast (they) are against all the all-stars. But, really, that's not going to be what wins this race."
Paul Tracy,"I was amazed with the quality of drivers in last year's field, and there are going to be even more this year. The list is very strong - a lot of drivers that are just the cream of the crop. I'm here to win. That's why I chose to run with these guys and with this team."
Paul Tracy,"The first year we raced at Denver, the track had some teething problems and was bumpy and slippery, but it has gotten a lot better since then, ... Last year, I was leading the race and (Sebastien) Bourdais caught me and won the event and we finished second. So I am very excited to come back to see if we can win this time."
Paul Tracy,"I've been afforded the opportunity to do this from Forsythe. He said to me to 'If you want to go NASCAR, you better go try it first before you commit to a 38-race schedule.' So here I am."
Paul Tracy,"We just didn't have the speed the Newman-Haas cars have,"
Paul Tracy,"Absolutely it had a lot to do with my decision. I am Canadian and I love racing in Canada and racing in the 24 for a team with a Canadian sponsor was really appealing to me. This event is one of the crown jewels of racing, and I really want to add a win here it to my resume."
Paul Tracy,"I am totally happy being in the Champ Car World Series, ... I get to race in Canada three times a year, which is very important to me and I just love to road race."
Paul Tracy,"I figure, at my age, I still have three, four, maybe five years in (Champ Car) left in me, but it could be the right time to make a change and I want to take a good look at it. I've talked with some other teams over there (in NASCAR), but Richard Childress is the only one who has stepped up and made something happen at this point."
Paul Tracy,He only made one mistake in the hairpin and we weren't close enough to take advantage.
Georg Trakl,The guilt of newborns is immense.
Georg Trakl,"The blue of my eyes is extinguished in this night, the red gold of my heart."
Georg Trakl,"When we are thirsty, we drink the white waters of the pool, the sweetness of our mournful childhood."
Georg Trakl,"Despair, night in the grieving senses."
Georg Trakl,"Black frost. The ground is hard, the air tastes bitter. Your stars cluster in evil signs."
Georg Trakl,"Silently, God opens his golden eyes over the place of skulls."
Alan Trammell,"This year, if I'm voting, I'm voting for Colon."
Alan Trammell,"What a trade they made getting Nathan and Liriano and another guy that led the International League in strikeouts,"
Alan Trammell,"We're all responsible, ... I'm the leader, the captain of the ship, and I have to take responsibility."
Alan Trammell,That's the only way to do it because there's no magic dust for times like this.
Alan Trammell,"We don't have the finished product yet, we have a learning 21-year-old. But we like what we have. I give him credit, going through what he went through last season, getting on-the-job training. He handled himself well under the circumstances."
Alan Trammell,"We're doing our job,"
Alan Trammell,"I like what I see of him, but there's room for improvement."
Alan Trammell,"In all honesty, they should be,"
Alan Trammell,"In all honesty, the guys we've been playing, it hasn't been a whole lot different, anyway. Whatever we've done to this point hasn't really worked. I'll go the other way. Honestly, it's been a struggle no matter who we put out there."
Alan Trammell,"(Grilli) did an outstanding job. I couldn't be happier. I'm sure he's very happy. He did a great job tonight. He had a good curveball tonight. Normally when he's pitching well, it's working for him. He threw it for strikes."
Alan Trammell,"What was there to like about this game? It was 10-4 and probably could have been worse,"
Alan Trammell,Maybe he can open some eyes.
Alan Trammell,"We're struggling, no doubt about it. There's nothing we can sprinkle on these guys, though. There's no magic. Just keep working."
Alan Trammell,"He's pitched better than that, there's no doubt about it. I think that's really it. Seven innings against the White Sox, I'll take that every time. He's given us all he's got. He deserves more."
Alan Trammell,"The athletic players (on the Devil Rays) fit me, and I would love to be able to work with a team like this."
Alan Trammell,"Nothing's been promised, ... It was an opportunity to talk baseball and tell them why I think I'm a good candidate."
Alan Trammell,"I hope I get to continue with this because there is some unfinished business. I'm going to be in baseball for many more years, whether it is here or not. I'm not done. I'm confident that I can do this."
Alan Trammell,his ability to get along with everybody -- making you feel welcome.
Tim Trantham,"A couple of young men did a real fine job defensively against them. I thought Jordan Daniels did an excellent job on (Chris) Harris inside. He did not get latched behind him and tried to get around in front of the post. I thought overall the perimeter defense was OK. We held several guys in check and to hold them in the 30s -- you've got to be pleased with that. The effort was there, I'm just not sure the mentality part was."
Tim Trantham,"When I looked in Aaron's eyes during the timeout, I knew he would make those free throws. He looked very confident. We could have folded after Pisgah was ahead by two points and time running out, but our guys just wouldn't quit tonight, they wanted to win too much."
Tim Trantham,"I feel like an 8-year old kid who just got a bike on Christmas morning. It was a huge sigh of relief to get this win tonight. We told our kids that we had some frustrating losses this season and we could make amends in this tournament. We did a great job of holding off Pisgah's spurts because they can score in a hurry, and we didn't give up when they fought back at us at the end."
Giovanni Trapattoni,We had that little bit of luck we have been missing all season.
Giovanni Trapattoni,He scored a great goal. I thought he deserved another. He's young and has plenty of room for improvement.
Giovanni Trapattoni,"We'll see how he feels, I'll talk with him and the doctors and then we'll decide."
Giovanni Trapattoni,"We had lot of players leave, lots of new players come and a new coach -- it's a team that has to find itself."
John Travolta,"So you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna do something really outrageous, I'm gonna tell the truth."
John Travolta,You try to keep the delivery room quiet so there's nothing recorded in the child's mind that shouldn't be there while there's pain going on.
John Travolta,I grew up with these kind of men.
John Travolta,"I felt marvelous about that because she's equally wanting to see others thrive because that's real love. You know real love, if you boil down to the bottom line is: the desire to see someone survive and thrive."
John Travolta,"I've hit a milestone in my life, turning 50, and if I waited any longer I'd have to write two books. I've had such a full life, I really want to share it."
John Travolta,It's basically like old home week. You get to hang out with your buddies.
John Travolta,Gilmore Girls.
John Travolta,"They're creative, they've got stamina and a sense of fun. You couldn't ask for more,"
John Travolta,We've been friends for 28 or 29 years and we have always been there for each other no matter what. Thick or thin.
John Travolta,He lives with his creativity in high gear.
John Travolta,"[In addition to] A Civil Action, ... The Thin Red Line."
John Travolta,"When I first started making films like 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Urban Cowboy,' those were accidents as far as social impact is concerned and we didn't know what we were doing as far as the effects they would have. But when you make decisions like 'Primary Colors' or 'A Civil Action,' those are bolder and kind of dangerous in a way because you can't be guaranteed that anyone will come to them. I really can't do it without you (the film critics) because these kind of films don't survive out there without your acknowledgment. We have to be a team here, otherwise we can't survive very well."
Star Trek,"Space, the final frontier ..."
Star Trek,"[Sep 26 |] Is human nature savage? It's a question that STAR TREK addressed in many ways, ... You'd Do The Same For Me."
Star Trek,"The Vulcan Neck Pinch is not half as powerful as the Vulcan Groin Kick, but it's more politically correct"
Star Trek,"If (casinos) don't see it reflected in gaming they'll see it reflected in food and beverage, reflected in retail."
Marcus Trescothick,"The best I have seen him bowl has been in the past couple of weeks but it is not something we can worry about too much. To lose a major player in your team, who has done so well, is obviously disappointing but it gives someone else an opportunity to come in and play in a series like this."
Marcus Trescothick,It was a tough night for Kabir but that was a special last over under pressure.
Marcus Trescothick,"It is an opportunity for him here. The wickets are pretty good, and I hope he can take advantage in this series."
Marcus Trescothick,"It was a close game between two good teams. Still two games to go, and we will do things right and try to come back stronger."
Marcus Trescothick,It got to the point when I said I was pretty fatigued and struggling to concentrate on my cricket ahead of a big Test match. I spoke to the people that needed to know and decided it was the right thing to come home.
Marcus Trescothick,"He missed out on one of the warm-up games, but I have a lot of confidence that he will do well,"
Marcus Trescothick,It is pretty nice to end the tour with a win. We will think of the Indian tour after Christmas.
Jim Tressel,My biggest worry is they look awful good across the board.
Jim Tressel,"We really work hard before the season and during the season ... at focusing on what's going on this second. I think there's a lot more people outside of our building that talk about that (the BCS), what's going to go on in January and whatever."
Jim Tressel,Early last season Ted Ginn was a novice playing a new position. You could see the increase in understanding. Once you understand what's being asked of you [then] all of a sudden your physical abilities take over. And he's got extraordinary physical abilities.
Jim Tressel,"Early last season Ted Ginn was a novice playing a new position, ... You could see the increase in understanding. Once you understand what's being asked of you [then] all of a sudden your physical abilities take over. And he's got extraordinary physical abilities."
Jim Tressel,I'm just excited to see his face and to see him smile a little bit and to see how anxious Maurice is to be back with his guys.
Jim Tressel,"Recruiting is such an inexact science. I remember a former staff member here, when we said we were going to offer A.J. Hawk a scholarship, he said, 'Oh, man. That's like a (Division) 1-AA fullback coming here.' Now, A.J. will be able to buy a few things here in a few weeks."
Jim Tressel,I saw him (Monday). Moving over to Dodd Hall is a good sign. He?s making progress and taking the next step in his road back.
Jim Tressel,"Exactly who will play when, obviously we're not going to outline for you today, but I think Troy's performance in the '04 season, his performance in the spring and his performance in preseason warrants him deserving to play. I think Justin's performance last season and this spring and this preseason and now Game 1 of this season warrants that he should play."
Jim Tressel,"The No. 1 goal we had was to make sure our seniors left with a wonderful memory. It was a tough football game, but our kids deserved to win it."
Jim Tressel,"If it's the last game you'd ever want to see in your life, it might be these two teams, and that makes it special. Two great football states, two great schools, two of the largest alumni in the world. The interest level is tremendous."
Jim Tressel,"We hate to lose him, but I'm extremely proud he has achieved this position and wish him the very best,"
Jim Tressel,"For this football game, as it stands right now, yeah, we've got two starting quarterbacks, ... We're planning to play both guys."
Jim Tressel,"Tyson is a wonderful young man, who loves the game of football and loves being at Ohio State and following in the footsteps of his dad. Our players, coaches and everyone in the Ohio State Athletics Department family are praying fervently for his recovery."
Jim Tressel,"This is a tough defensive football team that he's going to face in a tough environment, and it's a great challenge for him and a great challenge for the guys that will be on the field at the same time with him, and we certainly hope that he can continue to be efficient, make good decisions and so forth, but that's what Saturday is for -- to find that out,"
Jim Tressel,"It obviously was not by design that he didn't touch the ball more, ... If we would have done a better job of making touchdowns it would have come out differently."
Jim Tressel,"Our defense fought like crazy and came up with things that we needed, like the turnovers, ... We just needed more touchdowns."
Jim Tressel,I don't ever like to squash one's creativity.
Jim Tressel,I think consistency is always the measuring stick to see if you're going to get good. Our goal is to become a consistent offensive football team that does its part and whatever needs to be done to win.
Jim Tressel,"Absolutely. I think the consistency, or lack thereof -- where we are at this moment is not where you'd like to be after three games. We haven't done little things across the board. Everyone likes to discuss what we haven't done at quarterback, but we could talk a little bit about all the way down the line, where we need to get a lot better. We need to get a lot better fast, because when you start playing against the Big Ten defenses, yards and first downs and points are even more difficult. So we've got a lot of work to do and we've just got to get at it."
Jim Tressel,"Coach Hazell in the pre-meeting before we were heading over to the skull session took ill and â€“ and the trainers thought it would be best if they took him over from a preventative standpoint, took him over to the hospital. The word I got as we were coming up is that he's doing fine and don't know for sure if he'll be out today, but they feel good about where they have him and he'll be fine."
Jim Tressel,That wouldn't have been my first choice. But I can't have it back.
Jim Tressel,He's smart. He doesn't panic. He has an awareness for the whole field. He can tell by how you line up and who's in the game what may be coming. He's tough. He never misses a practice snap. You have to drag him off the field in games.
Jim Tressel,"What was impressive to me was that he looked like he has all spring - confident, patient, and with the ability to accelerate."
Jim Tressel,"He looked like he did the whole spring, comfortable and patient. That's a big guy with the ability to accelerate. We're very pleased with him."
Marc Trestman,"It's obvious the guys did a lot of work. And Jay is out there just living his dream, playing quarterback at a Division I-A college."
Marc Trestman,You don't go into it with the idea that you're trying to please anybody. You're trying to move the football and score touchdowns.
Marc Trestman,"He has the greatest understanding of the offense. He's got excellent hands, and he's got great running ability as well."
G. M. Trevelyan,"I have two doctors, my left leg and my right."

G. M. Trevelyan,Education... has produced a vast population able to read but unable to distinguish what is worth reading.
Lee Trevino,Al Geiberger should have to take a test to prove he's a member of the human race.
Lee Trevino,"[Jack Nicklaus] was the first to bring in course management. He could go to a course and tell you within one stroke what was going to win. He used to set his sights on that because he could shoot it. He was the only player I know who, if he decided he wanted to win a tournament, could go out and do it. No one will ever be as popular as Arnold Palmer and no one will ever come close to Jack as a player."
Lee Trevino,"I love it. I don't know if I love it as much as Arnold Palmer, but I think I am close. I can't wait to get up in the mornings because I know I am going out to play golf. The game has been very good to me. Much has been said about when I am going to retire but I never will."
Lee Trevino,"He's one guy we admire, ... We love Arnie. The best way I can sum this up is when I tell my kids to look up the definition of class, his picture is next to the word. That's what we think about him. Not one person out here doesn't think that."
Lee Trevino,"I do not know any player, who could strike a golf ball like he (Norman) can, as far as hitting it solid, knowing where it's going, knowing the mechanics of the game and knowing what he wanted to do with the golf ball."
Lee Trevino,"At 15 we put down my bag to hunt for a ball, found the ball, lost the bag."
Lee Trevino,"Nobody buy you and your caddie care what you do out there, and if your caddie is betting against you, he doesn't care, either."
Lee Trevino,"There are two things that won't last long in this world, and that's dogs chasing cars and pros putting for pars"
Lee Trevino,A hungry dog hunts best
Lee Trevino,"Golf isn't just my business, it's my hobby"
Lee Trevino,"You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can't get them across, your ideas won't get you anywhere."
Lee Trevino,"There are two things that won't last long in this world, and that's dogs chasing cars and pros putting for pars."
Lee Trevino,"The most interesting guy I've ever played with was King Hassan of Morocco. I went over there on a trip in the early 1970s, and the King and I played five holes. I've never been that nervous in my life."
Lee Trevino,"Nobody but you and your caddie care what you do out there, and if your caddie is betting against you, he doesn't care, either."
Lee Trevino,Michael Jordan was a tremendous basketball player.
Lee Trevino,"Living in Dallas, I root for the Mavericks and the Stars and the Cowboys, but I've always pulled for the Chicago Cubs. I enjoy watching them play."
Lee Trevino,"If I could do anything over, I'd have spent more time with my first set of children. I would have taken more quality time with them, for sure."
Lee Trevino,I've traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine. There's not anything I'm scared of except my wife.
Lee Trevino,I've played golf with three U.S presidents.
Lee Trevino,"I'm actually a very quiet person off the golf course. I talk 150 miles per hour when I'm at the course, but when in private I very seldom ever open my mouth."
Lee Trevino,I use an Arnold Palmer putter that was probably built back in 1954.
Lee Trevino,"I think a lot of Jim Thorpe, the Olympian, and his accomplishments."
Lee Trevino,I stay away from the telephone if at all possible.
Lee Trevino,I never played much golf as a kid. I caddied quite a bit but never got serious into golf until about age 15.
Lee Trevino,"I met Jesse Owens once. He was a remarkable individual, and I have tremendous respect for what he did in the Olympics under the circumstances."
Lee Trevino,"Golf isn't just my business, it's my hobby."
Lee Trevino,There is no such thing as natural touch. Touch is something you create by hitting millions of golf balls.
Lee Trevino,I'm not scared of very much. I've been hit by lightning and been in the Marine Corps for four years.
Lee Trevino,"My wife doesn't care what I do when I'm away, as long as I don't have a good time."
Lee Trevino,I'm not out there just to be dancing around. I expect to win every time I tee up.
Lee Trevino,I still sweat. My guts are still grinding out there. Sometimes I have enough cotton in my mouth to knit a sweater.
Lee Trevino,There is no such thing as a natural touch. Touch is something you create by hitting millions of golf balls.
Lee Trevino,"I have an orthopedic pillow that's made out of a sponge material. I have a plate in my throat, and I have to be careful or I could end up with a bad neck in the morning. That pillow is a must everywhere I go."
Lee Trevino,Pressure is when you play for five dollars a hole with only two in your pocket.
Lee Trevino,You can talk to a fade but a hook won't listen.
Lee Trevino,"When it comes to the game of life, I figure I've played the whole course."
Lee Trevino,Pressure is playing for ten dollars when you don't have a dime in your pocket.
Lee Trevino,"His nerve, his memory, and I can't remember the third thing."
Lee Trevino,No one who ever had lessons would have a swing like mine.
Lee Trevino,I adore the game of golf. I won't ever retire.
Lee Trevino,"If you are caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron."
Lee Trevino,Putts get real difficult the day they hand out the money.
Lee Trevino,"I'm going to win so much money this year, my caddie will make the top twenty money winner's list."
Lee Trevino,"How can they beat me? I've been struck by lightning, had two back operations, and been divorced twice."
Lee Trevino,"Yes, I think I have the best swing on the Tour. Why have scores comedown in the last ten years? Partly because they are imitating me."
Lee Trevino,"One of the nice things about the Senior Tour is that we can take a cart and cooler. If your game is not going well, you can always have a picnic."
Lee Trevino,"In case of a thunderstorm, stand in the middle of the fairway and hold up a one iron. Not even God can hit a one iron."
Lee Trevino,My divorce came to me as a complete surprise. That's what happens when you haven't been home in eighteen years.
Lee Trevino,The older I get the better I used to be!
Lee Trevino,A hungry dog hunts best.
Lee Trevino,You can make a lot of money in this game. Just ask my ex-wives. Both of them are so rich that neither of their husbands work.
William Trevor,I value mothers and motherhood enormously. For every inattentive or abusive mother in my fiction I think you'll find a dozen or so who are neither.
William Trevor,"The capacity you're thinking of is imagination; without it there can be no understanding, indeed no fiction."
William Trevor,A disease in the family that is never mentioned.
David Trezeguet,All the big names have experienced problems. Our results are not so bad after all. No one proved they were better than us.
David Trezeguet,It's 100 goals. I'm very proud of myself and my team-mates. It's part of the history of this club and it's something exceptional.
David Trezeguet,"Im happy with my two goals at Empoli because they took me closer to my target,"
Joey Tribbiani,This is the first such occurrence that's ever happened at Memorial Park Cemetery to my knowledge. This is a very rare occurrence. It's a very tragic end to someone's life. They feel that's the only way out.
Joey Tribbiani,"We will be relocating the service center, which is the family services center, mental health, the medical department. That will be relocated we hope next week. We don't know the location right now, but we will find a new location next week."
Joey Tribbiani,"With everything we look at, there is something about gambling that relates to America. Eventually, we would want regulations and controls because outside the U.S. is outside our ability to control."
Dick Trickle,Larry and Kathy (his wife) were both close friends of mine. I thought a lot of them. I still do.
Dick Trickle,"Racing is in my blood, I can't quite get out of it yet."
Dick Trickle,"I did it for a living, made a career out of it, but now I've turned it into somewhat of a hobby."
Lars Trier,"The risk is that you furnish the project with new suggestions to try and freshen it up; it's not always beneficial. You risk betraying the original intention with the story, forgetting what it is you really want to portray."
Lars Trier,"I'd toyed with a couple of ideas beforehand, but I hadn't written a single cue, and it was a wonderful feeling to just write away."
Lars Trier,"This way of working with actors that I have found now is normally a great pleasure, because it means giving a lot of freedom to some people-and to see them enjoy that freedom and to give to the project is usually very nice."
Lars Trier,In many ways the six weeks of shooting was the most intense film experience I've ever had.
Lars Trier,"Evil gives you far more strings to pull. But I must say that I have never been interested in the psychology of evil, not in the slightest. Perhaps I'm not interested in evil, but in the dark sides of human beings."
Lars Trier,"If you go on correcting a script, you may lose your enthusiasm. It almost happened in this process, too, when we spent ages changing scenes and moving back and forth; but in the end we returned to the original, and the final version of the film is very close to the script."
Lars Trier,It felt important to find some actors who really had the enthusiasm to participate. And I think it feels as if the heart is in it among those we finally chose.
Lars Trier,"When I was younger, I was fascinated by David Bowie, for example. he had created an entire myth around himself. It was as important as his music."
Lars Trier,"More than anything, there are more images in evil. Evil is based far more on the visual, whereas good has no good images at all."
Lars Trier,"I sit there pouring out my woes year after year, coming up with one enormity after another about my mother and the way she let me down; but it doesn't make me any the less fearful."
Lars Trier,"I grew up in a culturally radical home, where strong emotions were forbidden."
Lars Trier,I have maneuvered my way through four or five different types of cancer that I completely succumbed to. It's amazing how many probable types of cancer can arise when hypochondria permits.
Lars Trier,"It`s very exciting to be introduced to some movies by Matthew about objects like architecture...but I`m more of a typical woman, I like feelings."
Calvin Trillin,It happens to be a matter of record that I was first in print with the discovery that the tastelessness of the food offered in American clubs varies in direct proportion to the exclusiveness of the club.
Calvin Trillin,The shelf life of the average trade book is somewhere between milk and yogurt.
Calvin Trillin,"When it comes to Chinese food I have always operated under the policy that the less known about the preparation the better. A wise diner who is invited to visit the kitchen replies by saying, as politely as possible, that he has a pressing engagement elsewhere."
Calvin Trillin,"The question about those aromatic advertisements that perfume companies are having stitched into magazines these days is this: under the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment, is smelling up the place a constitutionally protected form of expression?"
Calvin Trillin,The food in such places is so tasteless because the members associate spices and garlic with just the sort of people they're trying to keep out.
Calvin Trillin,"As far as I'm concerned, whom is a word that was invented to make everyone sound like a butler."
Calvin Trillin,"In modern America, anyone who attempts to write satirically about the events of the day finds it difficult to concoct a situation so bizarre that it may not actually come to pass while the article is still on the presses"
Calvin Trillin,I never did very well in math - I could never seem to persuade the teacher that I hadn't meant my answers literally.
Calvin Trillin,The most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers. The original meal has never been found.
Calvin Trillin,I never eat in a restaurant that's over a hundred feet off the ground and won't stand still.
Calvin Trillin,Health food makes me sick.
David Trimble,"Whatever decisions are taken, there is no place for violence and riot and the incidents that we have seen over the last few days,"
David Trimble,"It was made clear to Sinn Fein again and again and again that this experiment, this risk that we were taking, would be time-limited and would not run beyond the end of January."
David Trimble,It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run while the race is still not quite finished.
David Trimble,"[While saying that there had been] some progress, ... there are difficulties ahead."
David Trimble,There has been useful work done. There has been a degree of progress but ... it's not all there yet.
David Trimble,This clears the way for the transfer of power from London to the Assembly.
David Trimble,"We have done and will continue to do everything we can to maximize the opportunity that's here for people, ... I hope we've gone over the Rubicon this time."
David Trimble,We have done and will continue to do everything we can to maximize the opportunity that's here for people. I hope we've gone over the Rubicon this time.
David Trimble,not to rush to judgement
David Trimble,"Recovery would be very simple -- let the prime minister put the information he has in the public domain,"
David Trimble,"We hope that they can, as they have done in the past, improve on what the IRA has done,"
David Trimble,"Of course, if they show they are committed to peaceful means and they honor the undertakings they gave under the agreement, there's still the prospect of people jumping together but it's time to start to deliver."
David Trimble,"But to deny the simple fact that this is a breach of the cease-fire is, I think, deeply disappointing."
David Trimble,In all of this we have negotiated in good faith. It is now apparent that others have not.
David Trimble,"In all of this we have negotiated in good faith. It is now apparent that others have not,"
David Trimble,"There have been problems, no doubt about it."
David Trimble,The debate revealed that the differences between us were tactical. They made clear that they are committed to an assembly on a cross community basis.
David Trimble,"We will of course be reflecting on all of the things that have been said in the debate and carrying through the tactics that have been outlined,"
David Trimble,The present situation is appalling. There is a serious danger that the problems could spread to other schools in the area.
David Trimble,We are dealing here with a conflict of rights; there's right on both sides.
David Trimble,"If there is a real commitment, then getting rid of the weapons could not possibly be a problem,"
David Trimble,We have still not secured any commitment (on IRA disarmament) that would be recognized by unionists. We consider that the guarantees are weak.
David Trimble,"We have stretched ourselves remarkably in the circumstances, ... It is also obvious there is a limit to how far we can stretch ourselves without an adequate response being made in the circumstances."

Tommy Tuberville,There's one thing I'll say. I'd hate to play us.
Tommy Tuberville,"I've got a subscription to Golf Digest. I may ask them to vote us No. 1, ... We're 13-0. We should be national champions. There's no doubt about it."
Tommy Tuberville,We did keep a few guys out of the game to get them healed for next week. They should be back next week.
Tommy Tuberville,"We appreciate the hard work and efforts that David gave to the Auburn football program over the last year. He did an excellent job as our defensive coordinator this past season, and I know he'll continue to be successful in the future."
Tommy Tuberville,"It's not over-recruiting. Since Ole Miss, we've built our philosophy around running the football. You've got to have a running game in order to be successful in college football."
Tommy Tuberville,"It was a good practice. Guys are showing a lot of enthusiasm. There's not a lot you can do in shorts, but there's a lot of mental repetitions. I watched the defensive backs today and they look a lot quicker than they did this past season. There are a lot of new faces we're looking at with that position. There will be a lot of competition with those guys this spring. Tomorrow we'll start easing into contact. Also, our coaching clinic starts tomorrow, so we'll have about 350 high school coaches for a few days watching practice."
Tommy Tuberville,"We threw high passes, we dropped balls, I called the wrong plays. It's just a mixture of things. You can say we weren't ready. We didn't have the emotion that we had the last couple of games. That's pretty obvious."
Tommy Tuberville,"We used last week to our advantage of getting guys healthy. We've got almost everything in that we want to do against Arkansas. We're going into this game healthy and full of speed, a lot of energy."
Joe Tucci,"That's a tremendous opportunity,"
Joe Tucci,"One of the reasons I chose EMC was that I didn't want to go through that (Wang experience) again, ... I wanted to see if I could take something great and make it greater."
Joe Tucci,We fully expect our momentum and level of execution to continue into 2006 and beyond.
Joe Tucci,"The harsh reality of reduced budgets and the uncertainty of the economic and geopolitical climate are weighing heavily on business confidence, causing key projects and the corresponding IT spending to be delayed."
Barbara Tuchman,"Books are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print."
Barbara Tuchman,"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. They are engines of change, windows on the world, lighthouses erected in the sea of time."
Barbara Tuchman,"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill."
Barbara Tuchman,Books are humanity in print.
Brian Tucker,"There's a real dearth of trained engineers and scientists from Pakistan,"
Brian Tucker,"I've had water problems in the bathroom for months. I told them to fix it last July, and it still hasn't been fixed."
Brian Tucker,We have some goals for them and we'll see how they do.
Brian Tucker,"[Chairman Brian Tucker explained the organization was looking for a fun way to share what PEP does for the county.] This is a good way for us to get out in the community, ... We're making an effort to be sure everyone in North Augusta knows we're here."
Brian Tucker,"It [the girls' success] is finally rubbing off on the boys team. It took long enough,"
Darcy Tucker,We'll worry about [tonight] and go from there.
Darcy Tucker,My eye watered for the rest of the game. There was some blood rolling around in there for four or five minutes and then it calmed down.
Darcy Tucker,"We're trying to stick together here and do the proper things and do the proper plays and work hard in practice and find ways to win hockey games, but it's awfully frustrating when you lose."
Darcy Tucker,We're going to keep fighting and give it our best shot.
Darcy Tucker,"It was a funny situation, ... My son was born and as the nurse yelled out the time of birth -- 7:05 p.m. -- everybody started chuckling, which I couldn't understand. Then someone said it was happening around the same time the puck was being dropped in our game [against Montreal] at the Air Canada Centre. I guess I'll have to get the little guy a stick."
Tom Tucker,When we engraved the 442 names on the back of the medals - that's when the reality sinks in. Everybody in the whole plant had to be involved to check the names and match the medals with the cases. You see names of fathers and sons and brothers and the reality sinks in that basically whole families were wiped out trying to help people. But that's what we do - what we manufacture generally has a higher degree of meaning to those that receive it. It's not just any award.
Tom Tucker,Last summer we received a phone call from the Department of Justice requesting medals commemorating the fallen police officers and firefighters who died trying to rescue people during the 9/11 attacks. We did that order in record time. They know they can come to us and get high quality awards in the shortest time you can expect - but sometimes physics does limit some things.
Tom Tucker,It will be a huge improvement on Stone Avenue overall.
Tom Tucker,We're seeing quite a bit of activity with schools and higher education. They have a lot of data that needs to be secure.
Tom Tucker,"This is a fascinating and unexpected discovery, if it turns out to be true."
Edward Tufte,The central claim of the book is that effective analytic designs entail turning thinking principles into seeing principles.
Edward Tufte,The know-your-audience philosophy can be a big step down the road to pandering to the audience.
Edward Tufte,The key argument is that cognitive tasks should be turned into design principles.
Edward Tufte,"In emphasizing evidential quality and beauty, I also want to move the practices of analytical design far away from the practices of propaganda, marketing, graphic design, and commercial art."
Edward Tufte,We've drifted into this presentation mode without realizing the cost to the content and the audience in the process.
Edward Tufte,"It's not that PowerPoint brought the Columbia down, but the method of presentation broke up the argument into tiny fragments, and it's intensely hierarchical-no sentences, just little phrases."
Edward Tufte,"I was writing a chapter of Beautiful Evidence on the subject of the sculptural pedestal, which led to my thinking about what's up on the pedestal - the great leader."
Edward Tufte,The idea of trying to create things that last - forever knowledge - has guided my work for a long time now.
Edward Tufte,"It is straightforward for me to be ethical, responsible, and kind-hearted because I have the resources to support that."
Edward Tufte,A curious consequence is that I have become a minor celebrity.
Edward Tufte,The point of the essay is to change things.
Edward Tufte,The minimum we should hope for with any display technology is that it should do no harm.
Edward Tufte,Public discussions are part of what it takes to make changes in the trillions of graphics published each year.
Edward Tufte,"A practical part of my teaching is to provide demonstrative, hands-on experiences."
Edward Tufte,The goal is to provide analytical tools that will last students a lifetime.
Edward Tufte,I think it is important for software to avoiding imposing a cognitive style on workers and their work.
Edward Tufte,My father worked for governments all his life as an engineer and public works director.
Edward Tufte,The speculative part of my work is that these particular cognitive tasks - ways of thinking analytically - are tied to nature's laws.
Edward Tufte,Beautiful Evidence is about the theory and practice of analytical design.
Edward Tufte,"My idea here is that, inasmuch as certain cognitive tasks and principles are tied to nature's laws, these tasks and principles are indifferent to language, culture, gender, or the particular mode of information that is provided."
Edward Tufte,"What gets left out is the narrative between the bullets, which would tell us who's going to do what and how we're going to achieve the generic goals on the list."
Edward Tufte,"At its heart, my work is about how to think clearly and deeply, using evidence, and all that has to pass through some presentation state."
Edward Tufte,"Rather, the point is to recognize the tightness between seeing and thinking on an intellectual level not just a metaphorical level."
Edward Tufte,"I am certainly not an intellectual relativist, nor a moral relativist."
Edward Tufte,"I hope that I am generous and tolerant, but certainly on the intellectual side I think that there are discoverable truths, and some things that are closer approximations to the truth than others."
Edward Tufte,What this means is that we shouldn't abbreviate the truth but rather get a new method of presentation.
Edward Tufte,There are many true statements about complex topics that are too long to fit on a PowerPoint slide.
Edward Tufte,The leading edge in evidence presentation is in science; the leading edge in beauty is in high art.
Edward Tufte,The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly - to develop strategies of seeing and showing.
Edward Tufte,"That is to say, nature's laws are causal; they reveal themselves by comparison and difference, and they operate at every multivariate space/time point."
Edward Tufte,"I do believe that there are some universal cognitive tasks that are deep and profound - indeed, so deep and profound that it is worthwhile to understand them in order to design our displays in accord with those tasks."
Edward Tufte,"If you like overheads, you'll love PowerPoint."
Bruce Tulgan,"A person's willingness to conform to arbitrary parameters is not a good criterion for selecting talent or allocating rewards,"
Bruce Tulgan,"The No. 1 thing is to be one of those people who gets a lot of work done very well, very fast. Don't be scared into submission by all the downsizing activity. That's exactly the wrong message to take."
Bruce Tulgan,This one wants more money. That one wants a different schedule. Another person wants to trade in her responsibilities for a whole new set. This one wants to be included in high-level meetings. That one wants to attend a particular training program. Still another wants to start telecommuting ... from a thousand miles away.
Bruce Tulgan,We are all moving into the workplace of the future together. It's all about competing for the best people. And the best people are thinking about their worklives in a whole new way. [Employers] have to lose their attachment to the old-fashioned career path. We can all learn from the emerging workforce and generation.
Bruce Tulgan,"Always be assessing your particular skills and your particular experience and your particular abilities and energies and interests, and matching them up with the available work to be done. And then be prepared to sell yourself into challenges."
Bruce Tulgan,"In today's global economy, employees and their employers need to think about their working lives in a whole new way, ... Everything is turned on its head. [Job] security is not about stability; it's about mobility. The very same forces that are changing today's workplace are working on Gen X, and they are dovetailing."
Jethro Tull,"My words are a whisper, your deafness a shout."
Jethro Tull,You set your wealth in Godly deeds against the seeds you've laid.
Jethro Tull,"To tell the truth, I'd scare me too."
Jethro Tull,Be sure to leave your underpants with someone you can trust.
Jethro Tull,"A sweetly scented angel fell, she laid her head upon my disbelief, and battled with me with her ever smile."
Jethro Tull,How can you laugh when your mother's hungry? How can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?
Jethro Tull,"I came across Mother Goose, so I turned her loose, she was screaming."
Jethro Tull,"He is the God of nothing, if that is all you can see. He is the God of everything, he's inside you and me."
Jethro Tull,"Sitting on a park bench, eyeing up little girls with bad intent."
Jethro Tull,"Jump up, look around, find yourself some fun. No sense in sitting there hating everyone."
Jethro Tull,"Lend me your ear, while I call you a fool."
Jethro Tull,"Give us Direction; the best of goodwill; Put us in touch with fair winds. Sing to us softly, hum the evening's song. Tell us what the blacksmith has done for you."
Jethro Tull,"The excrement bubbles, the century slime decays, and the brainwashing government lackeys would have us say it's under control."
Jethro Tull,"I don't know about carry out, but you can carry me off to bed."
Tommy Tune,Time is running out to permeate the piece.
Tommy Tune,"I would just stand there puzzled, then realize this would be a great place to make a show."
Tommy Tune,Because I like to pick up where I left off and continue from there.
Tommy Tune,"I like a show to unfold and keep presenting itself, surprising you."
Tommy Tune,I've had this reoccurring dream for the last ten to fifteen years.
Gene Tunney,"Upon awakening in the morning, I wondered if the proceedings of the night before had been a dream. It was hard to believe that I was the world's heavyweight champion."
Gene Tunney,"To stay relaxed and avoid tiring mentally and physically, it is necessary to get plenty of sleep and frequent rests during the day."
Gene Tunney,"Though I was not a belligerent kid, I do not think I ever passed up a good opportunity to fight."
Gene Tunney,"The way to know about championship quality is to learn from champions, and that I did; studying them with professional purpose during my time in the ring and from habitual interest afterward."
Gene Tunney,"The man who has allowed his body to deteriorate cuts a pitiful figure - chest collapsed, stomach protruding."
Gene Tunney,One half-conscious thought was burned in my mind: stay on your feet.
Gene Tunney,"Normally, I could hit hard enough, as anyone who studied my fights might have known. But the impression was that I was essentially defensive, the very reverse of a killer, the prize fighter who read books, even Shakespeare."
Gene Tunney,"No matter how skilled a boxer may be, he cannot stand up in the ring and give a good account of himself unless he is in perfect physical condition."
Gene Tunney,Never eat less than four hours before boxing. Then eat only lightly.
Gene Tunney,"My own ambition in the ring had always been skillful boxing, speed and defense - on the order of Mike Gibbons."
Gene Tunney,"In youth, we get plenty of exercise through games and running around, but as middle life approaches, we settle down, literally and figuratively."
Gene Tunney,If all human lives depended upon their usefulness - as might be judged by certain standards - there would be a sudden and terrific mortality in the world.
Gene Tunney,I did six years of planning to win the championship from Jack Dempsey.
Gene Tunney,"Handball, swimming, running, jumping, basketball, and boxing were as much a part of me as breathing."
Gene Tunney,Fat is one of the chief enemies of the heart because it has to be plentifully supplied with blood and thus needlessly increases the pumping load that the heart must sustain.
Gene Tunney,"But in the ring Jack Dempsey was an instinctive fighter. I doubt if he ever planned anything in the ring, or thought about it much."
Gene Tunney,"Being in top shape can make you a winner, while entering the ring in poor shape, not only cuts your chances of winning, but can be very dangerous."
Gene Tunney,"Actually, I started my ring career as a terrific hitter; then my hands cracked up and I had to resort to boxing and tricks to win."
Gene Tunney,A concave chest means that your diaphragm is sagging.
Gene Tunney,A boxer must exercise and develop every part of his body.
Gene Tunney,"As a West Side kid fooling around with boxing gloves, I had been, for some reason of temperament, more interested in dodging a blow than in striking one."
Gene Tunney,"To enjoy the glow of good health, you must exercise."
Gene Tunney,Exercise should be regarded as tribute to the heart.
Gene Tunney,"A boxer's diet should be low in fat and high in proteins and sugar. Therefore you should eat plenty of lean meat, milk, leafy vegetables, and fresh fruit and ice cream for sugar."
Marty Turco,They're a hard-working team. They don't have much talent but their goalie played great. He made some unreal saves. But we got the win and we're excited about it.
Marty Turco,"For the rest of the year and for the playoffs, great things can happen."
Marty Turco,The only regret I'll have is if we don't win. But we're not going to have that problem.
Marty Turco,That's an instinct play that I won't ever hesitate to make.
Marty Turco,"The penalties we took, some undisciplined, there's really no excuse,"
Marty Turco,It's a huge confidence for us. It's two guys doing it and carrying the rest of the guys on their back.
Marty Turco,"And there's a lot of other goalies from Canada that deserve to be here. But we're here to make each other better and that's such a Canadian thing, we keep pushing each other and supporting each other this week."
Marty Turco,He's the biggest name in the country and will be for a long time ... maybe forever. He is Canada to us.
Ivan Turgenev,Women... can't live with 'em... can't shoot 'em.
Ivan Turgenev,"if we wait for the moment when everything, absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin."
Ivan Turgenev,I share no man's opinions; I have my own
Ivan Turgenev,"However much you knock at nature's door, she will never answer you in comprehensible words."
Ivan Turgenev,"Whatever man prays for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces itself to thisGreat God, grant that twice two be not four."
Ivan Turgenev,Belonging to oneself--the whole essence of life lies in that.
Ivan Turgenev,The temerity to believe in nothing
Mark Turgeon,"Last year I think we wanted to be part of the NCAA Tournament so badly we didn't worry about the things that we could control, which is making our team better. That's what we're doing this year."
Mark Turgeon,His numbers in high school didn't lie. And then you start coaching the kid and he's so smart about the game. Those are the kind of kids we have to find to have a moment like this.
Mark Turgeon,"I kept saying we weren't any good when practice started, and now we're part of the Sweet 16. We just keep getting a little bit better."
Mark Turgeon,"We've had a lot of practice the last two weeks and it showed today. When we shoot well, we're pretty darn good."
Mark Turgeon,"I was in a power position, obviously, so I drove a hard bargain. I wanted to make sure that Jim knew what I was looking for. Over time, through each contract, I've talked about 'This is what I'd like to have someday.' I think he got as close to that as he could."
Mark Turgeon,"He's playing smarter than he has in the past. Kyle's made himself a little bit better athlete. He's been in great shape the whole time, which he needed to do."
Mark Turgeon,He had a tough night at Southern; it's as simple as that. He didn't play with the intelligence he usually plays with.
Mark Turgeon,"I remember back to the year he got hurt. He spent more time tripping over his feet than anything else. So he's improved a lot, and he's consistently improved every year."
Mark Turgeon,We're 2-0 and we took care of our home court. This league is loaded. (Bradley) looked like a pro team out there.
Mark Turgeon,"In my heart, this is where I'm supposed to be. I told the players, I never pursue a job. I never have. I never will. I was just trying to do what was best for our staff and our basketball program."
Mark Turgeon,I was just so proud and so happy. I can't even tell you.
Mark Turgeon,This team has figured out how to win games.
Mark Turgeon,"If you look over the (statistic) sheets of our last few games, it's been that way. We've worked on it all year, trying to get them to pass the ball and use each other. They really did that well tonight. This was a great team game."
Mark Turgeon,You don't want to notice them. You don't notice the really good ones. Those guys ref the game the way it's supposed to be called. Simple as that.
Mark Turgeon,"Both Jared and Gabe are fine young men, and I wish them both the best in their future endeavors."
Mark Turgeon,The four-way race has been fun. It says a lot about our league. There are no bad teams. Every game is hard and you can't take anything for granted. It's been a challenging year for everybody. You don't get a day off. You are constantly going from one battle to the next.
Mark Turgeon,"Our execution was good. We worked really hard this week. Not knowing who you were going to play really helped us because we worked on us, and I think it showed today in our execution."
Mark Turgeon,"Our execution was really, really good, especially in the second half. We only took three bad shots the whole game. We really played unselfish."
Mark Turgeon,"We won the Evansville game differently than we won the Missouri State game, for example. Whether it's rebounding or free throw shooting or defense or offensive execution, it's been something different each game for us."
Mark Turgeon,"He's a great kid and one of our leaders. I think a lot of players watch his example. Chemistry is a funny thing with each team. I think with this team, everyone respects each others' roles and respects what each other can do. That starts at the top with Paul."
Mark Turgeon,"Kids handle discipline different ways. Some get embarrassed. Some get mad. You just hope in the end they all use it the right way, and I think they will. I think the only way to get through to players today is playing time. It used to be running them, getting them out of bed and running them. Playing time, today, is really the answer. Hopefully, we won't have this again."
Mark Turgeon,We got nothing out of P.J.. He didn't give us defense and that's usually what he gives us.
Mark Turgeon,"We're really proud of what we've done, and we weren't going to let a bunch of people around the country who haven't seen us make us feel any different. We know what we have and it's pretty special."
Mark Turgeon,I couldn't get them under control in the first half. I just couldn't. They thought if they made a shot it would count as nine points.
Mark Turgeon,No complaints. We had the first game on our home court. This is probably how it should be.
Mark Turgeon,"You never know what kind of competition you'll have (for MVP), but usually the teams at the top have a chance to be MVP. I always felt he had a chance to be one of the better centers in the league."
Mark Turgeon,"They've got great players. Mac's a great coach, but you don't win without great players."
Alan Turing,Machines take me by surprise with great frequency.
Alan Turing,I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.
Alan Turing,"Mathematical reasoning may be regarded rather schematically as the exercise of a combination of two facilities, which we may call intuition and ingenuity."
Alan Turing,"We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done."
Alan Turing,We are not interested in the fact that the brain has the consistency of cold porridge.
Alan Turing,"No, I'm not interested in developing a powerful brain. All I'm after is just a mediocre brain, something like the President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company."
Alan Turing,A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.
Jonathan Turley,"The president's dead wrong. When the president admits that he violated federal law, that raises serious constitutional questions of high crimes and misdemeanors."
Jonathan Turley,"If you believe the president violated criminal provisions of the law, I don't see how it wouldn't qualify. ... If the president commits a criminal act, you are obligated to hold impeachment hearings."
Jonathan Turley,"Throughout this case, the government has denied evidence for purely tactical reasons under the guise of national security."
Jonathan Turley,"Whatever purpose confirmation hearings may have, this is clearly not the purpose. You have nominees talking like politicians, giving empty sound bites."
Jonathan Turley,"This type of violation should be a textbook example of an impeachment issue because not only is it a federal crime, but it violates the doctrine of separation of powers."
Jonathan Turley,"He can argue he has an evil twin, but that's it, because that evidence is rather conclusive,"
Alex Turner,"I think all this emphasis on sales is misguided. If you look at the Stone Roses or the Jam, you don't think about how many records they sold but what great music they made. That's what is?."
Alex Turner,"We did the triple, but in all honesty, I suppose we're supposed to display some gratitude. We are grateful because, you know, voted for by the people and all that, we're very happy about that but who else was going to be the best British band at the moment, you know?"
Alex Turner,"If it doesn't cure cancer or solve inner city poverty, it'll be [viewed as] a disaster."
Alex Turner,"We want to do things our way, and people think it's arrogance, so it's inevitable some people will get tired of us."
Chris Turner,"It's funny, because last year nobody was looking up to me. But this year, people on the team looked at everything I did. Whatever I did, they wanted to do. So I had to lead by example."
Chris Turner,"Definitely defense. If I can play defense like I play offense, then I can really be good."
Chris Turner,I'm not a believer in every time a person makes a mistake we should fire them.
David Turner,The rules for the car and track are still the same. [The guidelines] for the wheels and axles are strictly followed.
David Turner,CHEP has been growing profits at a faster rate than the rest of the group and the outlook is good.
David Turner,"CHEP has been growing profits at a faster rate than the rest of the group and the outlook is good,"
David Turner,"Believe it or not, we want players who want to play football and get a great education. To play at this [SEC] level, we have to get players. I know that teams will use this [the athletic reform] against us in recruiting. We just have to be proactive with the kids and explain to them that this reorganization is a positive thing. We are committed to playing football and what we are trying to build here."
David Turner,"Believe it or not, we want players who want to play football and get a great education, ... To play at this [SEC] level, we have to get players.

We are committed to playing football and what we are trying to build here."
David Turner,"We have opera, we have comedy, and we have...everythingâ€¦. It's very loving and warm."
Ike Turner,"A lot of people believe that the movie is the true story, that Tina did. I don't wanna debate on Ike & Tina, but I have to say this one thing... That movie was the biggest lie, and even Tina said that it's a lie. And she don't like the movie. But she started put gas on the fire by supporting it."
Ike Turner,"In those days, man, in the '50s, black people in the South... We didn't recognize contracts that much. And we didn't recognize marriages that much, either."
Ike Turner,"I always considered myself being an organizer. I'm very good at teaching singers, I'm very good at staging a show, to entertain people. But I never included myself. I never applied this to me as an artist."
Ike Turner,Little Richard did the intro to my book.
Ike Turner,I believe I was ahead of my time.
Ike Turner,"In China, when you get to the airport everyone be talking in American slang."
Ike Turner,"They used to say it was bad for Indians to drink, but it's bad for anybody. When they drink they lose their cool, a lot of us. Like when we played with Sonny Boy, I would never get paid, you know. He would drink up all the money."
Ike Turner,"I'm very fast on teaching guys. Like, when I came over here, I only had two rehearsals with the band. I wondered when I first got here... but it sure came up great."
Ike Turner,"I didn't know anything about publishing companies. I didn't know anything about writers royalties, and they kept me green, you know."
Ike Turner,"I'm really shopping for a record deal, and I haven't had a chance to go around to the record companies yet. So far I just pressed up a few of them."
Ike Turner,"I'm really thankful to God, man. Like now, I'm really making a real comeback with my group. With or without a record, with or without a movie. And behind all the negative press behind this movie."
Ike Turner,"They would come down in Mississippi, they hired me as a talent scout. And I would go all over Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and find out different artists for them."
Ike Turner,"Spector is a good guy, but he's a nut. Ha, ha, ha! You know, I love him, but he's unpredictable. He's OK as long as he don't drink."
Ike Turner,"I used to write songs so fast like this, like snapping my fingers. Some of them didn't even have a title, for I just did the song."
Ike Turner,I miss riding those fast trains in Japan... 'cause I'd never seen a train that fast in my life.
Ike Turner,"Most times, people have some acts that they really like. I mean, I don't have any in particular that I admire. I admire them all, you know."
Ike Turner,"They'll probably start working on my movie sometime... They are doing a complete movie of my life story. It will not be based on any negativity. It will be more about my life, from a kid, how I came up and why I came through."
Ike Turner,"The basic tracks I originally cut on a computer at my house, and then I over-dubbed it live. But I got the feeling I wanted here on the computer."
Ike Turner,"I think you have to advance with the times, you know. With hip-hop and rap and house music, they make loops and do stuff with loops."
Ike Turner,"Keith Richards uses a Telecaster, but he takes the sixth string off and tunes it to G. And that's what The Rolling Stones use all the time."
Ike Turner,"I can put a hip-hop beat to reggae. That is, I can have real reggae in the drums and in the rhythm, and on top of it I can put The Rolling Stones' feeling, anyone's feeling on top. Nobody has ever done this before, man."
Ike Turner,"I wanna record these girls individually. And then, I wanna cut a blues album on me. But all of it, original stuff, you know. When I listen to the blues today, it's like they all sounds similar. I wanna do something different, to try to add to the blues flavor."
Ike Turner,"I'm not gonna try to defend, or undo what's been done. All I could say about whatever's been done, it's been done, and it's water under the bridge. I have no regrets of my life."
Ike Turner,"We're having time to give the younger generation today inspiration. Regardless of the obstacles that you have to overcome, how you can make it?"
Ike Turner,I was familiar with Stevie Ray Vaughan because I listened to him. He played a lot of copies off of different guys' styles and stuff.
Ike Turner,"They have all different names for music. I think the music I'm going to change the style with is going to be really, really big-years and years after I'm gone."
Ike Turner,"When you get my age, and like James Brown... You know, you do a little bit and let them do it. 'cause they have the wind, the air to keep it going."
Ike Turner,"I really enjoy myself in Norway. Because I had started losing confidence in my ability of what I do. But sometimes, man, you just get tired of fighting and trying to prove yourself."
John Turner,"You reduce the cost of labs if you buy for here in Atlanta not trying to staff five other labs, ... There's a great deal of efficiency."
John Turner,"The security mission, which has always been there, has gone more to the forefront,"
John Turner,"We wanted to open the bathing area for residents while the rest of the excavation was being completed. We recognize there is still much work to be done, and it will be completed before the opening of the bathing season."
John Turner,There wasn't a cleanup issue on the FWP land. The Berg property was a whole other game plan.
John Turner,There wasn't a cleanup issue on the FWP land.
John Turner,Part of me is worried that we have a consumer-driven mentality that my health care is a commodity and it's up for the best bidder. That's very concerning because that's not the way health care should be delivered.
John Turner,"We began a cancer fund drive in conjunction with the tournament, ... She was a close friend, and I felt like I wanted to do something to honor her and raise money for cancer awareness."
John Turner,This new distribution agreement brings a host of opportunities for solutions resellers and property developers looking to tap into the digital home market.
John Turner,My time is now.

Kevin Turner,"So we better do more than that, because I think we have a big opportunity."
Kevin Turner,"In those huge games, she's always there. She can do it when everyone knows her, when coaches align their defenses to try to stop her. That's what makes her such a special kid."
Kevin Turner,I think this team is going to be on fire. They're ready to go. We're right there. We just need that little extra something special to get us over the top.

Mike Turner,"We are pleased with the outcome of these ballots, which represents very good progress in the consultative process."
Mike Turner,"Josh really needed to red-shirt last year, and he's made great progress. There has never been a question about Josh's strength because he bench-presses the world. He knows he has to improve on his footwork and he's now accustomed to the tempo at this level. He's getting better every day."
Mike Turner,"Big Shane has worked hard this summer and you can see so much improvement in the way he moves. He's done some good things in camp and learned the offense, and we're sort of just looking for him to take that next step to where he can be a major contributor for us. He'll absolutely get on the field."

Norv Turner,"We're always going to work to get the ball to Randy... , ... (The Eagles) had a good plan. They rolled (coverage), they doubled, they had a good mix. We found some creases as the game went on."
Norv Turner,"The biggest thing is guys understanding what they are going to call and what they are not going to call. Then eliminate those situations when you are in that position, and you know it's going to get called. You just can't do it."
Norv Turner,The thing right now is he will lay down and get off his feet and rest.
Norv Turner,We've used it in practice and we'll use it some the next couple of days.
Norv Turner,"Young guys have to learn how to handle the tempo in practice,"
Norv Turner,"They always are. They always have been, ... Guys play or don't play based on performance."

Norv Turner,I wanted to be here and appreciate the opportunity.
Norv Turner,"He sees himself as a tailback. We're going to give him every opportunity to play tailback and see what he does best, ... We have a bunch of guys who see themselves as the starting tailback. When you have that kind of competition, it gives you the opportunity to come up with a featured runner. That's our goal."
Norv Turner,"He's a physical player and he makes things happen, ... I'm trying to make the most of my opportunity and have some fun with my teammates."

When you have that kind of competition, it gives you the opportunity to come up with a featured runner. That's our goal."
Norv Turner,"Some of it is we're playing a game Thursday night, and obviously he can't play. I thought he was really coming on, and I think he's a guy that somewhere down the road has a future."
Norv Turner,"We're past that. We got good work in Texas, we'll get work against (New Orleans) Thursday night, and we're starting to zero in on our opener."

Norv Turner,"I belong here, ... When I got off the plane the other night, I felt like I was coming home. I feel like I'm home now."
Norv Turner,"I hate to even comment on it, ... When you see all those (homeless) people, the loss of life and all the millions and millions of dollars of damage, I don't know if you can even start to talk about how it affects an NFL team or season."
Norv Turner,"I hate to even comment on it. When you see all those (homeless) people, the loss of life and all the millions and millions of dollars of damage, I don't know if you can even start to talk about how it affects an NFL team or season."
Norv Turner,Everyone gets caught on this 0-3 thing. There have been teams that have lost three straight games and had outstanding seasons.
Norv Turner,"You really don't know, ... You go into games and I'm not sure you know what to expect. I know when we were getting ready to play (Kansas City) last time everybody thought it would be a shootout, a real high-scoring game. And both defenses played at a real high level."
Norv Turner,"You really don't know. You go into games and I'm not sure you know what to expect. I know when we were getting ready to play (Kansas City) last time everybody thought it would be a shootout, a real high-scoring game. And both defenses played at a real high level."
Norv Turner,It's a real good opportunity for him. He's kicked in big games and he's an experienced guy.
Norv Turner,"There is a process that a guy goes through and no question -- it's not even about 14 or 16 games -- it's about being the full-time guy, for an entire game. You learn the first time you do it. He hadn't done that since college."
Norv Turner,"It's clear what they're playing for. The question is, what are we playing for? These are the kind of games that define a team's character."
Norv Turner,He's been at the games and watching from upstairs.
Norv Turner,I think everyone is looking for that spectacular game and I believe he is going to have games like that.
Norv Turner,"When Chris came back, he played well in the last ... games and did a good job on special teams."
Norv Turner,"This will help them, ... Everyone thinks it's four games in, but for all those guys, it's eight games in. Those young guys, in particular the rookies and second-year guys, not only is the season long for them, but they played more snaps in the preseason than most guys."
Norv Turner,He can still have an impact on the game.
Norv Turner,how the game goes.
Norv Turner,highlight of the game.
Norv Turner,"We're playing a lot of young guys 30 to 50 plays a game. Kirk Morrison is one of those guys. Sometimes when you play that many young guys, you pay for it. It's cost us in some situations, but it's helping us. We're faster and more athletic. We are improving."
Norv Turner,"He's a very, very smart football player, ... When you have a guy who has that kind of versatility, it's unbelievable in terms of having injury situations."
Norv Turner,"He's an outstanding football player. I mean, he's a physical guy that brings it. He's a competitive guy. In that game, he looked to me like he misjudged the player's speed. He was in good position, and just didn't take account of his speed. That, unfortunately, happens to guys in this league. But he's one of the better safeties in the league."
Norv Turner,"We've played three outstanding football teams, ... We're going to look at this and coach off it. We're going to look at the good things we did and the areas we need to get better."
Norv Turner,We played a very good football team. There's a reason why they've won (21) straight here.
Norv Turner,"I said it early in the year when we were 0-3, we're a lot better football team. This morning I looked at our first Kansas City game. We're two plays away from winning that game. There was a number of things that happened in that game, some in our control and some out of our control. That was certainly a game we could have won. Kansas City won the game, they're 4-3. We lost the game, we're 3-4. That's where this league is a little bit."
Norv Turner,I think he's one of the best receiving backs I've been around. His hands -- he can really catch the football.
Norv Turner,I'd like to think we can get the football in (from that close).
Norv Turner,"I think he's one of the best receiving backs I've been around. His hands â€” he can really catch the football. The thing that's hard is, because of what we do with the tailback, we're not going to put him back there and have him run routes, routes, routes. Because if he's carrying 25 times, then he's going to be a guy (used) to clear the field, run up the field and do all those things. And that takes a toll on you."
Norv Turner,"The wear and tear of playing that type of schedule took its toll on this football team, and we were not a good football team in the second half."
Norv Turner,"I don't know if you ever fool anyone, but you give them different wrinkles and you give them things that may look like something you've run before and you actually run something different out of it, ... It still comes down to executing and going out and blocking and tackling and running a route and throwing and guys making plays."
Norv Turner,"Anytime in a season you start 0-3, you know you're fighting an uphill battle. We had chances at winning, and against good teams."
Norv Turner,"Everyone wants to get into those conversations, ... but the biggest thing for our team is to keep competing and fighting the way we have. ... What we need to do, obviously, is to go win a football game."
Norv Turner,"I told my guys, 'Believe your eyes,' ... 'You saw him. He is what you're watching.'"
Norv Turner,"Adam brings a lot more experience. I think some of the things that at times have gotten to us, some of the calls in terms of protection and all that, Adam's a lot more comfortable with."
Norv Turner,"I know what the expectation level is. We've got to give him as many chances as we can. Along the way, when he's opening things up for other guys, we've got to understand that's part of the equation of Randy being here."
Norv Turner,It's certainly not by design. It's a combination of things. We want to get the ball to him. He's getting an awful lot of double coverage.
Norv Turner,"Continuity, repetition, the detail of playing the defense, we're much further along than we were at any point last year."
Norv Turner,"It was a good conversation. Ultimately, we weren't headed in the direction (Davis) wanted to be headed, and he wanted to make a switch."
Norv Turner,"We've got good competition, ... I think, based on a game or a half, some people start jumping to conclusions, but I think that is one of our most competitive positions."
Norv Turner,Competition makes you better. Rich is our starting quarterback. When you have someone there who has played and won it's a motivational deal and it helps you play better.
Norv Turner,"We're having great competition,"
Norv Turner,"We've got good competition,"
Norv Turner,We ended up not taking advantage of a couple of situations.

And it is a solemn and weighty responsibility, and not lightly to be flung aside at the bullying of pulpit, press, government, or the empty catchphrases of politicians. Each must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, and which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man. To decide against your convictions is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let man label you as they may.

Sun Tzu,The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.
Sun Tzu,Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
Sun Tzu,"All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved."
Sun Tzu,"If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril."
Sun Tzu,"Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory."
Sun Tzu,"For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards."
Sun Tzu,"He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot, will be victorious."
Sun Tzu,Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.
Sun Tzu,"If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near."
Sun Tzu,Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the Attack.
Sun Tzu,"Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories."
Sun Tzu,Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
Sun Tzu,"The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself."
Sun Tzu,The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
Sun Tzu,"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy."
Sun Tzu,"If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity."
Sun Tzu,"Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate."
Sun Tzu,"The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom."
Sun Tzu,For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.
Sun Tzu,You have to believe in yourself.
Sun Tzu,To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.
Sun Tzu,If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.
Sun Tzu,"If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete."
Sun Tzu,Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
Sun Tzu,"The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution."
Sun Tzu,"Therefore the victories of good warriors are not noted for cleverness or bravery. Therefore their victories in battle are not flukes. Their victories are not flukes because they position themselves where they will surely win, prevailing over those wh"
Sun Tzu,Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.
Sun Tzu,"The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause people's substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, they will be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and their incomes dissipated."
Sun Tzu,Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret agents; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret operations.
Sun Tzu,"It is imperative to contest all factions for complete victory, so the army is not garrisoned and the profit can be total. This is the law of strategic siege."
Sun Tzu,Therefore a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.
Sun Tzu,Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.
Sun Tzu,One who sets the entire army in motion to chase an advantage will not attain it.
Sun Tzu,Opportunities multiply as they are seized.
Sun Tzu,"He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious."
Sun Tzu,Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?
