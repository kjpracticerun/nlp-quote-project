Jim Nantz,"[The crisp, tense action made for great TV. Too bad for CBS that, also for the second week in a row, the drama was taking place on Monday afternoon and was being shown on the Golf Channel.] Your heart goes out to the viewer, ... The loyal, passionate golf fan sets his weekend schedule around the coverage, and you've got nothing to show him."

Joel Naroff,There has to be some worry on the part of retailers. They may be required to cut prices sooner and steeper than normal.
Joel Naroff,The trade deficit may have narrowed in February but it is hardly clear that this is the start of a long downward trend.
Joel Naroff,"Whatever impacts Katrina had in September were wiped out in October and the nation's service and construction industries are moving ahead smartly,"
Joel Naroff,"The Fed will not shift its bias. Retail sales numbers for August, which they'll have in hand by the time of the meeting, will be pretty solid, so they will be facing essentially the same thing they've been facing for a while now -- the fundamentals are not that bad, but the stock market is,"
Joel Naroff,"The report was surprisingly weak and highlights the reality that, until forced to do so by ever-increasing demand, firms will not commit to new workers,"
Joel Naroff,"While wages didn't rise exceedingly rapidly, the low (jobless) rate is a warning that labor costs are probably going to increase further."
Joel Naroff,"The underlying trend looks to still be in the 200,000 (jobs per month) range, ... And if that is correct, conditions are okay, really."
Joel Naroff,"The job report was not that bad. The underlying trend looks to still be in the 200,000 range,"
Joel Naroff,"The rising mortgage rates have pushed us to a new record home-sales level, but once the fence sitters are all down, things could change,"
Joel Naroff,Trade will be restraining growth.
Joel Naroff,"They're faced with what is probably a moderation in growth, but a slow acceleration in inflation. The question is, where does inflation go from here? I think that will be the driving factor, because I don't think growth is going to stay this slow."
Joel Naroff,"Energy prices are about to leave the solar system, but where is all the other inflation?"
Joel Naroff,"The worries created by the high energy costs are affecting not only pricing decisions but hiring as well. If there is uncertainty about consumer spending, then it has to translate into a slowing in hiring."
Joel Naroff,"Energy costs have been so high for so long that businesses aren't confident anymore that they'll fall or fall significantly, ... It's made them look toward trying to push through some smaller price increases."
Joel Naroff,"The new Fed chair will be tested right off the bat. The economy is slowing, though clearly not as rapidly as the headline number would have you think. ...At the same time, inflation is slowly accelerating."
Joel Naroff,"They (consumers) are largely tapped out. When interest rates start to go up, the perception of the economy goes down for average consumers."
Joel Naroff,Price pressures are building generally throughout the economy.
Joel Naroff,"Energy costs are off but still high and everywhere else prices are rising. Inflation is not out of control, but it is not tame either."
Joel Naroff,"Manufacturing has been solid and continues to be so. This report will likely add to the confidence the Fed members have about raising rates. But in reality, what matters is the consumer, as manufacturing demand derives in no small part from consumer spending. That is still an issue."
Joel Naroff,"There is no inflation, unless you drive a vehicle, heat your home, use medical services, have a child in college, use cable, insure anything or smoke."
Joel Naroff,"In spite of the good current news, there remains a fair amount of caution."
Joel Naroff,"With consumers spending a little less and business investment likely to slow, that will translate to a bit slower growth for factories."
Joel Naroff,"The cost pressures on businesses slowed in February, which is a good thing, given that the ability to pass the higher expenses through to consumers remains limited. But a careful reading of the details paints a troublesome picture."
John Nash,"There's no question there was a lot of talent there. From 1 through 15 we had as much or more as anyone in the league. We were winning in the vicinity of 50 games, had the highest payroll. But that wasn't producing anything better than first-round elimination in the playoffs, so the decision was made to go in a different direction."
John Nash,"I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists. However, this is not entirely a matter of joy as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health."
John Nash,"[Nash lost one potential trade asset last month when center Arvydas Sabonis decided to retire. With a year and $6 million left on his contract, Sabonis could have been bait to teams seeking cap relief next summer.] We had some fairly attractive offers, ... But they were for players with long-term contracts that weren't worth it in the long run."
John Nash,"As we said when we signed him to the offer sheet, Steve has competed at the highest level in college culminated by his experience at Maryland and winning a national championship, ... With his two seasons at Washington, he adds to the limited experience of a young team and we know he will bring additional energy and enthusiasm to our training camp"
John Nash,The mathematics faculty were encouraging me to shift into mathematics as my major and explaining to me that it was not almost impossible to make a good career in America as a mathematician. So I... became officially a student of mathematics. And in the end I had learned and progressed so much in mathematics that they gave me an M.S. in addition to my B.S. when I graduated.
John Nash,I was on the mathematics faculty at M.I.T. from 1951 through until I resigned in the spring of 1959.
John Nash,"While I was on the academic sabbatical of 1956-1957, I also entered into marriage. Alicia had graduated as a physics major from M.I.T. where we had met, and she had a job in the New York City area. She had been born in El Salvador but came at an early age to the U.S., and she and her parents had long been U.S. citizens, her father being an M.D. and ultimately employed at a hospital operated by the federal government in Maryland."
John Nash,"Compliance with these regulations maintain the town's eligibility for federal grants and reimbursements under any federally declared emergency or disaster,"
John Nash,"I had been offered fellowships to enter as a graduate student at either Harvard or Princeton. But the Princeton fellowship was somewhat more generous, since I had not actually won the Putnam competition... Thus Princeton became the choice for my graduate study location."
John Nash,"Bluefield, a small city in a comparatively remote geographical location in the Appalachians, was not a community of scholars or of high technology."
John Nash,"As we said when we signed him to the offer sheet, Steve has competed at the highest level in college â€” culminated by his experience at Maryland and winning a national championship, ...

John Nash,"My beginning as a legally recognized individual occurred on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia, in the Bluefield Sanitarium, a hospital that no longer exists."
Leigh Nash,"Matt's a wonderful lyricist. The words that he writes I want to sing. It has never felt like a stretch. It's part of the gift, the two of us making music together."
Leigh Nash,"It's really wonderful to be able to put your whole self into something. As a band, creating new material is really a group effort; there is a certain lack of control one has as an artist. Now, I am able to take my experiences from the band and from life to make an album that is completely me, inside and out."
Leigh Nash,"I'd love to get to know or at least meet some of the women, such as Sheryl or Sarah. I know we won't have time to develop friendships with anyone, but I would love to get to know them."

Ogden Nash,"A family is a unit composed not only of children but of men, women, an occasional animal, and the common cold"
Ogden Nash,They take the paper and they read the headlines. So they've heard of unemployment and they've heard of bread-lines. And they philanthropically cure them all by getting up a costume charity ball.
Ogden Nash,Commitments the voters don't know about can't hurt you.
Ogden Nash,"The trouble with a kitten is that when it grows up, it's always a cat."
Ogden Nash,"The bed is a bundle of paradoxes: we go to it with reluctance, yet we quit it with regret; we make up our minds every night to leave it early, but we make up our bodies every morning to keep it late."
Ogden Nash,"Certainly there are things in life that money can't buy, but it's very funny - Did you ever try buying then without money?"
Ogden Nash,People who work sitting down get paid more than people who work standing up.
Ogden Nash,Too clever is dumb.
Ogden Nash,The only people who should really sin are the people who can sin and grin.
Ogden Nash,"I do not like to get the news, because there has never been an era when so many things were going so right for so many of the wrong persons."

Ogden Nash,"Marriage is the alliance of two people, one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other who never forgets them."
Ogden Nash,Happiness is having a scratch for every itch.
Rick Nash,After the first period we played better and came back. [Coach] Gerard [Gallant] gave us a little speech in between periods and we came back.
Rick Nash,"It was definitely a lucky goal. I came down and had a different move in mind, but he took that away. I had to adjust, and lost my balance. Lucky enough I stayed up and put it in."
Rick Nash,That had to be tough. He wanted the young kids to step forward. It takes a big man to give up that spot. If he didn't I may not have had a spot.
Rick Nash,"This is the team I was drafted to, and this is where I've made my home for the last three years. I don't want to switch teams. I'd rather take this team to the top."
Rick Nash,"[A Calder Trophy finalist last season, Nash hopes that his new bulk will enable him to muscle in goals around the net and do anything else to help turn around a team that limped to a Western Conference-worst 69 points. Columbus lost its top point-scorer when former captain Ray Whitney signed with Detroit, but his exit opened a spot for Nash on the second line. He will skate alongside speedy center Todd Marchant, who had career highs in goals (20) and assists (40) with Edmonton last year.] It's an honor to play with him, ... I grew up watching him and pretending I was him."
Rick Nash,"We had tons of chances tonight. Goals come in bunches. When you're hot, you're hot, and when you're not, you're not. But I'm not worried at all. We just have to play a full 60 minutes and we have to learn from our mistakes."
Rick Nash,"We decided these last 20 games we wanted to build some momentum for next season. We got off to a terrible start this year and if we can start to build some momentum right now, hopefully that will forward onto the start of our season next year."
Rick Nash,"It's part of the sport, part of the game. I can't do anything about it."
Rick Nash,"Just to know that we've got quite a future here in Blue Jackets with all the young players, I think is exciting for No. 1 the fans, and for especially the franchise, so I'm just happy to be back and looking forward to this September."
Rick Nash,Definitely. It's a big honor to get to experience playing against him on the ice and getting to know him with national teams. He's someone I grew up watching in Toronto. Detroit is only four hours down the highway. Every kid wants to mold their game around his - which you obviously can never do.
Rick Nash,We've definitely got to pick it up. We're under a lot of pressure. It's our country and we've got to win it for them.
Rick Nash,I don't really remember having pressure like this. There's always pressure on Canada to win at hockey. We have to accept it and move on.
Steve Nash,"For somebody not to be 100 percent and be as effective as he was is a tribute to his talent. He's a dominant presence, even when he's not at his best physically."
Steve Nash,For somebody to not be 100 percent and be as effective as he is a tribute to his talent.
Steve Nash,"We didn't space the floor real well, we didn't run, we didn't make decisions quickly like we normally do. We still scored 107 points, but we felt like we slowed ourselves down a little bit and they did a good job. We just didn't make them pay like we normally do."
Steve Nash,"The great thing about (Bell) is he doesn't pride himself solely on scoring. He's a team player who comes and plays hard every night, no matter if he's getting the looks or not."
Steve Nash,"I am not too accusatorial or defensive by nature. I have always been kind of philosophical about it, remembering that it is just a game. People take these things too seriously."
Steve Nash,"They played better than us at key times, ... I think we just made mistakes."
Steve Nash,"It is amazing. We did everything we could to win the game. We made some crucial mistakes, but some of it was bad luck. In hindsight, there wasn't much we could do."
Steve Nash,"He was obviously unbelievable. He just got in rhythm. I don't think it mattered what kind of look he got, he was just making shots."
Steve Nash,"We're looking to make a big improvement. We were a little indecisive, and we just didn't make them pay like we usually do."
Steve Nash,We didn't play well and we found a way to win. We know we have a lot of improvement to make.
Steve Nash,It's just a better percentage than giving it to Shaq.
Steve Nash,"I feel like the Seattle Seahawks. It's remarkable. There's like five games this year where we've not gotten a call in the last 30 seconds. After awhile, you realize you don't get those games back, and it's tough to take."
Steve Nash,"It's not fun to have a poor game and lose, but getting a win when others are playing well is great for me. Eddie's been on a real roll and it was great to have more options on the bench tonight."
Steve Nash,What concerns me is the shooting percentages. Everybody's eyes light up when they see us. We've been less than focused.
Steve Nash,We showed a lot of toughness to come back from last night's game. We showed a lot of determination to not let that game carry over in tonight's game.
Steve Nash,We showed a lot of toughness and determination to come back from last night and not allow that to carry over.
Steve Nash,"Avery ( Johnson , the Dallas coach) has got them really defensive-minded and really controlled offensively and defensively. They're programmed to be really responsible."
Steve Nash,"But you can't blame it on the referees. We had our opportunities. It just wasn't meant to be. So many things went against us in succession, it's just crazy. We just have to chalk it up that it wasn't our night, and one is going to come our way if we keep battling."
Steve Nash,"I learned at a young age to dribble with both hands, and that allows me to be more creative when I go against bigger and stronger opponents."
Steve Nash,"I have definitely gone through my ups and downs and faced my adversity and my nay-sayers, but managed to do all right. It is a pretty classic tale."
Steve Nash,"We love playing together and we love adversity. You know, back-to-back, the two best teams in the East."
Steve Nash,"He's so unique, there's nobody in the league who does what he does. His ability to guard different people, block shots, steal the ball, rebound. A lot of his scoring comes off quick cuts, and he's to the rim before anyone sees him."
Steve Nash,"We have the ability to play at a high level, but tonight it just wasn't there. We missed little things like hustle plays and calls here and there. We just do a tiny bit better with each one of those and they add up to six more points."

Joe Nathan,"It was one of those games where the opposing team kind of takes a breath when they see that Johan isn't coming back out there, ... Cy Young could go out there and they'd be relieved that it's not Johan."
Joe Nathan,We would've liked to have been more game-ready. Guys were missing pitches they don't normally miss.
Joe Nathan,"At least top three. A lot of times wins are out of your control, so all he can do is try to finish off strong with his last three (starts) and get his win total up a little bit â€” and hopefully his other numbers are strong enough to persuade some people to go that route."
Dave Navarro,Baby I Love Your Way.

Martina Navratilova,People in the States used to think that if girls were good at sports their sexuality would be affected.

Martina Navratilova,Sure I know where the press room is - I just look for where they throw the dog meat.

Martina Navratilova,Labels are for filing. Labels are for clothing. Labels are not for people.
Martina Navratilova,"I hope, when I stop, people will think that somehow I mattered."
Martina Navratilova,The difference between involvement and commitment is like ham and eggs. The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.
Martina Navratilova,"The mark of great sportsmen is not how good they are at their best, but how good they are their worst."
Martina Navratilova,I think the key is for women not to set any limits.
Martina Navratilova,Tennis has given me soul.
Martina Navratilova,"Being blunt with your feelings is very American. In this big country, I can be as brash as New York, as hedonistic as Los Angeles, as sensuous as San Francisco, as brainy as Boston, as proper as Philadelphia, as brawny as Chicago, as warm as Palm Springs, as friendly as my adopted home town of Dallas, Fort Worth, and as peaceful as the inland waterway that rubs up against my former home in Virginia Beach."
Gloria Naylor,"Time's passage through the memory is like molten glass that can be opaque or crystallize at any given moment at will: a thousand days are melted into one conversation, one glance, one hurt, and one hurt can be shattered and sprinkled over a thousand."
Gloria Naylor,Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.

Kevin Nealon,is not so much about Hollywood. It's more about Larry's weaknesses.
Kevin Nealon,"The funny thing about commercials to me is that many of them now don't even mention the product until the very end. You don't really know what the commercial is all about [until then]. They're kind of like little movies, like shorts, and that's why I think they're so entertaining."
Kevin Nealon,"Curb Your Enthusiasm, ... is not so much about Hollywood. It's more about Larry's weaknesses."

Danny Nee,"He's done great. He hasn't wilted. He's taken the responsibility and done a nice, solid job."
Danny Nee,"We're trying to make a miserable situation as positive as possible. We want to make it a positive environment in the gym every day the kids come to practice. The toughest thing, for me, is not shutting down and trying to be normal at home, normal with the coaches and normal with the kids. This is not a normal situation. It's very humbling."
Danny Nee,It's a great environment. I was trying to tell the kids about the fans. It's a big-time atmosphere. We were trying to explain to the players that they are coming to a really class atmosphere and you have to be ready to play.

Danny Nee,They are playing at a high level. The competition will be interesting.
Danny Nee,I was blown away. I couldn't believe it. ... The players took it harder than we did. He came out on the court with his hand all bandaged. We were thinking maybe it's the season. You don't even know.
Danny Nee,"(Fordham) just did a great job. They made a lot of good shots. Part of it was their ability to make them and part of it might have been poor defense. That's a bad formula. They're getting rebounds, they're getting second shots, they're making 3s, and we're struggling to get baskets at the other end."
Liam Neeson,"It's a simple story, yet with all the complexities of myth. The technology was so understated. I thought he (George Lucas) was an amazing director who had created this totally believable world."
Liam Neeson,"Well, I think they're all basically the same story. Every culture in the world has them. When you strip it down and analyze it, it's the young man or girl who goes through a trial or ordeal and hits a very low ebb but manages to get guidance from a Merlin type figure."
Liam Neeson,"I do tend to gravitate toward what guiding light we have. . . . If I read something that's got those ethics in it, then I go towards it. We live in such a corporate world where everyone is passing the buck, it seems to me. Therefore I like stories where the individual takes responsibility for BEING the individual, and not just for himself, but for his comrades, his society and ultimately for his country. Ultimately, we can all learn a lesson from that and not be browbeaten by the corporate world which is taking over."
Liam Neeson,"Every cliche about kids is true; they grow up so quickly, you blink and they're gone, and you have to spend the time with them now. But that's a joy."

Renaldo Nehemiah,"Everyone is getting excited about her. It's probably because she's so young, and so poised for her age. The other exciting thing is that we have yet to see the best of her. It's scary to think that she will only be 22 at the Beijing Olympics, an age when many athletes are just starting their careers. And so everything she does before then is just gravy."

Jim Nelson,A crisis on campus
Jim Nelson,"Just today, the soccer team was coming onto the field just as we were leaving. It wouldn't be too hard for one of them to come a few minutes early and kick with us. Æ’ It is not like we are asking someone to play a football game and a basketball game on the same weekend."
Jim Nelson,"That was a character builder. At 19-7 we could have folded as a team and been done. There was some snipping going on. I made a bad call on that fake punt. But our defense did a wonderful job of coming together. Æ’ We've had a lot of adversity on this team and sometimes it is hard for young people to understand goals, but each day they are getting closer to reaching them. It was so fun to watch this group mature as a team."

Pablo Neruda,"Now, on the road to freedom, I was pausing for a moment near Temuco and could hear the voice of the water that had taught me to sing."
Michael Nesmith,"People recognize intellectual property the same way they recognize real estate. People understand what property is. But it's a new kind of property, and so the understanding uses new control surfaces. It uses a new way of defining the property."
Michael Nesmith,"There's a certain logic to systems, and that logic is fairly self-evident. It's very straightforward, usually. It might take a little research, it might take a little bit of industry to prize it out, but it's there to be seen."
Michael Nesmith,"There is a certain logic to events that pushes you along a certain path. You go along the path that feels the most true, and most according to the principles that are guiding you, and that's the way the decisions are made."

Richard Neuhaus,I think the barbarity of the English language currently used in the liturgy is cause enough for sorrow without further fiddling in terms of feminist inclusiveness.
Richard Neuhaus,"human nature being what it is, those who want to evade the clear statement of the instruction will have ample opportunities to seek loopholes, evasions and rationalizations."
Richard Neuhaus,"One example is Roe v. Wade. The lethal logic of Roe v. Wade is that nobody has rights that we are bound to respect if they cannot effectively assert those rights. They are at the mercy and the discretion of those who can effectively assert their rights. We're not talking simply about the unborn, we're talking about the aged, the radically handicapped, the deformed."

Bob Newhart,"I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'"

Bob Newhart,"When I started out in 1960, I thought it might possibly last a couple of years. I never expected it to last 42. I take great satisfaction in that longevity."

Bob Newhart,It's getting harder and harder to differentiate between schizophrenics and people talking on a cell phone. It still brings me up short to walk by somebody who appears to be talking to themselves.
Bob Newhart,It was a decision to work clean. I just prefer to work that way. I have no problem with comedians who don't work that way. There was a temptation in the early '70s to reconsider. I decided against it.
Bob Newhart,I've been a very lucky actor.
Bob Newhart,I'm very open to the up-and-comers.
Bob Newhart,"I'm most proud of the longevity of my marriage, my kids, and my grandchildren. If you don't have that, you really don't have very much."

Bob Newhart,"I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'."

Bob Newhart,I don't have a stack of scripts.
Bob Newhart,Funny is funny is funny.
Bob Newhart,Comedians are never really on vacation because you're always at attention... that antenna is always out there.

Randy Newman,I think this is wonderful to get all the kids involved.
Randy Newman,"I've opted to work in the Broadway field, as opposed to breaking my heart trying to score films, which is such a damnably difficult thing to do. I guess it's just the dragon I prefer to slay, the one that gives me the most satisfaction to do battle with."
Randy Newman,I don't want your pity. I want to thank first of all the music branch for giving me so many chances to be humiliated over the years.
Randy Newman,"A Fool In Love,"
Randy Newman,"My dad was a doctor,"
Randy Newman,I am not overlooking any mail. I'm looking at all of it. I even wrote back to the Viagra people.
Randy Newman,"Learn about the world, the way it works, any kind of science and anthropology, it's really an interesting place we live in. Evolution is a really fantastic idea, even more than the idea of God I think."
Randy Newman,"I started recording because I was always complaining about the records that I was getting of my songs. At least if I did them and messed them up, I wouldn't have anyone else to blame."
Randy Newman,"If we'd had another carefree 70's, I'd have been dead. It was a little too carefree, you know? I don't know how carefree they were for me, I think I was worried then, I can't remember what about."
Randy Newman,I think the tax cut is ridiculous but so am I.
Randy Newman,I once had dinner with Madonna and I wasn't nervous but within about a minute I found myself talking about underwear.
Randy Newman,"When people start knocking those bands, those bands that sing all that harmony, it's hard, I can't do it. Course, there's only one of me."
Randy Newman,I like the idea of taking a true classic written by a true genius and destroying it essentially! I like the idea of bringing it down to earth a bit - and even a bit lower than that.
Robert Newman,"We could be in clinical trials this spring to determine safety, ... Two or three years beyond that, we're looking at trials on anti-tumor activity."
Robert Newman,Fred is the perfect candidate to take over this enormously important responsibility.
Robert Newman,There's no real precedent there for collective punishment or commissary funds. Those are going to be a long battle.
Robert Newman,"My only reaction to that is, 'Wow,' ... That amount of money could certainly have settled all the claims."
Ryan Newman,"It did get into Victory Lane, but it's hit and miss with Dodge. We proved that last year."
Ryan Newman,"Staying out of the wrecks is a big thing. Qualifying up front keeps you out of trouble,"
Ryan Newman,I told him like I told everyone on national television that I didn't intentionally hit him but it was obvious that he intentionally hit me.
Ryan Newman,"I think that the Roush cars have kind of made us look bad, ... But, in turn, we haven't been running where they are on those mile-and-a-half tracks."
Ryan Newman,"Just like last season, Bristol will be the race that makes it or breaks it for a lot of teams. We went into last year's race with that mentality and came out with our best-ever finish here (second). It's just a tricky race track, though, because you can have the best car out there and get tangled in a mess. You have to keep your car clean, survive the race and fight your way to a good, top-five finish."
Ryan Newman,"I was kind of running my own race. I'd catch Brian and lose him, but he got loose in 10 and lost momentum, and I just was able to capitalize. I stuck to the outside because he was trying to block. I thought he was running out of gas. I just kept my line, and that's all it took."
Ryan Newman,"The Lowe's team did a good job of putting Jimmie in position to win the race. Everything else aside, Jimmie did drive a smart and somewhat overaggressive race."
Ryan Newman,"We obviously had a really fast race car,"
Ryan Newman,"To come back here six times in a row with different race cars, different team members and under different conditions is a great feat. I am looking forward to Sunday."
Ryan Newman,We enjoy this track. It's very fast and I really enjoy qualifying here. But it's a handful in the race.
Ryan Newman,"When they didn't meet the rules coming back to the (inspection) house after the race, then it isn't fair anymore. And even if he waits an extra half-hour, or whatever it was, it's still not fair. It didn't pass the first time through, and I didn't see anything in the rule book that says, 'Cars will be given three opportunities to be made legal as they come through the house.'"
Ryan Newman,"Last year in this race, we had a great race car,"
Ryan Newman,"I've got the numbers in my head; I know what I've got to do. If I win the race, that answers all of the questions."
Ryan Newman,"Every race is equal as far as the points go, so you keep doing the best job you can. It can all change in one day, one weekend. We could come out of Louden, N.H., with the points lead, you just never know."
Ryan Newman,"He voiced his opinion on the situation, not necessarily in that race, but in previous races. I told him that was a hard deal for me to take, when someone turns right on a left-hand racetrack. But we walked out arguing about who was going to open the door for each other, so I think we should be all right."
Ryan Newman,"In hindsight, yeah, I think we're all a little surprised, ... But we had our race to run."
Ryan Newman,"I've never driven so conscious since this race a year ago, ... We have 10 races to prove ourselves if we're a championship team."
Ryan Newman,"You'd like to expect clean racing, but I know (this race) last year it wasn't clean racing,"
Ryan Newman,I was still happy to win them. Our goal in every race is to win.
Ryan Newman,I think the open-wheel racing definitely taught us to race clean.
Ryan Newman,"Unfortunately, we ran into problems before we really got started. I'm really proud of the guys the way they got us back out there."
Ryan Newman,We ran into some problems before we even got started. (The crew) did a lot of work on the car today. It's just a shame.
Ryan Newman,"If Jimmie and Tony have problems, there could easily be eight guys within 40 points of each other for the championship,"
Ryan Newman,We had a shot at winning the race. The 48 plain got lucky. He had battery problems and everything else.
Ryan Newman,"That's pretty cool making the 'Chase' for the second consecutive season, ... It wasn't the performance we wanted, but we got part of the main goal solved today. I look forward to those last ten races. We'll keep working on this Dodge and see how we can do."
Ryan Newman,"I'm a numbers guy, but it's all about performance. When performance happens, the numbers fall in place the way you want them to."
Ryan Newman,"The bottom line is, for us, we don't have to do that. We can beat everybody else with our knowledge and intelligence. Doing what they did with their car, it was pretty archaically uneducated and just a poor choice of cheating."
Ryan Newman,"I told Matt, 'You give me a straight arrow and I'll shoot it,'  ... They keep giving me straight arrows. I'm out here representing the team."
Ryan Newman,Jamie's misfortune was our fortune tonight.
Ryan Newman,His misfortune was my fortune. It's pretty cool to get in. We'll keep working and see how we can do.
Ryan Newman,"I still have the same kind of mixed feelings that I've always had, ... I've always said that from a competitor's standpoint, I don't think it's the ideal points system. It's definitely equal for everybody. Everybody has an equal opportunity up until the last 10 races. I really haven't changed my outlook on it at all. That's what we have to deal with, and that's fine with me."
Ryan Newman,"Obviously, our eyes were opened and opened wide about what happened last year. It's not just a situation where you jump on an airplane anymore and think you're going to get from one place to another without thinking about it. Things have changed."
Ryan Newman,"Obviously, our eyes were opened and opened wide about what happened last year."
Ryan Newman,"I don't think he made any decisions off my opinion,"
Ryan Newman,"Biffle has a ton of talent, ... He's obviously a very, very car-control style of driver. He likes to hang the car out, which is totally cool as long as you can control it. He's proven this year for sure that he can."
Ryan Newman,"Kurt proved last year that winning the championship is all about consistency, so that's what we're aiming for in the next 10 weeks, ... A few wins can't hurt, though, and that's what we'll be aiming for this weekend."
Ryan Newman,We'll see then how we communicate. That's gonna determine our relationship.
Ryan Newman,"The way it worked out, with so many cars out, there was a lot less susceptibility to cautions and crashes, ... I'm just happy to have been up front and have a good consistent race car."
Ryan Newman,Obviously the cautions played to our benefit tonight.
Ryan Newman,"Well, there's never a lack of action at Richmond, that's for sure. And with it being the cutoff race, it makes it even more crazy."
Gavin Newsom,"Michael Johnson and Fillmore Development Associates have shown tremendous persistence and passion for this neighborhood and the opportunity to bring back an important part of San Francisco's cultural heritage,"
Gavin Newsom,"This is real. This is about basic, fundamental rights. It's about laying a foundation of equality for everybody, and he missed a golden opportunity to stand on history and to do something that is noble and appropriate. By no means was this a profile in courage. What a wasted moment for his administration."
Gavin Newsom,"I think we're on firm legal footing and legal grounds, and certainly I believe very strongly and passionately we're on the right moral ground, ... Late Edition."
Gavin Newsom,a chance to see its beauty with their own eyes.
Gavin Newsom,"The bottom line is I recommended that Tony Hall be appointed to the Treasure Island authority, ... Clearly, I made a mistake, and I take responsibility for that mistake, and I'm accountable for that mistake. Period."
Ozzie Newsome,"[Not only must a team be willing to part with draft picks to facilitate a trade, it must meet the long-term contract demands of James or Alexander. That might mean a signing bonus in the $15 million range.] Everybody understands the value of the running back, ... But also everybody understands the life of the running back in the National Football League. You don't want to get caught in a position where you pay a huge amount, then an injury happens."
Ozzie Newsome,"Yes, we could be enticed to move that pick before we get to the 13th. Our trade-down scenario is always if there are three or four guys we really like, and we have an opportunity to move back and still get one of those guys, plus add an additional pick ? again, from an organizational standpoint, that is the right thing to do."
Ozzie Newsome,"Back then, we realized we needed an influx of young talent, ... We are approaching the 2002 draft in that manner."
Ozzie Newsome,"I have to constantly tell my personnel staff, 'Hey guys, we're still a good staff even though we're allowing good players to go play for other people,'"
Ozzie Newsome,"Are there different opinions and views from me to Brian, from Brian to [director of player personnel] Phil Savage , from me to Phil Savage? Yes. But there's always going to be a consensus. And somebody has got to have the authority. Two people can't have the authority or nothing gets done."
Ozzie Newsome,No one is the same player at 31 that they were at 26. But you never lose that leadership. It gets better as you mature because you have seen so many things.
Ozzie Newsome,Martin Luther King Jr. preached equality. Coach Bryant practiced it.

Stevie Nicks,"Everything on this record is what I really wanted to say, and I'm back to being the poet I always thought I was."
Stevie Nicks,"I hated Chris, my brother. I would pull his hair and kick him, until one day my father gave him permission to fight back. I'll be apologizing to him for the rest of my life."
Stevie Nicks,"I preferred not to be laden down with a big instrument. If you're behind a guitar, you get used to being behind a guitar, and you don't really perform because you can't. I wanted to be able to just hold on to the mike and sing."
Stevie Nicks,"My other family is Fleetwood Mac. I don't need the money, but there's an emotional need for me to go on the road again. There's a love there; we're a band of brothers."
Stevie Nicks,"Singing is the love of my life, but I was ready to give it all up because I couldn't handle people talking about how fat I was."
Stevie Nicks,"Right now I'm not involved with anybody, but I hope by 75 I will be again."
Stevie Nicks,"Even in my really bad, drugged-out days, I didn't go away. I still toured, still did interviews. I never gave up the fight. That's why I'm who I am today, because I didn't leave. And I think I made the right choice."
Stevie Nicks,"Do you want to be an artist and a writer, or a wife and a lover? With kids, your focus changes. I don't want to go to PTA meetings."
Stevie Nicks,"I made a conscious decision that I was not going to have children. I didn't want others raising them, and looking after them myself would get in the way of being a musician and writer."
Stevie Nicks,"I am pretty fearless, and you know why? Because I don't handle fear very well; I'm not a good terrified person."
Stevie Nicks,"If you have stage fright, it never goes away. But then I wonder: is the key to that magical performance because of the fear?"
Stevie Nicks,I watched Janis one time - we opened for her - and that's the only time I ever saw her. We opened for Jimi Hendrix. I got to stand on the side of the stage and watch him for two hours and then he died. But I got the essence before they left.
Stevie Nicks,We don't need to have somebody that's gonna make sure they pay for our market bills. It's like we have only one reason to love and that is for the real idea of love.
Stevie Nicks,"By the time I was five, I was a little diva."
Stevie Nicks,He and I were about as compatible as a rat and a boa constrictor.
Stevie Nicks,"For 70 nights, right across America, I've been getting out there with two ex-lovers and we've been playing songs which are so specific about each of us, you just wouldn't know. We're friends now but we can't forget what happened between us."
Stevie Nicks,"It was my 16th birthday - my mom and dad gave me my Goya classical guitar that day. I sat down, wrote this song, and I just knew that that was the only thing I could ever really do - write songs and sing them to people."
Stevie Nicks,"You know, the man of my dreams might walk round the corner tomorrow. I'm older and wiser and I think I'd make a great girlfriend. I live in the realm of romantic possibility."
Steve Nicol,"Well, obviously Pat's been out for five or six weeks, so he certainly had enough strength to get through it. But obviously some more training and some more games and he'll sharpen up, but the two of them did well. You can't complain. We scored in the last minute. I think, like the rest of us, as a team and as individuals we can all be better than we were tonight."
Steve Nicol,"It's huge. I think any team in the league would want Pat Noonan and Steve Ralston in their starting lineup -- we certainly want them. They've got a couple of games behind them. I think it should be enough, hopefully it will be."
Steve Nicol,"We've definitely tried to take the romance out of the game. You don't want to be thinking about playoffs and finals and the like. We want to do away with that, and put it down to your professionalism, ability and concentration all the things that we've done all season. Just try and make it another game."
Steve Nicol,"[While the Revolution begin the series on the road, they are confident of getting a result - which could then mean they would be at home for the final two games on the way to a possible MLS Cup appearance.] The home-field advantage has been huge the last three years. Against Chicago [in '03] we were well-beaten away; they were the better team and deserved to win, but if we had been at home, maybe the balance could have gone the other way, ... Last year, the crowd was behind D.C. the whole game; we were unlucky not to get through, and the home crowd could have tipped the balance in our favor."
Steve Nicol,Our philosophy would be to put them under pressure and keep them back. That's going to stop them from going forward. It's a case of trying to turn the tables on them by putting pressure on them on their half of the field.
Steve Nicol,"It was hard to tell who was in their preseason and who wasn't. Overall I was happy with the performance. We had some chances, particularly in the second half, which we didn't put away, but at this stage of the season I can't be too upset with this result."
Steve Nicol,It was hard to tell who was in their preseason and who wasn't.
Steve Nicol,"Taylor's no different than any other striker. If he don't get service, he don't score goals."
Steve Nicol,We've scored all kinds of goals this year. We've scored some lovely goals passing and moving and some lovely individual play. And we've scored some scruffy goals.
Steve Nicol,"Sealy has scored some good goals, one against us."
Steve Nicol,He just turns up every game and wants to score goals.
Steve Nicol,"[But the coaches felt he could have hustled back on defense more, which would become a common criticism.] Andy's got great soccer ability, which is why he's been in the league so long, ... It's not that he doesn't work hard, but we have to get guys who will kick and spit and punch to get results."
Steve Nicol,"As far as passion and guys and courage are concerned, this lot's got it in abundance. And that's what won us the game. They are always looking to win and that commitment and togetherness pulled us through again."
Steve Nicol,"We have nothing to be ashamed of. The effort and the way we tried to do things and the commitment was superb. Until we went one down, we were the team that was really pushing the ball. We were the ones really putting the pressure on. And even when we went to 10 men, we kept going at them. So we can have no complaints. It's one of those nights where it just never happened for us in the final third."
Steve Nicol,"He's really blessed with an ability in the box, ... It's something all guys who score goals have inside them. There are certain guys who just love to score goals, and he's one of them."
Steve Nicol,"Andy's got great soccer ability, which is why he's been in the league so long. It's not that he doesn't work hard, but we have to get guys who will kick and spit and punch to get results."
Steve Nicol,They have ability. The players have quality. The hard part is putting everybody together. They have a problem doing that. They're obviously putting it together as a team now.

Reinhold Niebuhr,"Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime; therefore, we must be saved by hope.

Reinhold Niebuhr,If we survive danger it steels our courage more than anything else

Scott Niedermayer,"I don't have that good a memory of it, but if he said it, it must be true. Just going the full season of competing together for the same team will be special for us."
Scott Niedermayer,"We're happy to be going back like this. If we were going back down two, it would have been a hole that would've been tough. Now we just shorten the series a little bit and start again from scratch in a couple days."
Scott Niedermayer,"Taking part in that gold-medal game, it's pretty intense. Coming back, there is a lot at stake for this team right now. It will be an adjustment. That doesn't take too long to figure out, though. Within a game, or two or three games, they'll have that taken care of."
Scott Niedermayer,We didn't want to get down two goals like that early in the game. They came out ready to go and we just weren't jumping like we needed to be. For us to compete with them we need to be going as hard as we can.
Scott Niedermayer,"Those teams are all playing for playoff position, too, so you don't want to fool around. We've been in that (playoff-race) mode for quite a while. We're going to have to be at our best from here on in."
Scott Niedermayer,"After a discussion with team doctors yesterday, it was recommended I undergo surgery on my knee in the very near future. I discussed the situation with Hockey Canada president Bob Nicholson and came to the extremely difficult decision to withdraw from the Olympic Games and have surgery next week."
Scott Niedermayer,"After a discussion with team doctors yesterday, it was recommended I undergo surgery on my knee. Representing Canada in international competition has always been a privilege I take very seriously, which made this decision extremely difficult."
Scott Niedermayer,"There is a belief in each other right now that if we go out there and work hard, we have a good opportunity (to win) every night."
Scott Niedermayer,"There is a belief in each other right now, that if we go out there and work hard, we have a good opportunity every night. No matter what kind of talent you have on your team, you need that if you really want to do well and win hockey games. You need that feeling. We have to hold on to it now."
Scott Niedermayer,We had a few little breakdowns and they took advantage of it.
Scott Niedermayer,"I don't know if his skill and ability were more than I expected, but the three goals were."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The growth of wisdom may be gauged exactly by the diminution of ill temper.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"I know my fate.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,He who despises himself nevertheless esteems himself as a self-despiser.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Oh, how much is today hidden by science! Oh, how much it is expected to hide!"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,A matter that becomes clear ceases to concern us
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"It quite often happens that the old man is subject to the delusion of a great moral renewal and rebirth, and from this experience he passes judgments on the work and course of his life, as if he had only now become clear-sighted; and yet the inspiration behind this feeling of well-being and these confident judgements is not wisdom, but weariness ."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Has a woman who knew she was well-dressed ever caught a cold?
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,So long as you are praised think only that you are not yet on your own path but on that of another.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Actual philosophers... are commanders and law-givers: they say ''thus it shall be!'', it is they who determine the Wherefore and Whither of mankind, and they possess for this task the preliminary work of all the philosophical laborers, of all those who have subdued the past -- they reach for the future with creative hand, and everything that is or has been becomes for them a means, an instrument, a hammer. Their ''knowing'' is creating, their creating is a law giving, their will to truth is -- will to power. Are their such philosophers today? Have there been such philosophers? Must there not be such philosophers?"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Every philosophy is the philosophy of some stage of life.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Man... cannot learn to forget, but hangs on the past: however far or fast he runs, that chain runs with him."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The thought of suicide is a powerful solace: by means of it one gets through many a bad night
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Let us beware of saying there are laws in nature. There are only necessities: there is no one to command, no one to obey, no one to transgress.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"As regards the celebrated ''struggle for life,'' it seems to me for the present to have been rather asserted than proved. It does occur, but as the exception; the general aspect of life is not hunger and distress, but rather wealth, luxury, even absurd prodigality -- where there is a struggle it is a struggle for power."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The significance of language for the evolution of culture lies in this, that mankind set up in language a separate world beside the other world, a place it took to be so firmly set that, standing upon it, it could lift the rest of the world off its hinges and make itself master of it. To the extent that man has for long ages believed in the concepts and names of things as in aeternae veritates he has appropriated to himself that pride by which he raised himself above the animal: he really thought that in language he possessed knowledge of the world."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,One should never know too precisely whom one has married
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"From what you would know and measure, you must take leave, at least for a time. Only after having left town, you see how high its towers rise above the houses ."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The philosopher believes that the value of his philosophy lies in the whole, in the building: posterity discovers it in the bricks with which he built and which are then often used again for better building: in the fact, that is to say, that building can be destroyed and nonetheless possess value as material."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Instinct. When the house burns one forgets even lunch. Yes, but one eats it later in the ashes."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"What is wanted -- whether this is admitted or not -- is nothing less than a fundamental remolding, indeed weakening and abolition of the individual: one never tires of enumerating and indicating all that is evil and inimical, prodigal, costly, extravagant in the form individual existence has assumed hitherto, one hopes to manage more cheaply, more safely, more equitably, more uniformly if there exist only large bodies and their members."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,I teach you the Superman. Man is something that should be overcome.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Shared joys make a friend, not shared sufferings."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,In everything one thing is impossible: rationality.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Judgments, value judgments concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they possess value only as symptoms, they come into consideration only as symptoms - in themselves such judgments are stupidities."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The irrationality of a thing is no argument against its existence, rather a condition of it."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"For the woman, the man is a means: the end is always the child."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"In large states public education will always be mediocre, for the same reason that in large kitchens the cooking is usually bad."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The man who fights too long against dragons becomes a dragon himself
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"That getting along without false judgments would amount to getting along without life, negating life. To admit untruth as a necessary condition of life: this implies, to be sure, a perilous resistance against customary value-feelings."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"To do great things is difficult, but to command great things is more difficult."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,What is evil? Whatever springs from weakness.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,What a time experiences as evil is usually an untimely echo of what was formerly experienced as good-the atavism of a more ancient ideal.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The world is beautiful, but has a disease called man"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Is Wagner actually a man? Is he not rather a disease? Everything he touches falls ill; he has made music sick
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Many find their heart when they have lost their head.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"We find nothing easier than being wise, patient, superior. We drip with the oil of forbearance and sympathy, we are absurdly just, we forgive everything. For that very reason we ought to discipline ourselves a little; for that very reason we ought to cultivate a little emotion, a little emotional vice, from time to time. It may be hard for us; and among ourselves we may perhaps laugh at the appearance we thus present. But what of that! We no longer have any other mode of self-overcoming available to us: this is our asceticism, our penance."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The will to overcome a passion is in the end merely the will of another or several other passions
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The will to truth! That will which is yet to seduce us into many a venture, that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers up to this time have spoken reverently -- think what questions this will to truth has posed for us!

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to liver dangerously.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The sick are the greatest danger for the healthy; it is not from the strongest that harm comes to the strong, but from the weakest."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The man loves danger and sport. That is why he loves woman, the most dangerous of all sports."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Believe me! The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously!
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"How is freedom measured, in individuals as in nations? By the resistance which has to be overcome, by the effort it costs to stay aloft.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Lift up your hearts, you good dancers, high! higher! And do not forget the good laughter!"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,I would believe only in a God that knows how to Dance.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his fine art, finally also the only kind of piety he knows, his ''divine service.''"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,We should consider every day lost in which we have not danced at least once.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Love is a state in which a man sees things most decidedly as the are not.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The pine tree seems to listen, the fir tree to wait: and both without impatience -- they give no thought to the little people beneath them devoured by their impatience and their curiosity."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Morals, however, remain invaluable: they reveal, at least for those who know, the most valuable realities of cultures which did not know enough to understand themselves. At all times they have wanted to improve men: this above all was called morality."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Scholars spend all of their energies on saying Yes and No, on criticism of what others have thought -- they themselves no longer think."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The desire to create continually is vulgar and betrays jealousy, envy, ambition. If one is something one really does not need to make anything --and one nonetheless does very much. There exists above the ''productive'' man a yet higher species."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Man created his own god: and there is no worse enmity on earth than that between gods
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"We create truth, we don't discover it."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,We advance our race by creating truth and imposing it on the world.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"When one has not had a good father, one must create one."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The most spiritual human beings, assuming they are the most courageous, also experience by far the most painful tragedies: but it is precisely for this reason that they honor life, because it brings against them its most formidable weapons."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"In the consciousness of the truth he has perceived, man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of existence and loathing seizes him."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"If we train our conscience, it kisses us while it hurts us."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"All credibility, all good conscience, all evidence of truth come only from the senses."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Again and again I am brought up against it, and again and again I resist it: I don't want to believe it, even though it is almost palpable: the vast majority lack an intellectual conscience; indeed, it often seems to me that to demand such a thing is to be in the most populous cities as solitary as in the desert."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"I know my fate. One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful / of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified. I am not a man I am dynamite."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,There is not enough love and goodness in the world for us to be permitted to give any of it away to imaginary things.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Insanity in individuals is something rare, but in groups, parties, nations and epochs it is the rule"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"When we talk in company we lose our unique tone of voice, and this leads us to make statements which is no way correspond to our real thoughts."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Morality is primarily a means of preserving the community and saving it from destruction. Next it is a means of maintaining the community on a certain plane and in a certain degree of benevolence.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"On this earth, one pays dearly for every kind of mastery . . . . For having a specialty one pays by also being the victim of this specialty. But you would have it otherwise -- cheaper and fairer and above all more comfortable -- isn't that right, my dear contemporaries?"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"With the unknown, one is confronted with danger, discomfort, and care; the first instinct is to abolish these painful states. First principle: any explanation is better than none. . . . The causal instinct is thus conditional upon, and excited by, the feeling of fear. The why? shall, if at all possible, not give the cause for its own sake so much as for a particular kind of cause -- a cause that is comforting, liberating, and relieving."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The thought of suicide is a great source of comfort; with it a calm passage is to be made across many a bad night.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,One begins to mistrust very clever people when they become embarrassed
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The surest aid in combating the male's disease of self-contempt is to be loved by a clever woman.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,To exercise power costs effort and demands courage. That is why so many fail to assert rights to which they are perfectly entitled -- because a right is a kind of power but they are too lazy or too cowardly to exercise it. The virtues which cloak these faults are called patience and forbearance.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,To produce music is also in a sense to produce children
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Fathers and sons are much more considerate of one another than mothers and daughters.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Woman understands children better than man does, but man is more childlike than woman"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she forgets how to charm.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings - always darker, emptier and simpler."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"It is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost. The noble soul has reverence for itself."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Undeserved praise causes more pangs of conscience later than undeserved blame, but probably only for this reason, that our power of judgment are more completely exposed by being over praised than by being unjustly underestimated."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,One never dives into the water to save a drowning man more eagerly than when there are others present who dare not take the risk.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Against boredom the gods themselves fight in vain.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The value of many men and books rests solely on their faculty for compelling all to speak out the most hidden and intimate things.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,It was the sick and dying who despised the body and the earth and invented the things of heaven and the redeeming drops of blood: but even these sweet and dismal poisons they took from the body and the earth!
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Your soul will be dead even before your body: fear nothing further.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The abdomen is the reason why man does not easily take himself for a god

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Here the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"History is nothing more than the belief in the senses, the belief in falsehood."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,No victor believes in chance
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Much that is dreadful and inhuman in history, much that one hardly likes to believe, is mitigated by the reflection that the one who commands and the one who carries out are different people. The former does not behold the sight and does not experience the strong impression on the imagination. The latter obeys a superior and therefore feels no responsibility for the acts."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Belief means not wanting to know what is true
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"People who have given us their complete confidence believe that they have a right to ours.  The inference is false, a gift confers no rights."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,That which needs to be proved cannot be worth much
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Mathematics would certainly have not come into existence if one had known from the beginning that there was in nature no exactly straight line, no actual circle, no absolute magnitude."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The most serious parody I have ever heard was this: In the beginning was nonsense, and the nonsense was with God, and the nonsense was God"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"In the beautiful, man sets himself up as the standard of perfection; in select cases he worships himself in it. Man believes that the world itself is filled with beauty /he forgets that it is he who has created it. He alone has bestowed beauty upon the world /alas! only a very human, an all too human, beauty."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"In the beautiful, man sets himself up as the standard of perfection; in select cases he worships himself in it. Man believes that the world itself is filled with beauty --he forgets that it is he who has created it. He alone has bestowed beauty upon the world --alas! only a very human, an all too human, beauty."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Women's modesty generally increases with their beauty.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Whoever battles with monsters had better see that it does not turn him into a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The belief in authority is the source of conscience; which is therefore not the voice of God in the heart of man, but the voice of some men in man."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"It was modesty which in Greece invented the word philosopher and left the splendid arrogance of calling oneself wise to the actors of the spirit --the modesty of such monsters of pride and self-glorification as Pythagoras, as Plato."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Arrogance on the part of the meritorious is even more offensive to us than the arrogance of those without merit: for merit itself is offensive.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The architect represents neither a Dionysian nor an Apollinian condition: here it is the mighty act of will, the will which moves mountains, the intoxication of the strong will, which demands artistic expression. The most powerful men have always inspired the architects; the architect has always been influenced by power."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"If one considers how much reason every person has for anxiety and timid self-concealment, and how three-quarters of his energy and goodwill can be paralyzed and made unfruitful by it, one has to be very grateful to fashion, insofar as it sets that th"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"I fear animals regard man as a creature of their own kind which has in a highly dangerous fashion lost its healthy animal reason -- as the mad animal, as the laughing animal, as the weeping animal, as the unhappy animal."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"About sacrifice and the offering of sacrifices, sacrificial animals think quite differently from those who look on: but they have never been allowed to have their say."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom. -- A theme for a great poet would be God's boredom on the seventh day of creation.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Do I advise you to love the neighbor? I suggest rather to escape from the neighbor and to love those who are the farthest away from you. Higher than the love for the neighbor is the love for the man who is distant and has still to come.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"When entering into a marriage one ought to ask oneself: do you believe you are going to enjoy talking with this woman up into your old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory, but most of the time you are together will be devoted to conversation."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Don't just propagate, elevate yourself."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"Enduring habits I hate.... Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I feel grateful to all my misery and bouts of sickness and everything about me that is imperfect, because this sort of thing leaves me with a hundred backdoors through which I can escape from enduring habits."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,You gave him an opportunity of showing greatness of character and he did not seize it. He will never forgive you for that.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,There was at all events one advantage in the choice of this day to my birth; my birthday throughout the whole of my childhood was a day of public rejoicing.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"How poor the human mind would be without vanity! It resembles a well stocked and ever renewed ware-emporium that attracts buyers of every class: they can find almost everything, have almost everything, provided they bring with them the right kind of money -- admiration."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"For others do I wait...for higher ones, stronger ones, more triumphant ones, merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in body and soul: laughing lions must come."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The strength required for the vision of the most powerful reality is not only compatible with the most powerful strength for action, for monstrous action, for crime -- it even presupposes it."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The so called unconscious inferences can be traced back to the all-preserving memory, which presents us with parallel experiences and hence already knows the consequences of an action. It is not anticipation of the effects; rather, it is the feeling: identical causes, identical effects . . ."
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,The doer alone learneth.
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The best friend will probably acquire the best wife, because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship"
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"In the mountains, the shortest way is from peak to peak: but for that you must have long legs"

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly."

Earl Nightingale,You become what you think about.
Earl Nightingale,We can help others in the world more by making the most of yourself than in any other way.
Earl Nightingale,"We must be the epitome-the embodiment-of success. We must radiate success before it will come to us. We must first become mentally, from an attitude standpoint, the people we wish to become."
Earl Nightingale,To give oneself is the only way of becoming oneself.
Earl Nightingale,Am I motivated by what I really want out of life -- or am I mass-motivated?
Earl Nightingale,When the days are too short chances are you are living at your best.
Earl Nightingale,"For a person to build a rich and rewarding life for himself, there are certain qualities and bits of knowledge that he needs to acquire. There are also things, harmful attitudes, superstitions, and emotions that he needs to chip away. A person needs to chip away everything that doesn't look like the person he or she most wants to become."
Earl Nightingale,Our first journey is to find that special place for us.
Earl Nightingale,"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Donâ€™t wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether itâ€™s at work or with your family."
Earl Nightingale,Excellence always sells
Earl Nightingale,"The key that unlocks energy is ''Desire.'' It's also the key to a long and interesting life. If we expect to create any drive, any real force within ourselves, we have to get excited."
Earl Nightingale,Creativity is a natural extension of our enthusiasm
Earl Nightingale,"Mistakes are a natural part of growing up. They're to be expected and made light of. But children bloom like spring flowers under praise. They want so much to be noticed and appreciated, to excel and have that excellence noticed."

Earl Nightingale,"You are, at this moment, standing, right in the middle of your own acres of diamonds."
Earl Nightingale,"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."
Earl Nightingale,The mind moves in the direction of our currently dominant thoughts.
Earl Nightingale,People are where they are because that is exactly where they really want to be - whether they will admit that or not.
Earl Nightingale,"We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal we've established for ourselves. It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile."
Earl Nightingale,A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.
Earl Nightingale,You'll find boredom where there is the absence of a good idea.
Earl Nightingale,"Get into a line that you will find to be a deep personal interest, something you really enjoy spending twelve to fifteen hours a day working at, and the rest of the time thinking about."
Earl Nightingale,Everything that's really worthwhile in life comes to us.
Earl Nightingale,You can measure opportunity with the same yardstick that measures the risk involved. They go together.
Earl Nightingale,We all walk in the dark and each of us must learn to turn on his or her own light.
Earl Nightingale,Everything begins with an idea.
Earl Nightingale,"Whenever we're afraid, it's because we don't know enough. If we understood enough, we would never be afraid."
Earl Nightingale,All you have to do is know where you're going. The answers will come to you of their own accord.
Earl Nightingale,"The more intensely we feel about an idea or a goal, the more assuredly the idea, buried deep in our subconscious, will direct us along the path to its fulfillment."
Earl Nightingale,What's going on in the inside shows on the outside.
Earl Nightingale,"We can let circumstances rule us, or we can take charge and rule our lives from within."
Earl Nightingale,Your world is a living expression of how you are using and have used your mind.
Earl Nightingale,"All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination."
Earl Nightingale,"Our environment, the world in which we live and work, is a mirror of our attitudes and expectations."
Earl Nightingale,Any person who contributes to prosperity must prosper in turn.

Brian Noble,"It's pinch-yourself stuff, isn't it? ... Statistically it's probably been the best era in the club's history and of course that makes me feel good. But corny as it sounds, I'm honestly more pleased for the players. That's why I do the job primarily and that's why getting to the grand final this year has been the best yet because we've been through some pretty dark times along the way."
Brian Noble,"We didn't help ourselves with that many penalties. If you give field position to this team, it's hard work. It's not the first time this has happened to us but we're not too despondent. It was one of those nights and we will learn from it."
Brian Noble,"A family of four doesn't want to pay more than $100 for an evening of entertainment, and they shouldn't have to. Judging by our success (in the Florida game) last year, this is a good decision."
Brian Noble,The win was as much for the character of the team as the skills we've shown over the last three months.
Brian Noble,"I thought the character was superb and in the end we looked like scoring from every play,"
Brian Noble,They've not been beaten here and we're highly delighted with the result. Our form is pretty good and the boys are talking about improving as well.
Brian Noble,"[Peacock, the Bradford captain whose move to Leeds was confirmed last week, moves up from vice-captain to replace the injured Paul Sculthorpe.] He wears his heart on his sleeve and leads by example, but he also understands tactics, ... He's had a difficult season at Bradford with all our ups and downs, but I never flinched from promoting him."
John Noel,"We're not trying to be on [the MTV show] TRL, but we enjoy playing to the largest crowd possible. It keeps the pressure off us if it's not our main focus. We do what we do because we like it, not because we have to."
John Noel,"You can almost hear those trees talk. You can feel it, the history. When John Hancock, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were signing the Declaration of Independence, this forest was already growing."
John Noel,"The idea was to have fun, get together and jam out. But it sounded so good, so easily that we decided to run with it."
Soichi Noguchi,"As a rookie astronaut, I could not ask for more. We had three spacewalks, two bonus extension days in space and one great crew."

Brian Nolan,It's an incredible music program that local families can take advantage of without having to travel. And it's an incredible place to visit for families that are traveling to the camp.
Brian Nolan,"I saw two 80-year-olds fighting over it at Sam's,"
Brian Nolan,"I feel good. But the community, they're not handling it real well."
John Nolan,"We just have to be smart to understand what our consumers want, what the technology can offer, ... In that sense, we're ready for the Internet to be a disruptive technology and completely disrupt our normal volumes. How much and to what extent remain to be seen. But it's also a supportive technology; we see tremendous opportunities in being able to reach more customers in a much richer fashion through the Internet."
John Nolan,the bottom line (is that) there was no indication at all that there was any risk.
John Nolan,It's hard with just having freshmen. They can't drive. Transportation becomes difficult to and from practice.
John Nolan,"It was an uphill battle. Our kids never quit. When they got down it would have been easy to walk away, but they battled all the way back."
John Nolan,"There's no doubt, if you want to be successful on the Internet, that aligning yourself with the postal service probably isn't a bad idea. We hope to play that trump card an awful lot."
Kevin Nolan,"We had a walk the night we arrived and again yesterday morning and you could see the place was buzzing with Bolton fans,"
Kevin Nolan,It just wasn't to be on the night. We switched off for a split second and when playing quality sides this is what happens. I'm absolutely devastated.
Kevin Nolan,"All first generation Full Track Music Download services in the UK receive a failing grade on download speeds, price and DRM. Operators must address these key weaknesses in order to realize their visions of mobile music revenues."
Kevin Nolan,"We've got some of our players away at the African Nations Cup and we've got to hope that they get knocked out early so that we can get them back. We want to keep this club going forward. There's no point, after all our hard work, in taking a step back."
Kevin Nolan,"We just think the gaffer deserves to be given something to play with and, we hope, that this will keep him here for another couple of years."
Kevin Nolan,"I'm not happy, but it's one of those things,"
Kevin Nolan,"We're not supposed to score those sort of goals, are we? I forgot, we're supposed to be like Wimbledon. Sorry, I won't do that again!"
Kevin Nolan,We've got to put the defeat behind us now and look forward to playing Fulham.
Mike Nolan,They're not a long-drive team; they're an explosive team. They're not shy. And that's Mike's personality; that's his philosophy.
Mike Nolan,"This is only the second step in our journey, but it might be more valuable than our first one last week,"
Mike Nolan,"They are just guys that if an issue needs to be discussed and a player doesn't feel comfortable coming to my office, he can go to a teammate to take it to me, ... Terry and Ahmed were both chosen by the players on this football team, and I just chose the other two."
Mike Nolan,"We don't have any excuses, ... We played a very good football team and we did not play very well. That was obvious."
Mike Nolan,"This is only the second step in our journey, but it might be more valuable than our first one last week. Adversity sometimes is some of the best experience you have."

Chuck Noll,"Before you can win a game, you have to not lose it."

Greg Norman,"Jason emerged out of nowhere and gave the golf world a welcome breath of fresh air. His personality and pure enjoyment of the game are just tremendous. He is a person that represents the true spirit of the Shootout and will be a welcome addition to this elite, 24-person field."
Greg Norman,"Jason emerged out of nowhere and gave the golf world a welcome breath of fresh air, ... His personality and pure enjoyment of the game are just tremendous. He is a person that represents the true spirit of the Shootout and will be a welcome addition to this elite, 24-person field."
Greg Norman,"If I play more golf and feel competitive, it's going to be on the regular tour. I don't see myself adjusting my schedule for senior tournament golf."
Greg Norman,"I got to know the lines on the golf course. You know where you're hitting the ball, you know where the trouble is, trying to keep it away from it. So I'm starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with it and hopefully I can keep it going the next couple of days."
Greg Norman,"Aggressive play is a vital asset of the world's greatest golfers. However, it's even more important to the average player. Attack this game in a bold, confident, and determined way, and you'll make a giant leap toward realizing your full potential as a player."
Greg Norman,"Sometimes things work out on the golf course and sometimes they don't. Life will go on. You try to understand what happens, but maybe today I don't want to know. I just screwed up so maybe I should just put it behind me."
Greg Norman,Setting goals for your game is an art. The trick is in setting them at the right level neither too low nor too high.

John Norris,We are bogged down in red tape. We're not able to get things approved and get to (work in) the field.
John Norris,"[â€¢ John Norris, who's running Kerry's Iowa campaign, said the senator has been to about 44 counties that make up roughly 80 percent of the caucus vote.] That's just by eyeballing it, I may be off by one, ... Hasn't been something we've been focused on."
John Norris,"For the shop owners, this reduces the cost and risk of bringing a very enthusiastic young worker into the shop. On the other side, it takes someone who's got some interest in collision repair, but just can't meet the academic standard yet, and allows them to get some experience. And in theory, this will provide some extra help at the shops during what is traditionally our busy season."
John Norris,The Fed can't do anything different than what it has been doing. It can't rest on its laurels.
John Norris,"Also, our seniors are becoming leaders on the floor, and that's hard to teach."
John Norris,They have been tremendous leaders. They have played their roles and done whatever was needed for the team to excel. We will need new leaders to step up next year.
John Norris,If (land does not have adequate moisture) we would recommend that you do not plant because the likelihood is those trees would die.
John Norris,"The biggest thing is that now our kids believe in each other and believe in the system. It took some time. But when it happened, we caught fire towards the tournament stretch. I just wish we could have ridden the wave a little longer."
John Norris,The Fed is more realistic about [the lack of] prospects for rampant job growth. Wages have stabilized this year and are growing at a comfortable pace.
John Norris,"They'll cite an incident - that I saw Barney in their ear - or some funny incident,"
John Norris,"Prices are going to go up, period, end of discussion. Energy costs are going through the roof. We still don't know the extent of the impact on building aggregates."
John Norris,"A rate hike in November is without a doubt a given. We're staring 4 percent in the face,"
John Norris,"I can't make a determination as to what the intent was, but the purchases were close enough together that we interpreted it to be subject to the bid law."
John Norris,"We are very concerned that this is simply a way of short-circuiting the very legitimate complaints that these detainees have,"
John Norris,I'd caution [consumers] very seriously on going into the real-estate market with both feet right now. [It's] not necessarily that they're going to lose their shirts. It's just that the easy money has been made.
Henri Nouwen,"Somewhere we know that without silence words lose their meaning, that without listening speaking no longer heals, that without distance closeness cannot cure"
Henri Nouwen,Much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared.
Henri Nouwen,"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate now knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares."
Henri Nouwen,".....every time there are losses there are choices to be made. You choose to live your losses as passages to anger, blame, hatred, depression and resentment, or you choose to let these losses be passages to something new, something wider, and deeper"
Henri Nouwen,"Your body needs to be held and to hold, to be touched and to touch. None of these needs is to be despised, denied, or repressed. But you have to keep searching for your body's deeper need, the need for genuine love. Every time you are able to go beyond the body's superficial desires for love, you are bringing your body home and moving toward integration and unity."
Henri Nouwen,"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand."
Henri Nouwen,"The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing... not healing, not curing... that is a friend who cares."

David Novak,They're going to face justice.
David Novak,Humility is going to be critically important for him. It's going to be horrendous. It's going to be excruciating for him.
David Novak,"This is a highly targeted and cost-effective way for us to create awareness and interest in Yum around the globe. Through this sponsorship, potential investors will know of Yum Brands and begin to associate the company with our leading restaurant brands."
David Novak,We thought it was time for us to begin to build awareness of the Yum corporate name.
David Novak,The United States of America rests.
John Novak,Everyone anticipates a tough year in 2006 across the board. Companies that have a diverse customer base and produce value-added technology-based components will continue to do better than the others.

John Novak,"There is just considerable and growing uncertainty surrounding GM and Ford Motor Co. (F.N: Quote , Profile , Research ), and that ripples through the industry."
John Novak,"It looks like they are making progress on their restructuring plan. It is far too early to call this a success, but they are moving in the right direction."
John Novak,"I'm not surprised by the bidding. But you're now getting to the point of the company being fully valued. I guess the question I would ask if I was a Thyssen shareholder is, Is this a good use of the money?"
Steve Novak,"It was a set play, and we pretty much ran it to perfection. That was a huge shot, and I needed to step up and make that one. It was a three-point game, but it didn't go down for me."
Steve Novak,"We knew what our goals were and what we expected to do this year. Obviously, there was a lot of cynics and skeptics that said a lot of things at the beginning of the year, and we've obviously proven many of them wrong."
Steve Novak,There's no question that everyone on the team has faith in him to knock down big shots.
Steve Novak,"That's definitely been more of a concentration. I definitely understand I need to get to the line more. I've definitely been known as a shooter and coming into a new conference I know I'm going to be guarded that way, so I've been working on putting the ball on the floor more."
Novalis Novalis,"To become properly acquainted with a truth, we must first have disbelieved it, and disputed against it."

Ivor Novello,You cannot isolate yourself from the crowd - even if you want to.
Ivor Novello,"Whenever I am asked if I go to hear my Fortune told, I invariably reply, No. I don't go because I don't believe in it-I believe in it too much!"
Ivor Novello,"When the cinematograph first made its appearance, we were told that the days of the ordinary theatre were numbered."
Ivor Novello,We were asked to believe that the variety and the novelty of even the crude films of the early days would provide a means of entertainment which would cut out the stage.
Ivor Novello,Things which do not require effort of some sort are seldom worth having.
Ivor Novello,"There is an atmosphere about the picture theatre that speaks of entertainment and relaxation. The charming surroundings, good music, and the fact that each visitor is determined to enjoy a few hours of holiday all exert an influence on the mind."
Ivor Novello,"There are very few misanthropes, thank goodness!"
Ivor Novello,"The public must suffer untold pangs from the stiffness, the deliberate stifling of emotion, on the part of many British actors."
Ivor Novello,"The pictures are designed to portray human emotions, good and evil, fine and tawdry; and it is no wonder that their appeal is so universal."
Ivor Novello,"The inconvenience, the glaring lights, the long hours of waiting, and the repetition of every scene are all calculated to defeat anything more than a real mastery of love technique."
Ivor Novello,"The crowd may be influenced easily, largely because it is a crowd."
Ivor Novello,"The cinema is an institution nowadays, with its roots sunk deep in the hearts of the millions of people who find enjoyment and entertainment in going to the pictures."
Ivor Novello,The average person is gregarious; there is something in the spirit of the crowd that adds to the enjoyment of entertainment.
Ivor Novello,"Television, they say, will permit a person to be entertained at home, without the effort of going to a picture house, without the trouble of booking seats, without the presence of other people."
Ivor Novello,Love-making is an art which must be studied.
Ivor Novello,"It has been argued that British girls are incapable of deep feeling or brilliant acting owing to their lack of temperament. This, I am positive, is not true."
Ivor Novello,I began my career with infantile dreams of becoming a composer.
Ivor Novello,Every blessed one of you feels better for that burst of laughter.
Ivor Novello,British girls are as temperamental as Americans.
Ivor Novello,"Behind the footlights there is always the applause, which stimulates the actors. On the screen it is a different matter."
Ivor Novello,"As the growth of the film industry has progressed from humble beginnings to its present important position, the play has prospered."
Ivor Novello,Actors who are lovers in real life are often incapable if playing the part of lovers to an audience. It is equally true that sympathy between actors who are not lovers may create a temporary emotion that is perfectly sincere.
Ivor Novello,"A visit to a cinema is a little outing in itself. It breaks the monotony of an afternoon or evening; it gives a change from the surroundings of home, however pleasant."
Ivor Novello,A couple of seats at a good picture house cost comparatively little but give a generous return in the shape of freshened minds and freedom from the worries that even the best regulated homes cannot always avoid.
Ivor Novello,There's something Vichy about the French.
Rachael Novier,"This has been a very deadly wildfire season, but Texas communities have shown strength, and we're going to continue fighting these fires from the ground and from the air."
Rachael Novier,Those who own more expensive properties pay more each year in property taxes; that's just common sense. But the one-third reduction is across the board and provides relief to Texans at all income levels.
Rachael Novier,We are currently reviewing them to determine which ones require action by the Legislature and which can be implemented quickly to protect our Texas coasts before the next hurricane season.
Krist Novoselic,The book is about creating new opportunities for voters.
Krist Novoselic,I can't remember the last time I looked at a Nirvana web site.
Krist Novoselic,"But remember, guitar players are a dime a dozen."
Krist Novoselic,And Seattle isn't really crazy anymore. It's a big dot-com city.
Krist Novoselic,We're all players and musicians and we sure all get along good. We just clicked right off the bat. We started playing and then we almost immediately started recording.
Krist Novoselic,"I'm really into Sweet 75 right now, and I dig playing Nirvana, don't get me wrong. Even if Kurt never died, more than likely I'd be in Sweet 75 today still."
Krist Novoselic,"I'm just really happy, because I think we're a great band, and I really like great bands."
Krist Novoselic,I live out in the country now and it's quiet and it's a place where I can think a lot.
Krist Novoselic,"I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got."

Krist Novoselic,"But whenever history is in the making, there's some kind of intangible feeling."

Marissa Nowakowski,It was well worth the wait. (Being a senior) made it all the better.
Marissa Nowakowski,"At least we got one of two goals. We have to look at the upside, but it's very disappointing. This season, I wouldn't trade for any of the other three years. I'm glad to end with this group."
Marissa Nowakowski,"We watched them when they were little, mini-freshmen and they're so good now. They're the most fun to watch, especially when you know them and they do well."
Marissa Nowakowski,I finally got some confidence after making the first shot.
Dirk Nowitzki,It?s a lot better than being down 0-2 like last year. Anything is possible in sports. We expect them to come out swinging on Saturday.
Dirk Nowitzki,"It's his first year. He also has to improve and keep working on stuff and learning as we go, and he did a great job picking things up. He has Del on his staff and he knows everything -- not only about basketball, but life."
Dirk Nowitzki,I want to take that one back at the end of regulation that I missed. I kind of rushed that one when the score was tied.
Dirk Nowitzki,"We have to show some killer instinct, and we can't be satisfied being up 2-0. All we did was win at home. Memphis is a tough team at home, and we have to be aggressive like we were the first two games here."
Dirk Nowitzki,"You hate to see players go down, but injuries are part of the game."
Dirk Nowitzki,We still make it hard on ourselves.
Dirk Nowitzki,"Obviously, it's a little different shooting off the rack. Game shots are totally different."
Dirk Nowitzki,"I thought we just slept right through [the game]. They were aggressive and came out on fire, and we just couldn't get anything going."
Dirk Nowitzki,"We really like what we're doing. More than anything, we're working on consistency at the defensive end."
Robert Nozick,The trouble with government regulation of the market is that it prohibits capitalistic acts between consenting adults.
Robert Nozick,There is no social entity with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good.
Robert Nozick,"There is no social entity with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing more."
Robert Nozick,"Whoever makes something having bought or contracted for all other held resources used in the process (transferring some of his holdings for these cooperating factors), is entitled to it. The situation is not one of somethings getting made, and there being an open question of who is to get it. Things come into the world already attached to people having entitlements over them."
Ted Nugent,[is] a good man and the right man for the job.
Ted Nugent,"Whenever I donate a hunting trip for the Children's Leukemia Foundation, Ronald McDonald Cancer House, all these children's charities, I offer the anti-hunters an opportunity: if you donate more to the children's charity than the hunters donate we won't go hunting."
Ted Nugent,"You have to save the habitat, you have to save the population - not individual animals. What you want to save is the foundation, the basic infrastructure from which resources are produced. You can't save Fifi and Boo-Boo and Thumper."

Ted Nugent,I am Classic Rock Revisited. I revisit it every waking moment of my life because it has the spirit and the attitude and the fire and the middle finger. I am Rosa Parks with a Gibson guitar.
Ted Nugent,Mr. Janet Reno? I think Mr. Janet Reno... I think he's one of the best hunting dogs in the world.
Ted Nugent,"The way that you eliminate bad and ugly is either through activism and policy making that never tolerates evil -- instead of the liberal politically correct policy of accepting evil and accepting other points of views that destroy lives.

Ted Nugent,Vegetarians are cool. All I eat are vegetarians - except for the occasional mountain lion steak.
Ted Nugent,My idea of fast food is a mallard.

Houston Nutt,"One of the things they're doing offensively that presents a lot of problems is they are very multiple, no huddle, option, play action, and they have good receivers as usual. They have a quarterback playing with a lot of confidence, and he's a senior."
Houston Nutt,"We had every intention of playing Rod, ... but the way Cedric Logan stepped up, it (the intentions to play Coleman) motivated him."
Houston Nutt,"We had every intention to play Rod, but the way Cedric Logan stepped up during the game, I think it really motivated him. I didn't want Louisiana-Monroe to be the one game (Coleman) plays, then all the sudden, he's getting one play a game the rest of the year. I didn't want to waste it."
Houston Nutt,"Robert has made a lot of improvement, but he's got to keep going."
Houston Nutt,"He has always been such a great person. He has been to my house, rode my horses, ... We have had him over to family dinner."

Houston Nutt,At the end of the game he got a helmet to the knee.
Houston Nutt,The depth has created a good scenario of competition. It?s made for a great spring practice.

Bill Nye,Winter lingered so long in the lap of Spring that it occasioned a great deal of talk.
Bill Nye,"The more you find out about the world, the more opportunities there are to laugh at it."
Bill Nye,I've always loved airplanes and flight. The space program was really important to me as a kid. I still have a photo of Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon in my living room.
Bill Nye,"Our world is driven by our remarkable ability to carefully measure and divide units of time. In a reasonable sense, the invention of clocks has had a greater effect on our lives than the invention of wheels. You can invent wheels relatively easily, if you live where trees fall over."
Bill Nye,"Humor is everywhere, in that there's irony in just about anything a human does."
