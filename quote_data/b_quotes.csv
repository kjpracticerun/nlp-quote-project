Mike Babcock,"He's a huge talent, and so far I've been very impressed with him. After spending 13 years in Detroit, it's going to take him awhile to get used to what we do, and for us to get used to what he does. We're not trying to change him, but we want him to play within the scheme we play. He's very explosive, very talented and seems very conscientious. He's more in the monitoring stage of observing what we're doing, but once he catches on a little more, then he'll be at the front."
Mike Babcock,We watched in on the replay a bunch of times. It doesn't look like that big a deal. ... I'll sleep easy tonight and we'll have a report tomorrow. He'll be fine.

Mike Babcock,"That's quite a statement. I just think when you make general statements when you don't know, you're probably not doing yourself any favors."
Mike Babcock,"We need to reestablish our work ethic and get back the fire we need to win games. As far as I'm concerned, the playoff race starts Oct. 8 in Dallas. You can't make the playoffs in the first 20 games, but you can be out of it after 20 games. So for me, it's all about establishing that work ethic again in a hurry. I just keep telling the guys that, too -- so much that they think the record is stuck."

Mike Babcock,There's adversity; what are you going to do with it? Are you going to turn it into a positive ?

You score when your coach is confident enough to put you out there enough to let you score. The bottom line is all he has to do is be a little responsible. I'm not asking him to check the No. 1 center in the league. If he sits in his end even a little bit, he'll be OK."

Erykah Badu,But now I realize that this record business really needs me. No one else is trying to take a chance or do something different.
Erykah Badu,"As Erykah Badu, it has nothing to do with me, the way I look, my hair wrap, my style, it's about you and what you feel for my music. If I can make you feel like the way that people who influenced me made me feel, that's completion."
Erykah Badu,Anything that had to do with art I been doing all my life. It was a gift. It's nothing I work real hard at doing.
Erykah Badu,"And I figured out that the reason I couldn't get through the day as well as I can now is because I had too many things on my mind, on my plate, you know, for one person to have. So I started to eliminate some of the things that were too heavy to carry and unnecessary."

Larry Baer,"Just like the baseball team, we feel it's important for the ballpark to get re-engineered, for the ballpark to take on a different look and continue to remain fresh."
Larry Baer,"The team's slightly re-engineered. There are some familiar faces, some new faces. Just like a baseball team, we feel the ballpark should be re-engineered and refreshed. We've spent a lot of time and a lot of effort to keep it highly desirable for the fans. When this ballpark is 30 years old it will still look young."
Larry Baer,Our partnership enabled us to create what we believe has become the best ballpark in America and a popular San Francisco landmark. Our fans can continue to expect the same type of exciting and contending Giants baseball and quality customer service they have enjoyed ever since we opened the park.

Bob Baffert,"This horse, and the rest of the horses, helped keep Bob going in his fight. For Beverly and Jeff, Point Determined has helped them get through a tough time. The kids lost a dad, Beverly lost a husband. It was a tough day when he died, so it was really neat when this horse won."

Walter Bagehot,We must not let daylight in upon the magic.
Walter Bagehot,The reason that there are so few good books written is that so few people who write know anything.

Walter Bagehot,"A schoolmaster should have an atmosphere of awe, and walk wonderingly, as if he was amazed at being himself."
Walter Bagehot,"The best reason why Monarchy is a strong government is, that it is an intelligible government. The mass of mankind understand it, and they hardly anywhere in the world understand any other."
Walter Bagehot,"An influential member of parliament has not only to pay much money to become such, and to give time and labour, he has also to sacrifice his mind too - at least all the characteristics part of it that which is original and most his own."
Walter Bagehot,Poverty is an anomaly to rich people; it is very difficult to make out why people who want dinner do not ring the bell.
Walter Bagehot,"Public opinion is a permeating influence, and it exacts obedience to itself; it requires us to drink other men's thoughts, to speak other men's words, to follow other men's habits."
Walter Bagehot,"The best history is but like the art of Rembrandt; it casts a vivid light on certain selected causes, on those which were best and greatest; it leaves all the rest in shadow and unseen."
Walter Bagehot,An ambassador is not simply an agent; he is also a spectacle.
Walter Bagehot,The habit of common and continuous speech is a symptom of mental deficiency. It proceeds from not knowing what is going on in other people's minds.

Walter Bagehot,"What impresses men is not mind, but the result of mind."
Walter Bagehot,"Dullness in matters of government is a good sign, and not a bad one - in particular, dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence, an indication of its success."
Walter Bagehot,"Conquest is the missionary of valor, and the hard impact of military virtues beats meanness out of the world."
Walter Bagehot,"The beginning of civilization is marked by an intense legality; that legality is the very condition of its existence, the bond which ties it together; but that legality - that tendency to impose a settled customary yoke upon all men and all actions -"

Walter Bagehot,The reason why so few good books are written is that so few people who can write know anything
Walter Bagehot,I started out by believing God for a newer car than the one I was driving. I started out believing God for a nicer apartment than I had. Then I moved up.
Walter Bagehot,"So long as there are earnest believers in the world, they will always wish to punish opinions, even if their judgment tells them it is unwise and their conscience that it is wrong"
Walter Bagehot,"Open-mindedness should not be fostered because, as Scripture teaches, Truth is great and will prevail, nor because, as Milton suggests, Truth will always win in a free and open encounter. It should be fostered for its own sake."
Walter Bagehot,"He believes, with all his heart and soul and strength, that there is such a thing as truth; he has the soul of a martyr with the intellect of an advocate."
Marcos Baghdatis,To have the crowd support -- it's incredible.
Marcos Baghdatis,"I believe it, my coach believe it, the guys I work with believe, my parents believe it. I have worked for that ... I'm very proud of myself ... it's been amazing."
Marcos Baghdatis,"I don't really know what it is yet. Maybe the nerve is squeezed. I just felt pain coming down through my leg. Maybe fatigue has something to do with it. Since Australia I've been playing all the time, working hard. I haven't wanted to stop."
Marcos Baghdatis,"Because a lot of sacrifices she did, and that's the one person I love the most."
Marcos Baghdatis,It's a dream come true. It's just amazing. I love everybody watching in Cyprus. Kisses.
Marcos Baghdatis,This in one of the best matches of my life. I'm in my own world and playing great tennis. Having this crowd with me is just amazing.
Marcos Baghdatis,I think it's one of my best matches in my life. I'm just in my own world and playing my best tennis and having the crowd here supporting me is great.
Marcos Baghdatis,I am very touched. I am very happy.
Marcos Baghdatis,To beat Andy in Rod Laver Arena in front of I don't know how many people ... it's a big experience.
Marcos Baghdatis,It's just been great playing in front of them. It's an amazing atmosphere ... there is so many emotions.
Marcos Baghdatis,"I started thinking a lot, having doubts in my head. He started serving well, got some confidence. It was going so fast, I couldn't control the game."
Marcos Baghdatis,I believe I should do the army and serve my country. I just need some peace of mind for a few years until my career is finished.
Cameron Bagrie,"He doesn't want to see lightening strike twice, and risk giving the housing market another wind."
Cameron Bagrie,The economy is far from being on the ropes.
Cameron Bagrie,"When it goes, it is going to go a country mile pretty quickly."
Jeff Bagwell,"For so long, it's been, 'OK, he's playing first base. Don't even worry about him in spring training. But it's a different story now, and I fully understand that. That part has been a little weird for me, but that's the way it is right now."
Jeff Bagwell,"Oh trust me, there are plenty of thoughts like that. You're not human if you don't get frustrated and wonder, 'Is it worth doing this?' But I still know I can do some things that are very positive. Am I going to be the same player I was in the '90s and 2000? Probably not. I don't know if I can ever be that player again."
Jeff Bagwell,"I'll be more than willing, ... Adrenaline will take a lot of pain out of my shoulder."
Jeff Bagwell,"He didn?t look real good last night. Of course, there were probably a lot of things going through his mind."
Jeff Bagwell,I want him on the mound tomorrow night. He's one of the main reasons why we're here. Things happen every once in a while. I'm sure it's going to be the last time you see that.
Jeff Bagwell,I can't just go away. That's not in my nature.
Jeff Bagwell,"It takes both sides, players and management, working very hard to make that happen."
Jeff Bagwell,"It's amazing, right down to both being hurt. I understand what he's going through, because I've gone through a lot of the same things. You don't really feel a part of it."
Jeff Bagwell,"Craig Biggio, ladies and gentlemen,"
Jeff Bagwell,You don't want everyone to think you're soft or that it's an excuse. It's tough on younger players.
Jeff Bagwell,"I told Phil I don't want this to be a charity case or sentimental pick. That's not what Phil is about. He's a standup guy and he's going to be honest with me. This is what he wanted. He wanted me to be here and he wanted me to get an opportunity to play, because he thinks I can do something."
Jeff Bagwell,He?s just a special individual. Sometimes your will can go a lot farther than your body. The legend grows every day for him. I just think this could be another special time.
Jeff Bagwell,"Oh, yeah, he made those great plays. What would have been if those balls got through?"
Jeff Bagwell,"You have to be an athlete,"
Bob Bailey,"Today's competitive grocery retail environment has driven retailers to utilize technology as a key customer service advantage for their shoppers, ... Giant understands that their customers lead busy lives and they want to make it easier and more convenient to shop in their stores."

Bob Bailey,"Once the race gets going, the cars get going and things come loose on the car."
Champ Bailey,I think we're tough when we do things like that. We were responding to some things they like to do. We're active.
Champ Bailey,"That's not true at all. The value has risen. Think about it. If you can't mug a guy down the field, isn't it more valuable to have the speed and coverage skills to stay with him?"
Champ Bailey,"It's OK, the rules apply for both teams. If they're going to do that, though, they should bring four corners over here (per team) instead of three."
Champ Bailey,"I prepare myself to play every week, regardless of the pain or whatever, ... I don't prepare for the week after. What's in front of me is what I've got."
Champ Bailey,My mind-set is taking it one day at a time. That's all I can do.
Champ Bailey,"I'm doing my job, doing it well. I'm going to keep doing it, and I'm going to talk about it."
Champ Bailey,They're playing a little different. They're not playing as hard.
Champ Bailey,It's just an unfortunate series of events.
Champ Bailey,"It changed the emotion, it changed the momentum,"
Champ Bailey,Speed can make up for a lot of things. And those boys can all run. You can't substitute that.
Chris Bailey,I have never been over fond of scenes anywhere.
Chris Bailey,"Lots of people I know have bootlegged tapes of performances and if they play it I will be transported back sometimes with happiness, sometimes with horror."
Chris Bailey,I find it odd at 47 that I can go to festivals and be in the company of groups that are much younger and we are playing a not-dissimilar set.
Chris Bailey,I always liked the intensity of the recording.
Chris Bailey,"I am very proud of The Saints and I'm very glad that I've been associated with them all these years, but the next record is the best record... has to be the philosophy for any band that remains even halfway decent or vibrant, and that is kind of where my head's at."
Chris Bailey,For a time that you couldn't get a gig if you didn't look a certain way.
Chris Bailey,"I was listening to the first record the other day, and it sounds remarkably contemporary."
John Bailey,"This is the best staff I've ever worked with. It's such an extraordinary organization, what it's done in the past and what it can do in the future. I feel lucky and proud to be a part of it."
John Bailey,My instinct is that it is deeply learned sitting at the table listening to one's parents. Police are there to be avoided.
John Bailey,It's really a compendium of Monterey history.
John Bailey,He was a great storyteller. History becomes what the storyteller says. We'd always call it
John Bailey,"[One account, in J. Henry Cartland's] Ten Years at Pemaquid, ... came over to this country with the view of settling here, but left his wife in the old country, until he could first make himself a little acquainted with the new country, and provide a suitable place for his family. Though he escaped from the wreck unhurt, his mind was deeply affected by his narrow escape, and he wrote to his wife such a doleful account of the storm and shipwreck that she never could be persuaded to undertake the voyage, even to join her husband. And he was too timid to risk himself again on the stormy Atlantic, they remained separated the rest of their lives."
Liberty Bailey,"We are now devoting ourselves to science. I am afraid some of us feel that science will give us final solutions - better bases for philosophy, an ideal groundwork for satisfactions, for enjoyment. But it is doubtful whether the mind of man can ever understand the universe. For every puzzle that we uncover and solve, two more appear that were hidden."
Liberty Bailey,"Is there any progress in horticulture? If not, it is dead, uninspiring. We cannot live in the past, good as it is; we must draw our inspiration from the future."
Liberty Bailey,"The name of the subject is not fundamentally important. All subjects may be made the means of developing a man. What we call culture is not the result of a line of study, so much as the result of association with educated and sensitive persons. A well educated mind has a broad outlook. It develops beyond the specialist to the philosopher... We are learning that no subjects are unclean."
Liberty Bailey,Fact is not to be worshipped. The life which is devoid of imagination is dead; it is tied to the earth. There need be no divorce of fact and fancy; they are only the poles of experience. What is called the scientific method is only imagination set within bounds. Facts are bridged by imagination. They are tied together by the thread of speculation. The very essence of science is to reason from the known to the unknown.
Liberty Bailey,Oneâ€™s happiness depends less on what he knows than on what he feels.
Liberty Bailey,"The sense of conquest is in it. Not often is a collector able to obtain complete material in one assault. The plant may be at the moment sterile, or only in fruit or flower... but this lack has the advantage of stimulating the collector to go back in another season or year to complete the work."
Liberty Bailey,"Even though the college man raises no more wheat than his neighbor, he will have more satisfaction raising it. He will know why he turns the clod; he will challenge the worm that burrows in the furrow; his eyes will follow the field mouse that scuds under the grass; he will see the wild fowl winging its way across the heaven. All these things will add to the meaning of life and they are his."
Liberty Bailey,"There are two essential epochs in any enterprise - to begin, and to get done."
Liberty Bailey,No beast has ever conquered the earth; and the natural world has never been conquered by muscular force.
Liberty Bailey,"We accept it because we have seen the vision. We know that we cannot reap the harvest, but we hope that we may so well prepare the land and so diligently sow the seed that our successors may gather the ripened grain."
Liberty Bailey,When the traveler goes alone he gets acquainted with himself.
Liberty Bailey,"I do not yet know why plants come out of the land or float in streams, or creep on rocks or roll from the sea. I am entranced by the mystery of them, and absorbed by their variety and kinds. Everywhere they are visible yet everywhere occult."
Liberty Bailey,A garden requires patient labor and attention. Plants do not grow merely to satisfy ambitions or to fulfill good intentions. They thrive because someone expended effort on them.
Liberty Bailey,"My life has been a continuous fulfillment of dreams. It appears that everything I saw and did has a new, and perhaps, more significant meaning, every time I see it. The earth is good. It is a privilege to live thereon."
Liberty Bailey,There is no excellence without labor. One cannot dream oneself into either usefulness or happiness.
Liberty Bailey,Every decade needs its own manual of handicraft.
Liberty Bailey,Give the children an opportunity to make garden. Let them grow what they will. It matters less that they grow good plants than that they try for themselves.
Liberty Bailey,Anyone who acquires more than the usual amount of knowledge concerning a subject is bound to leave it as his contribution to the knowledge of the world.
Liberty Bailey,"A person cannot love a plant after he has pruned it, then he has either done a poor job or is devoid of emotion."
Liberty Bailey,"Extension work is not exhortation. Nor is it exploitation of the people, or advertising of an institution, or publicity work for securing students. It is a plain, earnest, and continuous effort to meet the needs of the people on their own farms and in the localities."
Robert Bailey,"There was definitely physical violence,"
Robert Bailey,Expatriates often have to learn to live with a different amount of space than they were accustomed to. It is just part of the experience of being an expatriate.
Robert Bailey,We don't like to go to bed early.
Scott Bailey,"After realizing that some of our biggest spikes in site traffic were immediately following the race, we, along with Jack Daniels, launched the call-in show and are absolutely pleased with last season's success."
Scott Bailey,"He has added power to his game and he's able to elude tackles. He gives what I call a limp leg where they hit his right leg, but he slides out of the tackle and moves on down the field. He went up the middle against Westwood several times. It's no secret what we do is power football, but he takes to the middle and breaks to the outside, which allows him to use his quickness."
Scott Bailey,"The number of jobs isn't where it was before the recession. It's about 2,000 jobs below the peak."
Scott Bailey,"There are probably a lot of people who dropped out of the labor force and so don't get factored into the employment rate. Just looking at the job growth, it's one of the best numbers the county has had in a couple of years, but there is still a long ways to go."
Scott Bailey,"There is such a thing as reverse culture shock. I didn't realized that while I was away I had changed, and so had other people."
Steve Bailey,"The maps are delivered at sub-second speed and are easy to read, which is a real value add-on for our customers as they go about their busy, day-to-day lives."
Steve Bailey,"The issue is personal responsibility. There's no instant answer. We don't have a warehouse here in Pierce County with 100 cops and 100 firefighters sitting around playing cards, waiting for a disaster. If it's a wide enough spread disaster, the big one, we're gonna have problems getting to people right away."
Steve Bailey,"This represents a significant improvement over conventional heating appliances and grid-supplied electric power, and will ultimately provide consumers with a savings in their utility bills."
Steve Bailey,"Pierce Transit has been very proactive and very aggressive in their disaster planning. They work closely with our emergency management plan and public safety plan. When we request their help, there's never a question."
Steve Bailey,"He made evident that a jazz pianist can translate to popular culture. He wrote the theme to the TV show 'Taxi,' that's him playing the piano at the beginning."
Steve Bailey,"He has a reputation of always surrounding himself with world-class musicians. Even if you don't play piano, no matter what instrument you play, there will be a bunch of world-class musicians on stage."
Steve Bailey,Safety and loss helps prevent indirect costs of training temporary employees and clerical work because 80 percent of accidents are caused by unsafe acts.
Maria Bain,"This medication is not for everybody - it should be reserved for those who have first exhausted other methods for management of constipation, such as increased fiber and fluid intake, and regular exercise). I would also underscore the FDA's statement that this medication should not be used by people whose constipation is caused by other medications and diseases."
Maria Bain,Health care professionals and the general public should become more aware of the viral resistance trend and be cautious when prescribing and consuming antiviral medications.
Maria Bain,"For example, the prevalence of migraines is similar in boys and girls before puberty, but later the prevalence is about three times higher in women than men."
Maria Bain,The idea of using COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of other forms of cancer is now being tested on animals.
Oksana Baiul,Professional competitions are overrated.
Oksana Baiul,People really do spend a lot of money on their pets - sometimes more then themselves.
Oksana Baiul,"Pairs skating and singles are two different things. Although some skaters have achieved this successfully, it is a very difficult transition. You're looking at double work."
Oksana Baiul,"Olympic Gold changed me and my life dramatically. I became a celebrity overnight and people see me as a famous skater, not a real person."
Oksana Baiul,"Now, I don't make decisions as fast as I used to."
Oksana Baiul,"No, I'm not coaching. It's a huge responsibility to coach somebody."
Oksana Baiul,"My weaknesses are my jumps. The reason is that although I land them in practice, when I actually compete or perform, I should let my body go and stabilize my mind better. Also, I need to work on not letting negative thoughts and emotions get to me on the ice."
Oksana Baiul,"If you want to compete, you must find a coach that will be there for you 24/7 and that will challenge you in order to take you to a higher level."
Oksana Baiul,I'd like to consider myself a versatile skater and I like to skate to different kinds of music.
Oksana Baiul,"I wish I could say it's easy, but honestly, to get ready for a big championship is not as easy as it seems."
Oksana Baiul,"I wish I could compete again, but my good feeling is, these competitions are better as exhibitions."
Oksana Baiul,I will try to make a doll of Oksana with a little dog.
Oksana Baiul,I want kids to enjoy skating and I think it's a great workout.
Oksana Baiul,I use Graf Edmonton for boots and John Wilson blades.
Oksana Baiul,"I took some time off to enjoy my life, but figure skating is something I love and something I will continue doing for the rest of my life."
Oksana Baiul,I started taking ballet lessons when I was three and a half and I still take dance classes.
Oksana Baiul,I skate now for fun and to keep myself in shape.
Oksana Baiul,"I like to listen to different kinds of music - it just depends on my mood. I love Madonna, Russian singers... I like the Rolling Stones a lot!"
Oksana Baiul,"I have a lot of different stages in my life when training has been easy or hard. Now, it seems that I have been training for so long that it has become almost second nature to me."
Oksana Baiul,I don't care what the critics say or think because I care for and love my fans.
Oksana Baiul,I come to Fashion Week events in New York City twice a year.
Oksana Baiul,"First, I have to thank God for giving me the gift that he did as well as a second chance for a better life."
Oksana Baiul,And still I'm not completely happy with my skating. I always feel I can do more and climb higher.
Oksana Baiul,"Also, I gained lots of weight between ages 18-20 because I was drinking alcohol at night. Alcohol has lots of calories and that does not help."
Oksana Baiul,Actually I dance really well on the floor.
Oksana Baiul,"One of my favorite vacation places is Miami, because of the people, the water and the beach - of course - and the architecture on Miami Beach is so wonderful."
Anita Baker,"My kids' eyes always light up -- 'Why are these people screaming over my mother?' ... People around Detroit have made me cry, just walking up to me in the supermarket to say, 'It's good to have you back.' It's been beautiful. Just absolutely beautiful."
Anita Baker,"I would say that my peak was making my first million at the ripe age of 29, after the first album."
Anita Baker,"I don't let people use me. That's why I like a small number of people in my life. The more people in my life, the more complex it becomes, so I just try to keep it at a minimum."
Anita Baker,"Applause felt like approval, and it became a drug that soothed the pain, but only temporarily."
Anita Baker,"Long tresses down to the floor can be beautiful, if you have that, but learn to love what you have."
Anita Baker,"I'm picking and choosing in terms of the stress factor. If it's not fun, I'm not going to do it."
Anita Baker,"Completeness? Happiness? These words don't come close to describing my emotions. There truly is nothing I can say to capture what motherhood means to me, particularly given my medical history."
Anita Baker,"You leave home to seek your fortune and, when you get it, you go home and share it with your family."
Brian Baker,Clearly they recognize that content security is an incredibly valuable and necessary component in that video offering.
Brian Baker,"I thought last game certainly was his best performance, especially in terms of pass rush. I think he's still learning the league, obviously. Heck, I'll be saying that until midseason probably, maybe even the end of the season. But I think his conditioning is getting a little better; he's getting in a little more football shape."
Brian Baker,The success of all of our kids is paramount. ... We can't just lock up everyone. The stakes are high.
Brian Baker,"The only consistent quote was that it brought peace to the house. Parents argue with their kids about media all the time, almost daily. After using Bob for one or two days, the kids accept that 'this is Mum and Dad's rule, and we can't do anything about it'. It becomes a non-issue."
Brian Baker,This is very fun for us.
Brian Baker,Our defense has always been what's helped us turn things around throughout the year.
Brian Baker,"I believe this is holy ground,"
Bruce Baker,"It's a pleasant atmosphere and easy access, and they love the music. Some of them sing, some of them don't."
Bruce Baker,Both Bill and Shawn have proven track records and will continue to deliver the tradition of excellence that our Atlanta and Orlando viewing audiences expect.
Bruce Baker,"It will really speed up our computer system. It's dramatic, what it will do for us. School computers will be able to talk together."
Bruce Baker,"Given the right circumstances, people who are always late can be on time."
Bruce Baker,He was a banker's banker. He saw banking not just as a business and a profession but as a way to give back.
Buddy Baker,"He was in the plating department and was good worker, a very good worker in a department where work was hard."
Buddy Baker,"If it was a dream, it would be a nightmare. But I know what they're trying to do. They're trying to get back to racing."
Buddy Baker,"He's lined up behind some great receivers. But every time he's had an opportunity, he's done well."
Buddy Baker,Well I don't know which one has more money but I'll tell you what. Either one could burn a wet mule with hundred dollar bills.
David Baker,"It's been a while since I've won a race, ... It's about time."
David Baker,The foot problems were really getting to be worrisome in the old enclosure. I'm confident we've seen the end of that.
David Baker,I can't think of anything else where somebody had a theory and a practice and an institute in their name and that there was a coup going on internally over it. This sounds nasty.
David Baker,I strongly encourage the parents to report any kind of activity they see. I would especially ask them to take a look at what your children are doing on the Internet.
David Baker,"This is a way that people from all backgrounds can now make important contributions to progress in science and medicine. Rosetta@home seeks to solve one of the longest standing problems in molecular biology, with important implications for human health and the treatment of disease."
David Baker,"by lifting road blocks and increasing freedom of movement, and the terrorists have exploited these humanitarian measures."
David Baker,"Evangelicals, through their own scholarship as well as the support and encouragement of such bodies as Tyndale Fellowship, the John Wesley Fellowship and, to a lesser extent, the Institute for Biblical Research, have been able to secure positions in academic institutions beyond those traditionally regarded as evangelical. This includes folks teaching at major public and private universities."
David Baker,"I know sometimes Tim and I are put in an adverse position if and when I have to discipline him, but I will also say when my son (Sam, who played for Southern Cal) made the Associated Press All-American team, the first call congratulating me as a dad was from Tim Marcum. So, I respect him as a competitor. I think he has done as much as anyone to bring this league to the point it is today."
David Baker,We have been left with no other choice.
David Baker,"They're just apprehensive about 'the new,' ... They're very intelligent animals. They're creatures of habit just like we are."
David Baker,"They're very, very cautious animals."
David Baker,"Much more than America, much more than Europe, China really does look at the very, very long-term view,"
David Baker,"The Chinese should be very proud of what they are accomplishing,"
Dean Baker,"The optimistic scenario gives you about 2 million jobs next year -- about 180,000 a month. If I had to make my best bet, I'd say we'll have level home prices and growth of about 1.5 percent for the year. There'll be job creation of about 80,000 or 90,000 a month."
Dean Baker,I think their intention is to get people who are loyal and that does raise problems. It's clear that they're looking at this as a sales position.
Dean Baker,"People are willing to pay them because there is an expectation that prices will continue to rise. Once people don't have that expectation, things will change."
Dean Baker,"It's just prudent to have a chemical safety program, ... We don't want to have a sterile leaning environment, we want kids to have a rich learning environment while keeping them safe, that's the same issue every school faces."
Dean Baker,"[Consumer prices are likely to catch up eventually, say economists.] I'm not a big inflation hawk, ... but consumers are almost certainly going to be paying more."
Dusty Baker,It was a great game for TV.
Dusty Baker,"Woody is a competitor. He wanted to go out on a positive note for next year. He couldn't wait to get out there, and I was anxious to see him out there. In the winter, what you remember is how you finish."
Dusty Baker,He started out not very sharp and he had 37 pitches in the first inning. That's almost three innings worth and we were debating whether or not to send him out in the seventh or not but he wanted to pitch and he ended the game strong.
Dusty Baker,I'm hoping we don't need him. We'll worry about Wednesday when we get there.
Dusty Baker,"We wanted him to get that victory, but we needed it badly. He didn't get it, but he gave it to us."
Dusty Baker,It was a great comeback victory after we gave them those two runs. 'Z' pitched outstanding. Our bullpen did a great job.
Dusty Baker,"Boy, that was a great comeback victory especially after we kind of gave it to them in the (sixth) inning with those two runs."
Dusty Baker,He wanted the victory and knew we needed it. His fastball was moving.
Dusty Baker,"We were trying everything to get him his victory. It was a great run by Greg. The guys wanted to win for him, and we left him in in the ninth to have that opportunity."
Dusty Baker,"It seems like we have trouble keeping them in the ballpark. If we could keep them in the ballpark, it'd be different."
Dusty Baker,"He's going to hit. You don't usually stop hitting, and if you do, then somebody's in trouble, because a lot of hits are coming."
Dusty Baker,Big Z had trouble feeling the ball. He couldn't feel it in his fingers. We were hoping to get five innings out of Z and then go to the bullpen.
Dusty Baker,"We had Roger in trouble a couple of times, but we managed only one run. Roger knows how to pitch, and he knows how to win."
Dusty Baker,"I know there's a lot of [trade] speculation, but you have to handle it as if everyone here is going to be here. You don't know what's going to happen exactly."
Dusty Baker,There's a bunch of talent that's left there.
Dusty Baker,It was filled with ups and downs and a constant struggle. There was never a point where you felt you were in control for a long extended period of time.
Dusty Baker,He hasn't been quite Michael since spring training. We wanted him to go get his arm strength back. We are going to need him before the year is over.
Dusty Baker,"A lot of it depends on the strength of your starting pitching. If your starting pitching is good, you won't need 12 too much. Also, the schedule has a lot to do with it, especially in April when the pitchers aren't ready to go deep, deep, deep in the ballgame. You don't even know at that time if you'll need five starters. You might only need four. You hate to lose that guy's endurance by not pitching. It'll work itself out by the time we get ready to leave."
Dusty Baker,His doctor said it would be better if he continued to throw until the surgery to keep his arm strength going.
Dusty Baker,"We all feel responsible. Sometimes the players have to take some of the responsibility, too. It's the responsibility of all of us, coaches, players, everybody."
Dusty Baker,"Everybody talks about a fresh start, but it seems like whatever reputation you have follows you to the next job, the next place, which really isn't a fresh start. I certainly don't condone the things that have happened and transpired in the past but everybody deserves a fresh start."
Dusty Baker,It's a great problem to have [too many]. You can never have enough quality arms. You never know when somebody else might want one of your surplus arms. That could help your team out. Everybody is looking for good arms.
Dusty Baker,"There's progress. He's going to try to push it a little bit this week to find out exactly where he is. Hopefully, he'll be on the field doing some fielding and throwing. He's doing some light running. The running part is the difficult part. He's working around the clock."
Dusty Baker,You don't know what could transpire. You might need both of them. Some of it depends on the progress and health of the other guys.
Dusty Baker,"The problems starts when he throws a number of pitches. As long as we minimize his pitches, he says he feels great."
Dusty Baker,"[Fundamentals] are a part of the game that I take pride in, and that's what disgruntled me so much was to see a team of mine not fundamentally sound. That was a first. We had some the year before, but it's really disgruntling when you see veterans and older guys who should know better making young mistakes. You can take it from the young guys, but it's hard to take from veterans."
Dusty Baker,We couldn't get the ball down today. The ball was up and the location wasn't where he wanted it. Power hitters -- when you get the ball up and over the heart of the plate -- you're going to get hurt.
Dusty Baker,"They police themselves, but they don't police themselves the way we used to police ourselves."
Dusty Baker,[Prior] said he's feeling better. He had his physical therapist here and wasn't feeling the pain that he was feeling before.
Dusty Baker,Mark has a physical therapist here. He said he's not feeling the pain in his shoulder that he felt before.
Dusty Baker,That's something I just deleted from my memory. Ninety-six was a bad year.
Dusty Baker,"I had to talk to one of my players, because we needed some luck. I talked to the luckiest guy I know on Earth --Kirk 'Woody' Rueter. I called Woody and said, 'Woody, I need some of the Woody luck.' He said he sent it to us."
Dusty Baker,He's healthy. Sometimes he's not swinging well and other times he runs into some hard luck. It's a combination. I can see him getting frustrated. He needs one or two days and he'll get rolling.
Dusty Baker,"It embarrassed me into learning how to get the signs,"
Dusty Baker,"When I look at my score sheet and I look at theirs, I'm kind of outmanned, ... I've never been in that situation in September. It's just one of those years, I guess."
Dusty Baker,"When I look at my score sheet and I look at theirs, I'm kind of outmanned. I've never been in that situation in September. It's just one of those years, I guess."
Dusty Baker,"This is judgement time for who is going to be here and who's going to be playing next year, too,"
Dusty Baker,It's not over with yet. You don't know if somebody is going to offer Sammy a job here soon or what is going to happen. But Sammy has been one of the great players of the game for a long time and a guy who meant a lot to Chicago and a lot to the game. . . . I just hope he gets a job somewhere.
Dusty Baker,"He is making progress. He hit on the field so that's a big improvement right there, so will keep our fingers crossed."
Dusty Baker,You never see anyone lose two guys on one play. But nobody cares if Lee's hurt or not except us and the people in Chicago and the people who know him. We'll just have to adjust and just keep on adjusting.
Dusty Baker,"It's more of an honor system. I'd be the first one to admit it. But if they're young and they're drinking, they're done anyway. You can tell."
Dusty Baker,You hate to see it end in a tie.
Dusty Baker,It's nice to have him on our side. We used to hate for him to come up and hate for him to get on base [when he played for Colorado and Florida]. The thing about it is he works on his skills. He's one of the first guys here in the morning and one of the last guys to go in the evening. He's here almost beating the coaches. He comes to work on his bunting or lift or stretch or early hitting or something.
Dusty Baker,"You spend this many days with the guys here. You live and die with them. You hate to see them go. To the best of my knowledge right now, nobody is leaving unless somebody just makes you an offer you can't refuse. Right now, they're here."
Dusty Baker,"You hate to have a guy have back problems, then he starts changing his arm angle and compensating for it and you end up hurting something else. His teammates, they really convinced me he had had enough."
Dusty Baker,It was hard real hard. Rem was great about it. He's a real pro.
Dusty Baker,"It's better [to have the surgery] now than later. He's been working out real hard all winter on his lower half. It shouldn't set him back too far. He's still going to be able to throw. He threw a heck of a side today, they tell me."
Dusty Baker,"He's the guy who's doing it the most correctly. That's why he has Gold Gloves. To me, and he may not like it, but I point to him all the time as the way to be. It's not his personality to accept that, but I single him out, which I don't do that often. I say, 'Hey, this is how you want to go about your business. This is how you want to perform. This is how you want to work on fielding, hitting, bunting, everything."
Dusty Baker,"He didn't want to come out of the game. He said he was OK, but they all say they're OK. I don't know how he is, we'll talk to the doctors and go from there."
Dusty Baker,"It's the same with pitching. You talk to Greg Maddux and I'm sure he has a game plan, but he also sometimes can feel when a guy is looking inside or if a guy is looking for something else or it depends on which pitch he takes and how he takes it. Some guys get it early, some guys get it late, some guys never get it."
Dusty Baker,"He doesn't fool around out there, does he? He gets the ball and throws it. This guy learned how to put different pressure points on the ball to make the ball move. This guy is the best I've ever seen."
Dusty Baker,Well being a manager is sort of like being a father. I was always held to be responsible because I was the oldest of five. No matter what happened in my family I was always in charge and always at fault. Being a manger is like being a father where your dad is the ultimate last word and disciplinarian.
Dusty Baker,"You always want your players to get something, especially a guy of his magnitude and his determination and with his competitive nature. He's earned it, he's deserved a shot and an opportunity, which is why I didn't take him out of that game [Saturday]."
Dusty Baker,"What he gave me was a consciousness on how to do it,"
Dusty Baker,"Maybe I shouldn't have cursed. I had just given him the highest compliment last week when I said he's one of the pitchers I respect most in the league, because he doesn't clown, he doesn't showboat. He just pitches."
Dusty Baker,"It's just the last few days that he's been complaining that he can't run. Hopefully, it won't be too long. It doesn't appear too serious."
Dusty Baker,"Competition sometimes will make you sharper than you believe you are. Anybody who watched those games, you could tell it was serious competition."
Dusty Baker,We've got to get our bullpen shored up and do what we can until we get our big boys back.
Dusty Baker,"We've got to do what we can until the big boys get back with our starting pitching. Hopefully, we'll do better when we get home."
Dusty Baker,"I think that's wrong because that way you're placing blame on one department,"
Dusty Baker,"It's a situation where [his emotions] are his best friend and also could be his nemesis at the same time. This is what drives him and motivates him. On the other hand, it's destructive, not only to him but possibly to a teammate at some time."
Dusty Baker,"Just because you can hit, doesn't mean you know how to play winning baseball, ... That's what I'm trying to instill here, and it's not easy to do in the short time I've been here."
Dusty Baker,I've heard it's a greater problem in high school with young kids. Baseball is attempting to clean it up by testing. That's where it starts. It appears to be cleaner now than a couple years ago because of the testing.
Dusty Baker,I just hope my army is sharp.
Dusty Baker,So I let them be responsible for there particular areas. Then by the time it gets to me that means that there is a problem. I have my eyes open and I need to know something about every department but you don't want to micro manage any particular department.
Dusty Baker,"Everyone has a budget, I don't care who you are. But they said if we are in a pennant race in the middle of the summer they are going to get some help with added payroll."
Dusty Baker,"Let them police themselves, and then it goes another step past them to my coaches and there a coach that is responsible for a different area and different category on the field."
Dusty Baker,Now with as much parity as there is now if you gain a couple of key players and remain healthy you can go from worst to first now.
Dusty Baker,You can tell your uncle stuff that you could not tell your dad. That is kind of the role of an uncle. I feel very much like a father sometimes but sometimes I feel like a teammate.
Dusty Baker,I think we match up with anybody because our pitching. In a short series you run your big three out there or four out there. That generally is what wins a series - pitching and defense. If we can catch the ball and not give away any runs like we do sometimes.
Dusty Baker,"He's old. You don't see too many guys still pitching his age. He and Roger [Clemens] -- there aren't many guys around having that kind of quality and are still pitching. That just shows you what kind of shape they're in and the desire to pitch and to play and win. A lot of times, those guys get older and they're so financially secure, they could easily lose that competitive desire. He hasn't lost any."
Dusty Baker,They were struggling before Lee's absence. It'd be different if it just started. They've been struggling while Lee was here.
Dusty Baker,They were struggling before Lee's absence. They were struggling when Lee was here.
Ginger Baker,If I am playing any music at all it is jazz music.
Ginger Baker,"I'd rather play jazz, I hate rock and roll."
Ginger Baker,I think the American government is now the most corrupt government in the world.
Ginger Baker,I have never taken more than two weeks to record an album throughout my career.
Ginger Baker,"I have never had a great love of the music business, I never have."
Howard Baker,"It is not our purpose to second-guess what other agencies are doing or what the department's doing, but rather to make sure that we know the facts as best they can be ascertained, and to make appropriate recommendations to the secretary and to the president on how this can be avoided, how other challenges to national security may be dealt with,"
Howard Baker,"I've never said that before to a living soul, but I felt obliged to say it to you now,"
Howard Baker,"It certainly has been [an intense week]. And I must say I had no expectation that we would hit the ground running, as we say in America - that things would be so intense so fast."
Howard Baker,"The welfare of the planet and its environment is paramount. But what we do, and do equally and evenhandedly, is more difficult to identify. I have no doubt in mind that President Bush is serious in his determination to reexamine the overall issue and that would include reexamining the language of the Kyoto treaty."
Howard Baker,"I explained the American situation. I promised to pass on the substance of her communication to Washington as soon as possible. I did that. Well, certainly, the issue was difficult and painful. The relationship between Mrs. Tanaka and me and our two governments was difficult, but it was not painful."
Howard Baker,"This man is in terrible shape, ... His health circumstances are really barely short of extreme, and I have no doubt that he's in need of skillful medical attention."
Howard Baker,He is still characterized as a deserter of the U.S. Army. Our government will proceed according to provisions of the law and how that will finally unfold remains to be seen.
Howard Baker,"The most difficult thing in any negotiation, almost, is making sure that you strip it of the emotion and deal with the facts. And there was a considerable challenge to that here and understandably so."
Howard Baker,"I intend to travel to Okinawa and to visit with Okinawa officials and the citizens of Okinawa at an early date. I will send my best analysis of that situation, including the local attitudes, back to Washington, to the government there."
Howard Baker,I think the friendship and mutual admiration between the prime minister and the president will facilitate that.
Jack Baker,"Definitely third quarter earnings should be good, fourth quarter might be a little more of a struggle but again everything is relative. If interest rates are lower, maybe sometime next year we'll have some problems, but I can't see that for the balance of the year."
Jack Baker,"There's going to be nervousness for the next few weeks. From an historical perspective, September tends to be one of the worst months. In addition, you have a lot of people moving off to the sidelines ahead of September 11."
Jack Baker,Joseph Sibley was one of the premier historical figures of the oil region and his influence extended worldwide.
Jack Baker,"I think there is an underlying wave of enthusiasm in the market. The thing that people continue to point to is inflation, but I still do not see it. I don't see a lot of short-term negatives."
Jack Baker,"After the run we've had this week, I think the action today [Friday] is fine."
Jack Baker,I'm not really happy with the volatility. What I am happy with is the market's ability to rally after these sharp declines.
Joe Baker,The work really addressed in a new way what it meant to be Indian: what it really meant to really live in two worlds.
Joe Baker,"From my perspective, knowing what we had to do and how it was supposed to go, I don't see any glitches. Obviously, the clocks and scoreboard were different and the music playing was a bit of a distraction. I'm sure I'll get some e-mails and phone calls tomorrow and I'll talk with the coaches, and if it makes sense to do it again, we'll do it again."
Joe Baker,"[It was the intensity of Italian football which troubled the former Hibs striker most.] It was cruel stuff out there as Italians, at that time, were quite prepared to play without the ball, ... Foreign players - and we were the pioneers - were regarded with deep suspicion. Not only were we kicked up and down the park but regularly spat on as well. When I returned home for the close season, I knew I couldn't go back."
Joe Baker,He's still in competition. And he's made it very interesting.
John Baker,"We're trying to get them centered and focused,"
John Baker,There's a lot of money to be raised.
John Baker,"The Craftsman Collection features an iconic, mission-style design. With Craftsman, we believe we have successfully adapted this classic American form for the new American outdoor room."
John Baker,They're a business accelerator. They take technologies from an idea to commercialization.
Josephine Baker,"The things we truly love stay with us always, locked in our hearts as long as life remains."
Josephine Baker,I believe in prayer. It's the best way we have to draw strength from heaven.
Josephine Baker,"Beautiful? It's all a question of luck. I was born with good legs. As for the rest . . . beautiful, no. Amusing, yes."
Josephine Baker,"It [the Eiffel Tower] looked very different from the Statue of Liberty, but what did that matter? What was the good of having the statue without the liberty?"
Kenny Baker,"Movies have never been that big in my life, I'm always to busy doing other things to find time to go to the movies."
Kenny Baker,I started out Ice skating with Holiday On Ice and just got offered the part of R2 by chance.
Kenny Baker,I skated in ice shows all over Europe and South Africa for 20 years. I love to ice skate.
Kenny Baker,"I've been in show business for 50, no, 60 years. I was approached in school to join a variety act."
Matt Baker,"There's just such a mass of hotels that just want to give the service away for free. When that's what you're competing against, it just gets harder."
Matt Baker,"Mostly they're coming in the passing game, in blitz pickup and protections and check-downs, ... He's got the running game pretty much covered. He's in the right place all the time."
Matt Baker,We talked about it in practice Wednesday. Ronnie isn't going to win the game for the team. He'll probably mean an extra 40 rushing yards. Hopefully we'll play well enough that we won't need those 40 yards.
Matt Baker,"We didn't have a good practice at all yesterday morning,"
Matt Baker,"[Witnesses told police Smith did not appear to be speeding, Baker said. He said charges will not be filed against the driver.] There's nothing to charge him with, ... He wasn't being reckless. He was just distracted."
Matt Baker,Past Carolina teams may have folded when we get down like that. Not this team. No one got down. We just got down to business.
Matt Baker,We didn't have a good practice at all yesterday morning. But we came back last night a little bit and there was definitely a spark there today.
Matt Baker,"you're not going to win games like that, when you go dead for a whole quarter."
Matt Baker,"That's what I've been waiting for, why I stuck around -- to win football games, ... And it's a tough loss, to know it was right there at the end."
Matt Baker,"That's why I stuck around, to go out and win football games. It's a tough loss to know it was right there until the end. You can look at those last two drives, but it comes down on offense to missed assignments, dropped balls and bad throws. We were not very precise today."
Matt Baker,"Some of them were communication problems. We had a lot of holdings. I haven't seen exactly what they all were, but there were too many to win a football game."
Matt Baker,"You can look at those last two drives, but it comes down to ... penalties, dropped balls and bad throws, ... We were not very precise today as an offense."
Rick Baker,"[Emerging from decisive victory, Baker employed the same tactic as Fischer, extending a hand to west St. Petersburg.] It was a very deliberate thing, ... West St. Petersburg is a big, important part of the city."
Rick Baker,"I think you've been on television plenty, Ed,"
Rick Baker,This group will be the strength of the team.
Rick Baker,"I have a responsibility to make sure my citizens are protected. That goes beyond the legal mandate,"
Rick Baker,"You are laughing at our police officers but I'm proud of them,"
Rick Baker,"I grew up in Indianapolis, going to the 500, and I love it. Having this race here is like heaven for me."
Rick Baker,"The first domino is the Texas-OU situation. Anyone involved in college football in the area has to know how important that event is. For our part, we're going to stay right on top of things as they progress. We're really on the sidelines of this whole discussion, though, outside of whatever we can do to help."
Rick Baker,"I had a blood-and-guts period when I was a kid, but I just think that whole splatter movie thing kinda got out of control, and too many people became too desensitized to other people being brutally murdered, you know?"
Rick Baker,"I do what I did as a hobby as a kid, you know, and make a living at it. And I just feel like I'm one of the luckiest guys in the world 'cuz I get paid to make toys and play with them."
Rick Baker,Grinch had so many people in make up - virtually everybody. We had about 100 people a day for five months. And every day we would use 100 sets of appliances.
Rick Baker,"It's always kind of a shock the first time you see a movie that you worked on to see what's really inside the edit. And how much of it, you know?"
Rick Baker,"I have a job that I truly love, and an enormous crew of people that can do things better than I can!"
Robert Baker,"The air in an indoor space does not clean itself, unlike the outdoors, where air travels,"
Robert Baker,Is there any code to cover up for other police officers?
Robert Baker,"In NFL Europe I caught a shake route in front of the offensive line and jumped over two people and they were standing straight up, ... I high-jumped 6-foot-8 in high school, so it's no problem. I don't get excited about stuff I'm supposed to do."
Robert Baker,"In fact, you got in the vehicle that night, didn't you?"
Robert Baker,She was with a lot of men.
Robert Baker,"To me, it's a good business-oriented club."
Robert Baker,It is the defendant's contention that this blood sample is clearly planted.
Robert Baker,The lack of an age-based warning renders the product defective.
Stephen Baker,"You'll see a few times during Christmas time $399 notebooks,"
Stephen Baker,"Everybody is going into this Christmas season with very limited expectations, and anything they can throw at the marketplace to get people to go out and buy is going to be a positive."
Stephen Baker,Would I buy a cell phone for my 12-year-old?... No. I should have closer control over my child than that. He really shouldn't be in places where he needs to contact me by cell.
Stephen Baker,"People didn't stop spending money, they just spent it on things that complement their PCs."
Stephen Baker,"Of all the toys available, none is better designed than the owner himself. A large multipurpose plaything, its parts can be made to move in almost any direction. It comes completely assembled, and it makes a sound when you jump on it."
Stephen Baker,"To bathe a cat takes brute force, perseverance, courage of conviction - and a cat. The last ingredient is usually hardest to come by."
Stephen Baker,This is the year you really put the stake in the ground.
Stephen Baker,Prices came down and aggressive advertising increased.
Stephen Baker,"Plasma prices continue to free-fall as good availability and wide acceptance of the products spur retailers and manufacturers to maximize their sales opportunities,"
Steve Baker,They have been very aggressive about getting share and getting shelf space. We haven't seen a lot from Intel.
Steve Baker,We'll be delivering what's in the lines as soon as we have the power back on.
Steve Baker,We're hard pressed for labor more than for warehouse space. But we're going to be hard pressed for warehouse space.
Steve Baker,"People are excited about it because this really makes sense safety wise, health wise and economically."
Steve Baker,I think that you're giving people an excuse not to do it?and not necessarily a bad one. Some of those lost purchases in the fourth quarter just don't ever come back.
Steve Baker,"[On the Net, as elsewhere, anything that sounds too good to be true probably is.] Consumers should exercise the same amount of caution they would if they saw an ad anywhere else, ... There's nothing special about the Net anymore."
Steve Baker,It represented something that we believed to be a piece of Americana pop culture.
Steve Baker,"I think it was my dad's compensation for having all boys, you know."
Steve Baker,"I think you'll see companies like HP and Compaq diversify their consumer product lines to take advantage of all the digital technologies that are migrating from the consumer electronic side of the business, into the computer side of the business."
Van Baker,"Voice recognition is like handwriting [recognition] in that it's another technology that's always just around the corner. When you speak, it makes a difference if you are tired or energized, if consuming alcohol or not, if upset or feeling good. Your voice changes dramatically under those situations, and that makes it a challenge."
Van Baker,They just changed the rules of the game completely. Rival players are going to look big and clunky by comparison.
Van Baker,It's very important for Apple. It changes the rules of the game.
Van Baker,I fully expect to see more directed at the living room cabinet.
Van Baker,"The Mini is small enough that people will consider adding it to their living room consoles. The transition of bringing the computer into the living room won't happen overnight, but this is a good first step."
Van Baker,It seems like a computer that could finally go into the living room.
Van Baker,"Right now, it's no more than a couple of ideas in his head that still have to be turned into games."
Van Baker,"It's hard to say what he might do; it could be anything,"
Van Baker,"We don't see any reason that this will slow down anytime soon. The transition of entertainment from analog to digital, of time-shifting and place-shifting, is just getting under way."
Van Baker,Cisco wants people in the entertainment and computing industry to understand that they are the way to get something from point A to point B over the Internet.
Van Baker,It's a step in the right direction ... it's another enhancement to the service
Van Baker,"That's the safe choice, because that's what you already know and that's what you've got,"
Jim Bakker,"When we complain, we remain. When we whine, we stay behind. When we praise, we raise."
Jim Bakker,You don't decide to build a church because you have money in the bank. You build because God says this is what I should do. Faith is the supplier of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
Jim Bakker,They've all been through bad things. So bad things happen to people. They happen to all the great men of God.
Jim Bakker,"They put chains on me; they chained my waist, my legs. Put me in the back of a squad car, and I literally blacked out. I didn't even - there's whole pieces missing."
Jim Bakker,"The box got bigger, the outside, the buildings. And all that we were doing. I had to raise about $1 million every two days just to stay alive."
Jim Bakker,"So you can't lose serving God, and that all things work together for good."
Jim Bakker,"My dream became bigger and bigger. And the box got bigger than the message, than the Gospel."
Jim Bakker,"It was dripping and, you know, and there was a whole line of cameras and microphones. I felt like - you remember the honor guards, only it was a dishonor guard."
Jim Bakker,"I write about it in the book and, you know, explain that. But that was the technicality that actually got my sentence reduced - that Alan Dershowitz used to have my sentence - it came down eventually to eight years."
Jim Bakker,I think - there's always going to be a percentage of people who maybe aren't as good as others.
Jim Bakker,"I feel like God has forgiven me of so much, that I will forgive everyone who has hurt us."
Jim Bakker,"I don't think you ever know, until it was over, until the very last. But near the last months, it was getting more and more strenuous."
Jim Bakker,"I don't know, examination I guess. And then they put the jump suit back on me again. I went through the compound - I remember somebody shouting, Jim don't let them break you."
Jim Bakker,"I called the doctor, during writing the book, the psychiatrist who treated me at that time, Dr. Jackson. And I said, Dr. Jackson, whole pieces are missing. I don't understand what happened to me."
Jim Bakker,"God's forgiveness is the only thing. And, well, I take full responsibility for the adultery. It was my fault and, you know, no matter what went on, the man has to take responsibility; and I do."
Jim Bakker,"And God knows I needed to be forgiven. So I had to forgive everybody. And then God - as I read in the word, you're supposed to pray for your enemies. Try that one on."
Jim Bakker,"You know, I try not to look back, because looking forward is so much better than looking backward."
Jim Bakker,"You can't fake it when you're alone with God, you know."
Jim Bakker,"Most of you are so young you don't know who I am, and that's good."
Jim Bakker,"When you put your total faith in God, no matter what happens, to a person who's a true believer, if you die, you know you're going to heaven to be with God."
Jim Bakker,"Why should I apologize because God throws in crystal chandeliers, mahogany floors, and the best construction in the world?"
Jim Bakker,"Oh, I was never a businessman. I was a visionary, a dreamer."
Aburizal Bakrie,"For us, the well-being of the people around the mine area is more important than for us to keep fighting (the civil lawsuit)."
Aburizal Bakrie,"We hope that at the latest, this is resolved by the end of the year."
Aburizal Bakrie,"We have also explained that the government has submitted the new tax bill and customs and excise draft law to the House of Representatives to support law enforcement,"

Anton Balasingham,"It would serve no meaningful purpose if we enter into a recriminatory debate, making accusations and counter-accusations against each other over the abuses of the truce."
Anton Balasingham,The government has agreed to implement a clause in the agreement in relation to the paramilitary groups. This is a good sign.
Anton Balasingham,We are deeply pleased that the government has agreed to the smooth implementation of the cease-fire agreement.
Letitia Baldrige,"She's not going to have any trouble at all,"
Letitia Baldrige,That could happen. But I hope not in my lifetime. I was born dreaming of monarchies. I want to die that way.
Letitia Baldrige,I always believe you have to speak up.
Adam Baldwin,"A lot of the television industry is so cookie-cutter. In general, there are so many shows that are easy and bland to watch. You can tune in at any time and know exactly where you are in the story arc because it's pretty much the same every week."
Adam Baldwin,"We've had a long ride back from a cancellation of a short-lived television series to the release of a major motion picture. I don't know if there's any other story equivalent to that in Hollywood history,"
Adam Baldwin,"I mean, I'm a guy with three kids. I'm home usually Friday nights, but I know most people who aren't like me aren't."
Adam Baldwin,My heroes are the camera crew and the electricians. They work such long hours.
Adam Baldwin,"They're real people. It's a look into the future that's not going to be a perfect utopian future. Joss was able to portray people with flaws, imperfect people, tyrannical people, people who can be both heroic and self-centered."
Adam Baldwin,"Hopefully, young people will read more books, and it will cause them to think a little longer, than just react to pretty pictures."

Alec Baldwin,opening my eyes to animal rights. â€¦ Look at the way [Hurricane] Katrina was handled â€” the way the government treats people and their animals is a tragedy.
Alec Baldwin,I don't get acting jobs because of my looks.
Alec Baldwin,"harvesting our offshore winds to produce pollution-free energy is a forward-looking solution that protects public health, the environment and the region's quality of life."
Alec Baldwin,"Well, actors get very frustrated with giving control to other people. They have their own ideas and wants for their characters. Warren Beatty once told me that he thought actors ended up directing out of frustration. If you have a strong sense of how to communicate a film, you should direct. The problem is that it is a huge commitment. I'd rather direct a play than a film due to the time. A movie can tie you up for a year or more."
Alec Baldwin,You have actors who begin at a certain young age and there's very little change in their technique and the depth of their performances; they're the same 30 years later.
John Baldwin,"He found the ideas that he wanted to use in his novel before either he or his wife had looked at 'The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The story line was very well developed. He had the ideas in place, and decided to use them."
John Baldwin,"We came here to throw the triple axel and make skating history, and that goal was reached. It's our Olympic dream."
John Baldwin,"There's no way we're giving up. It's like our coach says, it's not if you're happy after the short. It's if you're happy after the long."
Robert Baldwin,My organs are too powerful... I manufacture blood and fat too rapidly.
Robert Baldwin,I have a horror of not rising above mediocrity.
Robert Baldwin,My organs are too powerful . . . I manufacture blood and fat too rapidly.
Christian Bale,"But after having done American Psycho and Shaft, I found it a breath of fresh air to play somebody who's completely human in terms of his emotions."
Christian Bale,"And being as I'm somebody who loves movies like The Machinist, I also love going along to big mass entertainment movies. I get in the mood for all kinds of movies, and so I like to try each of them."
Christian Bale,"You're creating a different world and the actor's job is to be able to convince the audience to enter into that world, whether it be actually something that you recognize from your own life or not."
Christian Bale,"When it comes to films, people often don't differentiate between the message of a bad central character and the message of the film itself. They are two separate things."
Christian Bale,"We are starting off with our own different characters and our own laws and everything, looking at Bruce Wayne and how he came to be the person that he was and how he comes to be this man that jumps around in the Bat suit."
Christian Bale,"Obviously there are times with acting when exactly what is required is just going through the motions, and when doing nothing is the best thing. But at other times, you have to make that leap beyond the immediate environment of people putting up lights on the set."
Christian Bale,"No, only disappointment in myself on those occasions I didn't manage to rise to the occasion as I felt I should've done. I can always see how to do it, and then the challenge is, Can I manage that each and every day?"
Christian Bale,My hope is that people will be repulsed by the character's complete lack of ethics and obsession with consumerism - that's what I was saying about the difference between the character's message and the film's message.
Christian Bale,It's the actors who are prepared to make fools of themselves who are usually the ones who come to mean something to the audience.
Christian Bale,It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.
Christian Bale,"It's about pursuing it rather than waiting to see what comes along. That's partly because I found myself getting typecast, as everyone does unless they pursue roles that are very different from what they've done before."
Christian Bale,"I've had some painful experiences in my life, but I feel like I'm trivializing them by using them for a scene in a movie. I don't want to do that. It just makes me feel kind of dirty for having done that."
Christian Bale,"I went backwards and forwards over it until I was 22. And then in the past few years I began to say to myself, OK, look, I'm not messing around. This is something I want to attack, instead of thinking, I'll just see what happens with it."
Christian Bale,"I tend to think you're fearless when you recognize why you should be scared of things, but do them anyway."
Christian Bale,I don't personally look to my own life experiences for answers about how to play a scene.
Christian Bale,"Essentially, I'm untrained, so I just go with my imagination and try to put myself as solidly as I can into the shoes of whatever person I'm going to be playing."
Christian Bale,"But I enjoyed getting sick, I didn't mind it at all. So in that short amount of time, I did actually go from 121 right back up to 180, which is way too fast obviously. And that resulted in some doctors visits to get things sorted out."
Christian Bale,"All of the muscles were gone, so that was a real tough time of rebuilding all of that. But you have a deadline, you have an obligation. You've said that you will commit to this part, and I just can't live with myself for not really giving it as much as I can."
Christian Bale,I have a fear of being boring.
Christian Bale,An actor should never be larger than the film he's in.
Christian Bale,I don't think I'm like any of the characters I've played - they're all really far from who I am.

Christian Bale,"If everyone really knew what a jerk I am in real life, I wouldn't be so adored in the slightest."

Marco Balich,"Italians live very passionately: their cars, how they eat and dress. Italians love speed, too, so we wanted to represent this also."
Marco Balich,"We wanted to do a show that was fun, energetic and looking to the future."
Marco Balich,The music of the '70s and '80s is fun music and we wanted to have a party.
Marco Balich,"The opening ceremony is all about passion, energy, the Italy of the future. It will be a bit aggressive. The closing ceremony will have a carnival theme - with a melancholy air because it's the end of the Games."

Ivern Ball,Most of us ask for advice when we know the answer but we want a different one.
John Ball,We work all week on getting numbers in the box and first half we just didn't. The second half we had a little more speed on the outside.
John Ball,"When I'm in good shape, I have more resources to draw from. It's nice to have that strength."
John Ball,"a single annual meeting reflects the reality of the market. Attendance at the recent European COMMON was dismal. A single, annual event, coupled with important changes to the venue and purpose, might encourage ASNA to attend a future event."
John Ball,"You can sit around at a show and look at cars, ... but if a cute-looking guy comes along, you can look at him, too."
Michael Ball,I like to listen to talk programs and sports.
Michael Ball,"[Ball is one of the few musical comedy artists to have distinguished himself  equally as an interpreter of both Andrew Lloyd Webber and Stephen Sondheim, who would seem to be  polar opposites as songwriters.] I'm very lucky that I've gotten to work with both of them, ... I was in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th party concert at the Albert Hall. That same year I was in  a special show called Hey, Mr. Producer , a celebration of Cameron Mackintosh's work. There  was a Sondheim section, and Cameron asked if I'd be part of it. I'd already recorded 'Losing My Mind'  from Follies , which is one of my favorite songs of Steve's. But I hadn't yet done a particularly  traditional treatment of it. Steve said he wanted me to do it absolutely straight, the way it was  heard in the original show, which I was delighted about. And he worked with me on it--just him, and  me, and a pianist in a tiny room, for an hour-and-a-half master class on this song. I came away knowing  every nuance; why he wrote everything that he did; why every note was in its place; why the phrasing  was like this--can you imagine how thrilling that was? And he is so articulate in explaining his  work; you can be under no illusion why something is there. When you have that understanding, that  is when his work opens up to you. Of course, they put me between Judi Dench singing 'Send in the Clowns'  and Bernadette Peters doing 'Being Alive.' You try holding your own in that company!"
Michael Ball,"[Although Ball is considered a pop singer, he's not a total stranger to  Gilbert and Sullivan, having played Frederick in the West End mounting of Joe Papp's memorable  production of The Pirates of Penzance . But Patience is a different kind of work--much  of its humor is highly topical, poking fun at the short-lived Aesthetic movement that flourished  among British dilettantes 125 years ago. Will that humor translate to a New York audience in the  year 2005?] I think there's absolutely no difference to how we regarded things then and how we regard  things now, ... There are still those performers and artists who strike on a new art  form or mode that attracts their fans, while the majority of us may be saying, 'I'm sorry, but isn't  that The Emperor's New Clothes?' There will always be charlatans who do things just to get acclaim  and adulation. So I think it'll speak to an audience as clearly today as it did then."
Seve Ballesteros,"It is very sad. I was treated with disrespect. It was hard to sleep, and I cried because the players' committee judged me without regard for the big picture and my contributions to the European tour."
Seve Ballesteros,"The problem was the first three holes. I didn't feel comfortable and was a bit tense. That made the rest of the day difficult, but I played well on the back nine."
Seve Ballesteros,"My intention is to compete until I'm 54. So if I join the Champions Tour, it will only be for four years - no more than that. I'm in the golf course design business. This is my future. I'd rather go to a place where there is nothing and design a golf course. This will be a good legacy for me to leave."
Seve Ballesteros,"I'd like to see the fairways more narrow. Then everyone would have to play from the rough, not just me."
Seve Ballesteros,"He was amazing to work with though, a genius. I've never seen anyone with such skill, especially with wedges. He had shots no one else had. He had control over the ball like no-one else. The new balls killed off his edge though."
Seve Ballesteros,"I look into their eyes, shake their hand, pat their back, and wish them luck, but I am thinking, 'I am going to bury you."
Seve Ballesteros,"I am really very happy with the final score today. It has been a great two days of competition and the European Team played fantastic. The Asian team also showed a tremendous game. On this occasion we had a little more luck, but at the end of the day golf is the real champion."
Seve Ballesteros,"Yeah, but I'll be working as a marshal. I'll be helping your team find all the balls they drive into the rough."
Goolam Ballim,The central risk to social cohesion is persistent and high unemployment. The speech was littered with a variety of fresh initiatives that heighten the probability of increasingly robust job creation.
Goolam Ballim,"Inflation would not be affected by providing tax cuts to the poor and middle-income groups. Especially pensioners, who get what is considered a household grant, could score."
Goolam Ballim,"As a general rule, as income rises, so debt increases, but in the very low income groups we find an extraordinarily high ratio of debt."
Rich Ballinger,"As far as the rate structure, our goal is to give an excellent value to the different segments of our community and to make sure that SHSU students can play the golf course for a very minimal fee."
Rich Ballinger,"We're proud that any student can walk and play 18 holes of golf for $5 during the week and $8 during the weekend. Faculty and staff will have discounted rates as well. It's a great thing for the university as a whole. Students will have to provide their own equipment. In the future we hope to offer rental sets, but at the moment we don't have any."
Rich Ballinger,We're very excited to have a facility of that caliber to be Sam Houston State University's golf course. We look forward to running this course and making it successful.

Steve Ballmer,We have an incredible opportunity...to revolutionize the Internet user experience. We need to deliver our next generation services platform in order to do that. And we need Bill Gates 100 percent focused on helping architect that.
Steve Ballmer,"By bringing together the software experience and the service experience, we will better address the changing needs of our customers' digital lifestyles and the new world of work."
Steve Ballmer,"Turner's experience as a proven leader of people in Wal-Mart's incredibly dynamic sales environment; his IT background as CIO of a world-class company and his familiarity with our products and technologies as a Microsoft customer for more than a decade uniquely qualify him to serve as our COO,"
Steve Ballmer,"Given the excitement and enthusiasm from many of the game developing companies here in Japan, I expect us to do quite well,"

Steve Ballmer,offered far more choices and benefits to consumers.
Steve Ballmer,Cars come in all shapes and sizes.. I'll be the judge of this thing..
Steve Ballmer,"In general, 50 percent of searches do not lead to the desired outcome. Does anybody not believe that the search experience is going to be dramatically better 10 years from now? Does anybody deny it would be nice to search within the enterprise and outside the enterprise?"
Steve Ballmer,"We've grown from 18% of the profits of the top 25 companies in our industry to 23% of the profits of the top 25 companies in our industry over the last five years. Profits are up over 70%, where the industry profit is up about 35%. Pretty good."
Steve Ballmer,"Vista will be out next year. Vista has never been delayed. I mean, we had earlier conceptualizations, but the thing that is Vista is on its track."
Steve Ballmer,"So, I think the output of our innovation is great. We have a culture of self-improvement. I know we can continue to improve. There is no issue. But at the same time, our absolute level of output is fantastic."

Steve Ballmer,"Look at the product pipeline, look at the fantastic financial results we've had for the last five years. You only get that kind of performance on the innovation side, on the financial side, if you're really listening and reacting to the best ideas of the people we have."
Steve Ballmer,Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.

Steve Ballmer,"I have never, honestly, thrown a chair in my life."
Steve Ballmer,I have lots of sources of information about what's going on at the company. I think I have a pretty good pulse on where we are and what people are thinking.
Steve Ballmer,"I come back to the same thing: We've got the greatest pipeline in the company's history in the next 12 months, and we've had the most amazing financial results possible over the last five years, and we're predicting being back at double-digit revenue growth in fiscal year '06."

Steve Ballmer,"All companies of any size have to continue to push to make sure you get the right leaders, the right team, the right people to be fast acting, and fast moving in the marketplace. We've got great leaders, and we continue to attract and promote great new leaders."
Steve Ballmer,"We can believe that we know where the world should go. But unless we're in touch with our customers, our model of the world can diverge from reality. There's no substitute for innovation, of course, but innovation is no substitute for being in touch, either."
Steve Ballmer,We will make our products work out of the box.
Steve Ballmer,I don't know what a monopoly is until somebody tells me.
Steve Ballmer,"I like to tell people that all of our products and business will go through three phases. There's vision, patience, and execution."

David Baltimore,"Were we to go with 60 percent at NIH reviews, many of us scientists would be very uncomfortable with the quality."

David Baltimore,"[Baltimore said his intention to retire as president of the Pasadena-based university was not prompted by any health problem, budget deficit or management disagreements, but rather a sense that he had accomplished his goals as an administrator.] Caltech is a wonderful place, the best place to do science I have ever seen, ... I will have done what I can do [as president], and it is time for somebody else to be thinking about it. I have a fairly extensive life in science and in business that I will pursue."
David Baltimore,"There is an increasing belief that we need to understand the structure better,"
David Baltimore,"When we talk about stem cells, we are actually talking about a complicated series of things, including adult stem cells which are largely cells devoted to replacing individual tissues like blood elements or liver or even the brain."

Afrika Bambaataa,When you talk about rap you have to understand that rap is part of the Hip-Hop culture.
Afrika Bambaataa,"Well, a lot of people within government and big business are nervous of Hip Hop and Hip Hop artists, because they speak their minds. They talk about what they see and what they feel and what they know. They reflect what's around them."
Afrika Bambaataa,We want you to sit down and leave your egos at home and let's get an understanding as to where all this is foolishness coming from. There are others who are putting things out there or throwing a stick and hiding their hand and keeping things built up in the media.
Afrika Bambaataa,We also want to try and slow down all this foolishness that's going on between the East and West. We gotta understand that Hip Hop is now universal. Hip Hop is not East coast or West coast.
Afrika Bambaataa,"They're keeping friction going between people from the East and the West. One thing we all got in common is your color, which is Black and Latino, which is our family."
Afrika Bambaataa,They allow us to disrespect our Black woman. A lot of these things would be considered criminal if it were to be carried out in the streets. That's like when they tell you after you buy your VHS and you rent movies they tell you not to copy the movies.
Afrika Bambaataa,"There's a lot of people over time who have brought out all these funky records that everybody has started jumping on like a catch phrase... When Planet Rock came out, then you had all of the electro funk records."
Afrika Bambaataa,"There are certain things that they say you can't do, there are all these secret people behind the scenes who make things available for you to do. That's why you have so much crime and violence."
Afrika Bambaataa,The thing that's good about Hip Hop is that it has experimented with a lot of different sounds and music.
Afrika Bambaataa,The thing about Hip Hop today and music in general is that the people who created it meaning Blacks and Latinos do not control it no more.
Afrika Bambaataa,I knew that as a DJ from 1970 on up that I would eventually come with this sound. I brought out all these other break beats that you hear so much on a lot of these records.
Afrika Bambaataa,I am one of the founders of Hip-Hop along with my brothers Kool DJ Herc and Grandmaster Flash.
Afrika Bambaataa,"How you act, walk, look and talk is all part of Hip Hop culture. And the music is colorless. Hip Hop music is made from Black, brown, yellow, red and white."
Afrika Bambaataa,Actually freestyle really comes from 'Planet Rock'. If you listen to all the freestyle records you'll hear that they are based on 'Planet Rock'. All the Miami Bass records are based upon Planet Rock.
James Bamford,It shows people do try to cover up when they make mistakes.
James Bamford,NSA prides itself on learning the lessons of the 1970s and obeying the legal restrictions imposed by FISA. Now it looks like we're going back to the bad old days again.

Albert Bandura,Measures of self-precept must be tailored to the domain of psychological functioning being explored.
Albert Bandura,"Learning would be exceedingly laborious, not to mention hazardous, if people had to rely solely on the effects of their own actions to inform them what to do. Fortunately, most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling : from observi"
Albert Bandura,"By exercising control over a few healthy habits, people can live longer, healthier lives and slow the process of aging."
Albert Bandura,"People who believe they have the power to exercise some measure of control over their lives are healthier, more effective and more successful than those who lack faith in their ability to effect changes in their lives."

Albert Bandura,Most of the images of reality on which we base our actions are really based on vicarious experience.
Carl Banks,"Number one, Harry is very deserving, and number two, this is an honor that was long overdue. He played middle linebacker like a man among boys."
Carl Banks,"I think what they have going for them right now is great team defense. I think the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, because when you break down this defense you can probably find some deficiencies at each position. But collectively, they've been able to mask them by playing good team defense."
Carl Banks,He was a man among boys. He was the guy who set the tone for toughness for our defense.
Carl Banks,"This is an honor that is long overdue. He played middle linebacker like a man among boys. Harry was a warrior who led by example. He was a great player and a great team leader.

Ernie Banks,"Just follow Buck O'Neil. This man is a leader, he's a genius. He understands people. He understands life. He will keep this going. He never gives up on situations he believes in. He's not discouraged about any of this. He believes he came along at the right time and is doing the right thing. He started the Negro League Museum in Kansas City. That was his goal, his mission, and many people resented that. But he stayed on course with his situations. All of us should learn from this man. He's an ambassador, he's a humanitarian. We should follow him and see what he has to say."

Iain Banks,"By the usual reckoning, the worst books make the best films."

Iain Banks,"As a writer, you get to play, you get alter time, you get to come up with the smart lines and the clever comebacks you wish you'd thought of."
Iain Banks,"I think the future stopped looking American when you think back to Blade Runner and Neuromancer, when it started to look more Japanese."

Jeff Banks,"When he comes out to the practice field, he knows exactly what to do, and he's ready to compete and get better."
Jeff Banks,"There's a difference between going out to practice and punting, and getting in a game and punting. He has to get the ball off, he's got a live rush, he's got guys coming at him, and I'm trying to work on his mindset. I'm trying to get him to where he's competing against New Mexico State when he gets a snap, and he's not just going out and going through the motions."

Benjamin Banneker,The colour of the skin is in no way connected with strength of the mind or intellectual powers.
Benjamin Banneker,Evil communication corrupts good manners. I hope to live to hear that good communication corrects bad manners.
David Banner,The sad thing is that people are going to think this is a reflection of rap music. But it's not a reflection ... people have lives outside of the music.
David Banner,"It's about  a white family and a black family living in modern day North Mississippi but  the white family's mind set is that of 1869 and no matter what you do it won't  change, they still think and talk the way they would in 1869, so it's really  pushing it, ... My character is a member of black rock  band who works at Sonic, but he is moving upward and is in direct conflict with  the white family. I think that it's really going to push the envelope and address  the issue of race relations in America, even if we don't want to."
David Banner,"My character  is one of the few people in the town besides Lazarus [played by Samuel L. Jackson]  that really understands this woman, ... He's  a hustler but No one else believes in her and they all kind of get down on her.  It's a real cool movie"
David Banner,"This was a star-studded event. We had cats flying in from LA and all over just to be there. We had over 10,000 people there, it was amazing,"
Joe Banner,"We didn't expect him to come in here with the biggest smile on his face in training camp. We understood that. But we thought we knew him well enough to know that he's such a prideful guy, such a competitive guy, that once he got here, we'd have a guy working as hard as he's always worked."
Joe Banner,"We want Brian to be here. We recognize him as an important part of this team, a quality person. I think Brian recognizes that this is a great situation for him. I think he recognizes that this system probably matches up to his own strengths and weaknesses better than any other system out there. So I think that in the long run, because we both have that mind-set about it, we'll find a way to get it done. I hope it's in the short run."
Joe Banner,"He's a quality guy and a strong leader. He's a physical guy who sets the tone, and he wanted to be here. He's one of a number of 30-year-old guys that we have signed, and I think that's good. The notion that we don't care about those guys is false."
Joe Banner,"I think a lot of people, including myself, do and say a lot of things in the context of negotiations that tend to go away and be forgotten,"
Joe Banner,It is an honor to be recognized by our peers and a great credit to our staff. We continue to strive for relevant and entertaining content on our web site and we know that our fans return again and again for news about the team. The enormous growth of this medium has allowed fans all over the world to be part of the Eagles family.
Joe Banner,"The Eagles continue to offer the city a deal that meets the city's revenue-neutral goals that is the best deal any team has offered in the NFL,"
Joe Banner,"There's an accumulation of events culminating with a series of things last week, including the very public interview that he did, ... I think there's a long list of things, some of which you know about and some of which aren't public."
Joe Banner,There is no question he's a vital part of our team and we have always maintained a strong desire to get a deal done with Brian.
Jon Banner,"There are limitations, obviously. They have a huge responsibility in the mornings. We have to be realistic about the amount of time we expect from them."
Jon Banner,"Every call we make regarding any story is a serious one. But anything of this nature is a difficult call. We have to be sensitive to the viewers and at the same time be responsible and present what are, in essence, horrific acts occurring."
Jon Banner,This is what we intend to do with 'World News Tonight' going forward. It's about giving them a real sense up close of the big stories of our time.
Jon Banner,"The competition is very stiff. Brian Williams has proved himself as a credible news anchor (at NBC), and Bob Schieffer has done the same (at CBS). But as Peter and Tom (Brokaw) and Dan have always said about the competition, it makes us all better."
Jon Banner,"We have learned first-hand the dangers of smoking and the tragedy of lung cancer,"

Ehud Barak,"It's possible within a matter of months, to achieve peace with both countries,"
Ehud Barak,"It is a terrible, terrible blow to peace. Even when Palestinians are killed it is a blow. But I have to say that, unfortunately, this time it is the Palestinians side that has initiated the violence."
Ehud Barak,"I don't think that such talk helps in any way to promote the peace process,"
Ehud Barak,"Together with the president of the United States let us be able to bring peace and security to our people, ... This is an opportunity; a window of opportunity that will not reoccur."
Ehud Barak,"Together with the president of the United States, let us be able to bring peace and security to our people, ... This is an opportunity, a window of opportunity that will not reoccur."
Ehud Barak,"Maybe I made a few or maybe many tactical mistakes, ... but I did not make a mistake in the very essence of what I've ... chosen to do, namely to leave no stone unturned in order to find a way to put an end to this conflict, at the same time to be open-eyed enough to realize that it takes two to tango."
Ehud Barak,"In fact, we have finished displaying our positions. We displayed our readiness to examine ideas and we are waiting,"
Ehud Barak,to discuss the ideas of President Clinton.
Ehud Barak,"I hope of course that everything will be decided in negotiation,"
Ehud Barak,I am optimistic but I know that only with true hard work on the details will we be able to win.

Ehud Barak,We are determined to do everything we can

Ehud Barak,as soon as the mechanisms of cooperation are established.
Ehud Barak,"We can just hope at a certain time he will be back, ... I would not exaggerate the immediate consequences of such a step, but of course we regret it."
Ehud Barak,"I am not dividing Jerusalem, I am going to make a determined attempt to put an end to the conflict,"
Ehud Barak,"We will stand firm fighting against terror until the circumstances will become right for resumption of negotiations, ... It's only negotiations and peaceful agreement that will solve the problem from its very roots."
Ehud Barak,This is a choice between extremism ... and putting an end to the conflict (with the Palestinians).
Ehud Barak,"Prime Minister, you have blood on your hands."
Ehud Barak,"Once it becomes clear that there is only a slight opening for an agreement with Syria, we move forward to implement our pullout from Lebanon."
Ehud Barak,"We're closer to an agreement than ever,"
Ehud Barak,sign an agreement that I don't think is good.
Ehud Barak,"Once there will be an agreement, if and when there will be an agreement, the enthusiasm within the people to accept it, even if it is a painful one, once it puts an end to the conflict I believe the Knesset will be with us and if not we will know what to do,"
Ehud Barak,"We need to make sure that if it's possible, under these difficult circumstances, we can reach an agreement, which maintains our safety and interests. We must do everything to make that happen,"
Ehud Barak,"The government under my authority will not accept any agreement in any form that will recognize ... the right of return. Period ... I do not intend to sign any document that will transfer sovereignty over the Temple Mount to Palestinians,"
Ehud Barak,"We are a government that does not deal with niceties of language and packaging, it deals with action, ... I have no doubt that ... we will continue on this path and, in the end, the feeling will change as well."
Ehud Barak,"I suggest to everyone that you look less at gestures and more at action on the ground, ... Everything will be examined according to how it is implemented, both in terms of what the Palestinians do and also as far as our own actions."
Ehud Barak,"He doesn't have the character or the will or the ability, ... He doesn't have the qualities to bring about the painful decisions that will take the challenge proper, and as a result of it unfortunately we have to do it painfully and unilaterally."
Brendan Barber,"The public wants a ban, the health arguments are overwhelming and all that is holding government back seems to be a reluctance to say no to business lobbying or risk being called nannies,"
Brendan Barber,This is a major victory for the simple union principle that people at work should not have to breathe in toxins.
Brendan Barber,The reforms should recognize that employer prejudice is a key obstacle in the way of many claimants moving back to work.
Brendan Barber,"We don't want to turn into a nation of clock watchers. Most people enjoy their jobs, and don't mind putting in extra effort when there's a rush or in an emergency, but that easily turns into the long hours culture of extra hours every week."
Brendan Barber,"We already have huge incentives to save for retirement, but they are not working,"
Brendan Barber,"By accepting flexible work requests from their female employees but not from their male staff, employers are helping reinforce the gender pay gap, when instead they could be enabling young dads to play a more active role in the raising of their children."
Brendan Barber,"The reality is that Britain has one of the lowest rates of sick absence in Europe and sickness rates have been coming down for the last 10 years,"

Chris Barber,"Here in England we live at a slower pace, have more time to enjoy things - like good jazz."
Chris Barber,A frisky spirit makes my trombone sing.

Red Barber,Baseball is dull only to dull minds.
Ronde Barber,I think Jon has learned to trust young guys more.
Ronde Barber,He started to understand it's not just going out there and using all of his talent and flinging the ball around. The details are more important. Not turning the ball over is more important than forcing the ball into a tight spot.
Ronde Barber,"We've really turned this thing around behind some young talent. If I had to put one thing on it, it's their play."
Ronde Barber,We think they're going to try and get back their running game.
Ronde Barber,"The rest of the league knows now that we can be even better this year. We got after them a little bit tonight. Week 1, on the road against a great quarterback and a quality opponent. That's doing something."
Ronde Barber,He turned it on. It was a pleasure watching him.
Ronde Barber,We obviously forced him into a lot of mistakes.
Ronde Barber,"You had a team in 2002 that was approaching greatness. I'm not making excuses, but this just might be a reason, I think. Guys who are good players try to be great players by doing too much. In the long run that's going to hurt you."
Ronde Barber,"That was one of our goals, to win the NFC South, and we found a way to do it. Regardless of what 2004 was all about, 2005 gave us a new opportunity. Everybody jumped at it, believed in it, worked for it."
Ronde Barber,"That was one of our goals, to win the NFC South, and we found a way to do it. Regardless of what 2004 was all about, 2005 gave us a new opportunity."
Ronde Barber,"Is that any different from any other season? We pride ourselves on being a defensive football team. Bring in all the free agents, all the coaches or whatever you want. This team has been built on defense."
Ronde Barber,"So restructuring wouldn't benefit anybody. It's hard to say what I'd say (in Brooks' shoes). I guess the situation would have to present itself. Until it does, I don't have an opinion either way. It'll happen eventually. Everybody gets to that point in their career. I don't know if I'm there yet."
Ronde Barber,"It definitely seemed different. Obviously, without Randy, they don't have that guy where he sees an advantage, throws his hands up and he just launches it."
Tiki Barber,"[It's clear that the Saints are getting an emotional boost from representing the victims of Hurricane Katrina.] They have an emotional edge in their own minds about what the season is going to bring for them and mean for them, ... We have to find a way to combat that."
Tiki Barber,"It was his first game as a full-time starter for us. We have a lot of talent around him, a lot of veteran players. He doesn't need to be Joe Montana right now. He has time to develop into that. As long as we play well around him, I think he'll continue to develop and be the great quarterback we expect him to be."
Tiki Barber,He did great. He had a phenomenal game.
Tiki Barber,"If you run the ball, you control the clock. If you control the clock, you usually control the game."
Tiki Barber,"Rushing the ball is all about ball control. If you run the ball, you control the clock. If you control the clock, you usually control the game."
Tiki Barber,"[Sunday], the defense played phenomenal, and if that happens, that will help all the time. It's having all those ways of winning, of having guys step up, that's going to be the difference."
Joseph Barbera,You keep pitching. Most of the pitches run wild. A few are caught.
Joseph Barbera,"When animators weren't sleeping, they were drinking."

Joseph Barbera,I hope we don't get to the point where we have to have the cat stop chasing the mouse to teach him glassblowing and basket weaving.
Joseph Barbera,I have spent a lot of years on the outside looking in.
Joseph Barbera,"I hate fishing, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to hike when you can get in the car and drive."
Joseph Barbera,"I don't know that I spent any more time alone than any other kid, but being by myself never bothered me."
Joseph Barbera,"I don't know anyone who enjoys going to the hospital. To help remedy this, I got an idea to create what a Laugh Room in the pediatric ward of hospitals."
Joseph Barbera,"I cannot say who, precisely, came up with the idea of a Stone Age family."
Joseph Barbera,"High-level, big-deal publicity has a way of getting old for me, but what never fails to thrill me is when I make personal appearances."
Joseph Barbera,Friends don't necessarily made good business or creative partners.
Joseph Barbera,"Faced with the choice of enduring a bad toothache or going to the dentist, we generally tried to ride out the bad tooth."
Joseph Barbera,"Except for me, no one in my family could draw."

Haley Barbour,"We're very hopeful that some really good ideas will be put forward,"
Haley Barbour,"I hate to say it, but my term as governor lasts for 2 1/2 more years, and for 2 1/2 more years I'm going to be standing in front of you saying: Be patient, ... Life as usual in Mississippi is not something we're going to recover for a long time?. That's just a fact."
Haley Barbour,"And I hate to say it, I think there are going to be more."
Haley Barbour,We got hit by the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States.
Haley Barbour,I'm floored that the House leadership would turn its back on job creation for Mississippians.
Haley Barbour,"that the federal government understands that it has a major commitment here. It's going to be required to support financially what we do, particularly in areas of public infrastructure."

John Barbour,Freedom all solace to man gives: He lives at ease that freely lives.
John Barbour,"The Internet business lost last year because of the number of companies that just couldn't keep up with demand, ... ...We got really slammed, and you know, we did, fact of life. But there are very few people out there who aren't saying 'You know something? Those people did the right thing for the long term.' It may have cost them money. It may have been painful. It may have been written all up in the press. But you know something, everyone who had a satisfied experience said we dealt with things correctly."
John Barbour,Music is so hot right now. It appeals to both boys and girls of all ages. This holiday season people will have less money in their pockets. They want a toy that will stretch further.
William Barclay,In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.

Brigitte Bardot,"I am not finding pregnancy much of a joy. I am afraid of childbirth, but I am afraid I can't find a way of avoiding it."
Brigitte Bardot,I never do anything by chance.
Brigitte Bardot,It's better to be unfaithful than faithful without wanting to be.
Brigitte Bardot,Only idiots refuse to change their minds.
Brigitte Bardot,I leave before being left. I decide.
Brigitte Bardot,I started out as a lousy actress and have remained one.
Brigitte Bardot,"I can't do the same thing every night, the same gestures... it's like putting on dirty panties every day."
Brigitte Bardot,Men are beasts and even beasts don't behave as they do.
Brigitte Bardot,"I am leaving the town to the invaders: increasingly numerous, mediocre, dirty, badly behaved, shameless tourists."
Brigitte Bardot,It is better to be unfaithful than to be faithful without wanting to be.
Brigitte Bardot,"It's incredible to think that such dreadful things are still happening in a country like Canada, in a country that can hardly be considered undeveloped. We're not living in caves any more."
Brigitte Bardot,My trust in you is broken and I am plunged into despair for the animals.
Brigitte Bardot,"Every age can be enchanting, provided you live within it."
Brigitte Bardot,"What could be more beautiful than a dear old lady growing wise with age? Every age can be enchanting, provided you live within it."
Brigitte Bardot,Women get more unhappy the more they try to liberate themselves.
Brigitte Bardot,"I am no mother, and I won't be one."
Brigitte Bardot,I gave my beauty and my youth to men. I am going to give my wisdom and experience to animals.
Brigitte Bardot,It is sad to grow old but nice to ripen.
Daniel Barenboim,"Jewish intellectuals contributed a great deal to insure that Europe became a continent of humanism, and it is with these humanist ideals that Europe must now intervene in the Middle East conflict."
Daniel Barenboim,The lack of musical education means that music is in danger of gradually losing its place in society.
Daniel Barenboim,"Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity."
Daniel Barenboim,Tradition demands that we not speak poorly of the dead.
Clive Barker,"You cut up a thing that's alive and beautiful to find out how it's alive and why it's beautiful, and before you know it, it's neither of those things, and you're standing there with blood on your face and tears in your sight and only the terrible ache of guilt to show for it."
Clive Barker,Gather experience... Look at what you should not look at. A feeling of anxiety is the sure and certain evidence that you should do this.
Clive Barker,What I tried to do is deliver movies that have worked for me more than once.
Clive Barker,I'm a great dog fanatic. My own dog died a little while ago and I take it very personally when things die - it's a major offence.
Clive Barker,You can plan to be brave - it's even better if you just try to be brave.
Clive Barker,My imagination is my polestar; I steer by that.
Clive Barker,"I have the normal complement of anxieties, neuroses, psychoses and whatever else - but I'm absolutely nothing special."
Clive Barker,Nothing ever begins. There is no first moment; no single word or place from which this or any other story springs.
Clive Barker,"Be regular and orderly in your life, that you may be violent and original in your work."
Clive Barker,"To you who have never died, may I say: Welcome to the world!"
Clive Barker,"It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world. It is great good health to want to understand one's dreams. It is great good health to desire the ambiguous and paradoxical."
Travis Barker,We just wanted to write a bunch of songs that we thought were good songs.
Travis Barker,We didn't hold ourselves to a standard that said we needed a certain type of song because that's the type we had on the last album.
Travis Barker,"We all write the music, and then Mark and Tom write the lyrics."
Travis Barker,"We all liked the Descendants and stuff like that, so we started playing it. It's not that it was really hard, well, it does take skill to play fast and keep up your stamina. But it was something that just happened."
Travis Barker,"Then I tried out for the Fontana High School drum line, in Riverside, and I did really well. I got second chair, and played snare in that drum line for three years."
Travis Barker,"On tour, you never have a home, you don't get used to anything, and you're always super busy."
Travis Barker,"Oh, I was super serious about practicing and rudiments, and still am. I still have all my books."
Travis Barker,"I practice every day, I warm up before I play."
Travis Barker,I play Orange County drums. I love those guys. I've got a four piece kit.
Travis Barker,"I like Steve Gadd, everything he did with Steely Dan. There's so many. I like everything."
Travis Barker,"I learned the songs and played the gigs, and then they called me about a month later. They told me they were like super stoked on me and asked me to join their band."
Travis Barker,"But there's actually a lot of punk bands out there that go out of the norm, use odd time signatures, or a lot of different tempo changes in a song."
Travis Barker,"But really, anytime, I play on a practice pad as much as I can."
Travis Barker,"Bill Stevenson of The Descendants is really good, too."
Travis Barker,"And I was in another band called Flash In The Pan, which was soca, Latin music, down in Laguna Beach."
Travis Barker,And I played in jazz band as well during all three years in school.
Travis Barker,All I wanted to do was ride skateboards - I wanted to be a professional skateboarder. But I had this problem. I kept breaking half of my body skateboarding.
Travis Barker,A lot of people think that punk rock musicians don't know what they're doing.
Travis Barker,"In junior high, I sang in madrigals, men's' and women's' choir. I played piano too, but then I got out of it."
Travis Barker,"I've always liked Dennis Chambers, he's real flashy."
Travis Barker,I was in a band called Hooker for a while.
Travis Barker,"We were concerned with having good songs, not just songs that go two hundred miles per hour."
Travis Barker,"We never worry about the big things, just the small things."
Travis Barker,"We just wrote songs that seemed good to us. We wrote the album in like two weeks. We could have had more time, but we accomplished what we needed to in the two weeks."
Travis Barker,"My mom passed away a day before high school started, and her dream was for me to be a full rock and roll guy, and play drums in a band."
Travis Barker,"My mom listened to the Beatles and Elvis, a lot of different types of music."
Travis Barker,"My chops are still up, even though I'm not still in high school."
Travis Barker,"In 1996, I was in was in an acoustic kind of rock band, we were called Feeble. We were just playing locally."
Travis Barker,"I'm super serious about that stuff. I mean, it's rare that I sit down at a drum set when I'm not touring, because we tour so much."
Travis Barker,"I'm a freak, everything has to be totally flat when I play. Ed Will, my jazz teacher, set up everything completely flat, and then you'd tilt your snare drum away from you, so I do that too. So my snare tilts away from me."
Travis Barker,"I was told once if I kept breaking things on my legs, that I wasn't going to be able to walk soon, you know? I wanted to be a pro skateboarder, but it was too hard. I was trying, but it wasn't going to happen."
Travis Barker,"I was playing with the Aquabats, and then I quit to join a band called Suicide Machine in Detroit."
Travis Barker,"I was a kid, and I wasn't even sure if I wanted to play the drums, you know? All I wanted to do was skateboard, but I was still learning and taking it in, so it was good."
Travis Barker,"I used to have friends come on tour and work as my drum tech, but they get bummed out when I have to tell them what to do. This time I'm just going to fly them out and let them hang. It's all good."
Travis Barker,"I listened a little to punk when I was younger, but it was straight edge punk. It was nothing like what is going on now, like poppy punk."
Travis Barker,"I can play punk rock, and I love playing punk rock, but I was into every other style of music before I played punk rock."
Charles Barkley,"They can't beat Detroit, first of all. But they aren't athletic enough, they don't guard, they have trouble with athletic people, the guards especially."
Charles Barkley,"They didn't give us all the money and all the endorsements after one year. Obviously, I wish it could have stunted my growth."
Charles Barkley,"We've won some heat races and had some decent finishes but we haven't been able to get the luck to win a feature,"
Charles Barkley,"When terrible events like this happen, everyone has to pull together and help out, ... That is the area of the country where I grew up and I know that any support those people get will be greatly needed and much appreciated."
Charles Barkley,I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It.
Charles Barkley,"I played against him (Wilkins) in college. Getting nominated with him, that's pretty cool."
Charles Barkley,When you read the book you see that these guys aren't holding any punches. They're straightforward. They're honest. They're giving you their honest opinion.
Charles Barkley,I'm not a role model... Just because I dunk a basketball doesn't mean I should raise your kids.
Charles Barkley,"I know I'm never as good or bad as one single performance. I've never believed in my critics or my worshippers, and I've always been able to leave the game at the arena."
Charles Barkley,I don't think of myself as giving interviews. I just have conversations. That gets me in trouble.
Charles Barkley,"I don't know what that gas is made of, but it can't smell any worse than Ernie Johnson 's gym bag."
Charles Barkley,The main thing to do is relax and let your talent do the work.
Charles Barkley,Poor people cannot rely on the government to come to help you in times of need. You have to get your education. Then nobody can control your destiny.
Charles Barkley,"My initial response was to sue her for defamation of character, but then I realized that I had no character."
Charles Barkley,"I know that I'm never as good or bad as any single performance. I've never believed my critics or my worshippers, and I've always been able to leave the game at the arena."
Charles Barkley,"This place? Nothing positive. OK, I want to say something positive. It's positively a dump."
Charles Barkley,I love New York City; I've got a gun.
Charles Barkley,"My family got all over me because they said Bush is only for the rich people. Then I reminded them, 'Hey, I'm rich'."
Charles Barkley,"Kids are great. That's one of the best things about our business, all the kids you get to meet. It's a shame they have to grow up to be regular people and come to the games and call you names."
Charles Barkley,Sometimes that light at the end of the tunnel is a train.
Charles Barkley,I'm no role model.
Charles Barkley,"We don't need refs, but I guess white guys need something to do."
Charles Barkley,The only difference between a good shot and a bad shot is if it goes in or not.
Charles Barkley,I think that the team that wins game five will win the series. Unless we lose game five.
Charles Barkley,"These are my new shoes. They're good shoes. They won't make you rich like me, they won't make you rebound like me, they definitely won't make you handsome like me. They'll only make you have shoes like me. That's it."
Charles Barkley,"If I weren't earning $3 million a year to dunk a basketball, most people on the street would run in the other direction if they saw me coming."
Charles Barkley,"Somebody hits me, I'm going to hit him back. Even if it does look like he hasn't eaten in a while."
Dean Barkley,I don't think Kinky weighs the risk about who he may or may not offend.
Dean Barkley,All I know is the people in charge of the petition drive all have smiles on their faces.
Dean Barkley,"As the Baby Boomers get older, they're going where it's warmer. It's not a matter of if (Minnesota loses a seat in Congress), it's a matter of when. It would be nice to dodge the bullet one more time, but eventually we're going to lose a seat in Congress."
Jim Barksdale,"Where we can compete on merit, we do very well."
Jim Barksdale,"When I started at Federal Express, not many people thought of using overnight package delivery as a viable way to conduct business."
Jim Barksdale,"Well, the sales of our products clearly demonstrate their value to businesses and to individuals."
Jim Barksdale,"Well, another market is being created now out of Internet technology."
Jim Barksdale,"We've tapped into a huge demand, and it's up to us to fulfill that demand and to be creative doing it."
Jim Barksdale,We're no longer a small business; we're a large organization spread around the world. I can't imagine Netscape growing as fast as it has if it weren't for the way we use our products.
Jim Barksdale,"We're building a great company, and we're very excited about the future of the company."
Jim Barksdale,"We provide many options in many product areas that they seem to want to adopt, and that's working well for us."
Jim Barksdale,"We can provide beta software to our developers in advance of the general public. We can easily link up with external partners, customers, and suppliers."
Jim Barksdale,"We can collaborate with a Netscape employee or partner who's halfway around the world. We can distribute information and software to customers and shareholders, and get their feedback."
Jim Barksdale,We also provide a lot of services with our consulting group that allow people to take maximum advantage of the Net economy. Those all seem to resonate with customers and are providing a good strong base going forward.
Jim Barksdale,"There are no pat answers - we're pushing through some new frontiers, and lessons of the past don't always apply."
Jim Barksdale,The ability of our people to think quickly and create great products in this whole new world of Internet open standards is not only essential to our success but is also one of the things that impresses me most about Netscape.
Jim Barksdale,That's the ultimate gratification in any business situation - do customers buy the product? And do they use it and do they come back and buy more of it?
Jim Barksdale,"Take our own company as an example: We're living proof, we jump with our own parachutes."
Jim Barksdale,"Our people are excited about building solutions, and it's rewarding to see how much fun Netscape employees have doing something they think is relevant and important."
Jim Barksdale,"One problem was that my direct testimony was in writing, so a lot of people didn't get to see it. I hope they see it, because I think it built a very strong case."
Jim Barksdale,One of Netscape's main attractions to customers from Day One is that we provide alternatives. And that's cherished by many customers - certainly not all.
Jim Barksdale,"Of course, nothing happens until somebody sells something."
Jim Barksdale,"No longer do we have to go looking for information - we can find it on the Internet, our intranet, or our extranet with the click of a mouse."
Jim Barksdale,"It's the first time I've ever done anything like that. It took longer than I expected. I've gotten a lot of E-mail since I got back, saying they thought I did a good job and presented the case well."
Jim Barksdale,"In those markets, people have more of a choice because they're not forced to adopt the product that comes with their operating system."
Jim Barksdale,"In my column series The Main Thing, I often talk about how Internet technology can improve the way people communicate - both within a business and between a business and its customers and partners."
Jim Barksdale,I've tended to work at fast-growing companies that improve the way business gets done.
Jim Barksdale,I was telling the truth. I feel like we got that point across.
Jim Barksdale,"I think we're proving ourselves as we go along. The past several months our strategy has been evolutionary - making maximum advantage of our client browser, as well as our enterprise software for people who want to build Web sites."
Jim Barksdale,I think they should separate Microsoft's application group from its operating system group.
Jim Barksdale,"I think the touchstone is to give consumers a full, fair choice without the power of a monopoly operating system pushing them in a direction that free competition might or might not achieve."
Jim Barksdale,I don't believe in government regulation of the software industry.
Jim Barksdale,I can't deny that some customers and prospects think it's the key to our future. But it's not. We're certainly supportive of the Dept. of Justice and the 20 states that have brought this action.
Jim Barksdale,"After all, it's the future of business communication that we're looking toward."
Jim Barksdale,"I want my testimony to stand on that point. But I would point out that Zona Research Inc. showed we have increased market share among business users, educational users, and government users over the past several months - and that's more recent than the IDC report."
Bruce Barnes,"They're all big (games remaining). They're all league games. We're on the road again. We have to bounce back. Defensive rebounds, making easy shots, converting free throws...We just didn't do it."
Bruce Barnes,This is football country. The only reason your parents had you was so you could play football.
Bruce Barnes,"This is big for our kids' confidence. This rivalry is important to our kids. A lot of the kids on both these teams are friends. So it means a lot, as far as bragging rights and things like that."
Matt Barnes,He's a stud. That's his bread and butter. He's got a huge heart.
Matt Barnes,"We just talked a little bit. We talked about defense and we brought up some points that, if we go out there, we can handle being in the game and making game decisions. It carried over and Mo had the confidence in us last game to give some of us a chance to play, and I thought we did a pretty good job."
Matt Barnes,I like playing against friends. I've gotten to know him really well over the years. He's a class guy.
Rick Barnes,We were really swarming and helping each other. I liked most of all we had seven turnovers. I thought we looked like a team.
Rick Barnes,"I don't know if it's an advantage or a disadvantage. I told the guys were only going to worry about the game in front of us. From there, you move on to the next one if you're successful."
Rick Barnes,Those things work themselves out.
Rick Barnes,What you like about opening the tournament in Dallas is the travel. Everyone's had to do a lot of traveling at this point of the year. It's nice to just take a bus trip up I-35.
Rick Barnes,"Once he got it going, we were playing off him, running him off screens anywhere we could. When they concentrate inside, he has enough confidence to get it going."
Rick Barnes,I was impressed with his physical conditioning. He's like a mountain stream of running water. It goes up against one rock and turns another way â€” it never stops flowing.
Rick Barnes,We realize we're in the middle of a conference race. We're not going to take anything for granted.
Rick Barnes,I've never seen players take so much pride in their schoolwork.
Rick Barnes,"We're hopeful we'll know something by [Friday] afternoon, but we can't be sure of that. Mike's been great in practice, and he's been working hard, but like the rest of us he's hoping we can get a resolution to this thing and start playing him in games."
Rick Barnes,"Regardless of what people are saying, N.C. State has not offered me the job. Texas is one of the best jobs in the country, and I'm happy here."
Rick Barnes,It's obvious he's been in pain. I've been worried all year just watching. I knew he was having a tough time.
Rick Barnes,"I look at it, and we didn't have a good night shooting the ball, but we still scored 82 points. There really were some good things."
Rick Barnes,"We're a better offensive team than we were the other night. We turned down some open shots, so we need to be aggressive. Being aggressive is taking an open shot."
Rick Barnes,I didn't know how P.J. would react. What he went through the other night was tough. We spent a lot of time to tell him he could bounce back. I told him the best thing would be to get lost in the game defensively and thought he was really good.
Rick Barnes,"He was a little jumpy the other night, and we got him for it. He had a great response. He definitely had a different perspective on things."
Rick Barnes,"Every game in this league, as you know in any league, that night you've got to be ready to play. We've got to continue to improve. There are areas we definitely can improve in."
Rick Barnes,We had a tough night shooting the ball.
Rick Barnes,"I think it was a situation on this night that (Tech) missed a lot of shots. We were obviously taller and longer, so we could get those rebounds."
Rick Barnes,"P.J. is special, he is. His mind-set, what he's got. I don't think he had any more motivation. ... This time of year, you would expect what he did today."
Rick Barnes,I don't know if we can guard Texas Tech for 40 minutes man-to-man. We were tired. Zone was good to us tonight.
Rick Barnes,He might have improved as much as any player that I've ever coached. And he has become an iron man.
Rick Barnes,"I don't know if anyone can really understand the stress of coaches until you go through it. I love this business, as we all do, but it's a tough profession. There's a lot of stress."
Rick Barnes,"I've always loved P.J., but I love and respect him even more now because of what he has gone through and how he's handled it, ... It's amazing the turnaround that he's made."
Rick Barnes,P.J.'s a tough kid. He's overcome a lot more than that in his life.
Rick Barnes,We just didn't want (Law) to drive the ball to the basket or get a foul.
Rick Barnes,"If he hadn't gotten hurt, we wouldn't have watched him play tonight. I think he'd be in the NBA."
Rick Barnes,"He's a totally different player. I think if he hadn't gotten hurt, we wouldn't be watching him right now. He would be playing in the NBA."
Rick Barnes,He had it going. It hurt having them over there [on the bench]. But you have to deal with it. That's where we have got to have help from our bench.
Rick Barnes,We told him all year to play more disciplined. It?s just a bad habit of him reaching. He is too good a player to let that happen.
Rick Barnes,You could probably make a case today. (But) there's too many games this week. It's an important week for a lot of people. It depends on what we do these next couple of games.
Rick Barnes,That may have been one of Brad's best games because he helped out in areas other than scoring on a tough shooting night.
Rick Barnes,Fran and I spent a lot of nights watching summer league games throughout the D.C. area. I've got a lot of respect for him. You've got to marvel at the job he's done once he arrived there. His teams are very intelligent. They're not going to beat themselves. They're going to play extremely hard. They're probably more athletic than people think.
Rick Barnes,"With four or five games left in the season, (a win) can swing a whole season around for anybody in this league. There are teams fighting for postseason play, and we make your rÃ©sumÃ© look pretty good."
Rick Barnes,"(Kelvin) lost some games when he didn't have his whole team there. Coming in (to the season) they were like us, a team that was up there. And they're a good basketball team."
Rick Barnes,That's stupidity. ... We're six games in. You've got to think teams are going to get better. That's just people wanting to write something. Our guys never thought that.
Rick Barnes,That's stupidity. We're six games in. That's just something for people to write about. There are plenty of good teams in this conference.
Rick Barnes,That's just stupidity. It's like the Indianapolis Colts (who won their first 13 games). We're six games in; teams are going to get better.
Rick Barnes,This game is the most important game we've had to this point.
Rick Barnes,His versatility is what separates him. There's not really a part of the game he can't handle.
Rick Barnes,I told the team after the game they had a glimpse of how good we can be. We were terrific ... but we can still get better.
Rick Barnes,The game is important to him. He wants to be really good at it.
Rick Barnes,He loves this game. I knew he would be a person that would come back from it.
Rick Barnes,I don't know if I would call it a wishbone more than I would call it that Fun 'n' Gun because they spread you out. They're going to shoot 25 threes. They make more threes than any team in the country. It's almost like playing against a no-huddle offense.
Rick Barnes,A year ago we were fighting to get into the NCAA tournament.
Rick Barnes,I think they know I'm upset because I think they know how much I want execution. It's always disappointing when you don't execute.
Rick Barnes,The environment was great and to come in here and find a way to get it done is huge. I feel good for our guys. Memphis is a very hard team to defend because of the way they play.
Rick Barnes,"When the game was in doubt, they made plays and we didn't."
Rick Barnes,"If it goes well in the league, even though my son has never shown any desire whatsoever to coach, ... In about four years if he doesn't have a job, I am going to hire him."
Rick Barnes,"They do a great job of creating offense with their defense. Out front, if you don't handle the ball well, those turnovers usually result in easy baskets at the other end."
Rick Barnes,Both teams play good defense and I think that's why they are where they are right now. But both teams can explode offensively. Both can put up numbers.
Rick Barnes,"Our man defense was good, but we used a lot more zone than I thought we would. Both teams were throwing the ball around because of the intensity of the game."
Rick Barnes,"I think there's a culture at Texas about winning. You come there expecting great things to happen, to be special. There is a culture on our campus about wanting to be the best at what you do."
Rick Barnes,"This is one of the better situations in the country. I know this, there are a lot of guys who would like to be sitting in my chair."
Rick Barnes,We weren't the second-best team in the country when we played Duke. We weren't.
Rick Barnes,"Kansas may be the hottest team in the country right now. I think they're a Top 10 team. On any given night, Kansas can beat any team in the country."
Rick Barnes,"Consistency. I've said to this team, 'If we've got to get a basket, what would we do?' There's no question that at some point we'll put the ball in his hands."
Rick Barnes,The biggest thing we need right now is consistency.
Rick Barnes,"Because of what we've been able to do the last couple of weeks, I think they've got confidence knowing we can play a number of different ways."
Rick Barnes,Both of the honorees tonight have been tireless advocates for community and social justice in Lynchburg.
Rick Barnes,He really can shoot college threes.
Rick Barnes,"[A few days before the start of the NCAA tournament last March, Texas coach Rick Barnes looked on as reporters fired questions at guard Brandon Mouton, most of which were a variation on one theme:] You play so well during the season, but then you disappear in the tournament -- what's up with that? ... Brandon, I've heard all those questions. I know you don't choke. But if you don't play well in this tournament, that's what I'm going to tell the world you did ."
Rick Barnes,"I don't know if guys have to quit, but it does help that P.J. is going to class,"
Rick Barnes,They play with so much character and heart.
Rick Barnes,"Obviously it was a goal we had at the beginning of the season. At the start of the year, looking at our schedule, we knew we had a target on our backs, and I am proud of the way the team handled it."
Rick Barnes,Back in the beginning of the season when I was looking at the schedule I knew it was going to be a tough finish for us.
Rick Barnes,The whole team put in a great effort and our inside game was just great. Back in the beginning of the season ... I knew it was going to be a tough finish for us.
Rick Barnes,"I am obviously a better-looking guy than he is. If we play basketball he wasn't very good; but the reason he does all the loose-ball drills is because that's how he had to get on the court as a player. But if it got down to he and I playing, it won't be a rivalry. To have a rivalry you have got to split some games, and he would never win a game from me."
Rick Barnes,I still think we should be a good basketball team.
Rick Barnes,That's college basketball. I just told them they needed to finish the game. An 18-point lead is nothing that can't be overcome and in February you expect teams to play hard.
Rick Barnes,Kenton's been around. He's matured. He'll tell you his approach has changed. He's always had an excellent basketball IQ. It's just that everything else has come together for him.
Rick Barnes,I've always told Kenton that he sells himself short. He's a much better basketball player than he thinks he is. He's got a great pace to his game. You're not going to speed him up much. He's really embraced the fact that he wants to run the team. He's comfortable now. He knows his teammates. He knows what we need to work our way into.
Rick Barnes,You're not playing this time of year if you're not a good basketball team.
Rick Barnes,"Look at Oklahoma. They start three seniors. They're a good basketball team. If people thought they were just going to go away, they (were wrong). You don't get ranked in the top five in the preseason if you don't have a good basketball team."
Rick Barnes,"Teams may look at A.J.'s baby face and slight build and not take him seriously. Well, they won't anymore."
Rick Barnes,"If you want me to be quite blunt, I've got one of the best jobs in America. I have no desire to coach in the Atlantic Coast Conference or any other part of the country."
Gary Barnett,"He's a gamer, ... He's a versatile runner with the ability to run between tackles and with the speed to get outside."
Gary Barnett,"Although the momentum behind Linux continues to be strong, until today, general business users have not really been a part of the story. With today's introduction of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop, Novell is keeping a promise it made last year, to invest in delivering a desktop that is designed for the business user, rather than for experienced Linux users. Novell deserves credit for addressing the issue of usability head-on, by delivering a desktop that really can meet the needs of the basic knowledge worker."
Gary Barnett,"Today, Vince Young was one heck of a football player, ... Everybody on our team has a great deal of respect for him. . . . The Texas offensive line did a great job of protecting Vince. He had plenty of time in the pocket, and we did not have much of a pass rush today."
Gary Barnett,"What makes Jeremy so valuable are his mental toughness and competitiveness,"
Gary Barnett,"There's reputation, and then there's character. Character is something you build up over 33 years of coaching. I will rely on my character, and we will rely on the character of our program and continue to do what we do. That's all we can do."
Gary Barnett,"We did not underestimate his throwing ability at all. His receivers made great plays, he made great throws and we didn't' get any pressure on him."
Robert Barnett,We have invested many resources in developing and redefining our safety systems and procedures that we have become a model of early detection and warning systems design and response around the country.
Robert Barnett,"It's smart, insightful, funny and instructive."
Robert Barnett,"Here in Mobile, it's bad, very bad. Thousands without power, people fighting for petrol, literally. We did not fare as badly as Gulfport, Biloxi or New Orleans, but there are towns totally obliterated, gone."
Steve Barnett,All of the police and corrections officers in Hamilton County are frustrated. We need a new jail. We have no place to send them.
Steve Barnett,"I don't really dwell on numbers. My philosophy is that you attract quality students that have good attitudes and work hard, ... Those students attract more students of the same kind and the numbers take care of themselves."

Jarrett Barrios,"If that's not a call to action, then I don't know what is."

Drew Barrymore,I'm not after fame and success and fortune and power. It's mostly [that I want] to have a good job and have good friends; that's the good stuff in life.
Drew Barrymore,I wanted to go [to Africa] because I read an article in the New York Times about education becoming free in certain parts of Africa and how the classrooms were sort of bursting at the seams because so many kids wanted to go. I thought that was so extraordinary that I wanted to see and experience what that was like and to sort of go down there and touch and feel and taste that world.
Drew Barrymore,"I think its nice when people find love, because I feel like everyone deserves it."
Drew Barrymore,"God made a very obvious choice when he made me voluptuous; why would I go against what he decided for me? My limbs work, so I'm not going to complain about the way my body is shaped."
Drew Barrymore,"And now they are making claims about my behavior, which is outrageous. This family obviously has a chip on their shoulder and another thought should not be wasted on this."
Drew Barrymore,"I get to be a kid now, because I wasn't a kid when I was supposed to be one. But in some ways, I'm like an old woman-lived it, seen it, done it, been there, have the T-shirt."
Drew Barrymore,"I've always said that one night, I'm going to find myself in some field somewhere, I'm standing on grass, and it's raining, and I'm with the person I love, and I know I'm at the very point I've been dreaming of getting to."
Mayor Barse,You can never have enough preparedness. This is a great opportunity to have someone come in and give us some training and enlightenment on certain safety issues.
Mayor Barse,We are always seeking new and better information.
Mayor Barse,An investigation can't hurt. Anything that enhances our city's safety capabilities is a good idea.
Mayor Barse,We're happy we can put them up.
Mayor Barse,This will help us plot the plan for the future of our generating facility. It is a critical need for our area.
Mayor Barse,"We must stop the bleeding at the border. It's just a scary thought that in a post-9/11 age, we still have this type of problem. It doesn't make any sense."
Roland Barthes,"To endow the writer publicly with a good fleshly body, to reveal that he likes dry white wine and underdone steak, is to make even more miraculous for me, and of a more divine essence, the products of his art. Far from the details of his daily life bringing nearer to me the nature of his inspiration and making it clearer, it is the whole mystical singularity of his condition which the writer emphasizes by such confidences. For I cannot but ascribe to some superhumanly the existence of beings vast enough to wear blue pajamas at the very moment when they manifest themselves as universal conscience."
Roland Barthes,"There are people who think that wrestling is an ignoble sport. Wrestling is not sport, it is a spectacle, and it is no more ignoble to attend a wrestled performance of suffering than a performance of the sorrows of Arnolphe or Andromaque."
Roland Barthes,To eat steak rare. . . represents both a nature and a morality.
Roland Barthes,"Literature is without proofs. By which it must be understood that it cannot prove, not only what it says, but even that it is worth the trouble of saying it."
Roland Barthes,"Through the mythology of Einstein, the world blissfully regained the image of knowledge reduced to a formula."
Roland Barthes,"I call the discourse of power any discourse that engenders blame, hence guilt, in its recipient."
Roland Barthes,"What the public wants is the image of passion, not passion itself."
Roland Barthes,"The New is not a fashion, it is a value."
Roland Barthes,"To hide a passion totally (or even to hide, more simply, its excess) is inconceivable: not because the human subject is too weak, but because passion is in essence made to be seen: the hiding must be seen: I want you to know that I am hiding something from you, that is the active paradox I must resolve: at one and the same time it must be known and not known: I want you to know that I don't want to show my feelings: that is the message I address to the other."
Roland Barthes,"I think that cars today are almost the exact equivalent of the great Gothic cathedrals: I mean the supreme creation of an era, conceived with passion by unknown artists, and consumed in image if not in usage by a whole population which appropriates t"
Roland Barthes,"Historically and politically, the petit-bourgeois is the key to the century. The bourgeois and proletariat classes have become abstractions: the petite-bourgeoisie, in contrast, is everywhere, you can see it everywhere, even in the areas of the bourgeois and the proletariat, what's left of them."
Steve Bartlett,"This is not about bankruptcy attorneys, it?s about consumers, ... This has had huge bipartisan support over three years."
Steve Bartlett,Congress has spoken that real-estate activities [that are] financial services are allowed and ought to be regulated. The Realtors are just wrong.
Steve Bartlett,"Because Doug knows Peter, he had some comfort there."
Steve Bartlett,"You meet new people. We just spent two hours with people we didn't know before, just talking about the Badgers."
Steve Bartlett,"This filing spike is a result of bad information being pushed on people, and then they file for bankruptcy out of fear."
Steve Bartlett,"Pension reforms, like investment advice and automatic enrollment, will strengthen the ability of Americans to save and invest for retirement."
Evarist Bartolo,The best education system is based on quality and equality. Children who are allowed to fall behind are being deprived of their human rights.
Evarist Bartolo,"The best education gives you the necessary skills to solve real problems and carry out the necessary tasks at home, in society and at work"
Evarist Bartolo,"The best education, both within formal learning institutions and outside them is that which helps to make people acquire the necessary skills, attitudes and behaviour that are needed in the real world of the 21st century"
Evarist Bartolo,"From kindergarten to university and beyond, we need to find ways of having an interactive and dynamic relationship between education and the bigger reality so that education helps us to understand and interpret the world to be able to change it for the better"
Alan Barton,We're not a one-man team and we proved that today we have other girls that know what this is about.
Alan Barton,The girls have cousins and sisters with state championships so they know what it takes.
Alan Barton,"The girls here in Greenland have to believe there's another sport in town, and that's girl's softball. We're not bad, but when we play experienced teams like that we've got to play at the top of our game."
Alan Barton,Our hands are on the wheel. Now we just have to steer it in the right direction.
Alan Barton,That big run put us where we needed to be. We played good defense and the press really got to Mountainburg early and it got us some easy shots. That's the way we like to play.
Alan Barton,This was a big win and we now control our own destiny to win district. Free throws were the difference. We switched our presses and got a big run and then we were able to get them in foul trouble and it paid off.
Alan Barton,"Believe it or not, it's the best we've played all year. We jumped out and had a lead, and one inning (the fourth) we had six batters bat. I'm proud as everything that we had six hits today, and that's the best we've hit the ball."
Clara Barton,"Others are writing my biography, and let it rest as they elect to make it. I have lived my life, well and ill, always less well than I wanted it to be but it is, as it is, and as it has been; so small a thing, to have had so much about it!"
Clara Barton,The surest test of discipline is its absence.
Clara Barton,"This conflict is one thing I've been waiting for. I'm well and strong and young - young enough to go to the front. If I can't be a soldier, I'll help soldiers."
Clara Barton,The patriot blood of my father was warm in my veins.
Edmund Barton,I say further that our system of education should be unsectarian.
Edmund Barton,The difference between the denominational system and the public school system is all the difference between bolstering them up on the one hand and letting them alone of the other.
Edmund Barton,"A State which has universal suffrage and a wide extension of the jury franchise, must qualify the people by education to rightly exercise the great powers with which they are invested."
Edmund Barton,"I cannot support for a moment any system of education which in the name of denominationalism or under any other name, draws funds from the coffers of the State manifestly for the propagation of creeds and dogmas widely divergent."
Edmund Barton,"If it is the duty of the State to educate, it is the duty of the State also to bear the burden of education, namely, the taxation out of which education is provided."
John Barton,"We have had trouble with the power running game the past four weeks,"
John Barton,"The fact that they were more physical, they could establish anything they wanted on the football field. They have two strong backs. They are strong runners, and we didn't do a good enough job against that."
John Barton,"With this competition the patient ultimately wins out,"
John Barton,Sometimes poetry is inspired by the conversation entered into by reading other poems.
John Barton,No poem is easily grasped; so why should any reader expect fast results?
Rich Barton,We hope this provides transparency so consumers will be able to more aggressively negotiate with service providers.
Rich Barton,"Until now, finding out a current market value of any home, whether it's yours or one you want to bid on, has been quite difficult. We believe you shouldn't need a computer science degree or a real estate license to find out what a home is worth."
Rich Barton,They've never been able to see the whole store. Now we're turning on the lights. Buyers can see home values to avoid overpaying.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,You cannot be happy with your family while being personally unhappy with your work. It's a Catch-22 kind of thing.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,Working is living to me.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,To walk across the street is a risk.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"To achieve some depth in your field requires a lot of sacrifices. Want to or not, you're thinking about what you're doing in life-in my case, dancing."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,The Russian people get so insanely close to each other as friends. Their lives are interrelated so much on an everyday basis.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"People of art should never get married and have children, because it's a selfish experience."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"It's what's left in life, to work with interesting people."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,It's weird when you see pieces of choreography that were done for you 15 or 20 years ago and now they are being done by another dance company.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I was not extremely patriotic about Mother Russia. I played their game, pretending. You have to deal with, you know, party people, KGB. Horrifying."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,I want to do exactly what I want to do. I'd rather gamble on the box office than beg for a grant.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I think art education, especially in this country, which government pretty much ignores, is so important for young people."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I really reject that kind of comparison that says, Oh, he is the best. This is the second best. There is no such thing."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,I kind of lost interest in the classical dance. I was very much interested in the modern choreography.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,I have some Russian friends. But probably only 10 percent. I don't hang out usually in the big Russian communities in Brooklyn and New Jersey.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I have been very lucky to work in so many new ballets, but that is what a dancer's work is."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I go a lot to see young people downtown in little theaters. It's great. If you start somebody's career, it's so exciting."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,I get speeding ticket like everybody else. If the restaurant is full I'm waiting in line like everybody else.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,I feel very uneasy with a lot of aspects of the Russian life and the Russian people.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"Every ballet, whether or not successful artistically or with the public, has given me something important."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,Dancing is my obsession. My life.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,Dancers are stripped enough onstage. You don't have to know more about them than they've given you already.
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"Creative Artists Agency put together a project of extraordinary mediocrity and colossal stupidity. Otherwise, it was great."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"Astaire was not a sexual animal, but he made his partners look so extraordinarily related to him."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,"I cannot belong to a nonprofit organization because when you receive grants, you have to make such great compromises with your artistic plans."
Mikhail Baryshnikov,I am not the first straight dancer or the last.
Gerald Barzan,"I work in a strange business, and trust is a word that's not even in the vocabulary."
Gerald Barzan,"If everybody thought before they spoke, the silence would be deafening"
Gerald Barzan,I do today from memory what yesterday I did in passion
Gerald Barzan,What is the good of being a genius if you cannot use it as an excuse for being unemployed?
Gerald Barzan,You don't have to fool all the people all of the time; you just have to fool enough to get elected
Gerald Barzan,You don't have to fool all the people all of the time; you just have to fool enough to get elected.
Gerald Barzan,The only thing we learn from a new election is we learned nothing from the old
Gerald Barzan,I wish I could be half as sure of anything as some people are of everything.
Gerald Barzan,Doctors and undertakers/ Fear epidemics of good health.
Gerald Barzan,"Forty for you, sixty for me And equal partners we will be"
Gerald Barzan,Absence makes the heart grow wander
Gerald Barzan,Success is the ability to rise above principle.
Massoud Barzani,"In the last decade, major changes took place in the world that gave many people their freedom, ... I would not be surprised to see such changes in our region."
Massoud Barzani,"To get past this crisis, we need a new mechanism in a new place that brings everybody around the table."
Massoud Barzani,"The constitution should not just be ink on paper, ... Until such time, we will adhere to it."
Marcos Basaglia,This is a technical adjustment; it's too soon to talk of optimism. Some stocks showed healthy gains but they were the ones that lost out most.
Marcos Basaglia,The rates prospects are giving courage to people. They want to buy one day before the market rises and many are betting that it will rise more tomorrow.
Marcos Basaglia,"If the government does not have a majority (in Congress), getting its tax objectives and other measures approved would not be so easy."
Marcos Basaglia,Uncertainty over Congress alliances is affecting the market. If it is not resolved -- if the president stays without allies there -- the market reaction may be quite strong.
Marcos Basaglia,"No one really expected a lower rate. It's just that, in the absence of good news, a flat rate added to the profit taking."
Shamil Basayev,I carried out the general operative management.
Shamil Basayev,"Our losses were high because five days before the operation there was a serious leak of information and the infidels brought in an extra 1,000 special forces troops."
Shamil Basayev,This generation will lead us to freedom.
Habibul Bashar,"Our last test performance was not too bad. We made some mistakes in the second innings. If we can overcome them, we can expect a better performance here."
Habibul Bashar,"If you make a postmortem, you will definitely find visible improvement. What made us most happy that we removed the tag that we had been too bad against Sri Lanka in the past. The one-day victory erased bitter memories and I think our Test performance was not bad at all if you consider our previous series."
Habibul Bashar,We would try to play better this time and hopefully force at least for a draw.
Habibul Bashar,It feels really great to win this match. I tell our supporters to be patient and have faith in us. Please continue to back us and we will do it again.
Habibul Bashar,No team could be compared with them but we are counting on the good cricket we've played recently. I have little doubt about the ability of my players and I want stubborn efforts from them.
Habibul Bashar,"The much-awaited win will embolden our confidence, which will help us build a fight against any team in future."
Habibul Bashar,"True, they have lot of world class players and they have been dominating Test cricket for many years. We respect them fully but we are not afraid at all. We've nothing to lose, everything to gain. It will be a great motivation for us."
Habibul Bashar,It was a definite boost for our confidence and self belief.
Matsuo Basho,"[Japanese haiku poets found something morose in the sound, an omen of the cicada's short adult life.] In the cicada's cry, ... no sign can foretell how soon it must die."
Matsuo Basho,Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old; seek what they sought.
Matsuo Basho,Seek not to follow in the footsteps of men of old; seek what they sought.
Jean-Michel Basquiat,"I wanted to be a star, not a gallery mascot."
Jean-Michel Basquiat,I start a picture and I finish it.
Jean-Michel Basquiat,I don't think about art when I'm working. I try to think about life.
Jean-Michel Basquiat,"I am not a black artist, I am an artist."
Jean-Michel Basquiat,"Since I was seventeen I thought I might be a star. I'd think about all my heroes, Charlie Parker, Jimi Hendrix... I had a romantic feeling about how these people became famous."
Jean-Michel Basquiat,I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.
Jean-Michel Basquiat,I thought I was going to be a bum the rest of my life.
Shirley Bassey,I hate it when people come up to me when I'm eating.
Shirley Bassey,"I think men are afraid to be with a successful woman, because we are terribly strong, we know what we want and we are not fragile enough."
Shirley Bassey,Diamonds never leave you... men do!
Shirley Bassey,"I've always been the breadwinner and men don't like that. They turn on you. They bite the hand that feeds them. Eventually, too, they become very jealous of the love one has with an audience."
Shirley Bassey,"I decided to retire from show business at the age of 17, because I didn't like it a bit."
Frederic Bastiat,"Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Sometimes the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons and gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim - when he defends himself - as a criminal."
Frederic Bastiat,We cannot but be astonished at the ease with which men resign themselves to ignorance about what is most important for them to know; and we may be certain that they are determined to remain invincibly ignorant if they once come to consider it as axiomatic that there are no absolute principles.
Frederic Bastiat,"They will come to learn in the end, at their own expense, that it is better to endure competition for rich customers than to be invested with monopoly over impoverished customers."
George Bataille,"Obscenity is our name for the uneasiness which upsets the physical state associated with self-possession, with the possession of a recognized and stable individuality."
George Bataille,"Crime is a fact of the human species, a fact of that species alone, but it is above all the secret aspect, impenetrable and hidden. Crime hides, and by far the most terrifying things are those which elude us."
George Bataille,"Pleasure only starts once the worm has got into the fruit, to become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison."
George Bataille,"Naturally, Love's the most distant possibility."
George Bataille,"To place oneself in the position of God is painful: being God is equivalent to being tortured. For being God means that one is in harmony with all that is, including the worst. The existence of the worst evils is unimaginable unless God willed them."
George Bataille,"Life has always taken place in a tumult without apparent cohesion, but it only finds its grandeur and its reality in ecstasy and in ecstatic love."
George Bataille,I believe that truth has only one face: that of a violent contradiction.
Mario Batali,"I travel around and instead of my showing someone how to cook, I walk in with a completely hands-off approach, and they show me their dishes."
Mario Batali,"I have research assistants, of course."
Mario Batali,"Kids today want to eat their risotto with curry and shrimp and sour cream, not risotto alla Milanese, like they should, in my opinion."
Mario Batali,"My intention is to make sure that we think about it without becoming too intellectual about it. There are pockets of restaurateurs throughout our country right now and in Italy, France, and Spain, who spend all their days figuring out how to confound the customer."
Mario Batali,The proximity to the Mediterranean... it's been a calming influence or just a generally good thing.
Mario Batali,"I like things that are fun, and I look to do them a lot, and that I have the opportunities to do them makes me a lucky guy."
Mario Batali,"This is food that can be made at home without too much shopping,"
Mario Batali,The lighting and the buzz and everything in addition to the food have an impact on what the customer feels.
Mario Batali,"I guess the success of selling this kind of food to New Yorkers is that to them it seems new. Serving the head or the tail or the tongue certainly doesn't make me a pioneer in the real world-although maybe, in New York, in a fancy restaurant, I was a bit of one."
Mario Batali,I think that the rise of a group of people called the slow food movement is doing a lot to try to protect and preserve traditions.
Mario Batali,"I think Italian food is easier to like and love and less intimidating than most. So people overestimate my contribution, not in a bad way or a good way. It's just that my food is simpler than a lot of other chefs' food, and that makes it more accessible, and possibly easier to eat."
Mario Batali,"Think of American food. In my generation, growing up in the '60s and '70s, Banquet Fried Chicken and TV dinners were the thing. Now people are back into roasting their own chickens, and TV dinners are a point of kitsch. It will be interesting to see what survives another hundred years."
Mario Batali,The Food Network is getting a little more entertaining than I would have thought a couple years back. They're in 80 million homes now. This is no longer a niche market.
Mario Batali,The food at my restaurants is mostly the food of Italy's grandmothers.
Mario Batali,"When I was a child, our whole family cooked. All my cousins cooked. All my aunts and uncles cooked. It was part of our heritage."
Mario Batali,"It's more interesting to talk about the whole lily family and say, did you know that lily bulbs are also part of the onion family? It's like the stream-of-consciousness way I think about food when I'm just cooking it."
Mario Batali,"In growing up in Seattle, I don't know a single family that didn't barbecue or cook on the weekends and make its own kind of simple, pared-down, what I call Pacific Northwest cooking."
Mario Batali,"I started to train in economics, and I hated it. I never really entered that world, and went to a cooking school in London. Since then I've been cooking in great places all over the world: mostly California, Italy, and a little bit of France."
Mario Batali,The whole concept of the supremacy of the family unit in the Italian culture... That's all based on the relation of the mom and the children and the bambino.
Mario Batali,"There are all kinds of myths going on in the Italian culture, and the way they celebrate is through their food. It's the tradition of the table where the Italians celebrate most of their triumphs and successes."
Mario Batali,"English food in the last 30 years has come to grips with English products, their dairy culture and their cheeses and their creams and their seafood."
Mario Batali,"Once you become an elaborate and well-developed culture, anything from Rome or the Etruscans, for that matter, the food starts to become a representation of what the culture is. When the food can transcend being just fuel, that's when you start to see these different permutations."
Mario Batali,"Every region has its own specialties, and whether it was Christmas Eve and the seafood dinner and the seven courses, whichever family you were from, it's a visceral part of your life."
Mario Batali,When I was a cook and 24 years old... I read the kinds of books that were the inspiration to understanding the value of simplicity in cooking.
Mario Batali,"To eat the boiled head of a pig sliced like salami is very strange. It may seem cutting edge, but it's actually a lot older than any of the other traditional salami."
Mario Batali,"As they say in Italy, Italians were eating with a knife and fork when the French were still eating each other. The Medici family had to bring their Tuscan cooks up there so they could make something edible."
Mario Batali,"There are pockets of great food in Spain, but there are also pockets of very mediocre food in Spain, and the same in Morocco and the same in Croatia and the same in Germany and the same in Austria."
Mario Batali,There's a battle between what the cook thinks is high art and what the customer just wants to eat.
Mario Batali,"You know, when you get your first asparagus, or your first acorn squash, or your first really good tomato of the season, those are the moments that define the cook's year. I get more excited by that than anything else."
Mario Batali,"I just signed to do my next book with Ecco Press, a new primer or encyclopedia. This will be my take on what classic Italian cooking is."
Mario Batali,"When I was in college, I used to write little ditties and short stories and poetry for my friends. Writing a book is another thing. It is so much different from my traditional day of dirty fingernails and greasy hair and hot pans."
Mario Batali,The passion of the Italian or the Italian-American population is endless for food and lore and everything about it.
Mario Batali,"When I got to college age, my parents suggested, why don't you go to cooking school instead of going to a traditional college? I said that's not for me. That's ridiculous."
Mario Batali,"The Four Seasons wanted me to become the chef, and I didn't feel that at age 28 I was ready to become the chef."
Mario Batali,"We would load up the yellow Cutlass Supreme station wagon and pick blackberries during blackberry season or spring onions during spring onion season. For us, food was part of the fabric of our day."
Mario Batali,"In America, I would say New York and New Orleans are the two most interesting food towns. In New Orleans, they don't have a bad deli. There's no mediocrity accepted."
Daisy Bates,No man or woman who tries to pursue an ideal in his or her own way is without enemies
Daisy Bates,No man or woman who tries to pursue an ideal in his or her won way is without enemies.
Daisy Bates,Opinions differ most when there is least scientific warrant for having any.
Daisy Bates,The man who never makes a mistake always takes orders from one who does. No man or woman who tries to pursue an ideal in his or her own way is without enemies.
David Bates,"combining the results of small, heterogeneous studies does not necessarily bring one closer to the truth."
David Bates,"There's too much of an emphasis on protecting the police. We want the police officers, everyone involved in this, names exposed, none hidden."
David Bates,"With approval from the Scoutmaster, and the right advance planning, patrols of boys in their young teens and up should be able to make brief outings on their own."
David Bates,Scouts are more likely to have an appreciation for things they know something about.
Gregory Bateson,"If we pursue this matter further, we shall be told that the stable object is unchanging under the impact or stress of some particular external or internal variable or, perhaps, that it resists the passage of time."
Gregory Bateson,We do not know enough about how the present will lead into the future.
Gregory Bateson,"To think straight, it is advisable to expect all qualities and attributes, adjectives, and so on to refer to at least two sets of interactions in time."
Gregory Bateson,"There is a strong tendency in explanatory prose to invoke quantities of tension, energy, and whatnot to explain the genesis of pattern. I believe that all such explanations are inappropriate or wrong."
Gregory Bateson,"The processes of perception are inaccessible; only the products are conscious and, of course, it is the products that are necessary."
Gregory Bateson,Synaptic summation is the technical term used in neurophysiology for those instances in which some neuron C is fired only by a combination of neurons A and B.
Gregory Bateson,"Rather, for all objects and experiences, there is a quantity that has optimum value. Above that quantity, the variable becomes toxic. To fall below that value is to be deprived."
Gregory Bateson,"Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those things on the seashores, and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and in the plains."
Gregory Bateson,"Of all these examples, the simplest but the most profound is the fact that it takes at least two somethings to create a difference."
Gregory Bateson,Numbers are the product of counting. Quantities are the product of measurement. This means that numbers can conceivably be accurate because there is a discontinuity between each integer and the next.
Gregory Bateson,Number is different from quantity.
Gregory Bateson,Money is always transitively valued. More money is supposedly always better than less money.
Gregory Bateson,Logic is a poor model of cause and effect.
Gregory Bateson,"Logic can often be reversed, but the effect does not precede the cause."
Gregory Bateson,Language commonly stresses only one side of any interaction.
Gregory Bateson,"It is, I claim, nonsense to say that it does not matter which individual man acted as the nucleus for the change. It is precisely this that makes history unpredictable into the future."
Gregory Bateson,It is to the Riddle of the Sphinx that I have devoted fifty years of professional life as an anthropologist.
Gregory Bateson,"It is of first-class importance that our answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx should be in step with how we conduct our civilisation, and this should in turn be in step with the actual workings of living systems."
Gregory Bateson,"It is impossible, in principle, to explain any pattern by invoking a single quantity."
Gregory Bateson,"Interesting phenomena occur when two or more rhythmic patterns are combined, and these phenomena illustrate very aptly the enrichment of information that occurs when one description is combined with another."
Gregory Bateson,"From the point of view of any agent who imposes a quantitative change, any change of pattern which may occur will be unpredictable or divergent."
Gregory Bateson,But epistemology is always and inevitably personal. The point of the probe is always in the heart of the explorer: What is my answer to the question of the nature of knowing?
Gregory Bateson,All experience is subjective.
Gregory Bateson,A major difficulty is that the answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx is partly a product of the answers that we already have given to the riddle in its various forms.
Gregory Bateson,"In the transmission of human culture, people always attempt to replicate, to pass on to the next generation the skills and values of the parents, but the attempt always fails because cultural transmission is geared to learning, not DNA."
John Batiste,He tended to surround himself with those that support his agenda. He was involved with the selection of flag officers to an unprecedented level.
John Batiste,"And as I recall, the secretary didn't even go to his retirement ceremony; I have never forgotten that."
John Batiste,"I believe we need a fresh start in the Pentagon. We need a leader who understands teamwork, a leader who knows how to build teams, a leader that does it without intimidation. You know, it speaks volumes that guys like me are speaking out."
Vijay Batra,The crossing marked the resumption of the stalled bus service.
Vijay Batra,"In the retaliatory fire, three militants died."
Vijay Batra,"The two were asked to stop, but they opened fire prompting troops to return fire. Their identity is being ascertained."
Shane Battier,"In reality, we're trying to win every game. That's the bottom line."
Shane Battier,We're playing to win. I've always been of the mind-frame that you've got to play.
Shane Battier,Our offensive and defensive execution was poor when it mattered. We couldn't get a stop when we needed it.
Shane Battier,"We played a team (Tuesday) that really wasn't sharp in their execution, and if we can do that against the playoff teams, then we'll be a lot more excited."
Shane Battier,Hubie treats Brendan just like every other coach. He yells at him just as much.
Shane Battier,"Brad is an excellent choice, he can shoot it, pass it and defend on the perimeter. I think if we've learned anything it's that teams that have had success (in the Olympics) have done it with team play. I like that we are picking a team that can play together."
Shane Battier,We've put in a good body of work. It's time to take it to a higher gear.
Duggar Baucom,"Their pressure was intense. We worked on that, but you can't simulate that in practice. Intimidation, I think, is the best word for it. They took our candy and we couldn't do anything about it."
Duggar Baucom,It was the longest season of my life. Without a doubt.
Duggar Baucom,"Basically two starters. Willie didn't start, but he finished the games. We've faced some adversity, but we'll get back together."
Charles Baudelaire,On the day when a young writer corrects his first proof-sheet he is as proud as a schoolboy who has just got his first dose of pox.
Charles Baudelaire,"The being who, for most men, is the source of the most lively, and even, be it said, to the shame of philosophical delights, the most lasting joys; the being towards or for whom all their efforts tend for whom and by whom fortunes are made and lost; for whom, but especially by whom, artists and poets compose their most delicate jewels; from whom flow the most enervating pleasures and the most enriching sufferings -- woman, in a word, is not, for the artist in general... only the female of the human species. She is rather a divinity, a star."
Charles Baudelaire,"There are in every man, always, two simultaneous allegiances, one to God, the other to Satan. Invocation of God, or Spirituality, is a desire to climb higher; that of Satan, or animality, is delight in descent."
Charles Baudelaire,"For the perfect idler, for the passionate observer it becomes an immense source of enjoyment to establish his dwelling in the throng, in the ebb and flow, the bustle, the fleeting and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel at home anywhere; to see the world, to be at the very center of the world, and yet to be unseen of the world, such are some of the minor pleasures of those independent, intense and impartial spirits, who do not lend themselves easily to linguistic definitions. The observer is a prince enjoying his incognito wherever he goes."
Charles Baudelaire,"In putting off what one has to do, one runs the risk of never being able to do it."
Charles Baudelaire,"Who among us has not, in moments of ambition, dreamt of the miracle of a form of poetic prose, musical but without rhythm and rhyme, both supple and staccato enough to adapt itself to the lyrical movements of our souls, the undulating movements of our reveries, and the convulsive movements of our consciences? This obsessive ideal springs above all from frequent contact with enormous cities, from the junction of their innumerable connections."
Charles Baudelaire,"I have cultivated my hysteria with delight and terror. Now I suffer continually from vertigo, and today, 23rd of January, 1862, I have received a singular warning, I have felt the wind of the wing of madness pass over me."
Charles Baudelaire,"I have to confess that I had gambled on my soul and lost it with heroic insouciance and lightness of touch. The soul is so impalpable, so often useless, and sometimes such a nuisance, that I felt no more emotion on losing it than if, on a stroll, I had mislaid my visiting card."
Charles Baudelaire,What is exhilarating in bad taste is the aristocratic pleasure of giving offense.
Charles Baudelaire,"All fashions are charming, or rather relatively charming, each one being a new striving, more or less well conceived, after beauty, an approximate statement of an ideal, the desire for which constantly teases the unsatisfied human mind."
Charles Baudelaire,Inspiration comes of working every day.
Charles Baudelaire,"True Civilization does not lie in gas, nor in steam, nor in turn-tables. It lies in the reduction of the traces of original sin."
Charles Baudelaire,"Genius is no more than childhood recaptured at will, childhood equipped now with man's physical means to express itself, and with the analytical mind that enables it to bring order into the sum of experience, involuntarily amassed."
Charles Baudelaire,"As the end of the century approaches, all our culture is like flies at the beginning of winter. Having lost their agility, dreamy and demented, they turn slowly about the window in the first icy mists of morning, . . . [then] they fall down the curtains."
Charles Baudelaire,This life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed with a desire to change his bed.
Charles Baudelaire,"All forms of beauty, like all possible phenomena, contain an element of the eternal and an element of the transitory -- of the absolute and of the particular. Absolute and eternal beauty does not exist, or rather it is only an abstraction creamed from the general surface of different beauties. The particular element in each manifestation comes from the emotions: and just as we have our own particular emotions, so we have our own beauty."
Charles Baudelaire,There are as many kinds of beauty as there are habitual ways of seeking happiness.
Charles Baudelaire,"The pleasure we derive from the representation of the present is due, not only to the beauty it can be clothed in, but also to its essential quality of being the present."
Charles Baudelaire,"All forms of beauty, like all possible phenomena, contain an element of the eternal and an element of the transitory / of the absolute and of the particular. Absolute and eternal beauty does not exist, or rather it is only an abstraction creamed from the general surface of different beauties. The particular element in each manifestation comes from the emotions: and just as we have our own particular emotions, so we have our own beauty."
Charles Baudelaire,"There exist certain individuals who are, by nature, given purely to contemplation and are utterly unsuited to action, and who, nevertheless, under a mysterious and unknown impulse, sometimes act with a speed which they themselves would have thought beyond them."
Charles Baudelaire,Any healthy man can go without food for two days - but not without poetry.
Charles Baudelaire,"Always be a poet, even in prose."
Charles Baudelaire,Those men get along best with women who can get along best without them.
Charles Baudelaire,"For the merchant, even honesty is a financial speculation."
Charles Baudelaire,"Even in the centuries which appear to us to be the most monstrous and foolish, the immortal appetite for beauty has always found satisfaction."
Charles Baudelaire,"Beauty is the sole ambition, the exclusive goal of Taste."
Jean Baudrillard,"We have dreamt of every woman there is, and dreamt too of the miracle that would bring us the pleasure of being a woman, for women have all the qualities -- courage, passion, the capacity to love, cunning -- whereas all our imagination can do is naively pile up the illusion of courage."
Jean Baudrillard,"Terror is as much a part of the concept of truth as runniness is of the concept of jam. We wouldn't like jam if it didn't, by its very nature, ooze. We wouldn't like truth if it wasn't sticky, if, from time to time, it didn't ooze blood."
Jean Baudrillard,"With the truth, you need to get rid of it as soon as possible and pass it on to someone else. As with illness, this is the only way to be cured of it. The person who keeps truth in his hands has lost."
Jean Baudrillard,The surprises of thought are like those of love: they wear out. But here too you can carry on for a long time doing your conjugal duty.
Jean Baudrillard,"Smile and others will smile back. Smile to show how transparent, how candid you are. Smile if you have nothing to say. Most of all, do not hide the fact you have nothing to say nor your total indifference to others. Let this emptiness, this profound indifference shine out spontaneously in your smile."
Jean Baudrillard,"The price we pay for the complexity of life is too high. When you think of all the effort you have to put in --telephonic, technological and relational --to alter even the slightest bit of behavior in this strange world we call social life, you are left pining for the straightforwardness of primitive peoples and their physical work."
Jean Baudrillard,"Executives are like joggers. If you stop a jogger, he goes on running on the spot. If you drag an executive away from his business, he goes on running on the spot, pawing the ground, talking business. He never stops hurtling onwards, making decisions and executing them."
Jean Baudrillard,"We have dreamt of every woman there is, and dreamt too of the miracle that would bring us the pleasure of being a woman, for women have all the qualities / courage, passion, the capacity to love, cunning / whereas all our imagination can do is naively pile up the illusion of courage."
Jean Baudrillard,"The skylines lit up at dead of night, the air-conditioning systems cooling empty hotels in the desert, and artificial light in the middle of the day all have something both demented and admirable about them: the mindless luxury of a rich civilization"
Jean Baudrillard,"Mistakes, scandals, and failures no longer signal catastrophe. The crucial thing is that they be made credible, and that the public be made aware of the efforts being expended in that direction. The ''marketing'' immunity of governments is similar to that of the major brands of washing powder."
Jean Baudrillard,Every woman is like a time-zone. She is a nocturnal fragment of your journey. She brings you unflaggingly closer to the next night.
Jean Baudrillard,"Laughter on American television has taken the place of the chorus in Greek tragedy. In other countries, the business of laughing is left to the viewers. Here, their laughter is put on the screen, integrated into the show. It is the screen that is laughing and having a good time. You are simply left alone with your consternation."
Jean Baudrillard,"If everything is perfect, language is useless. This is true for animals. If animals don't speak, it's because everything's perfect for them. If one day they start to speak, it will be because the world has lost a certain sort of perfection."
Jean Baudrillard,"If we consider the superiority of the human species, the size of its brain, its powers of thinking, language and organization, we can say this: were there the slightest possibility that another rival or superior species might appear, on earth or elsewhere, man would use every means at his disposal to destroy it."
Jean Baudrillard,At the heart of pornography is sexuality haunted by its own disappearance
Jean Baudrillard,Genius is childhood recaptured.
Jean Baudrillard,"One of life's primal situations; the game of hide and seek. Oh, the delicious thrill of hiding while the others come looking for you, the delicious terror of being discovered, but what panic when, after a long search, the others abandon you! You mustn't hide too well. You mustn't be too good at the game. The player must never be bigger than the game itself."
Jean Baudrillard,What is a society without a heroic dimension?
Jean Baudrillard,We shall never resolve the enigma of the relation between the negative foundations of greatness and that greatness itself.
Jean Baudrillard,The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.
Jean Baudrillard,"If you say, I love you, then you have already fallen in love with language, which is already a form of break up and infidelity."
Jean Baudrillard,"As for freedom, it will soon cease to exist in any shape or form. Living will depend upon absolute obedience to a strict set of arrangements, which it will no longer be possible to transgress. The air traveler is not free. In the future, life's passengers will be even less so: they will travel through their lives fastened to their (corporate) seats."
Jean Baudrillard,"In days gone by, we were afraid of dying in dishonor or a state of sin. Nowadays, we are afraid of dying fools. Now the fact is that there is no Extreme Unction to absolve us of foolishness. We endure it here on earth as subjective eternity."
Jean Baudrillard,"Sadder than destitution, sadder than a beggar is the man who eats alone in public. Nothing more contradicts the laws of man or beast, for animals always do each other the honor of sharing or disputing each other's food."
Jean Baudrillard,"Fiction is not imagination. It is what anticipates imagination by giving it the form of reality. This is quite opposite to our own natural tendency which is to anticipate reality by imagining it, or to flee from it by idealizing it. That is why we shall never inhabit true fiction; we are condemned to the imaginary and nostalgia for the future."
Jean Baudrillard,Perhaps our eyes are merely a blank film which is taken from us after our deaths to be developed elsewhere and screened as our life story in some infernal cinema or dispatched as microfilm into the sidereal void.
Jean Baudrillard,A society which allows an abominable event to burgeon from its dung heap and grow on its surface is like a man who lets a fly crawl unheeded across his face or saliva dribble from his mouth -- either epileptic or dead.
Jean Baudrillard,"You need an infinite stretch of time ahead of you to start to think, infinite energy to make the smallest decision. The world is getting denser. The immense number of useless projects is bewildering. Too many things have to be put in to balance up an uncertain scale. You can't disappear anymore. You die in a state of total indecision."
Jean Baudrillard,"Here in the U.S., culture is not that delicious panacea which we Europeans consume in a sacramental mental space and which has its own special columns in the newspapers -- and in people's minds. Culture is space, speed, cinema, technology. This culture is authentic, if anything can be said to be authentic."
Jean Baudrillard,"Computer science only indicates the retrospective omnipotence of our technologies. In other words, an infinite capacity to process data (but only data -- i.e. the already given) and in no sense a new vision. With that science, we are entering an era of exhaustivity, which is also an era of exhaustion."
Jean Baudrillard,"The skylines lit up at dead of night, the air-conditioning systems cooling empty hotels in the desert and artificial light in the middle of the day all have something both demented and admirable about them. The mindless luxury of a rich civilization, and yet of a civilization perhaps as scared to see the lights go out as was the hunter in his primitive night."
Jean Baudrillard,"A woman spent all Christmas Day in a telephone box without ringing anyone. If someone comes to phone, she leaves the box, then resumes her place afterwards. No one calls her either, but from a window in the street, someone watched her all day, no doubt since they had nothing better to do. The Christmas syndrome."
Jean Baudrillard,"Cities are distinguished by the catastrophic forms they presuppose and which are a vital part of their essential charm. New York is King Kong, or the blackout, or vertical bombardment: Towering Inferno. Los Angeles is the horizontal fault, California breaking off and sliding into the Pacific: Earthquake."
Jean Baudrillard,"Democracy is the menopause of Western society, the Grand Climacteric of the body social. Fascism is its middle-aged lust."
Jean Baudrillard,If you are prepared to accept the consequences of your dreams then you must still regard America today with the same naive enthusiasm as the generations that discovered the New World.
Jean Baudrillard,"The sumptuous age of stars and images is reduced to a few artificial tornado effects, pathetic fake buildings, and childish tricks which the crowd pretends to be taken in by to avoid feeling too disappointed. Ghost towns, ghost people. The whole place has the same air of obsolescence about it as Sunset or Hollywood Boulevard."
Jean Baudrillard,Governing today means giving acceptable signs of credibility. It is like advertising and it is the same effect that is achieved - commitment to a scenario.
Jean Baudrillard,"Man has lost the basic skill of the ape, the ability to scratch its back. Which gave it extraordinary independence, and the liberty to associate for reasons other than the need for mutual back-scratching."
Vicki Baum,Success is as ice cold and lonely as the North Pole.
Vicki Baum,Fame always brings loneliness.
Vicki Baum,A woman who is loved always has success.
Vicki Baum,Pity is the deadliest feeling that can be offered to a woman.
Vicki Baum,Marriage always demands the greatest understanding of the art of insincerity possible between two human beings.
Vicki Baum,You don't get ulcers from what you eat. You get them from what's eating you.
Vicki Baum,Fame always brings loneliness. Success is as ice cold and lonely as the North Pole.
Richard Bavaria,So many parents were asking us for this. We were just responding to what they wanted.
Richard Bavaria,It's very helpful if parents have some sort of calendar that is large enough and is posted in a prominent place. In one color you have written when the science fair project is due. And then you backtrack from that date breaking down that science fair project into manageable chunks of time. Great big projects tend to scare kids.
Richard Bavaria,I've seen some kids as young as second or third grade use planners ... the very elementary planners. Letting kids see that a planner can help them get their projects done and organize their time at home can be very helpful.
Richard Bavaria,"I think the child psychologists are well-intentioned and are speaking for a good number of children, but education is too complicated to be governed by black and white rules."
Richard Bavaria,Homework routines are important. A mistake that many parents want to make is that all their children have exactly the same routine for homework. And any parent with more than one child can tell you that children learn differently from each other.
Allison Baver,"It really breaks my heart to watch that. I know he's the best skater in the world, and he really didn't have a chance to show that. But the Olympics aren't over."
Allison Baver,"It really breaks my heart to see it, because I know he's the best skater in the world in my eyes. But the Olympics are not over."
Allison Baver,"Once I got there and started skating every day, I knew I had to make a full commitment. Somebody told me, a coach a long time ago, that if you want to make the Olympic team, you have to dedicate your entire life, sacrifice everything. I wasn't ready to do that before."
Jason Bay,"You know what? My main thing is going to be trying to be consistent. Those numbers I put up last year and the protection we'll have this year, I think that's going to help me maintain that."
Jason Bay,Great. To see all these people here the past two days--it's just impressive.
Jason Bay,"This game is all about momentum, ... I think last night had (it) rolling through tonight. Momentum is what carries you. Whether you're 30 games back to three games back, momentum can break the spell and help win games."
Jason Bay,"The neat thing about this tournament is the nature of it, and how quick it is. A nice win here, you step it up in one game, and all of a sudden people take note, not just of the team but the players on it."
Jason Bay,"It speaks volumes, I think, that this team went out and spent the money it did this winter, especially after there wasn't a lot spent the previous few years. I hope everybody realizes now that there are two ways to get better: One is to give up young talent in trades, which you don't want to do. The other is to spend money out of pocket to fill needs. We did it right."
Jason Bay,"It's not as distracting as I thought it would be, ... It's in the back of your mind. For anyone to totally forget about that is not human. At the same time, I've dealt with a lot of distractions all year with the All-Star game and the 'sophomore slump.'"
Jason Bay,"It's fun, but it's nerve-wracking,"
Jason Bay,"We showed a little bit of character coming back. With the way we were going, we could have easily rolled over."
Jason Bay,"This whole weekend, all these people--it just speaks volumes about our fans. They still love baseball here."
Michael Bay,"The psychological root behind this competitive streak is that I was an athlete when I was young and took sports really seriously. I look at directing as a sporting event. It's a race, a marathon. It's great when it clicks - which is why I push my crews so hard so we can excel."
Michael Bay,"I love doing big movies. It's awesome! You have all these toys. The thing I like about this movie is, like they always say, directors have the biggest train sets! Don't tell anyone, but I'd do this for free."
Michael Bay,"It's great that I get accused of not being politically correct. People need to take themselves less seriously. This world is so screwed up as it is, we've all got to relax a bit more."
Michael Bay,"I can be very reserved about things. My business side isn't shy. I can be like a general. But I've got a shy side. I'm also a lot deeper than people think, and a lot more sensitive. But I don't let people in too much.'"
Michael Bay,"I'm at that point in my life where I definitely want to get married soon. I've got my dogs as surrogates, but I'm ready for kids.'"
Michael Bay,"It's... a hard thing for a director, to think you came up with a shot, something from your mind, and someone died while doing it. It's the worst thing you'll ever have to live with. It was very hard for me to get back on the horse again."
Michael Bay,A lot of directors don't want the pressure of a movie the size of Pearl Harbor. But I love it. I thrive on it.
Michael Bay,"The press don't like to say nice things because nice is boring. It's much better to label me the devil. What we do is not brain surgery. We are entertainers, plain and simple, and we're responsible to bring that money back, to make a profit."
Michael Bay,I go out there to win. People don't care if you die in this business. The only way I get back is with success.
Michael Bay,I allow a lot of room for improvisation and funny stuff. I always feel planned.
Michael Bay,"For me, the great joy is to watch an audience watching what I've made. To hear not a peep from the audience at the right moment, and then to hear the laughs and the cheers."
Michael Bay,Maybe I have just a younger voice than many other directors.
Michael Bay,It is really cool to have created a movie that has turned out to become the biggest movie of the year.
Michael Bay,"What I look for in a script is something that challenges me, something that breaks new ground, something that allows me to flex my director muscle. You have got to think fast in this business, you've got to keep reinventing yourself to stay on top."
Michael Bay,Everybody knows about Pearl Harbor. The thing that really fascinated me is that through this tragedy there was this amazing American heroism.
Michael Bay,"We don't make movies for critics. I've done four movies; there's millions upon millions upon millions of people who've paid to see them. Somebody likes them. My greatest joy is to sit anonymously in a dark theater and watch it with an audience, a paying audience."
Michael Bay,"I don't see anything wrong with spending a lot of money to make big action movies to entertain people. Yet somehow, I come under special scrutiny. I mean, why don't people get upset if Dow spends $300 million to invent some new chemical? Audiences like popcorn movies. What's wrong with that?"
Michael Bay,Fast cars are my only vice.
Richard Bayer,They need someone who can hit the ground running.
Richard Bayer,We've received literally hundreds of inquiries over the past several days as the students and their families try to determine what their next steps should be.
Richard Bayer,Be happy in that job interview.
Richard Bayer,Trying to do too many difficult things at once is a recipe for failure.
Richard Bayer,"Most good work habits are just common sense, Don't stick beans up your nostrils."
Elgin Baylor,"It was a terrific trade. I wouldn't say it was our best trade ever. I don't want to say that, because we traded for (Elton) Brand and we traded for Ron Harper. But, yeah, it has worked out well. It has been a great trade, but you have to see the end results. Hopefully, we'll continue to play like this."
Elgin Baylor,Coaching is easy. Winning is the hard part.
Elgin Baylor,"If you look up the definition of greatness in the dictionary, it will say Michael Jordan."
Elgin Baylor,"Not only do I admire Jordan's accomplishments and his phenomenal basketball ability, but also the way he has conducted himself on and off the court. I don't think there will ever be another player to have the same impact on the game of basketball as Michael Jordan."
Stephanie Beacham,What I mean to say is that I'm old enough now and confident enough now not to be frightened of any of the possibilities life might offer.
Stephanie Beacham,To this day I will not be called Steph.
Stephanie Beacham,One of the reasons I wanted to teach deaf children was because it made me very sad that they spoke so clumsily and that they moved with less grace that I knew was possible of deaf people.
Stephanie Beacham,Nothing is going to improve my hearing. I've only got to prevent it from getting worse.
Stephanie Beacham,I'm the one by the backdoor - I am not the one in the middle of the party.
Stephanie Beacham,I took some classes in sign language when I was in my early teens because I was told that I would be completely deaf very early. But I never really wanted to learn.
Stephanie Beacham,I have to concentrate more intently when people speak. I always have to position myself on their right side so that I can hear out of my left ear. I sometimes get a crick in my neck from listening. But I don't there's too much else.
Stephanie Beacham,I genuinely enjoy talking one-to-one. I have no shyness about that.
Stephanie Beacham,I can not remember even thinking that I was deaf when I was dancing.
Stephanie Beacham,But I am completely confused in a room full of people. I don't hear a word anybody says. I'm not able to enjoy parties for that reason.
Stephanie Beacham,"But as far as my work is concerned, I see no impediment, and various advantages, to being deaf."
Frank Beamer,I didn't think I was going to accept the job when I went there to visit. I had no idea I was going to like it.
Frank Beamer,"We usually have four. The voting was so close, we went with all six."
Frank Beamer,"I knew there was one kind soul . . . you stand out in this crowd,"
Frank Beamer,"I remember watching him at Highland Springs (High School, near Richmond), and when I recruited him I told him my plan was to get him on offense some and get him on defense some, and I think he's the kind of guy that can handle it. I think he's got that kind of ability."
Frank Beamer,We asked Ike to get some things done and he has made progress in that regard. ...I feel comfortable that Ike will work hard to be a successful part of this football program.
Frank Beamer,We're not a turnover team. It was just kind of freaky tonight.
Frank Beamer,They knew what needed to be done. I think they did a great job of going back out there and quickly taking the game back over.
Frank Beamer,Marcus has been consistently getting better. Every week you see a little improvement.
Frank Beamer,"We take pride in our program in doing things right . . . just too many things that weren't quite right, ... I hate to see anyone's story here not be successful. You want it to turn out right, you work for it to come out right. Just too many situations. I thought this was what's best for our football team."
Frank Beamer,"That's what happens when you start thinking everything's OK, that 'hey, we're a good football team,' ... We were then and we are now. You've got to prove it every week. Certainly, this week we're going to be challenged."
Frank Beamer,This is our last opportunity to show we're a good football team. I believe this is one of the best football teams Virginia Tech has ever had. Getting to 11 wins would be something--and so would finishing in the top 10.
Frank Beamer,"I think both of those kids will play as hard as they can against each other. Knowing that family, I bet it'll be close afterwards, too. ... His sister (Christina) goes to school here. The whole family is close."
Frank Beamer,They got us field position and then the offense stuck it in. It's still a team game. I still believe our offense is going to get more consistency as we go along.
Frank Beamer,He's not just a big back. He's a big back who has that breakaway ability. He's really quick and a great athlete.
Frank Beamer,"I'm proud that we demonstrated to the ACC that we were a good pick. We've got the ability to be a good program for them. I think they knew that, but I think a lot of people didn't think we were going to be that this year."
Frank Beamer,"I think he takes pride in sitting in there and throwing the football, ... But people that have the ability that he has ? Michael and Marcus ? they've got to take off when they feel the need to take off. That's what he does."
Billy Beane,"I don't think there's any question, ... that we need Jermaine to be his old self."
Billy Beane,"We have four very good rookies, but at the risk of saying it before the season is over, it would be pretty tough to find an explanation for choosing somebody else."
Billy Beane,"You could get carried away with the superlatives. Not just his power, but his selectivity at the plate. That type of approach can carry over to the other guys in the lineup."
Billy Beane,"It's something we didn't know about, but he came forward with the information, so I commend him for that."
Billy Beane,"For us, it was an opportunity to add a player without subtracting a player. Our history here, usually we're trading a player to acquire a player."
Billy Beane,"There was a real sense of determination in talking to him. You could get carried away with superlatives with Frank Thomas. Arguably, he is one of the greatest offensive players of his generation."
Billy Beane,Frank believes he'll be ready in spring training. There was a real sense of determination in talking to him.
Billy Beane,There are no hard feelings whatsoever. This is part of the business.
Billy Beane,"Lenny was so perfectly designed, emotionally, to play the game of baseball. He was able to instantly forget any failure and draw strength from every success. He had no concept of failure. And he had no idea of where he was."
Billy Beane,"Do I wish everybody in baseball had the same amount to spend? Absolutely. At some point, the disadvantage of being a small-market team is that the inefficiencies will be weeded out. Having less than your competitor is never an advantage."
Billy Beane,This guy's skill level and ability is undeniable. Frank Thomas is a presence.
Amy Beaner,She's running very consistently. She's a smart racer.
Amy Beaner,Alyssa Snyder had a really good race. She started out farther back and moved her way up throughout the race.
Amy Beaner,Collectively she's taken a lot of time off her race.
Amy Beaner,She had such a huge lead. We were all just in awe as we watched her race.
Amy Beaner,I thought the girls ran really well. Our top three have consistently switched spots over the last several meets. It's nice to see them running that tight. We're trying to encourage the other girls to close the gap.
Amy Beaner,"Looking at the girls that were in front of them, I was not disappointed in that. I thought they competed hard."
Amy Beaner,"It was tough competition today, but I do think it was good for the girls to have that competition."
Amy Beaner,All of our boys competed really hard today. I was really happy with the outcome.
Amy Beaner,"The last two meets, I've seen a lot of improvement in the boys' team, which is good to see. We hope to peak at the right time and this is the time we want to start to see that."
Amy Beaner,"Our boys are a little disappointed, but individually I thought they competed hard and that's all you can ask."
Amy Beaner,I thought our boys ran well.
Standing Bear,"That the Indians possess the inherent right of expatriation as well as the more fortunate white race, and have the inalienable right to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,' so long as they obey the laws and do not trespass on forbidden ground."
Standing Bear,We lived on our land as long as we can remember. The land was owned by our tribe as far back as memory of men goes.
Standing Bear,"My first years were spent living just as my forefathers had lived - roaming the green, rolling hills of what are now the states of South Dakota and Nebraska."
Standing Bear,"And when native man left off this form of development, his humanization was retarded in growth."
Standing Bear,Man's heart away from nature becomes hard.
Mary Beard,The dogma of woman's complete historical subjection to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind
Mary Beard,The volumes which record the history of the human race are filled with the deeds and the words of great men . . . [but] The Twentieth Century Woman . . . questions the completeness of the story.
Mary Beard,"Viewed narrowly, all life is universal hunger and the expression of energy associated with it."
Mary Beard,"While it is generally agreed that the visible expressions and agencies are necessary instruments, civilization seems to depend far more fundamentally upon the moral and intellectual qualities of human beings -- upon the spirit that animates mankind."
Mary Beard,"In their (women) quest for rights they have naturally placed emphasis on their wrongs rather than their achievements and possessions, and have retold history as a story of their long martyrdom"
The Beatles,"Life is very short and there's no time, for fussing and fighting my friend. I have always thought that it's a crime, so I will ask you once again: try to see it my way, only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. While you see it your way, there's a chance that we might fall apart before too long. We can work it out."
The Beatles,"And in the end, the love we take will be equal to the love we make."
The Beatles,"[In A Twist of Lennon, Cynthia was reluctant to speak ill of anyone, even Yoko, whom she did not blame for taking John because] he had never been mine ... Dad's always telling people to love each other, but how come he doesn't love me?"
Peter Beattie,"I told him he probably knows more about money than the bloke in Canberra,"
Peter Beattie,"The declaration opens the way for the company to begin an environmental impact statement for the refinery and associated pipelines and present it to my Government for consideration by October 2006,"
Peter Beattie,"The existing laws do provide certain circumstances where shoot-to-kill applies and they have to apply in those circumstances,"
David Beaty,It was the first time I didn't work on straight commission. It wasn't like a big sacrifice at all. It was a joy to make the transition.
David Beaty,There are other places that have basalt. But this is a well-known research lab that had good potential for scientific synergy.
David Beaty,"They just have a broad knowledge of life, and they have a broad range of skills."
Adrian Bebb,The EU is going to be bruised. It might be a moral victory for industry but that's about it. It's fairly obvious that they (WTO) will come out against the national bans.
Adrian Bebb,We welcome the Commission acknowledging there is a problem. Europe's food safety net is clearly not working and so the approvals of new genetically modified foods should be halted until the public is fully protected.

Britt Beemer,Electronics continue to lead all categories in year-over-year sales growth for the holidays.
Britt Beemer,I probably would produce a little four-minute video mailer explaining exactly what happened and expressing remorseful feelings.
Britt Beemer,"[The two executives are also swapping territories. Menzer, 54, will take over the U.S. business after serving as chief executive officer of Wal-Mart International. Duke, 55, will run the international division after heading Wal-Mart Stores U.S. A.] Its interesting they flipped the jobs, ... They want the future CEO to have experience on the domestic and international side equally. It may be that Wal-Mart looks at the international side as equal to the U.S."
Britt Beemer,"High hotel rates that border on price gouging are the single biggest issue that I hear retailers complaining about, and they usually use the word 'abuse' in their complaint,"
Britt Beemer,"It's a typical, mediocre Christmas season. But we've gone through the last years with no hot new toy and no hot apparel look. There's no reason to shop early."
Britt Beemer,I've never seen this many consumers not done with their Christmas shopping.
Britt Beemer,"I think retailers will hold prices up to 40 percent off before Christmas and then go even deeper in January to clear inventory. No doubt, heavy discounts help sales but they hurt profits. And retailers, more than ever, know that they have to answer to Wall Street and not Main Street."
Britt Beemer,"The closer you get to Christmas, there's this mentality on the part of consumers where they're willing to go out just a little bit more to get the even bigger discounts."
Britt Beemer,I don't think the day is the kind of day that retailers thought it would be. Christmas Eve is seldom the big day because of the fact that so many consumers ... want to be home.
Britt Beemer,One thing that shocked me was that the number of consumers planning to buy gift cards this Christmas is not as big as last year.
Britt Beemer,"[The two executives are also swapping territories. Menzer, 54, will take over the U.S. business after serving as chief executive officer of Wal-Mart International.

They want the future CEO to have experience on the domestic and international side equally. It may be that Wal-Mart looks at the international side as equal to the U.S."
Britt Beemer,"I think they've got to be aggressive and to make Martha more accessible initially, ... America has got to know that she's not the same defiant Martha she was before. That's the challenge. If she can be humble through all of this, I think America will forgive her."
Britt Beemer,"One in five people are being impacted by all these advertising lawyers on television, telling Americans it's not a problem."
Britt Beemer,Wal-Mart deserves their high admiration level because they do what they say. They give America a place to buy at low prices in stores where employees seem happy to be there and willing to assist customers when questions are asked.
Leo Beenhakker,"We all travel on the third and we will also send one member of staff to see the Mexico/Guatemala game just to have the latest update before we play them. We already know Panama and it's down to us now to prepare well and get the job completed,"
Leo Beenhakker,The preparations with the local players will begin during that period and it gives us an opportunity to not only work with the guys who are currently on the team but also to see some others because we are also looking at one or two from other leagues in Europe.
Leo Beenhakker,A hobby is only fun if you do not have time to do it
Leo Beenhakker,"It seems that a lot of people forget that after the World Cup, there is still a lot of football."
Leo Beenhakker,"I'm so proud of the players and for the people of the whole country,"
Ludwig Beethoven,I despise a world which does not feel that music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy
Ludwig Beethoven,"Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy, it is the wine of a new procreation, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for men and makes them drunk with the spirit."
Ludwig Beethoven,"Music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken."

Ludwig Beethoven,Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.
Ludwig Beethoven,"Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears from the eyes of woman."

Ludwig Beethoven,"Recommend virtue to your children; it alone, not money, can make them happy. I speak from experience."
Ludwig Beethoven,"Recommend virtue to your children, that alone - not wealth - can give happiness. It upholds in adversity and the thought of it and my art prevents me from putting an end to my life."
Ludwig van Beethoven,"The barriers are not erected which can say to aspiring talents and industry, ''Thus far and no farther.''"
Ludwig van Beethoven,"Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears form the eyes of woman."

Ludwig van Beethoven,"Never shall I forget the time I spent with you. Please continue to be my friend, as you will always find me yours."
Ludwig van Beethoven,Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.

Greg Behrendt,It's your version of whatever that is. We use those words because they are kind of empowering. Try to get back into your life and get back on track with dreams you have. There's nothing more attractive than a person who likes herself.
Greg Behrendt,"I'm fascinated with human relationships, ... I advocate the relationship you have with yourself."
Greg Behrendt,"It's the prettiest place on the planet, ... My childhood was like a dream. It's like the last Mayberry."

John Beilein,Good players are worth nothing if you don't have good chemistry. Good players are good teammates.
John Beilein,We learned at Syracuse that we had to attack inside and outside for scoring success. It's rare that you see a game where we shoot twenty-some percent (from 3-point range) and win.
John Beilein,It felt like 10 years ago that we had beaten a really good team. We didn't have that quality win yet.
John Beilein,Things were very quiet in the locker room. And then I asked for a moment of prayer.
John Beilein,What's good about it is we played both Pitt and Louisville the past two weeks. We'll be prepared to make the final adjustments Thursday afternoon.
John Beilein,Tonight's game wasn't about who had better players or better coaches. That shot was all about luck. We had some good luck and they had some bad.
John Beilein,"He's a one in a million kid. With English as his second language, it's certainly a unique situation."
John Beilein,"He's really done a tremendous job. For them to have the wins they've had, to win at Syracuse. Villanova was not a win for them, but it was a heck of a loss."
John Beilein,"He's getting there, ... It's going to take a lot of hard work. Our hope is that Kevin will be able to outrun and out-condition the centers we play against. He's going to play a lot of minutes if he can do that."
John Beilein,They showed me so much courage.
John Beilein,We couldn't have done it without the crowd. It's a lot easier to dive for those loose balls when the crowd's behind you.
John Beilein,It seems like a year ago that we played. I don't know if it's an advantage playing a team a second time.
john bejo,"In our world where everything is a number, struggle to be a plus to anybody, rather than a minus."
john bejo,To speak what's right is not hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is when you stop fighting for what is right because you thought you're guilty. Everybody is guilty.

john bejo,"Today, I will stand in front of the mirror and tell my self 'I love every piece of you for you're God's masterpiece?"
john bejo,"Every love story is a leap of faith. There is no such thing 100% sure, we know that. Each step of the way is a risk and an adventure. Love is putting our trust in a person who could mold or break us, who could neglect or take care of us. Faith starts where reason ends..."
Kenenisa Bekele,I knew I was in record shape coming into the race but sometimes the pace of the race doesn't go your way. The third lap slowed right down and I just couldn't get back onto the pace after that.
Kenenisa Bekele,It was a great race.
Kenenisa Bekele,Today's race was tough because of the wind. The wind made it hard to break away and I needed every ounce of strength to pull away from the other runners.
Kenenisa Bekele,It was a very close race. This course is flat and there was a lot of wind today and that was the reason.
Kenenisa Bekele,"The race was very fantastic, ... Today, I had my brother with me. He did everything very good. Today, everything was perfect."
Kenenisa Bekele,"It is for me a difficult race. I had never raced under 3,000 meters, so this is a very tough race for me. Maybe for the future it gives me confidence to improve. I'm not disappointed because it's my first time."
Kenenisa Bekele,It was more than just perfection tonight.
Kenenisa Bekele,"Yes it hurt, it was a hard race and he made me work with everything I had for the win."
Kenenisa Bekele,"I'm very happy,"
Kenenisa Bekele,"As you know, I started the year with great grief. Let alone to be eligible to be for this award, I never expected to return to competition in such a way to do this well."
Kenenisa Bekele,It gives me a lot of motivation to achieve the double for the last time. It not only brings glory to my country but to myself. It's a wonderful opportunity.
Kenenisa Bekele,"With no individual global championships to aim at in 2006, my focus is the Golden League this summer, and I am looking forward to challenging for the US$1 million prize."
Kenenisa Bekele,I was not trying to save any energy for tomorrow's race. The short race is the tougher race and this was the one I was concerned about.
Kenenisa Bekele,I've achieved everything there is to accomplish in cross country. I've competed in the cross country world championships for six years and now it's time to step aside and make way for some of our younger athletes.
Kenenisa Bekele,It's not always easy when it's your first competition. I'm happy that I won.
Kenenisa Bekele,It's a stress-free competition that is intended to raise awareness about the sport in China since the Olympics will be held there in three years.

Harry Belafonte,"I was quite taken with her, because I'd never seen the African influence in dance with that kind of strength and artistic power. It impacted my soul. No one had reached those heights. She was the definitive black dance company. She moved among the highest intellectuals of black culture, all the writers and painters and literary folk."
Harry Belafonte,I don't think that (U.S. President) George Bush...is a man of honor.

Harry Belafonte,Our foreign policy has made a wreck of this planet. I'm always in Africa... And when I go to these places I see American policy written on the walls of oppression everywhere.
Harry Belafonte,"I think Bush has a very selfish, arrogant point of view. I think he is interested in power, I think he believes his truth is the only truth, and that he will do what he wants to do despite the people."
Harry Belafonte,You can cage the singer but not the song.
Harry Belafonte,"I not only think that they are misguided, but I think they know exactly what they are doing, and I think that they are men who are possessed of evil."

Adrian Belew,"We expect to keep our writing sessions going until late spring, then to play some new material in a few secret club dates. The record will likely take a long time and may not surface until 1999!"
Adrian Belew,The only drawback is once the work is done you rarely see each other.
Adrian Belew,"My favorite puzzle is trying to work out the parts myself, after all it is a solo effort."
Adrian Belew,King Crimson will soon be touring parts of Europe.
Adrian Belew,King Crimson is never easy; it's challenging. That's why I like it.
Adrian Belew,"I'm slowly designing my second Experimental Guitar record. And next year I will release DUST, the giant rarities collection mentioned earlier."
Adrian Belew,I was left with an urge to make the guitar sound like things it shouldn't be able to sound like.
Adrian Belew,"I thought I might be a band instructor, someone who plays all the instruments and teaches others."
Adrian Belew,I love drums and still play frequently.
Adrian Belew,I have no secrets; all of these things have been discussed at length in guitar magazines over the years but are far too elaborate to cover in one article.
Adrian Belew,I have enjoyed all the artists I've worked with.
Adrian Belew,"I didn't make my first solo record until 1981 so I don't have any 60's or 70's recordings but I am working on a large boxed set called DUST to be released next year, the 20th anniversary of my first solo record."
Adrian Belew,I borrowed a guitar at age 16 and taught myself to play because I wanted to write songs.
Adrian Belew,"DUST includes rarities, demos, unreleased songs and instrumentals, live recordings, and more."
Adrian Belew,Digital for storage and quickness. Analog for fatness and warmth.
Adrian Belew,Currently I'm working with Parker Fly on a new Midi guitar to arrive next year.
Adrian Belew,Age 10. I joined the school marching band as a drummer.
Adrian Belew,"Yes, but don't forget I also have the luxury of the worlds finest band when it gets lonely."
Adrian Belew,"I prefer a quartet, it makes everyone work harder."
Adrian Belew,"For example, after developing a sound similar to an elephant trumpeting, I wrote the song Elephant Talk which gave my elephant sound an appropriate place to live."
Adrian Belew,As you can appreciate over my lifetime I've developed a large vocabulary of sounds each requiring certain physical techniques often combined with a specific effect box.
Ed Belfour,"I don't worry about that stuff,"
Ed Belfour,"I had a bit of a brain cramp and got caught in No Man's Land,"
Ed Belfour,"I've let in a lot of weird goals, ... Fluky ones, whatever you want to call it, but they're ones I don't normally let in. There are a lot more shots coming at the net and guys are just shooting it at the net because they have more time and pucks are going in off legs and feet and shoulders and heads, so you might have to play out a little further on the shot and hope it hits you."
Ed Belfour,"It seemed like it took forever. It took nine goals, but I'm real thankful and honored."
Ed Belfour,"Never in my wildest dreams,"
Ed Belfour,It's always discouraging when you don't have things go your way. They are frustrated just like the rest of us.
Ed Belfour,"I had a chance to read his biography,"
Ed Belfour,"I had a chance to read his biography, ... He was a fierce competitor, very acrobatic and obviously very brave, not wearing a mask most of his career. I'm just honored to be tied with him."
Bill Belichick,You know where I stand on that. Could I have been any further away from the play?
Bill Belichick,"They're 12-4. If the playoffs weren't set up the way they were, they'd probably be playing at home, (but) they're in the same division as Indianapolis."
Bill Belichick,You can?t worry too much about other guys on your team and what their situation is because you can go out there the first day of training camp and that could change on one play. I don?t feel like we can look at it that way - and we don?t.
Bill Belichick,We'll worry about next week next week.
Bill Belichick,Understanding what not to do sometimes is just as important as what you can do.
Bill Belichick,"It's hard enough gaining 10 yards on three downs. If you start trying to gain 12 or 13 or 17 on two, then eventually it's probably going to catch up with you."
Bill Belichick,"I think he probably did a tremendous job in acquiring and developing talent in the '70s and '80s, a lot of them from small schools,"
Bill Belichick,Cedric is a guy that has a lot of talent and has had some big time production at Arkansas. He missed a little bit of time but we feel like at that point in the draft that he was a real good value there with the pick. He is an explosive guy that runs well. He can run with power and basically came in and had big production as a freshman and was a four-year producer at Arkansas when he was healthy.
Bill Belichick,"We got a good block at the point of attack from Graham. Neal pulled and the safety came up and filled the gap quicker than we expected. That wasn't really the guy Neal was expecting to block but he saw him in the hole and reacted to it and dug him out of there. Matt and Logan (combination-blocked) the tackle up to (middle linebacker Danny) Clark. We didn't quite get Clark blocked, he got over the top, but he wasn't able to get enough on Corey to keep him out."
Bill Belichick,He's fast and he has good range for the safety position and he's done a good job as a contact player both in hitting and tackling and forcing the run when he's been asked to.
Bill Belichick,"If you don't stop the running game, it doesn't matter whether you can stop the passing game or not. They don't ever have to throw it if they don't want to. To me, against a team like Atlanta, if you can't stop them from running, it doesn't really matter what else happens."
Bill Belichick,"The running back situation is a good, competitive one. I think Antowain and Kevin are good players, have good, solid strengths. I think both of those players are going to be productive for us. They have been in the past. How exactly it's going to work out, I don't know. I'm sure it will be decided on the field. We'll do what we think is best for the team."
Bill Belichick,"We've always tried to coach and abide by the NFL rules, whatever they are,"
Bill Belichick,"We'll try to comply with the rules and if we don't, I'm sure we'll be penalized for it, just like everybody else will."
Bill Belichick,"My father was always just part of the team. He willingly accepted whatever responsibility he was given, whether it was coaching the linebackers or the junior varsity."
Bill Belichick,"There's probably more (quality) linebackers than we've had the last couple of years. Some of those guys have had a lot of production, have had a lot of playing time."
Bill Belichick,normal week of practice.
Bill Belichick,"That's a game-breaking skill, but along with that, he has a lot of power. He's good on the goal line and short-yardage situations. (He's) tough to tackle. He's fast, (has) good hands (and) is pretty good in blitz pickup. He does a good job."
Bill Belichick,"But again, I think that's consistent with his philosophy, ... Whatever Al's philosophy is, it's been pretty consistent through the years, be it the type of players he gets to play corner(back), the coaches, their style of play, what he wears. It's all consistent."
Bill Belichick,"I think practice preparation is always an indicator of game performance - not necessarily 100 percent, because there are still a lot of variables there, but it?s still an indicator,"
Bill Belichick,Tell him what you said to the team last night.
Bill Belichick,"The overall competitive nature he brings as an owner and as a franchise (still exists),"
Bill Belichick,"There's a lot of love between us -- me, Charlie, Romeo. We've been together with the Giants, the Patriots, the Jets and the Patriots again. For it to be able to end this way ... the only word I can think of is 'special.'"
Bill Belichick,"Rodney is one of our leaders. If he's out, the next guy's in. It's what we've had to deal with."
Bill Belichick,"I think everyone's happy to see him out there. But we've got to do our own jobs. We can't just rely on him to show up, and everything falls into place."
Bill Belichick,"We're not on a sightseeing tour here. We have a job to do. We all have something that we want to try to accomplish. That's really what we're going there for. Understanding what the setting is and what the stadium is and all of that, yes, we are all aware of that."
Bill Belichick,"It's just an exchange of information with somebody that you have common ground with, ... You talk about things that are successful, and sometimes that has an application to what you're doing."
Bill Belichick,There certainly was room for improvement there. I'm not saying that was any masterpiece.
Bill Belichick,"We gave up big plays, running and passing, and that obviously hurt us,"
Bill Belichick,I coached this game with a heavy heart. My dad passed away. I found out about it the middle of last night.
Bill Belichick,"I found out about it the middle of last night, ... I coached this game with a heavy heart."
Bill Belichick,"We're certainly giving up too many big plays in the passing game, ... Some of it was the technique ... our judgment on the ball, sometimes we just didn't use our help, or where our help was supposed to be, it didn't get there quick enough. ... Some of it is tied into the rush, the timing of the rush, when the ball is thrown. ... The quarterback stands back there and pumps three or four times, that's hard for anybody to cover those routes. We just need better overall team defense."
Bill Belichick,I've been in the game for a while. I've heard 'Belichick' and 'genius' together. I've also heard 'Belichick' and 'moron' together.
Bill Belichick,I don't see how you can say anybody is better than them. They haven't lost a game. That's more than anybody else can say.
Bill Belichick,terrible ... We loved when he was in the game.
Bill Belichick,"Almost 75 years of football gave him a vast knowledge and reverence historically for the game that very few could match, ... He coached everything, and his ability to teach and interact with people has really come back to me in my lifetime and in the last few days."
Bill Belichick,We're looking at another really good football team this week in Denver. They're probably one of the hotter teams in the league right now. They're playing very well in all three phases of the game. They've been a good team to watch just because they're executing so well. They haven't had a turnover in three games.
Bill Belichick,That was a heck of a football game. I've got to give all the credit in the world to (our) players. This is a team that believes a lot in itself even when others don't.
Bill Belichick,"I was really proud of our team. It's tough down here. Miami is a good football team. They're well coached, they're physical and they gave us all we wanted. I'm proud of the guys for hanging in there."
Bill Belichick,"As usual, Tom played his best football when it counted."
Bill Belichick,"Statistically, we're fighting an uphill battle when we're on the negative turnover ratio and winning games, especially on the road, ... That's not normally the correlation. ... Right now, we're in a little bit of a dry spell."
Bill Belichick,"He has some experience,"
Bill Belichick,"Sometimes, maybe some of the guys at that position, because of expectation, are put into situations before they're ready to have success, (and) that affects their confidence and their ability to develop."
Bill Belichick,"It's unique. He's like a little kid, running around out there. He's got a lot of energy. In competitive situations, that flows over to other players. It's not the most orthodox way of playing, but he's productive."
Bill Belichick,"just not healthy. I'm sure it was a factor, I don't think there's any doubt about it."
Bill Belichick,Hank is a smart player. He works hard. He is very diligent. He is a tough kid and he really puts a lot into the game.
Bill Belichick,"We didn't want to play him on defense last year. That was an emergency, desperation type of situation and of course Troy handled it wall...But he's a better receiver than he is a defensive back."
Bill Belichick,"What you need to think about it is, 'How do I defeat the guy who is assigned to block me?' That's what defensive football really is about,"
Bill Belichick,There are certainly areas that you can improve in and develop more consistency (in).
Bill Belichick,"I don't think that the issue is talent. It's more from a consistency standpoint and being able to gain the experience, and do it competitively the right way every time."
Bill Belichick,"This is our best opportunity to pull everything together in terms of substitution, communication, execution, playing on the road, playing in a hostile environment, all of those kinds of things."
Bill Belichick,"Al's never really hired a defensive coach, Al's hired offensive coaches,"
Bill Belichick,"We know we're facing different challenges and our team is evolving differently. It's all just part of it. Whatever you have to deal with, whatever changes there are, then collectively as a team you manage them."
Bill Belichick,"And I understood that in an age where there was so much ego, because of the camera, that it was very important to look for that kind of player, ... I began to look for the kind of player that doesn't need his ego fed by stardom, but will do what he's supposed to do because he knows the game and loves the game, and will do the job the right way even if someone else gets the glory."
Bill Belichick,"But your whole advantage offensively, is to know when the ball is being snapped. Defensively, that's your one disadvantage."
Bill Belichick,"Ben can run. He's not a receiver, but he has that receiver type of ability for a tight end. He's obviously a big target. That's always something that the quarterback likes, is a tall guy that has a good reach and is just a big target to throw to."
Bill Belichick,"Ben can run. He's not a (wide) receiver, but he's got that receiver type of ability for a tight end. He's obviously a big target. That's always something that the quarterback likes, is a tall guy that has a good reach and is just a big target to throw to."
Buddy Bell,He understands that he wasn't ready. Those were his words to me.
Buddy Bell,"We're trying to figure out what we're going to do next with Bautista. I still don't think he's going to pitch for us this year, although he wants to."
Buddy Bell,I think when you're in the public eye you unfortunately have to get that kind of stupidity. But that's the way it is. You just live with it and move on.
Buddy Bell,"We think so. Then again, that's up to him. He's made a lot of progress in conditioning. We look forward to seeing him back."
Buddy Bell,"My perspective on that was I don't think the call was made correctly. My perspective was if it's a catch, the ball would have stayed in his glove. It's pretty elementary for me. He (plate umpire Mike Winters) called me nuts. It's not the first time I've been called that."
Buddy Bell,"He's played really well. He'll come into Spring Training with a real good opportunity. A lot of it depends on what we do in the winter, but there's not a whole lot about his game that I don't like."
Buddy Bell,"When they got the four runs, we can't stop playing. We've got to keep playing. The nature of the game is to keep going. I didn't think the focus was there at the end after they got the four runs. That can't happen. I'm kind of running out of answers."
Buddy Bell,"I like his stuff, but he's still learning how to pitch."
Buddy Bell,We have a real strict pitch count for these young kids and he was at 97. We were going to let him go between 95 and 100.
Buddy Bell,We have a really strict pitch count for these younger kids.
Buddy Bell,He did a great job. He's nice to have in the rotation with that kind of stuff.
Buddy Bell,"Then we came back, thanks to the home runs. We usually don't get that kind of production as far as home runs go."
Buddy Bell,"Because of the history and Ambres got hit earlier, ... I guess Mike (home plate umpire Mike Everitt) felt like Zack sent a message."
Buddy Bell,"I knew it was over 100 games. We'd get close, but not over the hump."
Buddy Bell,"Everybody was sure we would do it, but I knew better. There was no way we would lose 100 games two years in a row! 63-99 looks real good right now!"
Buddy Bell,He's a guy that'll help us win some games.
Buddy Bell,"Ooh, it does look funny, though,"
Buddy Bell,"That's not enough for a guy who's scrambling, fighting for a job."
Buddy Bell,"We have a lot of decisions, which is good."
Buddy Bell,"I'll tell you, having a guy like that out there is such a comfort. He gets such a jump on the ball and can hit for power. He's a true professional."
Buddy Bell,"I never really doubted the character of this team. Inexperience shows, and that's something we've got to live with, but the character has always been there. ... We've got a lot of young guys that need to show progress if we're going to get better, and I think they will."
Buddy Bell,I don't think we saw Schilling at his best tonight. But we took advantage of it and that's what we have to do when a guy like that is not at the top of his game.

Charlie Bell,My management team and I remain firmly committed to strengthening McDonald's relevancy and continuing the momentum that began under Jim's leadership.
Charlie Bell,"Billups is not going to run you off a lot of screens. He's kind of a rock-you-to-sleep guy. He's one of those guys you think he's not doing anything, and he crosses you over real quick and goes to the hole. He's so strong. If he gets a step on you, you're dead."
Charlie Bell,"We didn't know how physical he'd become, because we don't beat up our kids in practice. He had to play himself into showing us, and one game in midseason he came up and made a great tackle along the edge. From that point on, I think that answered our questions."
Charlie Bell,It's fun to improve after you have had a good game like we did. We've had a good week of practice ... They've kept their focus well.
Charlie Bell,"They have to stop us, and we believe we can score on anybody. They've got a tough job as well."
James Bell,"As compared to two years ago, we're ahead, ... We've had some things we've had to work through. We had to get everybody on the same page, we had to get them all going in the right direction. And that's what we've done. That creates a good, positive atmosphere."
James Bell,We've got a lot of depth there which is good. We're still trying to identify our best guys.
James Bell,"IntelliChoice.com performs a valuable service by analyzing all of the data that consumers are not capable of finding or calculating on their own.

James Bell,"Not as long as they play, and they play with a passion. It's a team thing, too, its not just about one group. As long as the jell together, we'll be in good shape."
James Bell,The kids wanted to play. I don't know what kind of effect it will have on the team.
James Bell,This represents an important step toward justice being done.
James Bell,I've just heard that as a rumor. I've not heard it's true from the government.
James Bell,"He understands the game,"
James Bell,"You'll see a better football team. The first two years were truly growing pains for everybody. Sometimes to get to where you want to go, you have to make sacrifices. And sometimes that means doing things differently."
James Bell,"The emotions are high right now. Everybody's ready for that first game. We've just got to be patient, stay with our pattern and take it one day at a time."

James Bell,"Clearly we've had challenges,"
James Bell,"Hybrids continue to refute the argument that their cost of ownership fails to justify their slightly higher sticker prices. Perhaps more importantly, this is the first time that two hybrids, the Ford Escape and the Toyota Highlander, dominate the SUV category. This is also the second year in a row that one vehicle, the Honda Odyssey, swept the minivan category."
Jason Bell,"I like where we're at right now. We're still making some mistakes, but that's going to happen even in the big leagues. A catcher's going to set up outside and a pitch is going to go inside. Physical mistakes are going to happen. Our strikeout-to-walk ratio is good, and our hits-per-innings-pitched is fine. We just have to avoid the mental mistakes."
Jason Bell,"We made a couple of mistakes defensively not marking up in the box, ... But I was really impressed that our girls didn't get down."
Jason Bell,"In addition to just the sheer communication, if we succeed with this, there will be enormous benefits in terms of coordination, and we'll actually be able to save lives."

Jeff Bell,"It seems to me that the best relationships-- the ones that last-- are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with."
Jeff Bell,"First, it is measurable. Second, it is more engaging emotionally, and therefore effective. Third, the highest quality of creative and technical talent is working in this area,"

Jerry Bell,"There are problems, but the last chapter is far from over."
Jerry Bell,"Someone's going to have to tell us what's different politically, and if there's nothing different, there's no reason for optimism. We've been on a treadmill for 10 years. If nothing changes politically, the result will be the same."
Jerry Bell,"I believe there was a fear that damage would be done to the fire district if that were to happen, ... When you have a disruption in the continuity of the district like that, it's not good for the district and I think that's what they were thinking when they held the meeting to approve the contracts."
Jerry Bell,"Frankly, it enters into the discussions on virtually every conversation we had with the sports commission, and we had to clear that way. People connect the dots, but I can't help that."
Jerry Bell,Jay has been valuable in the growth of KKZN not only on-air but because of his personal-appearance work.
Jerry Bell,"Audiences and participation on talk radio during the 2004 election year really boomed, particularly among the 25-to-54 age group."
Larry Bell,The incredible power of a teacher.
Larry Bell,"Living for Tomorrow: The Power of Individuals to Prevent Violence in Schools and Communitites,"

Larry Bell,"He's not going to win, but my vote is a vote for having more voices heard in the country."
Mark Bell,"Your child is safest in a new child safety seat. A new seat will have a registration form that, when completed and returned to the manufacturer, will be used to notify the owner if there is a potential recall or defect in the future. New seats also have clearly labeled expiration dates."
Mark Bell,He's had bad luck. I feel for that guy.
Mark Bell,It was the first time I played with him. He's a big strong guy who can fire the puck. He'll be an asset to our team.
Mark Bell,"We've got to take some confidence out of that game. We generated a lot of offense, which sometimes isn't always there."
Marty Bell,Could you write it any better? You win the last seven games and you win the West.
Marty Bell,We told the guys that this game was going to come down to whoever was going to make the plays at the end of the game.

Steve Bell,"We have no doubts that he's hiding somewhere in Cannington or nearby,"
Steve Bell,Another issue we had was sanitation because they were not picking up after the dogs either.
Steve Bell,I want to give fans the chance to get on the train right at the beginning. I want them to be able to share in any success that may come along. So I'll endorse a site to be the official fan site - for the entire series â€“ it could be something very big for them. Just look at the fan sites of Harry Potter and other fantasy books.

Marc Benioff,"The era of the traditional software 'load, update and upgrade' business and technology model is over, ... It is time for 'The Business Web.' ... Just as mainframe companies struggled for relevance in the client-server era, Microsoft finds itself in a worse position today, facing not just the obsolescence of a technology model, but a business model as well."
Rafa Benitez,We had more space in the second half and more pace -- and at the end 2-0 is a good result.
Rafa Benitez,I need to know why after all the problems in the game there was only three minutes.
Rafa Benitez,"He was unfortunate last season because he had so many injury problems, but if he can stay fit then he will be an important member of our squad this year."
Rafa Benitez,I spoke to some players after the game and pointed out a few mistakes we made.
Rafa Benitez,I need to speak to the doctors but if he is not fit in two to three days it could still be dangerous in one week. I will speak to the England manager (Sven-Goran Eriksson) about it.
Rafa Benitez,We worked really hard for the win...after the last performance (a 2-0 defeat at Charlton Athletic) we showed we had character.

Alan Bennett,Last year we were more of a running team. This year we're more versatile.
Alan Bennett,I was an only child. I lost both my parents. By the time I was twenty I was bald. I'm homosexual. In the way of circumstances and background to transcend I had everything an artist could possibly want. It was practically a blueprint. I was programmed to be a novelist or a playwright. But I'm not.
Alan Bennett,This symposium will highlight the surprisingly diverse and positive role that cocoa can potentially play in improving public health and reinvigorating endangered tropical ecosystems. It also underscores the impact that collaborative efforts among public and private sector scientists can have in a relatively short time.

Alan Bennett,"If you think squash is a competitive activity, try flower arranging."
Alan Bennett,Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have.
Alan Bennett,"I've never seen the point of the sea, except where it meets the land. The shore has a point. The sea has none."
Alan Bennett,"Those who have known the famous are publicly debriefed of their memories, knowing as their own dusk falls that they will only be remembered for remembering someone else."
Alan Bennett,"We have smaller defensive ends, but they're quick. They'll be OK. Everybody knows their job, and our defense is better this year. If we play better in the second half of the game this year, we'll do better."
Alan Bennett,"He says some things which are taken as gospel, when they ought to be disputed. When he writes 'Courage is no good / It means not scaring others', you want to say that just isn't true. There is more to courage than that."
Alan Bennett,I'm all in favour of free expression provided it's kept rigidly under control.
Alan Bennett,"We started off trying to set up a small anarchist community, but people wouldn't obey the rules."
Alan Bennett,We were put to Dickens as children but it never quite took. That unremitting humanity soon had me cheesed off.
Alan Bennett,"Were we closer to the ground as children, or is the grass emptier now?"
Alan Bennett,Children always assume the sexual lives of their parents come to a grinding halt at their conception.
Alan Bennett,"Cancer, like any other illness, is a bore."
Bob Bennett,"Our position is this is a baseless, frivolous case we have no intention of settling."
Bob Bennett,Plaintiff [Jones] has failed to produce evidence showing the existence of essential elements of each of her claims. Therefore President Clinton is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Bob Bennett,"When you bite into it, it just doesn't exist, ... I believe very strongly there is no legal case here."
Dan Bennett,"The free teen film screenings and panel discussion on opportunities for women in film direction and editing is going to be an entertaining and informative program. There is a shortage of women professionals in this field, and that needs to change. Our panelists will talk about how that can be done. And these are two very enjoyable and thoughtful films. We're hoping high school and college students respond to this program ---- both genders are encouraged to attend."
Dan Bennett,Probably nothing in the world arouses more false hopes than the first four hours of a diet.
Dan Bennett,The trouble with a budget is that it's hard to fill up one hole without digging another.
David Bennett,It's a tight fraternity. The [I-AA] playoffs are the toughest thing to get into in collegiate sports.
David Bennett,Perkins wasn't running as hard as he could run.
David Bennett,"Perkins wasn't running as hard as he could run, and we put Hall in. Hall lays it on the ground twice, once on a pass and once on a run. So you go to your next one - Jamie Fordham. Jamie did a fine job. He ran the ball hard. That's just the way it is. If somebody's not getting the job done you go to the next one."
David Bennett,I know I wouldn't want to be a running back [today].
David Bennett,We have to have a good week of practice. We've got to get back to fundamentals.
David Bennett,"There are actually very few predictors of Alzheimer's disease, ... This study makes us think about the spectrum of clinical signs of AD beyond changes in memory and behavior and motor skills. Changes in BMI are easy to measure in a doctor's office without an expensive scan."
David Bennett,The most likely explanation is that there is something about these individuals or about this disease that affects BMI before the clinical syndrome becomes apparent -- that loss of BMI reflects the disease process itself.
David Bennett,"but the realization that once the disease is full blown, the possibility of bringing someone back is small."
David Bennett,"If these people aren't carrying (as much of a debt) load, and credit card companies aren't making money off them, then they could turn to people like us to cut our rewards."
David Bennett,"Look at what y'all are doing to our hair, boys. What y'all want to do, write a book?"
David Bennett,"These findings suggest that subtle, unexplained body mass and weight loss in an older person may be an early sign of AD [Alzheimer's disease] and can precede the development of obvious memory problems,"
David Bennett,"The ultimate relief would have been to stop the sweep-up of funds to Enron Corp. from Enron North America. The judge didn't order that, but we got the next best thing."
David Bennett,"The ultimate relief would have been to stop the sweep-up of funds to Enron Corp. from Enron North America, ... The judge didn't order that, but we got the next best thing."

Dick Bennett,They just dominated us. We just could not come close to their athleticism.
Dick Bennett,"Sometimes you have to be empty. That is one thing I have truly learned in all the rebuilding projects. At some point, you have got to take a punch to the gut that just empties all the arrogance or pride or false hopes, and then you realize we better face up to who we are."

George Bennett,"That was my intention,"
George Bennett,We are very pleased to bring the benefits of our care management services to a Massachusetts health plan consistently ranked as one of the best in the nation.
George Bennett,We are particularly excited about expanding our work with the Medicaid population in Massachusetts. Health Dialog has served this population for some time and this new initiative with Network Health speaks to the value we are able to deliver to this population in particular. The agreement with Network Health offers us the opportunity to help even more individuals in our home state confidently navigate the healthcare system.
James Bennett,"I told (McCormick) before I went out (in the seventh inning) if I get in trouble, bring John Wilson in."

James Bennett,"This is just something that escalated to a point where, you know, you hope it doesn't happen to another family."
James Bennett,Homelessness isn't just downtown. They're in Kenwood and up by Gandy and over by Eckerd College living in the woods.
James Bennett,I think this class is the epitome of what we were trying to accomplish when we developed the 'One of Our Own' program.
James Bennett,"I think we ought to make it a first-class facility. If it takes more than $50-million, we will have to make sure we find the funds to make it right. It's pretty important to get it right."
James Bennett,It's conceivable that we can be out there clearing trees by the end of this year or the beginning of next.
James Bennett,I have made mistakes but I have never made the mistake of claiming that I have never made one.
Phil Bennett,You will get your [butt] kicked when you get into the Big 12.
Phil Bennett,I don't know if I want to risk it. I'm real leery.
Phil Bennett,"We're not where we want to be yet. But we made progress, and we want to take it to another level. I'm excited to be a part of what we're doing."
Phil Bennett,But this was about the pride factor.
Phil Bennett,"Our job is to go down and do everything in our power to win, ... I don't want to go down there and just be competitive. I want to win. Would I say we're an underdog? Probably so. But we were an underdog last week, too."
Phil Bennett,"We'll need to use our speed and tackle well defensively, ... We must have patience on offense. With McNeal, we'll have to play it tight to the vest. We have to contain him. The rush will be crucial."
Phil Bennett,"When I took the SMU job, I knew it would be a rebuilding process,"
Phil Bennett,"I had some of my closest friends beg me not to take this job, ... I saw something they didn't."
Steve Bennett,There's nobody that's for it aside from Mr. Rooks. There's not a soul I've talked to in the area that wants this to happen.
Steve Bennett,"With two more weeks of strong TurboTax sales -- especially TurboTax Online -- the tax season is turning out better than we expected. As a result, we're raising our guidance for both total company and TurboTax growth for the year."
Steve Bennett,"I'm in it for the long haul. I'm going to fight it just as long as I can. I hate to take that kind of position, but I don't have any choice."
Steve Bennett,These opportunities are much broader than our traditional consumer and professional tax businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Taxes also impact our payroll business as well as the tax forms part of our supplies business.
Steve Bennett,"Once again, Intuit is proving its ability to execute and deliver, ... We are taking guidance up because of the strength of both our QuickBooks and TurboTax businesses."
Tony Bennett,It think now the only way of getting at the truth of what happened is if somebody who was at that party comes forward with a statement.
Tony Bennett,"I've tried to do that for my top assistant wherever I've been, but this is even better because it'll be for my son. I will feel like I've finished the job I was called to do in coming here,"
Tony Bennett,"I am very thankful for this opportunity. It is a privilege and honor for me to follow in the footsteps of my father. Everywhere he's gone, he's been full of integrity and passion. That's what I want to carry on."
Tony Bennett,"I am very thankful for this opportunity. I can't tell you how much of a privilege and a honor it is for me to follow in the footsteps of my father. Everywhere he has gone, there have been two things that have been consistent when he has rebuilt programs. People have always said they have been full of integrity and passion. There's no question that is what I want to carry on."
Tony Bennett,"[Luckily for his audiences, Bennett doesn't tire of singing] I Left My Heart. ... that song made me a world citizen. And when I do it, it always feels like the first time."
Tony Bennett,To work is to feel alive.
Tony Bennett,"The young people look great on television. They're youthful and have a lot of zip and energy, but when you see them live, they can only do about 20 minutes because they haven't got the training to hold an audience for an hour and a half or so."
Tony Bennett,More than anybody else I'd like to thank Count Basie for teaching me how to perform.
Tony Bennett,I know the history of the record business so well because I followed Billie Holiday into the record studios. It was so primitive compared to the sophisticated business today.
Tony Bennett,"I've been so fortunate because I never really had ups and downs as far as my career. Ninety-nine percent of the time, I've been sold out all over the world."
Tony Bennett,I still insist that American performers are the best performers in the world.
Tony Bennett,"I have a simple life. I mean, you just give me a drum roll, they announce my name, and I come out and sing. In my job I have a contract that says I'm a singer. So I sing."
Wayne Bennett,"It's convenient, ... If there is no statute, even if we see something, we don't have authority to do anything about it."
Wayne Bennett,It didn't help our momentum.
Wayne Bennett,I'm not aware of any such incident of this magnitude in 37 years I've been on this job. This is unprecedented.
Wayne Bennett,We had a football team out there.
Wayne Bennett,"I was asked if I would have the courage to do it ... I said I would, but I didn't say I was moving him."
Wayne Bennett,"Shaun Berrigan finished up playing half-back - he's about our fifth-choice half-back in this club,"
Wayne Bennett,I don't think they use it as a tactic any more and I have confidence and belief in Craig. It's more a case of muscle memory taking over (if a player grapples a rival's head) and if that happens the ref will handle it.
Wayne Bennett,"The effort the players have put in has been tremendous. I have great admiration for them for what they do week-in, week-out and year-in, year-out."
William Bennett,"If at first you doubt, doubt again."
William Bennett,"Some of us in college, some of us in high school, you know, did things that we weren't particularly happy about or proud of later, speaking here for myself,"
William Bennett,Our common language is English. And our common task is to ensure that our non-English-speaking children learn this common language.
William Bennett,It is our character that supports the promise of our future - far more than particular government programs or policies.
William Bennett,"The formation of character in young people is educationally a different task from and a prior task to, the discussion of the great, difficult ethical controversies of the day."
William Bennett,every black baby in this country.
William Bennett,"There are no mental jobs, only mental attitudes."
William Bennett,a bad argument in order to put it down.

Warren G. Bennis,"Leaders keep their eyes on the horizon, not just on the bottom line."
Warren G. Bennis,"The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment."
Warren G. Bennis,There is a profound difference between information and meaning.

Warren G. Bennis,"People who cannot invent and reinvent themselves must be content with borrowed postures, secondhand ideas, fitting in instead of standing out."
Warren G. Bennis,Leadership is the wise use of power. Power is the capacity to translate intention into reality and sustain it.
Warren G. Bennis,Great things are accomplished by talented people who believe they will accomplish them.
Warren G. Bennis,Leaders are people who do the right thing; managers are people who do things right.
Warren G. Bennis,Leaders must encourage their organizations to dance to forms of music yet to be heard.
Warren G. Bennis,"Leadership has become a heavy industry. Concern and interest about leadership development is no longer an American phenomenon. It is truly global. Though I will probably be in less demand, I wanted to move on."
Warren G. Bennis,I wanted the influence. In the end I wasn't very good at being a president. I looked out of the window and thought that the man cutting the lawn actually seemed to have more control over what he was doing.
Warren G. Bennis,Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.
Bernard Berenson,"You can parody and make fun of almost anything, but that does not turn the universe into a caricature"
Bernard Berenson,Government lasts as long as the under-taxed can defend themselves against the over-taxed.
Bernard Berenson,"Miracles happen to those who believe in them. Otherwise why does not the Virgin Mary appear to Lamaists, Mohammedans, or Hindus who have never heard of her?"
Bernard Berenson,"In figure painting, the type of all painting, I have endeavoured to set forth that the principal if not sole source of life enchantments are Tactile Values, Movement and Space Composition."

Bernard Berenson,Miracles happen to those who believe in them.
Bernard Berenson,"When everything else physical and mental seems to diminish, the appreciation of beauty is on the increase."
Dr. Berger,Further research is required to translate these findings into an improvement of health-care quality.
Dr. Berger,"This is good news because many of the past studies of the effect of aspirin in preventing cardiovascular events looked only at men, so physicians were reluctant to prescribe aspirin for women because there was little data."
Dr. Berger,"This is good news, because many of the past studies of the effect of aspirin in preventing cardiovascular events looked only at men, so physicians were reluctant to prescribe aspirin for women because there was little data."
Dr. Berger,We now know with certainty that Aspirin is effective in both men and women in reducing cardiovascular events.
Jim Berkman,"We have a lot of pride and tradition at Salisbury, and the reason that we've had a lot of great teams is because the kids play real hard for the maroon and gold. When they put that jersey on, they know that they owe a responsibility to that jersey, to the forefathers that have established that bar at Salisbury."
Jim Berkman,"Our defense played really good. St. Mary's is a good team. They didn't beat [No. 4] Roanoke because they weren't a good team. We played really hard today. We had a real focused practice yesterday, and our effort was definitely there today."
Jim Berkman,"They're a team struggling in transition. Their coach left them in the middle of the year, and the guy left their cupboard pretty bare."
Jim Berkman,It was one of those days where at the beginning it seemed like every ball that bounced out of a pile wound up on their sticks. We held the fort while that was happening. Then we started to get a few breaks.
Lance Berkman,"We weren't going to win the rest of them, ... Nobody expected us to go 9-0 over the last nine games. It would have been nice, but these guys are getting paid to play, just like we are. They're a tough team. We certainly have our hands full. We just have to regroup and come back tomorrow."
Lance Berkman,He did what we needed him to do. We absolutely had to have that performance - and he gave it to us.
Lance Berkman,"You have to be patient, ... He makes a lot of good pitches and doesn't make many mistakes, and when he does make a mistake, you have to capitalize on it. If we get an opportunity to score, we need to do it and not let him off the hook. He's too good for that."
Lance Berkman,"It's a very high honor, ... I remember when I was being recruited to go there and they take you through the hall of honor and see all the guys' pictures and stuff. It doesn't even cross your mind then that one day you'll have your picture up there."
Lance Berkman,"It may not be intense in the stands, but it's intense on the field. It's not a rivalry of hatred. It's a rivalry of mutual respect. We enjoy competing against these guys."
Lance Berkman,"One-run games can go either way, and most of the time they do."
Lance Berkman,"To me, it's fun to be in this position, because nobody expected us to do anything, ... We've got two weeks, we're going to play as hard as we can, and we're going to see what happens."
Lance Berkman,"MLB takes care of it. They're the ones here in force. They've got crew chiefs. They've got all kinds of personnel,"
Lance Berkman,"To win the series we obviously had to win at least one game here. It was big for our confidence, not having won one here last year, to pick up this victory. But that doesn't mean we're going to sweep them when we go home. They're a tough team. This is going to be a long series. I think it's going to go six or seven games. Hopefully we'll come out on top."
Lance Berkman,"All I do, ... is eat. And drink coffee."
Lance Berkman,"I think that's just one of those weird things in the game of baseball. At some point, you've gotta think [the Phillies] are due."
Lance Berkman,I don't think Major League Baseball should have the right to tell us about the roof. They're trying to take the home-field advantage from us. I don't think that's right.

Silvio Berlusconi,and patch up relations between the EU and the United States ... which are fundamental to global peace.

Silvio Berlusconi,"Every citizen is equal to another [before the law], but I'm perhaps a little bit more equal than others, considering that 50% of Italians gave me the responsibility fo leading the country."
Silvio Berlusconi,"Finally, a moment of joy,"
Silvio Berlusconi,There is no point in talking about improvement because there has been no worsening
Silvio Berlusconi,Their overriding consideration is hatred toward me. And this runs counter to the truth and hurts the interests of our people. Do they realize that they are exposing them to mortal danger?
Silvio Berlusconi,a habit for me to come pay homage to the president in the Oval Office.
Silvio Berlusconi,elected by moderate voters who mandated these gentlemen to do the exact opposite of what they're now doing.

Arnie Berman,"Techs are being impacted by the same concerns that the rest of the market is,"
Arnie Berman,"Technology stocks that were once valued on a price-to-possibilities basis are now valued as if history no longer matters,"
Arnie Berman,This marriage of Hewlett and Compaq that's finally been allowed to be consummated reminds me a lot of what would happen if there were a union between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles.
Arnie Berman,"The latter stage of an economic recovery, where head count is rising and productivity is starting to fall, is the best for technology spending, and that's where we will be in 2006. Business leaders start thinking more about technology and less about questions like capacity expansion or how long the recovery will last."
Arnie Berman,"On the surface, you'll see that the financial momentum delivered by the earnings tonight was more positive than not, and stocks should probably get a little boost off this."

Jerry Berman,"The Internet is going to be a legislative issue in every Congress from now on,"
William Bernbach,"The truth isn't the truth until people believe you, and they can't believe you if they don't know what your saying, and they can't know what you've saying if they don't listen to you, and they won't listen to you if you're not interesting, and you won't be interesting until you say things imaginatively, originally, freshly."
William Bernbach,"We don't ask research to do what it was never meant to do, and that is to get an idea."
William Bernbach,A great ad campaign will make a bad product fail faster. It will get more people to know it's bad.
William Bernbach,Our job is to bring the dead facts to life.
William Bernbach,"If your advertising goes unnoticed, everything else is academic."
William Bernbach,Word of mouth is the best medium of all.
William Bernbach,"In communications, familiarity breeds apathy."
William Bernbach,"It is insight into human nature that is the key to the communicator's skill. For whereas the writer is concerned with what he puts into his writings, the communicator is concerned with what the reader gets out of it. He therefore becomes a student of how people read or listen."

William Bernbach,Nobody counts the number of ads you run; they just remember the impression you make.
William Bernbach,"Properly practiced creativity MUST result in greater sales more economically achieved. Properly practiced creativity can lift your claims out of the swamp of sameness and make them accepted, believed, persuasive, urgent."
William Bernbach,In advertising not to be different is virtually suicidal.
William Bernbach,"Forget words like 'hard sell' and 'soft sell.' That will only confuse you. Just be sure your advertising is saying something with substance, something that will inform and serve the consumer, and be sure you're saying it like it's never been said before."
William Bernbach,Advertising isn't a science. It's persuasion. And persuasion is an art.
William Bernbach,I warn you against believing that advertising is a science.

William Bernbach,Advertising doesn't create a product advantage. It can only convey it.
William Bernbach,"Nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature . . . what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action . . . if you know these things about a man you can touch him at the core of his being."
Richard Berner,"They will still go. Absolutely. Definitely. There's no question about it. They now have a little latitude to space the timing of the increases, but there's no question they will move."
Richard Berner,It's likely we got a decline in sales. We've had a drop in vehicle sales and it also looks like back-to-school was on the disappointing side.
Richard Berner,Why should people hold crude in tank farms if they think the price is going to come down?
Richard Berner,"With many people fearing a profitless recovery, earnings will probably surprise to the upside."
Richard Berner,"Reading (the Fed) has been trivially easy over the past year and a half, compared to what's it's going to be."
Richard Berner,"I believe that such fears are overblown, ... Advance labor-market indicators like Manpower's survey of businesses indicate that hiring plans are on the rise. So while it is true that job gains have been slow in coming, they typically are anemic in the early stages of recovery."

Richard Berner,"The fourth quarter is going to be very sluggish, indeed. We'll see some improvement in the first quarter, but it's a slow grind."
Richard Berner,"Home prices will rust, not bust, for the next few years."
Richard Berner,"Ultimately, a weaker dollar will spur policy shifts abroad that will be good for global growth. Ultimately, that will help earnings as well."
Richard Berner,We believe the Fed will move further to contain future inflation risks.
Richard Berner,Energy prices will have to fall substantially and growth will have to improve to erase the feeling that the growth/inflation mix will be unpleasant.
Richard Berner,"I think the surprise will be that housing prices and housing sales will decelerate, but the economy will do just fine."
Richard Berner,"There's still quite a bit of slack in the economy, and you can't push through prices until you eliminate that slack."
Richard Berner,"I don't think there's any doubt that the uncertainty over Iraq has been corrosive, but it's by no means the only factor hindering growth. The hope that if you take away that uncertainty and you unveil a coiled spring is probably overdone."
Richard Berner,"I don't think home values will crash -- they will rust, not bust. Demographics have underpinned demand, courtesy of a wave of immigration in the past 16 years that reduced supply, and you don't see the speculative overhang that could contribute to a bust in home values."
Richard Berner,The Fed truly wants to get inflation somewhat higher -- back into the comfort zone. Why not say where that comfort zone is?
Richard Berner,The US economy is currently in the midst of the most profound hiring shortfall of any modern-day business cycle.
Tim Berners-Lee,"The recommended strategy is to employ 'smart' buying practices to reduce acquisition and support costs, including software asset management, and increase the use of standards-compliant software,'"
Tim Berners-Lee,We need diversity of thought in the world to face the new challenges.
Tim Berners-Lee,"We could say we want the Web to reflect a vision of the world where everything is done democratically, where we have an informed electorate and accountable officials. To do that we get computers to talk with each other in such a way as to promote that ideal."
Tim Berners-Lee,"The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation."
Tim Berners-Lee,"The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past."
Tim Berners-Lee,Web users ultimately want to get at data quickly and easily. They don't care as much about attractive sites and pretty design.
Tim Berners-Lee,You affect the world by what you browse.
Tim Berners-Lee,"Sites need to be able to interact in one single, universal space."
Tim Berners-Lee,"Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch."
Leonard Bernstein,Music . . . can name the unnameable and communicate the unknowable.
Leonard Bernstein,"I believe in people. I feel, love, need and respect people above all else, including natural scenery, organized piety and nationalistic superstructures. One human figure on the slope of a mountain can make the mountain disappear for me, one person fighting for truth can disqualify for me the entire system which had dispensed it."
Leonard Bernstein,"It was an initiation into the love of learning, of learning how to learn . . . as a matter of interdisciplinary cognition - that is, learning to know something by its relation to something else."
Leonard Bernstein,"This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before."
Leonard Bernstein,Technique is communication: the two words are synonymous in conductors.
Leonard Bernstein,"To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time."

Yogi Berra,"It was impossible to get a conversation going, everybody was talking too much."
Yogi Berra,I'm a lucky guy and I'm happy to be with the Yankees. And I want to thank everyone for making this night necessary.
Yogi Berra,I wish I had an answer to that because I'm tired of answering that question.
Yogi Berra,"I never blame myself when I'm not hitting. I just blame the bat and if it keeps up, I change bats. After all, if I know it isn't my fault that I'm not hitting, how can I get mad at myself?"

Mary Berry,"Voting in Florida is like there's some kind of goody in a box and you want to get it, but you've got to be persistent to get it,"
Mary Berry,What we want to find out is how do you get police officers like Officer Volpe on a police department in the first place.
Mary Berry,"It's going to be impossible to defeat him unless he turns out to be an ax murderer and there's been no evidence of that presented, ... It's up to the civil rights groups to make the best case they can make."
Mary Berry,"What led me to believe that hearings are necessary, ... is the broad array of complaints, which is almost mind-boggling, that have occurred in the Florida election -- such things as voting machines (and) disparate treatment as to who had what voting equipment."
Mary Berry,"The city of New York must maintain a world-class police force that provides protection against illegal activities, including civil rights violations by its own officers, for all of its diverse populations,"

Mary Berry,"Civil Rights opened the windows. When you open the windows, it does not mean that everybody will get through. We must create our own opportunities."
Matt Berry,"I can't think about what if. That's not the thing to do. All I can do is worry about this season, have fun and believe that good things will happen."
Matt Berry,"I would've missed the leaves changing. When fall hit, that's when it would have hurt me."
Matt Berry,"I'm not looking for pity. The funny thing is, people still come up to me and apologize. I always laugh and say, 'for what?' Through good times and bad, I've learned a lot from this whole experience. There's nothing to feel sorry for."
Matt Berry,"We decided the best way to go is to not target the students with the bad behavior, but the ones around them; work on more of a reverse peer pressure type campaign."
Wendell Berry,"I am not bound for any public place, but for ground of my own where I have planted vines and orchard trees, and in the heat of the day climbed up into the healing shadow of the woods. Better than any argument is to rise at dawn and pick dew-wet red berries in a cup."
Wendell Berry,"When despair for the world grows in me, and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be -- I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought or grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free."
Wendell Berry,"All right, every day ain't going to be the best day of your life, don't worry about that. If you stick to it you hold the possibility open that you will have better days."
Wendell Berry,It is not from ourselves that we learn to be better than we are.
Wendell Berry,Better than any argument is to rise at dawn and pick dew-wet red berries in a cup.
Wendell Berry,We learn from our gardens to deal with the most urgent question of the time: How much is enough?

Skip Bertman,"We feel good about the game being next Saturday, but the other day we thought we were going to be playing North Texas this Saturday. You never know. We think things might lighten up between now and then. But with the information we have now, I feel real good about the LSU-Arizona State game staying where it is."
Skip Bertman,I don't think John would be interested in either of those jobs. I think he likes it here.
Skip Bertman,It could happen that the federal government could tell us not to play the game. It depends on what is happening in New Orleans next week.
Skip Bertman,"The events of yesterday and this morning have made it clear that this is not the time to play a football game. This is a dire situation that rivals any in the history of our state, and our priorities are on participating in recovery efforts."

Skip Bertman,"We will now face significant logistical challenges, but we hope for the continued cooperation of our fans. Naturally our strong preference would have been to play during the weekend, but safety for student-athletes, fans and everyone else involved in a football game was the overriding factor for the commissioner."
Skip Bertman,"We will now face significant logistical challenges, but we hope for the continued cooperation of our fans."
Skip Bertman,"Fresno State is one of the top teams we're looking at. I think our last conversation with them was pretty positive, but I wouldn't say it's done until ESPN finishes talking with them. We need ESPN to cooperate and pay them some money."
Skip Bertman,"You knew she was ill. But even through last week, she was upbeat. She was a great coach, but more importantly, she was a great human being. She touched a lot of people. I was happy for her that she could see all the hard work come to fruition. To reach goals like that, not everybody can do. It was a life well lived and well served."
Skip Bertman,"He oversaw budgets, did football scheduling, oversaw maintenance. His job included a little bit of everybody's job. That's what made him so knowledgeable and that's what will make him so valuable to Georgia Tech."
Skip Bertman,"This is a modest increase in our ticket price in order for us to continue to move forward our basketball programs. One of our short term goals is to begin a feasibility study for a new basketball practice facility for both our men's and women's basketball teams, and this move is the first step in making that happen."
Skip Bertman,I am very excited to be included in the very first college baseball Hall of Fame class. For me to be honored with these coaches and players that I have grown to admire and respect is very special. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in Lubbock.
Skip Bertman,I'm honored to be on this list for the official beginning of the College Baseball Hall of Fame. The coaches on the list laid the groundwork for what college baseball is today. Being mentioned with those men means a lot to me.
Skip Bertman,We'd have to arrange something as far as a rental agreement. And it would have to work with the LSU football schedule. I'm not sure we could play football on a Saturday night and have it ready for Sunday afternoon.

Bernardo Bertolucci,I am still against any kind of censorship. It's a subject in my life that has been very important.

Bernardo Bertolucci,I don't think you can in any way export culture with guns or tanks.

Todd Bertuzzi,I got enough to worry about with my own team.
Todd Bertuzzi,"Trying to cause someone great pain by hitting them in the head while they are facing the other way is an intentional act to injure. You will have to compensate them for any permanent injury they suffer, even if you did not mean the injury to be permanent."
Todd Bertuzzi,"We did the correct things, but we also made some costly mistakes."
Todd Bertuzzi,"It was no mistake,"
Todd Bertuzzi,"Just getting a bit more puck luck, ... The chances were there. I just wasn't putting them away before."
Todd Bertuzzi,"I'm getting a little bit more puck luck,"
Todd Bertuzzi,"I understand your jobs and the things you have to do,"
Todd Bertuzzi,"I'm a firm believer in second chances, and if we're going to go through life not giving anyone second chances, what kind of life are we going to have? People make mistakes in life. Unfortunately, I was under the microscope and on TV when my mistake happened, and if I'm going to sit here and keep getting ridiculed about it, how are we ever going to give someone a second chance to become better or to change situations?"
Todd Bertuzzi,For them having the faith in me is pretty rewarding. Knowing they believe in me and that the so-called baggage that I carry wasn't going to interfere with this team.
Todd Bertuzzi,"We have to smarten up on situations like that. In this day and age, in this league, teams can come back. It's something we're going to have to learn."
Annie Besant,Refusal to believe until proof is given is a rational position; denial of all outside of our own limited experience is absurd.
Annie Besant,"Better remain silent, better not even think, if you are not prepared to act."
Annie Besant,"Liberty is a great celestial Goddess, strong, beneficent, and austere, and she can never descend upon a nation by the shouting of crowds, nor by arguments of unbridled passion, nor by the hatred of class against class."
Annie Besant,Refusal to believe until proof is given is a rational position; denial of all outside of our own limited experience is absurd
Annie Besant,"Never forget that life can only be nobly inspired and rightly lived if you take it bravely and gallantly, as a splendid adventure in which you are setting out into an unknown country, to meet many a joy, to find many a comrade, to win and lose many a battle."
Henry Bessemer,"The ordinary bronze powder is, as before mentioned, made from an exceedingly thin leaf of beaten metal, resembling an ordinary leaf of gold."
Henry Bessemer,"We fixed on No. 4, Queen Street Place, for our City offices, and it was from there that so many of my patented inventions were dated."

Henry Bessemer,"The ground for the factory having been chosen, and a long lease of the premises obtained, I had next to plan the necessary buildings."
Henry Bessemer,"On March 4th, 1830, I arrived in London, where a new world seemed opened to me."
Henry Bessemer,"Nevertheless, several of my friends have from time to time tried to induce me to write a concise account of my steel invention in my own quiet way."
Henry Bessemer,"My life at this time was pretty much one of hard work and steady attention to business, from which I could only snatch short intervals."
Henry Bessemer,"It is true I had been successful on a small scale in overcoming one of the main difficulties in the new process, but there was still much to invent, and much that at that period I necessarily knew nothing about."
Henry Bessemer,"In such a case secrecy must be absolute to be effective, and although mere vague curiosity induced many persons of my intimate acquaintance to ask to be allowed to just go in and have a peep, I never admitted anyone."
Henry Bessemer,I was quite unable to make any white metal alloy hard enough to be made into powder by my machinery.
Henry Bessemer,"I had now arrived at my seventeenth year, and had attained my full height, a fraction over six feet. I was well endowed with youthful energy, and was of an extremely sanguine temperament."
Henry Bessemer,"I had been working pretty hard up to the time of the trials of the cane press, and felt that I was entitled to a little relaxation."
Henry Bessemer,"I fear this little episode does not speak very favourably for my business capacity in those early days, for I certainly ought to have made much more than I did by this really important invention."
Henry Bessemer,"At this period the enthusiasm of the amateur was fast giving way to a more steady commercial instinct, and I let no opportunity slip of improving my position, but I felt that I was still labouring under the disadvantage of not having acquired some technical profession."
Henry Bessemer,"I had an immense advantage over many others dealing with the problem inasmuch as I had no fixed ideas derived from long-established practice to control and bias my mind, and did not suffer from the general belief that whatever is, is right."
Henry Bessemer,"The bronze powder business, however, no longer required my personal attention, and was well managed by those I had chosen as the guardians of a secret, which was long and honourably kept."
Paul Bessler,The features are definitely getting influenced by the boomers. Our research shows that two-thirds of baby boomers are going to keep working.
Paul Bessler,This is not my grandfather's home any more.
Paul Bessler,"This is not just a millionaire's dream anymore. Depending on the community, between 8 percent and 38 percent of our buyers have three homes or more."
George Best,"I'm OK. Much better than on other occasions. It's true that I've made lots of mistakes but I've never tried to bother anyone. I want to stay alive, preferably in peace, without seeing every one of my mistakes in the papers, and on many occasions, even stories that are lies."
George Best,"Owen is great and Beckham is good. Owen is direct, fast and scores goals. Beckham has other qualities which make him good, but what makes a player different is the danger he poses to the opposing defense. That's where Owen is better than Beckham."
George Best,fighting for his life
George Best,drifting in and out of consciousness
Henry Beston,"The quality of life, which in the ardor of spring was personal and sexual, becomes social in midsummer"
Henry Beston,"As well expect Nature to answer to your human values as to come into your house and sit in a chair. The economy of nature, its checks and balances, its measurements of competing life-all this is its great marvel and has an ethic of its own."
Henry Beston,"The three great elemental sounds in nature are the sound of rain, the sound of wind in a primeval wood, and the sound of outer ocean on a beach"
Henry Beston,"We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature, and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth."
Henry Beston,"The three great elemental sounds in nature are the sound of rain, the sound of wind in a primeval wood, and the sound of outer ocean on a beach."

Toba Beta,"It wasn't technology that developed slowly, but collective knowledge of society and market demands."
Toba Beta,"Some people say, â€˜Do not judge the book by its cover!â€™ Well, I say not to judge at all. People can say anything they want to say, but for me, cover does matter."
Toba Beta,"If you can not be sure about something unbelievable, do not jump to conclude it as hoax.If you are witnessing bizarre event right in front of you, do not jump to conclude it as real.Why? Because some people say 'seeing is believing', while the others say 'sometimes your eyes can deceive your mind'."
Toba Beta,"Outside belief, I wonder how people could be absolutely certain about something which needs forever to prove, like polemic between the concept of 'free will' against 'predestination' amongst the scholars."
Toba Beta,There are people who really believe in and fear of ghost. Some of them even are too afraid that cause their minds and senses are no longer function properly to be able to distinguish whether something is ghost or else.

Toba Beta,This civilization is the impact of the world's consumption behavior.

Toba Beta,"If you don't listen to the question entirely, then you are going to revise your answers frequently."

Jerome Bettis,"That's a tough thing when you've got a team that's looking at you as a leader and you're a rookie. You've got to develop that. First of all, you have to understand that's expected of you. How do you understand that if you don't know?"
Jerome Bettis,I still think I can get it done. I still think I can play this game.
Jerome Bettis,"I think the biggest thing was understanding what we are going into. I think not playing in a dome for so many years, it really rattled us. We understood it was going to be loud and you can't do anything about it but play through it."
Jerome Bettis,"Even when it's warm, they don't want to see me, trust me. I try to make it as difficult as possible for those guys and as painful as possible every time they tackle me. So late in the game, in the fourth quarter, that's when you start getting those big runs, because they don't want to come up and tackle you."
Jerome Bettis,"The reality is it could be my last. So, the way I look at it, I'm approaching it as if is the last home game."

Jerome Bettis,"I really think it is great that my mother and my father are able to capture a moment for themselves. Thirteen years following me around this great country of ours, they deserve it."
Jerome Bettis,"The frustrating part for me was listening to everybody talk about, well should I play,"
Jerome Bettis,That's my job. There was no way I wasn't going to get into the end zone.
Jerome Bettis,"I got the humility from Mom and Dad. But when I was here, coach (Lou Holtz) pounded it in; made sure it didn't leave. It was never about me, it was always about the team."
Jerome Bettis,"The script right now, if you took it to Hollywood they'd turn it down, saying it couldn't happen."
Jerome Bettis,"I feel so bad for him. He knew this was coming, but you hate to see it happen during Super Bowl week. He's not even going to get to enjoy it."
Jerome Bettis,He's our horse now; he carries the load. I always had faith in him.
Jerome Bettis,The range of our emotions there were all over the place.
Jerome Bettis,Joey Porter is getting criticism based on what he (has) said throughout the playoffs. I think it's easy to criticize him because of what he said in the past. But it's not like things he said in the past weren't true. The guy speaks off the cuff; he shows you what he believes and what he thinks. That's not a bad thing.
Jerome Bettis,"He's smash-mouth, but he's also got a lot of creativity and is going to bring a lot to the table for that team."
Jerome Bettis,"I do know that I would have loved to have been in there late in the game, ... Coach and I talked about all the situations that happened in the game and everything that was going on. But it's a conversation I'm going to keep and not talk about."

Jerome Bettis,"It'd be nice but it's not necessary. I started in so many, that's not critical. It wasn't on my Christmas list."
Jerome Bettis,"I played this game to win a championship. I?m a champion and I think the last stop is here, in Detroit."
Jerome Bettis,"Detroit, you were incredible. Pittsburgh, here we come. I played this game to win a championship. I'm a champion. I think The Bus ... his last stop is here, in Detroit."
Jerome Bettis,"when my body started to come around. I said to myself, 'If my body doesn't come around, there's no way I can be out here.' I only play a certain way. At that point, I said to myself, 'If it doesn't come back, I have to walk away.' . . . It was the first time it took that long [for his body to recover from a season]. I don't know if it was the age or whatever, but it took a while. I think that was a message that, 'You're okay, but it's taking a little longer.'"
Jerome Bettis,"We've played (in Detroit) a couple of times, so that's a benefit for me. Nothing the likes of this type of game, of course. But I don't think there's going to be any more pressure on me."

Gary Bettman,"The proposal, in effect, was a compromise,"
Gary Bettman,"Accordingly, I have no choice but to announce the formal cancellation of play for 2004-05."
Gary Bettman,"I believe that I owe it to our fans, our business partners, all the people that work in and about the game, that I'm going to have to make an official announcement. But in some respects, I'm sort of doing that now because I think everybody understands the timetable."
Gary Bettman,"My message to the kids and our fans is hockey's a great game. There's a lot of hockey being played at all levels. Get involved, do it. We will be back and we will be back better than ever and hopefully as soon as possible. Don't give up on the game. It's too good."
Gary Bettman,"If you want to know how I feel, I'll summarize it in one word - terrible."

Aneurin Bevan,Virtue is its own punishment
Aneurin Bevan,He has the lucidity which is the by-product of a fundamentally sterile mind. He does not have to struggle... with the crowded pulsations of a fecund imagination. On the contrary he is almost devoid of imagination.

Our vision has been to build a place to find anything."

Mike Bianco,"Baseball is so much about confidence. How you feel about your swing, your pitching. I don't think it's a false confidence. We know we have to play well to win. We didn't play well in March. We've seen both sides of it, which I think is a good thing."

Bret Bielema,"Thanks, that's a great perspective."
Bret Bielema,"He never had the daily repetitions of a mike learning curve, the reads, the reactions, the fits and drills. It was kind of a season in learning. When he began to start to play pretty well is when he had that little injury and didn't really play well again until the bowl game."
Bret Bielema,I kind of like where he is.
Bret Bielema,"I'll never forget opening up a fortune cookie at a Chinese restaurant on the very day that Fry offered me the job, ... It said, 'Choose a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life.' It's turned out to be true."

Marcelo Bielsa,We created good scoring opportunities and took advantage of them.
Marcelo Bielsa,"To be champion of the Olympic Games is quite an achievement and I'm obviously very happy. There are other elements that fit in professional football, the feelings of instability and constant analysis. But what has just happened, it is something that fills me with happiness."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"OBSOLETE, adj. No longer used by the timid. Said chiefly of words. A word which some lexicographer has marked obsolete is ever thereafter an object of dread and loathing to the fool writer, but if it is a good word and has no exact modern equivalent equally good, it is good enough for the good writer. Indeed, a writer's attitude toward obsolete words is as true a measure of his literary ability as anything except the character of his work. A dictionary of obsolete and obsolescent words would not only be singularly rich in strong and sweet parts of speech; it would add large possessions to the vocabulary of every competent writer who might not happen to be a competent reader."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"MISS, n. The title with which we brand unmarried women to indicate that they are in the market. Miss, Missis (Mrs.) and Mister (Mr.) are the three most distinctly disagreeable words in the language, in sound and sense. Two are corruptions of Mistress, the other of Master.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"MAGNITUDE, n. Size. Magnitude being purely relative, nothing is large and nothing small. If everything in the universe were increased in bulk one thousand diameters nothing would be any larger than it was before, but if one thing remain unchanged all the others would be larger than they had been. To an understanding familiar with the relativity of magnitude and distance the spaces and masses of the astronomer would be no more impressive than those of the microscopist. For anything we know to the contrary, the visible universe may be a small part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life- fluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal. Possibly the wee creatures peopling the corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper emotion when contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these to another."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"UNDERSTANDING, n. A cerebral secretion that enables one having it to know a house from a horse by the roof on the house. Its nature and laws have been exhaustively expounded by Locke, who rode a house, and Kant, who lived in a horse.His understanding was so keen That all things which he'd felt, heard, seen, He could interpret without fail If he was in or out of jail.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"NOVEL, n. A short story padded. A species of composition bearing the same relation to literature that the panorama bears to art. As it is too long to be read at a sitting the impressions made by its successive parts are successively effaced, as in the panorama. Unity, totality of effect, is impossible; for besides the few pages last read all that is carried in mind is the mere plot of what has gone before. To the romance the novel is what photography is to painting. Its distinguishing principle, probability, corresponds to the literal actuality of the photograph and puts it distinctly into the category of reporting; whereas the free wing of the romancer enables him to mount to such altitudes of imagination as he may be fitted to attain; and the first three essentials of the literary art are imagination, imagination and imagination.

Among these are the fables of Teddy the Giant Killer, The Sleeping John Sharp Williams, Little Red Riding Hood and the Sugar Trust, Beauty and the Brisbane, The Seven Aldermen of Ephesus, Rip Van Fairbanks, and so forth. The fable with Goethe so affectingly relates under the title of The Erl- King was known two thousand years ago in Greece as The Demos and the Infant Industry.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"TREE, n. A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal apparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear only a negligible fruit, or none at all. When naturally fruited, the tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor in public morals. In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit (white and black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the public taste and, though not exported, profitable to the general welfare. That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no discovery of Judge Lynch (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the lamp-post and the bridge-girder) is made plain by the following passage from Morryster, who antedated him by two centuries:While in yt londe I was carried to see ye Ghogo tree, whereof  I had hearde moch talk; but sayynge yt I saw naught remarkabyll in  it, ye hed manne of ye villayge where it grewe made answer as  followeth:Ye tree is not nowe in fruite, but in his seasonne you shall  see dependynge fr. his braunches all soch as have affroynted ye  King his Majesty.

The Idiot's activity is not confined to any special field of thought or action, but pervades and regulates the whole. He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"ABSENTEE, n. A person with an income who has had the forethought to remove himself from the sphere of exaction."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SPOOKER, n. A writer whose imagination concerns itself with supernatural phenomena, especially in the doings of spooks. One of the most illustrious spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells, who introduces a well-credentialed reader to as respectable and mannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet. To the terror that invests the chairman of a district school board, the Howells ghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another township."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RICE-WATER, n. A mystic beverage secretly used by our most popular novelists and poets to regulate the imagination and narcotize the conscience. It is said to be rich in both obtundite and lethargine, and is brewed in a midnight fog by a fat which of the Dismal Swamp."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"INNATE, adj. Natural, inherent --as innate ideas, that is to say, ideas that we are born with, having had them previously imparted to us. The doctrine of innate ideas is one of the most admirable faiths of philosophy, being itself an innate idea and therefore inaccessible to disproof, though Locke foolishly supposed himself to have given it a black eye. Among innate ideas may be mentioned the belief in one's ability to conduct a newspaper, in the greatness of one's country, in the superiority of one's civilization, in the importance of one's personal affairs and in the interesting nature of one's diseases."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,Politeness is the most acceptable hypocrisy

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SYCOPHANT, n. One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he may not be commanded to turn and be kicked. He is sometimes an editor.As the lean leech, its victim found, is pleased To fix itself upon a part diseased Till, its black hide distended with bad blood, It drops to die of surfeit in the mud, So the base sycophant with joy descries His neighbor's weak spot and his mouth applies, Gorges and prospers like the leech, although, Unlike that reptile, he will not let go. Gelasma, if it paid you to devote Your talent to the service of a goat, Showing by forceful logic that its beard Is more than Aaron's fit to be revered; If to the task of honoring its smell Profit had prompted you, and love as well, The world would benefit at last by you And wealthy malefactors weep anew -- Your favor for a moment's space denied And to the nobler object turned aside. Is't not enough that thrifty millionaires Who loot in freight and spoliate in fares, Or, cursed with consciences that bid them fly To safer villainies of darker dye, Forswearing robbery and fain, instead, To steal (they call it cornering) our bread May see you groveling their boots to lick And begging for the favor of a kick? Still must you follow to the bitter end Your sycophantic disposition's trend, And in your eagerness to please the rich Hunt hungry sinners to their final ditch? In Morgan's praise you smite the sounding wire, And sing hosannas to great Havemeyher! What's Satan done that him you should eschew? He too is reeking rich --deducting _you_."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,Historian. A broad - gauge gossip.
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"ADAMANT, n. A mineral frequently found beneath a corset. Soluble in solicitate of gold."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"LETTUCE, n. An herb of the genus _Lactuca_, Wherewith, says that pious gastronome, Hengist Pelly, God has been pleased to reward the good and punish the wicked. For by his inner light the righteous man has discerned a manner of compounding for it a dressing to the appetency whereof a multitude of gustible condiments conspire, being reconciled and ameliorated with profusion of oil, the entire comestible making glad the heart of the godly and causing his face to shine. But the person of spiritual unworth is successfully tempted to the Adversary to eat of lettuce with destitution of oil, mustard, egg, salt and garlic, and with a rascal bath of vinegar polluted with sugar. Wherefore the person of spiritual unworth suffers an intestinal pang of strange complexity and raises the song."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"PLATITUDE, n. The fundamental element and special glory of popular literature. A thought that snores in words that smoke. The wisdom of a million fools in the diction of a dullard. A fossil sentiment in artificial rock. A moral without the fable. All that is mortal of a departed truth. A demi-tasse of milk-and-mortality. The Pope's-nose of a featherless peacock. A jelly-fish withering on the shore of the sea of thought. The cackle surviving the egg. A desiccated epigram."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SALACITY, n. A certain literary quality frequently observed in popular novels, especially in those written by women and young girls, who give it another name and think that in introducing it they are occupying a neglected field of letters and reaping an overlooked harvest. If they have the misfortune to live long enough they are tormented with a desire to burn their sheaves."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"BONDSMAN, n. A fool who, having property of his own, undertakes to become responsible for that entrusted to another to a third. Philippe of Orleans wishing to appoint one of his favorites, a dissolute nobleman, to a high office, asked him what security he would be able to give. I need no bondsmen, he replied, for I can give you my word of honor. And pray what may be the value of that? inquired the amused Regent. Monsieur, it is worth its weight in gold."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SCRAP-BOOK, n. A book that is commonly edited by a fool. Many persons of some small distinction compile scrap-books containing whatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to collect. One of these egotists was addressed in the lines following, by Agamemnon Melancthon Peters:Dear Frank, that scrap-book where you boast You keep a record true Of every kind of peppered roast That's made of you;Wherein you paste the printed gibes That revel round your name, Thinking the laughter of the scribes Attests your fame;Where all the pictures you arrange That comic pencils trace -- Your funny figure and your strange Semitic face --Pray lend it me.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"Romance is the fiction that owes no allegiance to the God of things as they are. In the novel the writer's thought is tethered to probability, but in romance it ranges at will over the entire region of the imagination."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"GHOST, n. The outward and visible sign of an inward fear."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"GHOST, n. The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.He saw a ghost. It occupied --that dismal thing! -- The path that he was following. Before he'd time to stop and fly, An earthquake trifled with the eye That saw a ghost. He fell as fall the early good; Unmoved that awful vision stood. The stars that danced before his ken He wildly brushed away, and then He saw a post. --Jared MacphesterAccounting for the uncommon behavior of ghosts, Heine mentions somebody's ingenious theory to the effect that they are as much afraid of us as we of them. Not quite, if I may judge from such tables of comparative speed as I am able to compile from memories of my own experience. There is one insuperable obstacle to a belief in ghosts. A ghost never comes naked: he appears either in a winding-sheet or in his habit as he lived. To believe in him, then, is to believe that not only have the dead the power to make themselves visible after there is nothing left of them, but that the same power inheres in textile fabrics. Supposing the products of the loom to have this ability, what object would they have in exercising it? And why does not the apparition of a suit of clothes sometimes walk abroad without a ghost in it? These be riddles of significance. They reach away down and get a convulsive grip on the very tap-root of this flourishing faith."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RESPONSIBILITY, n. A detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one's neighbor. In the days of astrology it was customary to unload it upon a star.Alas, things ain't what we should see If Eve had let that apple be; And many a feller which had ought To set with monarchses of thought, Or play some rosy little game With battle-chaps on fields of fame, Is downed by his unlucky star And hollers: Peanuts! --here you are! --The Sturdy Beggar"

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"INSCRIPTION, n. Something written on another thing. Inscriptions are of many kinds, but mostly memorial, intended to commemorate the fame of some illustrious person and hand down to distant ages the record of his services and virtues. To this class of inscriptions belongs the name of John Smith, penciled on the Washington monument. Following are examples of memorial inscriptions on tombstones: (See EPITAPH.)In the sky my soul is found, And my body in the ground. By and by my body'll rise To my spirit in the skies, Soaring up to Heaven's gate.1878.Sacred to the memory of Jeremiah Tree. Cut down May 9th, 1862, aged 27 yrs. 4 mos. and 12 ds.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RENOWN, n. A degree of distinction between notoriety and fame --a little more supportable than the one and a little more intolerable than the other. Sometimes it is conferred by an unfriendly and inconsiderate hand.I touched the harp in every key, But found no heeding ear; And then Ithuriel touched me With a revealing spear.Not all my genius, great as 'tis, Could urge me out of night. I felt the faint appulse of his, And leapt into the light! --W.J. Candleton"
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RACK, n. An argumentative implement formerly much used in persuading devotees of a false faith to embrace the living truth. As a call to the unconverted the rack never had any particular efficacy, and is now held in light popular esteem."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"PROBOSCIS, n. The rudimentary organ of an elephant which serves him in place of the knife-and-fork that Evolution has as yet denied him. For purposes of humor it is popularly called a trunk. Asked how he knew that an elephant was going on a journey, the illustrious Jo. Miller cast a reproachful look upon his tormentor, and answered, absently: When it is ajar, and threw himself from a high promontory into the sea. Thus perished in his pride the most famous humorist of antiquity, leaving to mankind a heritage of woe! No successor worthy of the title has appeared, though Mr. Edward bok, of _The Ladies' Home Journal_, is much respected for the purity and sweetness of his personal character."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"OBSESSED, p.p. Vexed by an evil spirit, like the Gadarene swine and other critics. Obsession was once more common than it is now. Arasthus tells of a peasant who was occupied by a different devil for every day in the week, and on Sundays by two. They were frequently seen, always walking in his shadow, when he had one, but were finally driven away by the village notary, a holy man; but they took the peasant with them, for he vanished utterly. A devil thrown out of a woman by the Archbishop of Rheims ran through the trees, pursued by a hundred persons, until the open country was reached, where by a leap higher than a church spire he escaped into a bird. A chaplain in Cromwell's army exorcised a soldier's obsessing devil by throwing the soldier into the water, when the devil came to the surface. The soldier, unfortunately, did not."

An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.Of Roman history, great Niebuhr's shown'Tis nine-tenths lying.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"CERBERUS, n. The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard the entrance --against whom or what does not clearly appear; everybody, sooner or later, had to go there, and nobody wanted to carry off the entrance. Cerberus is known to have had three heads, and some of the poets have credited him with as many as a hundred. Professor Graybill, whose clerky erudition and profound knowledge of Greek give his opinion great weight, has averaged all the estimates, and makes the number twenty-seven --a judgment that would be entirely conclusive is Professor Graybill had known (a) something about dogs, and (b) something about arithmetic."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"HOPE, n. Desire and expectation rolled into one.Delicious Hope! when naught to man it left -- Of fortune destitute, of friends bereft; When even his dog deserts him, and his goat With tranquil disaffection chews his coat While yet it hangs upon his back; then thou, The star far-flaming on thine angel brow, Descendest, radiant, from the skies to hint The promise of a clerkship in the Mint. --Fogarty Weffing"
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"DUTY, n. That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit, along the line of desire.Sir Lavender Portwine, in favor at court, Was wroth at his master, who'd kissed Lady Port.

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"REASON, v.i. To weight probabilities in the scales of desire."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"OWE, v. To have (and to hold) a debt. The word formerly signified not indebtedness, but possession; it meant own, and in the minds of debtors there is still a good deal of confusion between assets and liabilities."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"Embalm, v.: To cheat vegetation by locking up the gases upon which it feeds. By embalming their dead and thereby deranging the natural balance between animal and vegetable life, the Egyptians made their once fertile and populous country barren and incapable of supporting more than a meagre crew. The modern metallic burial casket is a step in the same direction, and many a dead man who ought now to be ornamenting his neighbor's lawn as a tree, or enriching his table as a bunch of radishes, is doomed to a long inutility. We shall get him after awhile if we are spared, but in the meantime the violet and the rose are languishing for a nibble at his glutaeus maximus."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"Doubt, indulged and cherished, is in danger of becoming denial; but if honest, and bent on thorough investigation, it may soon lead to full establishment of the truth."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"PRE-ADAMITE, n. One of an experimental and apparently unsatisfactory race of antedated Creation and lived under conditions not easily conceived.

Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation of symbols.They say 'tis conscience feels compunction; I hold that that's the stomach's function, For of the sinner I have noted That when he's sinned he's somewhat bloated, Or ill some other ghastly fashion Within that bowel of compassion. True, I believe the only sinner Is he that eats a shabby dinner. You know how Adam with good reason, For eating apples out of season, Was cursed. But that is all symbolic: The truth is, Adam had the colic."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"PHILANTHROPIST, n. A rich (and usually bald) old gentleman who has trained himself to grin while his conscience is picking his pocket."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"POCKET, n. The cradle of motive and the grave of conscience. In woman this organ is lacking; so she acts without motive, and her conscience, denied burial, remains ever alive, confessing the sins of others."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"BEHAVIOR, n. Conduct, as determined, not by principle, but by breeding. The word seems to be somewhat loosely used in Dr. Jamrach Holobom's translation of the following lines from the _Dies Irae_:Recordare, Jesu pie, Quod sum causa tuae viae. Ne me perdas illa die.Pray remember, sacred Savior, Whose the thoughtless hand that gave your Death-blow. Pardon such behavior."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"ENVELOPE, n. The coffin of a document; the scabbard of a bill; the husk of a remittance; the bed-gown of a love-letter."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"DAWN, n. The time when men of reason go to bed. Certain old men prefer to rise at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach, and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of them. The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all the others who have tried it."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RAZOR, n. An instrument used by the Caucasian to enhance his beauty, by the Mongolian to make a guy of himself, and by the Afro-American to affirm his worth."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SEAL, n. A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their authenticity and authority. Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, and attached to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself. Sealing, in this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent. In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a sacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now. As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful. Our word sincere is derived from _sine cero_, without wax, but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S., commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean _locum sigillis_, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used --an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish. The words _locum sigillis_ are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"MAGDALENE, n. An inhabitant of Magdala. Popularly, a woman found out. This definition of the word has the authority of ignorance, Mary of Magdala being another person than the penitent woman mentioned by St. Luke. It has also the official sanction of the governments of Great Britain and the United States. In England the word is pronounced Maudlin, whence maudlin, adjective, unpleasantly sentimental. With their Maudlin for Magdalene, and their Bedlam for Bethlehem, the English may justly boast themselves the greatest of revisers."

Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RABBLE, n. In a republic, those who exercise a supreme authority tempered by fraudulent elections. The rabble is like the sacred Simurgh, of Arabian fable --omnipotent on condition that it do nothing. (The word is Aristocratese, and has no exact equivalent in our tongue, but means, as nearly as may be, soaring swine.)"
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"RIGHT, n. Legitimate authority to be, to do or to have; as the right to be a king, the right to do one's neighbor, the right to have measles, and the like. The first of these rights was once universally believed to be derived directly from the will of God; and this is still sometimes affirmed _in partibus infidelium_ outside the enlightened realms of Democracy; as the well known lines of Sir Abednego Bink, following:By what right, then, do royal rulers rule? Whose is the sanction of their state and pow'r? He surely were as stubborn as a mule Who, God unwilling, could maintain an hour His uninvited session on the throne, or air His pride securely in the Presidential chair.Whatever is is so by Right Divine; Whate'er occurs, God wills it so. Good land! It were a wondrous thing if His design A fool could baffle or a rogue withstand! If so, then God, I say (intending no offence) Is guilty of contributory negligence."
Ambrose Gwinett Bierce,"SCEPTER, n. A king's staff of office, the sign and symbol of his authority. It was originally a mace with which the sovereign admonished his jester and vetoed ministerial measures by breaking the bones of their proponents."

I have to be more responsive and helpful to my assistant coaches, to give them the platform and the resources they need to be successful."
Brian Billick,"I can do the math. You can't trade sevens for three, plain and simple."
Brian Billick,You never pass up dynamic talent. Is he all you need? No. But I'll take it.
Brian Billick,"We spent next year's No. 1 to get a guy who was ranked 10th on our board this year. What's that worth? Unless we wind up in the top 10 of next year's draft -- and we think we're going to a better team than that -- we can live with that price. This building is pumped. We've added to our offense and our defense, and we've got a quarterback we can build around."
Brian Billick,"I had a quarterback that had a year off. He needed those snaps, ... I wanted to get as many viable snaps with Anthony Wright - going into the Tennessee game - as I could. Clearly the game was out of reach, but it was a tactical decision to get Anthony the reps."
Brian Billick,You don't want to put a player at risk. He feels good. We just have to make sure everyone else signs off on it.
Brian Billick,"That's that hook I'm talking about. Why would you not hold on to the potential for that for as long as you possibly can? ... These guys, the way they played last night, tells me they're holding onto that."
Brian Billick,There's always the potential via the rehab if it flares up again. That potential always exists.
Brian Billick,Mark brings the unique perspective to the position that only a former player can bring.
Brian Billick,"It had great strength, the point where he could probably play, but, on reexamination, from the long-term perspective, they decided to go with the surgery. I think they went about it the right way."
Brian Billick,Mark brings the unique perspective to the position that only a former player can bring. Mark will bring the same toughness and tenacity to this staff that he brought to his teams during his 11-year career in the NFL.
Brian Billick,I told the team before the game they didn't quite seem to have the passion and intensity you need to have every time you step on the field. That's something this team is usually good at. That concerns me a little bit.
Brian Billick,"There are varying opinions as to whether you do a surgery on this and there are prevailing opinions that say no, that the strength is good. That's something he and the doctors will have to sort through. Obviously, if they decide that it would put him in additional risk long term and if surgery is required, then clearly that would do him for the rest of the season."
Brian Billick,"Sometimes it's easy to feel isolated from one another because of the nature of what we do, but I think the organization as a whole appreciated the concept that we are truly in all this together,"
Brian Billick,I think the process is equitable. It's certainly not perfect. And management would be wise to be more inclusive in their perspective. But Marvin has been enriched by the fact that he has gotten to go through the process. I have no doubt in my mind that someone's going to wisely make him a head coach.
Brian Billick,"That's up to Deion. Having him here, as I've said a thousand times, has been phenomenal. It's been a joy for me to be around such a professional, and to see a guy at this stage of his career prepare the way he does and pass that on to people around him is special. Our guys are better for it."
Brian Billick,It's our intention to live up to the contract.
Brian Billick,"I hate to make the move, but Orlando understands that's what we need to do and hopefully his presence still being around will help us out."
Brian Billick,"You hate to let them walk out the door, but it's absolutely unavoidable, ... We knew what we were coming up to. We didn't wake up after the playoff loss to Pittsburgh and say, 'Oh, [shoot], look where we are with the cap.' We projected where our window was, and where we'd have to regroup. And we're clearly in the regrouping stage. But that regrouping doesn't mean we can't be good this season. We're not capitulating."
Brian Billick,"I've got a quarterback that's had a year off, ... I wanted to get as many viable snaps, game snaps, with Anthony Wright going into the Tennessee game that I could."
Brian Billick,"It wasn't for lack of shots, ... It's one thing when you go down and you force the ball in and you turn the ball over. We've done that. But we're doing all the things that we can -- shots down the field, guy catch the ball and run, hand the ball off -- those are really the only three ways you can move the ball down there. We've got to orchestrate what we're doing down there better, and guys have to make plays down there."
Brian Billick,I am accountable for everything that goes on with this football team. I take that very personally. The buck stops here. I am accountable and am going to be the one that has to put us on a course to correct it.
Brian Billick,I was fortunate. A lot of it has to do with fate. I knew coming in we had a good talent base. And that this is a good organization. But there were fewer obstacles to winning here than I thought there would be.
Brian Billick,"Every team goes through it at some point, in some form or fashion to varying degrees, ... And it is a fact of life in the NFL today. What degree, and what your expectations are, varies as well."
Brian Billick,"You need to get into football shape, and that has to be done in a certain environment, ... So we'll deal with whatever the system says he has to do, but it's our hope that they understand that there are certain circumstances that in order for him to go forward and do his job, there's some certain things that he needs to do."
Brian Billick,"The energy level, the quickness, the speed, the recognition; [Vilma] is an impressive player. I think there are some favorable and justified comparisons."
Brian Billick,"I would bet that Kyle is not ready to go this week; I'll wait on the doctors, but that one we're most assured of, ... What the time frame is beyond a week, I couldn't say. I can almost guarantee you -- without being a doctor -- that Kyle won't go this week."
Brian Billick,"I would bet that Kyle's not ready to go this week. I'll wait on the doctors, but that one we're most assured of. What the time frame is beyond the week I couldn't say, but I can almost guarantee without being a doctor that Kyle won't go this week."
Brian Billick,"is more severe than it sounds, but I'll have to defer to the doctors to see how bad it is."
Brian Billick,"It's a different pull. This is much lower. [Doctors] are still determining whether it's related or not, and how severe it might be."
Brian Billick,"They're optimistic that he could be fine game time. Certainly, if the doctors say he can't go, he can't go. But he has not been healthy, and you have to be healthy to play this game and this position."
Brian Billick,I think he showed a lot of mental discipline to overcome that [Denver] game. He's got a strong sense of conviction to hold onto the good things he did in Denver but be very cognizant of what he didn't do well and to not let that repeat itself.
Brian Billick,"We want to score more points, ... If the profile of the game dictates that we play good defense, special teams, run the ball and throw the ball effectively enough to keep a game under control, that's exactly what we'll do. Yes, we'd like to score more points. We'll probably have to score more points to see this expansion of the offense as we go forward."
Brian Billick,"The players love his passion, they love his dedication, ... Rex grew up in this game, in as passionate a football home, a la Buddy and his brothers, as you could possibly imagine. Talking, arguing, fighting over football every night at dinner. He brings that passion with him, and the players respond to that."
Brian Billick,"Passion, emotion and intensity are good, but they've always got to be under control."
Brian Billick,"They acted like out of control men, ... They acted like men who let the passion of the moment get away from them."
Brian Billick,"We need a consistency there, ... We've got to continue to find ways to get the ball in Mark's hands, which we'll do. It's not bad having Derrick Mason, Todd Heap, run the ball well. But to have another presence that people have to account for on the back side, with some consistency that the quarterbacks can rely on, that's the next step for us."
Brian Billick,"I don't know of a football field -- pup, community, Pop Warner, junior high, high school or college -- that that's not a touchdown, ... But evidently not in the NFL."
Brian Billick,"I don't know of a football field, pup, community, Pop Warner, junior high, high school or college that that's not a touchdown. But evidently not in the NFL."
Brian Billick,"I believe in the character of this football team, ... We made some egregious mistakes [Sunday]. But I believe in the character of these guys, and I'll stick by that character and support them to the end."
Brian Billick,Only if we let it. Only if we believe what we read and see. I know the Jets aren't feeling sorry for themselves. I know the resolve that team has. That's a good football team.
Brian Billick,"Look, Fish, ... the only criminal behavior Kyle is capable of is quarterbacking. So, he is what we would call a 'hardened criminal.'"
Brian Billick,"The frustration, the angst -- anger, if you will -- of the fans right now is matched only by the coaches and the players and the organization. It's very frustrating, very angering to not play better, to not do a couple of those things that you have to win in a close game."
Brian Billick,"They are two class individuals and I know they have a great affection for the people in Tennessee, for that organization, as they should, ... There is nothing like going home and being in a competitive atmosphere."
Brian Billick,"Sure, but just from the intensity of this game. Not taking advantage of the momentum the way we have done the last month or so."
Brian Billick,"More than any defense we've had, this fits Ray's ability. That's scary. The 3-4 maybe didn't suit Ray as well as the other defenses, but he embraced it anyway. ... He's been asked to adjust because of what's gone on around him. That's asking a lot."
Chauncey Billups,"It was a little different, but I'm happy to see those guys getting some important minutes, playing down the stretch when it really counted. Those minutes are when you really grow. Any move you make could be the best or worst move."
Chauncey Billups,"We always knew a championship ring means way more than being an all-star, although we wanted to be all-stars. This is just secondary. It's not going to make me feel the same way as I felt when I was on that big stage in the finals when I won a championship. At the same time, it's going to be up there, because it's going to validate what I always felt about myself."
Chauncey Billups,"I knew it would be tough. I didn't know it would be this tough. I didn't know they would struggle this bad with the players that they have ... I don't know how it's going to work out this year, but they're going to be all right. They've just got to be patient."
Chauncey Billups,"That guy, he's playing great. He's back to his old self again. I'm sure you all could see that. I'm happy for him, I'm happy that he's on my team, too. I just hope he stays playing with that same confidence coming down the stretch into the playoffs."
Chauncey Billups,"We're playing better. We're making progress. But now we've got to continue to do that, and not always take one step and then two steps back. That's the way it's been most of the season."
Chauncey Billups,Watching him is unbelievable. The kid is a freak of nature.
Chauncey Billups,"That's a great, great honor. I've never got that before. I've been player of the week, but player of the month is a lot tougher to get because you have to do it over the course of four straight weeks."
Chauncey Billups,"It was really an ugly game. We missed so many lay-ups. But when you're a good team, you win ugly games."
Chauncey Billups,"We were running around having fun. We were pretty much playing pre-season minutes, which is working out well."
Chauncey Billups,It's a lot of fun to play in this building. It's been a long time since we've had that college-game feeling. A standing-room crowd. The fans didn't sit down until they scored the first basket. You don't see that in the pro game.
Chauncey Billups,That was a lot of fun playing in this building. It's been a long time since we had that college-game feeling.
Chauncey Billups,"I like Flip because Flip is an offensive-minded coach,"
Chauncey Billups,"No question, that's what it's all about, letting the young boys shine."
Chauncey Billups,"We're healthy. A couple of our guys sat out, a couple of our young boys got an opportunity to play. They all played well, so we're fine."
Chauncey Billups,"He almost carried us to a victory last night, and he did it tonight. He's just playing great basketball right now."
Chauncey Billups,"We still have the best record in the league, but we're not playing the best basketball in the league right now. We have to get back to doing the things we were doing earlier in the season."
Chauncey Billups,"We come out this way and it's an advantage to have him and his staff because they've been in this conference for 10 years, and they know all these teams and all these players, all their tendencies. We know the basic stuff about these teams. We know what they like to do -- meat and potatoes. But they know them inside-out."
Mike Binder,I date this girl for two years--and then the nagging starts: I wanna know your name.
Mike Binder,Never practice two vices at once.
Mike Binder,Never moon a werewolf.
Brooke Bingaman,We're in this holding pattern and it's not lifting.
Brooke Bingaman,We're not really sure why this pattern is holding up for so long. We're not sure if the pattern is going to break. We're kind of trying to understand it ourselves.
Brooke Bingaman,"Over this past month, the pattern has essentially gotten stuck. At this point we're not seeing a breakdown in that pattern."
Brooke Bingaman,It looks like kids will have to have their egg hunts indoors on Sunday.
Brooke Bingaman,"Be cautious when you're out there in terms of flooding, and make sure you're prepared at home for power outages."
Brooke Bingaman,We do see spring in our future. There will be a block of dry weather early next week that could transition us into more typical spring weather than the persistent rain we've been experiencing for so long.
Jeff Bingaman,"The truth is, this is something the administration would dearly like."
Jeff Bingaman,"Social Security is not a retirement savings plan; it is a social insurance program. It's a contract that says, as a society, we will look out for you and your family when you can no longer work."
Jeff Bingaman,"Frankly, reconciling some of (her) past views with current testimony is not that easy, but I take Gale Norton at her word. Based on her testimony, because of the promises she made at the hearing, I will support her nomination."
Jeff Bingaman,"This is a program that's very important for the low-income seniors who depend upon it, ... I don't think most of them are aware that Congress has failed to extend the program."
Jeff Bingaman,"I strongly believe that securing our nation's borders is a fundamental responsibility of the federal government, ... This is not a burden that should fall on local communities that lack the resources to deal with the influx of illegal (immigrants) and the increase in border violence."
Jeff Bingaman,"I support concrete and progressive immigration reform based on three primary criteria: family reunification, economic contributions, and humanitarian concerns."
Jeff Bingaman,"Today, energy prices are at historic highs. Some analysts estimate that energy price shocks this year could cost American consumers more than $40 billion. Speaking very frankly, we cannot afford this kind of expense."
Jeff Bingaman,I have no doubt that Ms. Norton is an extremely decent and capable person ... I do have doubts about some of the policies she has promoted and whether they are consistent with the responsibilities of the job of Secretary of Interior.
Jeff Bingaman,"The diversion of Social Security revenues to private investment accounts would shift much of the risks of old-age back to low-income seniors, and pose very serious challenges to families who depend on social security's survivor and disability insurance benefits."
Jeff Bingaman,[The Center for Constitutional Rights has called for] emergency action ... The conscience of our nation is up for grabs.
Jeff Bingaman,People should not be imprisoned without having the ability to challenge the legality of that imprisonment.
Sue Bird,She never seemed like she was in pain. That's what great players do.
Sue Bird,"It's comforting to know that they would put their injuries aside, put the pain aside and still want to go out and win it for themselves and for the team. For them to be able to play the way that they have, it kind of makes you proud."
Sue Bird,Every higher seed has to do it. I'd rather play the two games at home.
Sue Bird,"This is the worst feeling I ever had, ... They jumped on us. Our defense was so bad. I don't even know what happened."
Sue Bird,"I just think what separates him is his ability to really get the most out of his players, out of his teams. Obviously, he's had some great teams and some great players. There's no doubt about that, but it's more than that. It's the way he brings out his best and that's really what separates him, I think, from everybody else."
Matt Birk,"He's as good as there is. Just from the little bit I know about him from some Pro Bowls and around the league, he's a quality guy, too. When people were asking me about the deal he signed, I said if anybody's worth that kind of money, he is. In my opinion, he's that good."
Matt Birk,He's actually good. I'm not.
Matt Birk,"Playing with pain is part of the game,"
Matt Birk,"Gene thinks we're making all this money because of Gene Upshaw. No, we're making all of this money because of TV. This sport is huge, and what's going on right now is hurting all of us."
Matt Birk,"We're kind of on a roll,"
Matt Birk,"We put the fun in dysfunctional, don't we?"
Martin Biron,"That's never happened, to be honest with you. When that happens, you work twice as hard because you want to keep it up and give them more to cheer at."
Martin Biron,I didn't care one bit if my legs were shaking at the end of practice. I want it; I welcome it. That's how we're going to get better.
Martin Biron,"There's not a whole lot of coaches that can say they've got 300 wins. That's definitely a big honor, especially in a season like this year where it's a 100-point season. It's big. That's big all around."
Martin Biron,They created the chances and created more opportunities and they got the goals.
Martin Biron,I made a mistake on their second goal to give the puck up on the wall. I'll take the blame for that. They created the chances and created more opportunities and they got the goals.
Martin Biron,"Our main objective as a group was to respond to any adversity that we faced all year. That's where I think our major accomplishment was, we battled injuries, we battled people putting us down, we battled a dry spell a few weeks ago. So it may have surprised other people but we knew in our dressing room that we had character, leadership - a lot more maturity than we had two, three seasons ago."
Rick Bisesto,Everything we baked we gave to friends to find out what works and what doesn't work. It took us a few months to get it down right. The end result was a lot of products.
Rick Bisesto,Don't settle and cater to the customer. We do anything and everything we can to make treats that the dogs like.
Rick Bisesto,We're offering accessories for dogs such as high end collars and feeding stations. It's stuff I didn't see out there. What we offer might not be the least expensive but it will be high quality.
Rick Bisesto,We pride ourselves on customer service. It's part of our business plan.
Rick Bisesto,In the beginning we just started researching and baking treats. It continued to grow to where it is now and who knows how far it can go from here.
Julie Bishop,Australia has an increasingly multicultural society.
Julie Bishop,"Australia is already a world leader in dementia research, treatment and care."
Julie Bishop,"If my brother and mother can enjoy this for a while, that's all I can ask for. It's the greatest thing in the world."
Julie Bishop,"We have a decreasing birthrate, although there are attempts to stem that trend, and we have an increasing life expectancy."
Julie Bishop,Prevention is one of the few known ways to reduce demand for health and aged care services.
Julie Bishop,Advances in science and medical research and public health policies have meant that life expectancy for Australians is one of the highest in the world.
Julie Bishop,"It is time for Government and providers, educators, unions, and health professionals to all work together to ensure that we attract and retain the best possible people in aged care, to ensure that the sector has a vibrant, interesting, rewarding career path so that it becomes a career of choice for people."
Julie Bishop,"Community care is a fundamental, an essential, an enduring part of our aged care system."
Julie Bishop,And I believe that the best buy in public health today must be a combination of regular physical exercise and a healthy diet.

Angelo Bitsis,"Just like with any issue, if we get complaints, we go out there."
Angelo Bitsis,We did draw blood from the driver and that is to see if there's anything in his system that would cause him to be impaired.
Angelo Bitsis,"There was no resistance, no attempt to flee or anything like that. It was a very, I hate to use the word, it was a very routine investigation and arrest. Just so happens that he's someone who is of some prominence and so everyone is making a big deal of it."
Robert Bixby,The surpluses put everybody to sleep.
Robert Bixby,"When the commission returned its report, most people focused on the second one, because it's the most coherent."
Robert Bixby,"The deficit is like an unhealthy habit. You can keep doing things you know aren't good for you. You know that somewhere down the road you're going to pay a price. But you keep doing those bad things, anyway."
Robert Bixby,That would undermine the whole concept of fiscal discipline.
Robert Bixby,"In a way, you've left yourself no choice, because the budget, as it turned out, wasn't any better prepared than New Orleans."
Charlie Black,He's reaching out and trying to repair things. He is working very hard at it.
Charlie Black,"A lot of the goals are going to relate to spending, as opposed to going after a radical tax-reform package."
Charlie Black,"If he can sometimes be a lightning rod and keep some of the criticism away from the president, I think that's fine with him."
Charlie Black,"Even though the president's job-approval numbers are down a bit, the RNC is still raising money at a record clip. It's likely a case where it's the party activists that give, and they give no matter what. And perhaps they give more when the party faces challenges."
Charlie Black,"I don't think he's lost any of his zeal for Social Security reform, ... The action has sort of shifted to the Hill now and the Ways and Means Committee so we'll have to kind of see what they can come up with."
Cilla Black,But reality television is here to stay.
Cilla Black,I had to do the book because there was an unauthorised biography which didn't tell it like it was.
Cilla Black,The nicest thing about coming of age is that I can do whatever I like.
Cilla Black,"I never did acid, I am just so high anyway."
Cilla Black,"It was an unknown thing, a lot of people had very bad trips and I like to be in control."
Cilla Black,I did smoke a joint once but I did not enjoy it.
Cilla Black,I didn't think before that I'd done enough to justify publishing an autobiography but after 40 years in show business I'm now ready to tell my story.
Cilla Black,"I love Simon Cowell, he's a dear friend."
Cilla Black,Well it has been very exciting and very changing as well. Celebrating the 40th year and having the album out and the Channel 4 documentary and I resigned from Blind Date.
Cilla Black,The difference with me is that I did inhale.
Cilla Black,The best advice he gave me was to carry on. It would have been difficult to set foot back inside a TV studio if I hadn't carried on - I don't know if I would have ever gone back in.
Clint Black,"I use computers for email, staying current with my own website as well as finding important information through other websites. I also use it for creating MP3 files of new music I'm working on."
Clint Black,"Country radio certainly widens the boundaries of what I can do. Other artists may do something more edgy that gets on radio and that opens the door for me to be more edgy, I think."
Clint Black,"I mean, it takes a large entourage to put on a tour. You can't have 'em sittin' around."
Clint Black,"I now have a home recording studio, which I can operate entirely on my own, as well as a portable version of the same which allows me to record anywhere I like and simply swap out the hard drives for use in the home studio."
Clint Black,I intend to keep writing Christmas songs. There's still a lot more about Christmas that can be captured and feel like old-time Christmas. A lot of the traditions haven't been explained in song.
Clint Black,"I wanted to be the perfect artist. I'd do three hours of media interviews a day, going to every radio station I could squeeze in. I'd sign autographs after the show until everybody left."
Clint Black,I am proud and honored to be part of the America Supports You Freedom Walk to honor the victims of 9/11 and to support our men and women in uniform.
Mark Black,"It was overall a great start up. We didn't have any big, unexpected problems. It's a real credit to the people out here."
Mark Black,We hope to be at 100 percent capacity by mid-November.
Mark Black,"It is kind of exciting. It's the beginning of the process and from here, we go forward."
Robert Black,"Some candidates in this race are sure to take a more negative tone and try to convince voters that our state has done nothing right in the last few years, but Texans will know better."
Robert Black,"A lot of the areas that are still without power, water. They're keeping notes on napkins."
Robert Black,"The real and fatal gap at the heart of the prosecution case is that they haven't been able to lead any evidence at all that could establish that the case containing the bomb started at Malta Airport, ... And without such evidence the case against the two Libyans simply collapses."
Robert Black,We have numerous conversations with numerous different education stakeholders.
Robert Black,"This is the same song, different verse from the Democrats running for governor. They have immense amounts of criticism but absolutely no plan to address the challenge."
Robert Black,"If the governor neglected, as a courtesy, to call the mayor, he is sorry."
Robert Black,"The audit concluded that there was a cancer growing on the comptrollerÂ´s office, ... ThereÂ´s a clear pattern here."
Roy Black,"Unfortunately, under the rules in Virginia, much of our evidence was not allowed. I think if all of our evidence had been allowed, we would not be in this position right now."
Roy Black,It's unfair to prosecute anyone addicted to pain medication.
Roy Black,No one is suggesting Rush Limbaugh did anything to hurt anyone other than himself.
Roy Black,I don't think it was bad faith. I just think the judge was wrong on the law.
Roy Black,The Best Lawyers in America 2003-2004.
Roy Black,I am pleased to announce that the state attorney's office and Mr. Limbaugh have reached an agreement whereby a single count charge of doctor shopping filed today by the State Attorney will be dismissed in 18 months.
Steve Black,"We lost the sales of 150,000 gallons of airline fuel. If we still had an airline I was selling gas to, we wouldn't be having this conversation."
Steve Black,"If a person wants to keep their land from ever going into urban development, they get a conservation easement,"
Steve Black,"Our lease is up in a year, that's what brought on the conversation. One of the main things that happened [to OFS] was the rise in insurance and fuel costs."
Will Blackmon,"I run all day in practice, so I'm used to it,"
Will Blackmon,I guess he's still in class. We respect each other. It's cool.
Will Blackmon,I was trying to be brave on that one. It was a simple 6-yard out and was trying to take what I could get.
Ritchie Blackmore,"When you've toured for about 10 years like me, you end up feeling like you're always waiting for somebody or something. The whole day is a drag."
Ritchie Blackmore,"When you're recording, if you're not really clean in your playing, it sounds like a mess."
Ritchie Blackmore,"When you're around someone good, your own standards are raised."
Ritchie Blackmore,"When something is not good, it's bad. Period."
Ritchie Blackmore,"What's the point of re-releasing an album? The original sounded good, why change something about it?"

Ritchie Blackmore,"The cello is such a melancholy instrument, such an isolated, miserable instrument."
Ritchie Blackmore,"Stevie Ray Vaughan was very intense. Maybe that's what caught everybody's attention. As a player, he didn't do anything amazing."
Ritchie Blackmore,Simplicity is the key.
Ritchie Blackmore,Session work makes you more strict. You can't hit notes all over the place. You've got to make each one really count.
Ritchie Blackmore,Playing a Fender is an art itself. They're always going out of tune.
Ritchie Blackmore,Pete Townshend used to crash chords and let the guitar feed back. He's overrated.
Ritchie Blackmore,Learning to play with a big amplifier is like trying to control an elephant.

Ritchie Blackmore,"If a ballet dancer falls over, it's knowing how to get out looking clumsy that counts."
Ritchie Blackmore,"Ian Gillan, Roger Glover and I wanted to be a hard rock band - we wanted to play rock and roll only."
Ritchie Blackmore,"I'm very moved by Renaissance music, but I still love to play hard rock - though only if it's sophisticated and has some thought behind it."
Ritchie Blackmore,I'm not into that Keith Richard trip of having all those guitars in different tunings. I never liked the Rolling Stones much anyway.
Ritchie Blackmore,"I'm not good enough, technically, to be a classic musician. I lack discipline."
Ritchie Blackmore,"I was impressed by Hendrix. Not so much by his playing, as his attitude - he wasn't a great player, but everything else about him was brilliant."
Ritchie Blackmore,I was impressed by Hendrix. His attitude was brilliant. Even the way he walked was amazing.
Ritchie Blackmore,I like leaping around on stage as long as it's done with class. None of this jumping up in the air and doing the splits.
Ritchie Blackmore,"I however don't go to clubs to show off and to be seen, and certainly not to make statements. I just want to be able to quietly watch a band."
Ritchie Blackmore,I have never met one person who likes Grand Funk.
Ritchie Blackmore,I had given up the guitar between '75 and '78. I completely lost interest. I was sick of hearing other guitar players and I was tired of my tunes.
Ritchie Blackmore,I had given up on the guitar between '75 and '78. I completely lost interest. I was sick of hearing other guitar players and I was tired of my tunes.
Ritchie Blackmore,I feel like I own the stage.
Ritchie Blackmore,I don't use the twang bar anymore. It's become too popular.
Ritchie Blackmore,I don't see myself as such an important guitarist.
Ritchie Blackmore,"I don't put myself on Jeff Beck's level, but I can relate to him when he says he'd rather be working on his car collection than playing the guitar."
Ritchie Blackmore,I criticize my own work pretty harshly.
Ritchie Blackmore,"I can turn on some jazz guitarist, and he won't do a thing for me, if he's not playing electrically. But Jeff Beck's great to listen to."
Ritchie Blackmore,I can never remember what I do even in the studio.
Ritchie Blackmore,I can imagine that Rod Stewart likes giving autographs because he's pure showbusiness.
Ritchie Blackmore,"I can do the old hand vibrato just fine, but I like attacking the strings."
Ritchie Blackmore,Everything I do is usually totally spontaneous.
Ritchie Blackmore,"But you have to give your whole life to a cello. When I realized that, I went back to the guitar and just turned the volume up a bit louder."
Harry Blackmun,as a person of judicial integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one field. I'd like to be known just as a good worker in the vineyard who held his own and contributed generally to the advancement of the law.
Harry Blackmun,"If there is any truth to the old proverb that one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client, the Court now bestows a constitutional right on one to make a fool of himself."
Harry Blackmun,It is precisely because the issue raised by this case touches the heart of what makes individuals what they are that we should be especially sensitive to the rights of those whose choices upset the majority.
Harry Blackmun,What the Court really has refused to recognize is the fundamental interest all individuals have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations.
Harry Blackmun,"In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently."
Harry Blackmun,"Disapproval of homosexuality cannot justify invading the houses, hearts and minds of citizens who choose to live their lives differently."
Harry Blackmun,The right of an individual to conduct intimate relationships in the intimacy of his or her own home seems to me to be the heart of the Constitution's protection of privacy.
Harry Blackmun,Who is to say that 5 men 10 years ago were right whereas 5 men looking the other direction today are wrong.
Harry Blackmun,"The states are not free, under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life, to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies."
Harry Blackmun,"By placing discretion in the hands of an official to grant or deny a license, such a statute creates a threat of censorship that by its very existence chills free speech."
Elizabeth Blackwell,"For what is done or learned by one class of women becomes, by virtue of their common womanhood, the property of all women."
Elizabeth Blackwell,"It is well worth the efforts of a life-time to have attained knowledge which justifies an attack on the root of all evil . . . which asserts that because forms of evil have always existed in society, therefore they must always exist . . ."
Elizabeth Blackwell,"It is not easy to be a pioneer - but oh, it is fascinating! I would not trade one moment, even the worst moment, for all the riches in the world."
Elizabeth Blackwell,"If society will not admit of woman's free development, then society must be remodeled."

Elizabeth Blackwell,"The idea of winning a doctor's degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me."
David Blaine,I think pain is easiest to avoid by filling the days with distractions - I wish to remove everything to search for a truth.
David Blaine,"Basically, it's something that's been done in the circuses, based on the old high-wire acts, ... It's like family entertainment, this one."
David Blaine,My only fear is the unknown.
David Blaine,"We are all capable of infinitely more than we believe. We are stronger and more resourceful than we know, and we can endure much more than we think we can."
David Blaine,I just believe that the feeling of wonder is amazing. I am pushing myself as far as I can humanly push myself... I can only hope for the best and expect the worse.
David Blaine,"As a kid, I always was obsessed with Houdini."
David Blaine,We are all capable of infinitely more than we believe.
David Blaine,I have not had time to reflect on my own truths in many years.
David Blaine,"In truth, the only restrictions on our capacity to astonish ourselves and each other are imposed by our own minds."
Ian Blair,These allegations strike to the heart of the integrity of the police and integrity of the Met and I fundamentally reject them. There is no cover-up.
Ian Blair,it would be arrogant not to consider the issue of resignation in such circumstances but stressed he had no plans to resign.
Ian Blair,I can remember being asked a question about a previous individual who was given a caution. I think that was a wrong decision.
Ian Blair,"We have to look at the impact of this kind of behavior, and if there is evidence, something should be done about it."
Ian Blair,"We have to look at the impact of this kind of behavior on impressionable young people and if there is evidence, something should be done about it,"
John Blair,"If a hospital is providing quality angioplasty and they're close to the numbers, we're not going to shut them down. Our decision really only can be made based on volume, but barring them being egregiously unable to meet expectations of volume, the agency is not looking to shut the programs down. We would be concerned if they were well below."
John Blair,"[He said Dunn's research shows promise and more government money has been requested.] We gave him a little bit of seed money to see if it can work and he did it, ... Because of recent events in London, we have looked at accelerating this."
John Blair,a modern take on traditional country homesteads in the area.
Edward Blake,"The accumulation of personal wealth and the extension of commercial transactions have developed a great and lamentable increase in certain classes of crimes, while the improvements in transport have largely facilitated the escape of fugitive criminals."
Edward Blake,"As far as I can judge, not much good can be done without disturbing something or somebody."
Edward Blake,"I may err in judgment, but I hope not in intention."
Edward Blake,I fear the carnival of crime is beginning on our border.
Norman Blake,"When I was a kid I listened to a lot of punk music, but then along came Orange Juice, ... They really broadened my musical perspective. They were self-deprecating and had a great sense of humor. And they sounded like Velvet Underground meeting Al Green. They called themselves 'the sound of young Scotland,' a play on Motown's 'Sound of Young America.'"
Norman Blake,"All you can do is make the records, and hope a group of people will pick up on it, and it will become the received wisdom that that's the record to buy, ... Because that's kind of how the music business works, isn't it? You think of the Coldplay record or something like that. The received wisdom is that you should have that on your coffee table, if you buy one record every two months or whatever."
Norman Blake,That sounds too much like hard work for us.
Rob Blake,"It's a different feel for that game than any other game on your schedule. It has in the past, and always will."
Rob Blake,"This team in the past hasn't taken advantage of some of the leads we've had in a series. So we have to force the issue, not sit and wait and see what's going to happen. (The Stars) are a veteran team with guys who have won Cups and their best game is going to be (tonight)."
Rob Blake,You never want to give a team life. We know how good they can be.
Rob Blake,We just have to hope we're in striking distance near the end (of the season).
Rob Blake,"It's always the same. Yeah, we got the first gold medal in 50 years or something like that. But the pressure to win and the expectations to win will always be there."
Rob Blake,"It wasn't about the Stanley Cup the year before, it was all about the gold medal. That's been the talk the last three years, and now this year. When you go home in the summers, the gold medal is remembered more. The difference now is defending the gold medal."
Rob Blake,"I think the last 25, 30 games, we've been battling to find our way into the playoffs, and once we succeeded, I think the emotion was tough to bring. But now we move on against Dallas, and I think you'll see we won't have trouble bringing emotion."
Rob Blake,Definitely. We're going to be fighting down the stretch and we have that western swing with . . . the teams we are battling with. You want be in a position for those three games coming up to be real big.
Rob Blake,We knew they were going to give it their best. They have a lot of character and a lot of veterans over there. We weren't up to the task. They are right back in this series.
Rob Blake,(The Red Wings) are the one team in the league that challenges you with puck possession. We didn't match them today in intensity.
Robert Blake,"Paid him? ... Don't put words in my mouth, junior."
Robert Blake,"Collette Duvall is a woman, a friend of mine, that I met when I was about 50 years old, and for the next 15, 16 years we were on-and-off lovers and always friends,"
Robert Blake,There was a clear understanding that Rosie belonged to me and Bonny.
Robert Blake,I wanted to convince him (the security) problem was real. And these were the probable reasons.
Robert Blake,"The rest is all a scam,"
Robert Blake,I'd like to give my best performance. I'd like to leave a legacy for Rosie about who I am. I'm not ready for a dog and fishing pole yet. I'd like to go to bed each night desperate to wake up each morning and create some magic.
Robert Blake,What are they going to do to me that they haven't done already? They took away my entire past. They took away my entire future. What's left for them to take?
Robert Blake,I know I spent a whole a lot of money...
Robert Blake,"We got married to get to know each other and see if we could make it together,"
Robert Blake,"I know a lot about you, and what I don't know I can lie about,"
Robert Blake,"Thank you, your honor,"
Robert Blake,"I was very pleased and very lucky that the system worked, ... I had lost faith in that."
Robert Blake,"The U.S. economy is probably growing at a pace that cannot be sustained over the long run. In our opinion, that means the Federal Reserve is going to need to act to restrain growth more dramatically than the market expects."
William Blake,"Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believed."
William Blake,"For everything exists and not one sigh nor smile nor tear, one hair nor particle of dust, not one can pass away."
William Blake,Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.

William Blake,"Sleep, sleep, beauty bright, Dreaming in the joys of night; Sleep, sleep; in thy sleep Little sorrows sit and weep."
William Blake,"I see every thing I paint in this world, but everybody does not see alike. To the eyes of a miser a guinea is more beautiful than the sun, and a bag worn with the use of money has more beautiful proportions than a vine filled with grapes."
William Blake,There is no mistake so great as the mistake of not going on.
William Blake,Pity would be no more / If we did not make somebody poor; / And Mercy no more could be/ If all were as happy as we.

William Blake,One Law for the Lion and Ox is Oppression
William Blake,I love laughing.
William Blake,"Cruelty has a Human Heart, And jealousy a Human Face; Terror the Human Form Divine, And secrecy the Human Dress. The Human Dress is forged Iron, The Human Form a Fiery Forge, The Human Face a Furnace seal d, The Human Heart its hungry gorge."
William Blake,"Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governed their passions or have no passions, but because they have cultivated their understandings. The treasures of Heaven are not negations of passion, but realities of intellect, from which all the passions emanate uncurbed in their eternal glory. The fool shall not enter into Heaven let him be ever so holy."
William Blake,Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
William Blake,"When the stars threw down their spears, / And watered heaven with their tears, / Did he smile his work to see? / Did he who made the Lamb make thee?"
William Blake,"Can I see another's woe, and not be in sorrow, too? Can I see another's grief, and not seek for kind relief?"
William Blake,The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.
William Blake,The pride of the peacock is the glory of God./ The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. / The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. / The nakedness of woman is the work of God.
William Blake,All futurity seems teeming with endless destruction never to be repelled; Desperate remorse swallows the present in a quenchless rage.
William Blake,"Mutual Forgiveness of each vice, / Such are the Gates of Paradise."
William Blake,Listen to the fools reproach! it is a kingly title!
William Blake,"If others had not been foolish, we should be so."
William Blake,Great Men & Fools do often me InspireBut the Greater Fool the Greater Liar.
William Blake,"The selfish smiling fool, and the sullen frowning fool, shall be both thought wise, that they may be a rod."

William Blake,Mere enthusiasm is the all in all. . . . Passion and expression are beauty itself.
William Blake,Mechanical excellence is the only vehicle of genius.

William Blake,And Eternity in an hour.
William Blake,see the world in a grain of sand ... And eternity in an hour.
William Blake,Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
William Blake,You never know what is enough unless you know more than enough.
William Blake,A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
William Blake,"The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity... and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself."
William Blake,The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
William Blake,Forgiveness of enemies can only come upon their repentance.

William Blake,"Since all the riches of this world May be gifts from the Devil and earthly kings, I should suspect that I worshipp'd the Devil If I thank'd my God for worldly things"
William Blake,"Then my verse I dishonor, my pictures despise, my person degrade and my temper chastise; and the pen is my terror, the pencil my shame; and my talents I bury, and dead is my fame."
William Blake,"The Desire of Man being Infinite, the possession is Infinite, and himself Infinite."

William Blake,"The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship."
William Blake,It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend.
Ken Blanchard,"The first principle of ethical power is Purpose. By purpose, I don't mean your objective or intention-something toward which you are always striving. Purpose is something bigger. It is the picture you have of yourself-the kind of person you want to be or the kind of life you want to lead."
Ken Blanchard,"As a manager the important thing is not what happens when you are there, but what happens when you are not there."
Ken Blanchard,In the past a leader was a boss. Today's leaders must be partners with their people... they no longer can lead solely based on positional power.
Ken Blanchard,"The key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority."
Ken Blanchard,"I never use notes, they interfere with me."
Ken Blanchard,"For a manager to be perceived as a positive manager, they need a four to one positive to negative contact ratio."
Ken Blanchard,"Too many leaders act as if the sheep... their people... are there for the benefit of the shepherd, not that the shepherd has responsibility for the sheep."
Ken Blanchard,"I absolutely believe in the power of tithing and giving back. My own experience about all the blessings I've had in my life is that the more I give away, the more that comes back. That is the way life works, and that is the way energy works."
Ken Blanchard,"Don't quack like a duck, soar like an eagle."
Ken Blanchard,Feedback is the breakfast of champions.
Henry Blanco,He just has a passion for the game.
Henry Blanco,"I've been working all year long with [hitting coach Gene Clines] and I think that's one of the differences. It works,"
Henry Blanco,"I think he's showing everybody he still can do it. Everybody knows his age, but I don't think it means anything. All I can tell you is, he's still smart. He's as smart as when he was 20, and that's what it takes. He doesn't throw hard, he doesn't overpower hitters, he just does what he's capable of doing."
James Blankenship,"The next four weeks are huge for us, in terms of trying to have a winning season. Gibson Southern (1-2) is playing real good football right now. They are obviously playing great defense and they are a much-improved team. We are going to have to get a lot better real quick."
James Blankenship,"My first year here I had to do a lot more running around campus to get registered,"
James Blankenship,"Gibson Southern was committing eight in the box to try to stop our running game, kind of daring us to pass. We had some kids make some big plays, but I still don't think we are even close to where we should be on the offensive line."
James Blankenship,"It started out weird, and then it just kept getting more weird as the night went on. I don't know of much that didn't happen in that game. Even when we kicked off, it was an adventure. I was just happy that our kids did eventually take control. I was waiting for them to play circus music at any time over the loud speaker, because that is what it seemed like."
James Blankenship,"Matt is a playmaker. Once he stopped worrying about what was going on around him, he did a great job of throwing the ball."
James Blankenship,We just got rid of the bells and whistles and just played football. Our offensive line really started coming off the ball and making holes. There was nothing fancy in what we did for the last quarter and a half.
James Blankenship,"We were real happy with our play early. The kids were really coming off the ball, playing excited on defense and offense."
James Blankenship,"As tight as the game was for a while there, we felt we could control the clock and control the line of scrimmage, ... We didn't want to do anything that would give Tell City a potential big play going the other way."
James Blankenship,"Tell City has obviously improved quite a bit from the beginning of the season, ... They are going to be pretty good in the 2A sectional. In the first couple of drives of the second half, they did a great job. But we just finally started stepping it up."
Drew Bledsoe,He's obviously a tremendous talent and everybody knows the difficulties he's had. Anybody that's going to look at him has to determine how much they'd be willing to take and determine from T.O. where he's at in terms of his attitude toward things. There are a lot of things if a team is going to approach T.O. that they've got to weigh.
Drew Bledsoe,Jason Witten is a special talent. He's as good as Ben Coates (was) when I played with him in his younger years.
Drew Bledsoe,"He will make things as hard on me as he can, ... He takes pride in trying to put pressure on the quarterback and trying to devise schemes to confuse your protection and try to get in the backfield. If we can handle it, we are going to have opportunities to make plays."
Drew Bledsoe,I think both of us appreciate more now than we did the first time around the opportunity we have to be a part of this league. To be in my 13th year and still have a chance to go out and compete is certainly something I don't take for granted. I think Bill's kind of in the same boat. He really enjoys being around the players and enjoys the process of getting ready for games. That part has changed a little as well.
Drew Bledsoe,"As a veteran player, I understand there's a method to his madness,"
Drew Bledsoe,"He's a very smart receiver in the slot, ... He does a great job with his moves at the top of his routes and gets himself separation. He has a lot of experience in this offense, so he really understands where we need him to be."
Drew Bledsoe,"This was huge because it would've hurt to lose back-to-back heartbreakers. It was a short week and we made mistakes, but we continued to show resiliency. We had to overcome ourselves to win."
Drew Bledsoe,When you have that rivalry and you have that history that goes with it certainly is good for the game and for the sport. I think it adds a little level of excitement for the players and the fans.
Drew Bledsoe,"I said, 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir' and did what I was supposed to do. He's a funny guy, but he's only funny if he's not talking to you because he's pretty hard on guys. When I was young, I got tired of all the noise from Bill. As you get older, you realize some of the things he taught me when I was young that have gone on to help me in my career."
Drew Bledsoe,"To go and talk to somebody that has a negative relationship with the guy, I just don't see the benefit for me personally or our team in doing that."
Drew Bledsoe,I kind of picked up the game at an early age. The way that other kids would learn what a fork or a spoon is.
Drew Bledsoe,It is the best feeling in the world to have a close game come down to just a couple of plays and you are able to do it.
Drew Bledsoe,That's the only reason I'm here. I don't need to play the game for any other reason than to win a championship.
Drew Bledsoe,The amount of work and the amount of both physical and emotional investment it takes to get to the top.
Drew Bledsoe,"You know, it's a different deal - throwing a football as opposed to throwing a baseball."
Drew Bledsoe,"Crazy things can happen, ... There are a lot of talented players in this league and if you don't take advantage of your opportunities and put a team away when you have a chance, you always leave them some opportunity to beat you. That's what happened."
Gretchen Bleiler,"I'm just super excited to work on my tricks for the rest of the season, rather than just competing, competing, competing. The Olympics were absolutely the highlight of my season, but I'm happy to slow down a bit."
Gretchen Bleiler,It makes snowboarding look easy. I've got a whole new perspective about racing.
Gretchen Bleiler,"That's snowboarding. We found some powder, we came down the mountain, she won gold, I won silver."
Brian Blessie,"I've been telling these kids all year that as long as they put their minds to it and compete and get after it, that we're going to playing we're going to play with good teams and have chances to beat good teams. Howard's a good club, and New Mexico (Junior College) is a good club. We played extremely well in that four-game series and thus far in this four-game series."
Brian Blessie,"We're in a position where we can control our own destiny. We don't need anybody to help us out. We've just got to win a series next weekend, finish up on the right note and get us to the post season."
Brian Blessie,"Basically, from here out, we control our own destiny. If we'll come out and play like we did those two games against New Mexico, I like our chances and I think we'll be in a good position."
Brian Blessie,We're in a situation now where we've got to take care of business with Howard and Frank Phillips. I would assume we need to probably win six games to really clinch it.
Brian Blessie,"The greatest thing in the world in baseball is you get to come out and play again the next day, or in our case 20 minutes later. Our kids really responded. We had the opportunity to split with the No. 1 team in the nation and kind of make a statement."
Wolf Blitzer,"You want to revise and amend those words, senator?"
Wolf Blitzer,Everybody will watch this trial live on television.
Wolf Blitzer,"There are smiles among the president's supporters,"
Wolf Blitzer,"In the Security Council, there is understanding that if Hans Blix ... were to be approached by the Iraqis that they need a little extra time for the civilian activities, the Security Council might give them a little bit extra time,"
Wolf Blitzer,"The committee found significant shortcomings in almost every aspect of the intelligence community's human intelligence collection efforts against Iraq's weapons of mass destruction activities. In particular, that the community had no sources collecting against weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after 1998. Most, if not all of these problems stem from the broken corporate culture and poor management, and it will not be solved by additional funding and personnel."
Wolf Blitzer,And hovering over all of this is the threat of terror. There are people out there who hate us. They are plotting 24/7. These guys are patient and spend a large amount of time between attacks planning.
Wolf Blitzer,Forty-three percent of the U.S. population believes there is too much freedom in the press. Twenty-two percent of the U.S. people believe government should censor newspapers.
Wolf Blitzer,"[Throughout the Middle East, democracy is making] baby steps, ... Lebanon is still a problem."
Wolf Blitzer,We'll have to wait the old-fashioned way.
Wolf Blitzer,Looks like a pretty serious race unfolding.
Wolf Blitzer,Why are you advertising so much of the U.S. intention and giving the Iraqis that potential advantage?
Wolf Blitzer,"It is time for the United States, as the sole recognized intermediary, to consider more forceful action for peace. The rest of the world will welcome this leadership."
Henry Blodget,"Near-term forecasts call for pain, especially in the travel sector."
Henry Blodget,"The environment continues to worsen versus our expectations, and we continue to think the seasonally weak first quarter will be the toughest quarter in terms of year-on-year growth."
Henry Blodget,"The environment continues to worsen versus our expectations, and we continue to think the seasonally weak first quarter will be the toughest quarter in terms of year-over-year growth. We also continue to expect the market to strengthen in the second half of the year, when the impact of the dot.com bubble has worked its way out of the system."
Henry Blodget,"Near-term, in a market environment in which investors are fleeing to quality, its stock could continue to do well. Our analysis, however, suggests that the company's long-term earnings growth is likely to be slower than the 15 percent to 20 percent consensus."
Henry Blodget,"In this market, you have two choices. Either you sit on the sidelines or you say you want to be in companies that you feel comfortable with."
Henry Blodget,We believe AOL and Time Warner are in the final stages of gaining approval from U.S. and Europe regulatory commissions. We do expect any concessions that would materially impact future performance.
Henry Blodget,"The online advertising market appears to be stabilizing, but we believe it will continue to remain challenging for the foreseeable future."
Henry Blodget,"We continue to believe in the long-term growth of online advertising. Near-term, however, we don't believe the market will bottom until the first quarter. We estimate only single-digit year-over-year market growth in the first quarter."
Henry Blodget,"We expect the challenging environment for online advertising to continue into the second quarter 2001, three-to-six months longer than we had originally expected. Because of this, we are not able to raise our bottom line estimates."
Henry Blodget,"We continue to think some upside is possible to these estimates, despite weakness in the online advertising market. We are not looking for as much upside as in the past, however."
Henry Blodget,"We would therefore remain cautious about adding new money to online advertising-driven stocks until the first or second quarter, when we should have better visibility. We continue to believe that the first quarter will be the toughest quarter, with only 10 percent year-over-year growth."
Henry Blodget,"There continue to be three major growth drivers in the consumer sector: traffic, advertising, and commerce. Traffic growth in the U.S. continues to slow, as more than 50 percent of the total market is already online. More importantly, we estimate that more than 80 percent of disposable income is already online."
Henry Blodget,"The majority of AOL's profits are derived from its pure advertising and commerce revenue, so strong sequential growth in this line is critical to the long-term growth story."
Henry Blodget,We continue to believe that the first quarter will be the toughest quarter for online advertising. We expect market growth of only 10 percent year-over-year. We believe growth will then accelerate modestly through the year.
Henry Blodget,"We continue to believe Yahoo! will make a good long-term investment. As a result of the challenging advertising environment, however, we believe the stock could see significant downside in the next three to six months."
David Bloom,"We are in a regime where we are worried about the economic cycle, we're risk-loving and are determined by short-term interest rates. The trade data doesn't matter in this regime."
David Bloom,"Victoria's Secret is aiming at both men and women, ... and they've already been successful because a lot of people are talking about the fact that they're going to be on."
David Bloom,"No one's quite sure if he's a genius or a fool, the difference sometimes seems so close. But I think he knows exactly what he's doing."
David Bloom,"Because of the lack of economic direction and data at the moment the security issue has played a bit more of a role than it would normally. But if you look at the turning point for a lot of things it's the U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers, not anything else."
David Bloom,We have seen this in the early payment by Russia of Paris club debt and the increase in euro in their basket.
David Bloom,"A company that's really trying to increase its awareness can very quickly do it because so many people are watching at one time, ... The gala around the Super Bowl ads has become so well known ? I've observed parties where people actually are quieter during the ads than they are during the game."
David Bloom,AIDS could ravage China's working-age population. Sick workers don't produce and there will be tremendous discipline problems as people become desperate.
Jeremy Bloom,One thing that I feel like I have been able to do is transition between those two sports very easily.
Jeremy Bloom,"To a certain point I feel like competitively I've done it all, looking back on everything with a smile on my face. Football is the missing block. Make it? Don't make it? I need to find that out."
Jeremy Bloom,"I would think as long as I'm playing, I wouldn't be skiing. I want to be running routes all year long. I would want to be training for football all year, which I've never done."
Jeremy Bloom,This is it. That was my last race for sure. I'm really looking forward to what's next.
Jeremy Bloom,"Overall, it was a huge success for me. It was a huge honor for me to be a two-time Olympian and have the accomplishments that I've been able to have in skiing. But certainly there was an element of disappointment. ... I expect perfection out of myself, and I didn't ski a perfect run. I was disappointed in that, but I did ski well, and I had a great time."
Jeremy Bloom,"It's so funny because it's such an unknown where I'm going. It's hard to say where I'll be, but one thing's for sure â€“ it will be a competitive situation, which I love, and a team environment, which I sorely missed."
Jeremy Bloom,"As far as the pop culture icon things that come my way, I'm an athlete. It's not something that would ever take away from my training."
Jeremy Bloom,"They told me that about college. 'You're going to get hurt, you're too small, you're not going to play.' I love people like that, it inspires me to do it even more."
Jeremy Bloom,"Well, this is America, so obviously football is the Big Daddy in this country. It gets the most attention and has the most pressure, and that's what I've been really missing. A lot of people love to ski in this country, but it's primarily a recreational sport and that's the way people view it. Competitive skiing is not really on the radar here."
Steve Bloom,"If you knew how scarce lab space is on this campus, you'd understand how big a deal it is to have this kind of laboratory space available. It just opens all kinds of opportunities."
Steve Bloom,"As the music editor for High Times, I found that the musicians wanted to do something for the cause, ... So I took them up on their offer. I suggested they do a album like this or commit to a benefit concert. I sort of tapped a vein that hadn't been tapped before."
Steve Bloom,"There is an argument that medical marijuana is a back door to (recreational) legalization, ... I don't think that, but I do believe it's opening the door for people to learn about the plant."
Steve Bloom,"[Despite the proliferation of miracle fixes such as this Stone Age diet, the US population continues to be more walrus than warrior, with Britain not far behind.] Seriously obese people will soon be as common a sight here as they are in America and fad diets won't help them, ... If you want to lose weight long term you have to think in terms of preparing and eating delicious vegetable stews and salad dressings. It's tedious. It's boring. But it works."

Kurtis Blow,"I know that Lumumba would not have wanted people to be sad. He would not want you to be upset and angry. [He] believed in Africa and Africans, those at home and those abroad. He believed in Black Power."

Kurtis Blow,Hip Hop is thee dominant youth culture in the world right now.
Kurtis Blow,"I used to date Latoya for awhile, I was a close freind of the family."
Kurtis Blow,"Well I was always a hustler... I ran numbers; I wasn't a stick up kid, but I was a fence for them. I used to sell weed; and was kicked out of Music and Art for that."
Kurtis Blow,"I was signed when I was 19 years old, in 1980. I went to Germany and France. Seeing the world at that time was just an awesome experience for a teenager."
John Bluem,I want to thank the Crew for continuing to support this game. It's wonderful for them to keep contributing to this type of game and it really shows how the soccer community really is. Thanks to the fans for everything. We're very happy and we hope the event keeps growing. I hope everyone tells their friends so it will grow even more next year.
John Bluem,"After it happened, I asked the Crew if they would mind if we played the game here on our campus, made it a memorial game and used the proceeds from the game as a fundraiser. They have been unbelievably supportive and fantastic in their efforts to raise awareness of the game, to participate in the game, etc. So our hats go off to the Crew for all of their help."
John Bluem,"What we're trying to achieve here is consistency. We want to be in the NCAA tournament every year. Four of the last six is a good start. Next year, three in a row would be the first time Ohio State has done that. It's a lofty goal and it's not going to be easy. Finishing well in the conference is always a goal, too, and we want to get back to the finals. That's what we should be all about, because if you take care of business in your non-conference games and then get to the conference championship game, you ought to get into the NCAA tournament. Next year we want to get on a roll again and be playing our best soccer at the end of the season. That will be important."
David Blunkett,"My sense is that there is a new understanding, yes."
David Blunkett,"I can assure the traveling public that if we believed it was not safe for them to travel or fly we would say so,"

David Blunkett,When I'm in London I do have the convenience of being close to St James Park which is also good for me because it gives me an excuse to get out and get some much needed exercise!
James Blunt,Goodbye My Lover.
James Blunt,"My life is brillant, My love is pure."
James Blunt,"Like any parents, mine wanted me to have a secure job with a regular wage and career prospects. And the one job my father knew of, that he'd had experience of himself, was the army, so he could help me in that direction."
James Blunt,"It's taken a long time but eventually when I had the songs in place and demos right and I found myself a manager, that's when everything started happening quickly but I think that's always the way it is."
James Blunt,"Absolutely, it's a really weird stage because at the minute, I can walk down the street and be unrecognised, lead a normal life, but my label and everybody is warning me that will be changing and I'm in for a rollercoaster ride."
James Blunt,But I think he might be too old for me at 27. I don't think my mum and dad would have that.
James Blunt,If the Army helped towards my tuition fees I would then give them four years of my life.
Roy Blunt,"We'll move toward voting next week, and when we do it will pass,"
Roy Blunt,I don't see any wavering of the support for the leader. I think a lot of members think he's taking arrows for all of us.
Roy Blunt,It's pretty easy to criticize leadership.
Roy Blunt,I don't know that we would drop the food stamp cuts.
Roy Blunt,It's no more difficult to file an ethics charge than it ever was.
Roy Blunt,"Tom DeLay wants to lay out that case. I think our friends on the other side know the only effective way he can do that is if the Ethics Committee does its work,"
Roy Blunt,"We all believe that he (DeLay) will return once this indictment is out of the way, and be the leader again."
Roy Blunt,"It's not easy to fill the gap left by Tom DeLay but all of our team is going to come together like we've never come together before,"
Roy Blunt,"I think largely because of his effectiveness as a leader, [DeLay] became a target, ... We all believe that he'll return once this indictment is out of the way. That's what the rules call for."
Roy Blunt,"Tom DeLay will stay as leader, ... Meet the Press."
Roy Blunt,"Our team has the very big shoes of Tom DeLay to fill temporarily, ... Under the strong leadership of the Speaker, we will work hard to do what Tom would do -- complete our work, and move forward with a positive agenda for the American people -- until he returns."
Roy Blunt,"Despair has been your lot for 60 years, ... but today we can say farewell with courage and with the knowledge that the fate of our fellow citizens has finally been discovered."
Roy Blunt,I think the compromise works. I talked to Chairman (Michael) Oxley about it again today and we look forward to having that situation resolved on the House floor next week.
Roy Blunt,"I think the whole leadership is in agreement this is what ought to happen, both the House and the Senate,"
Nellie Bly,"What a mysterious thing madness is. I have watched patients whose lips are forever sealed in a perpetual silence. They live, breathe, eat; the human form is there, but that something, which the body can live without, but which cannot exist without the body, was missing."
Nellie Bly,"The eating was one of the most horrible things. Excepting the first two days after I entered the asylum, there was no salt for the food."
Nellie Bly,Soon I was crossing the river and nearing New York. Once again I was a free girl after ten days in the mad-house on Blackwell's Island.
Nellie Bly,"People in the world can never imagine the length of days to those in asylums. They seemed never ending, and we welcomed any event that might give us something to think about as well as talk of."
Nellie Bly,"On the wagon sped, and I, as well as my comrades, gave a despairing farewell glance at freedom as we came in sight of the long stone buildings."
Nellie Bly,It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world.
Nellie Bly,"It always produces such a lonely, homesick feeling to know others are eating, and we haven't a chance, even if we are not hungry."
Nellie Bly,"In our short walks we passed the kitchen where food was prepared for the nurses and doctors. There we got glimpses of melons and grapes and all kinds of fruits, beautiful white bread and nice meats, and the hungry feeling would be increased tenfold."
Nellie Bly,"I took upon myself to enact the part of a poor, unfortunate crazy girl, and felt it my duty not to shirk any of the disagreeable results that should follow."
Nellie Bly,"I shuddered to think how completely the insane were in the power of their keepers, and how one could weep and plead for release, and all of no avail, if the keepers were so minded."
Nellie Bly,"I hardly expected the grand jury to sustain me, after they saw everything different from what it had been while I was there. Yet they did, and their report to the court advises all the changes made that I had proposed."
Nellie Bly,"I had, toward the last, been shut off from all visitors, and so when the lawyer, Peter A. Hendricks, came and told me that friends of mine were willing to take charge of me if I would rather be with them than in the asylum, I was only too glad to give my consent."
Nellie Bly,"I had never been near insane persons before in my life, and had not the faintest idea of what their actions were like."
Nellie Bly,"I had looked forward so eagerly to leaving the horrible place, yet when my release came and I knew that God's sunlight was to be free for me again, there was a certain pain in leaving."
Nellie Bly,"I always made a point of telling the doctors I was sane, and asking to be released, but the more I endeavored to assure them of my sanity, the more they doubted it."
Nellie Bly,"I always had a desire to know asylum life more thoroughly - a desire to be convinced that the most helpless of God's creatures, the insane, were cared for kindly and properly."
Nellie Bly,"How can a doctor judge a woman's sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination."
Nellie Bly,"Even that was all consumed after two days, and the patients had to try to choke down fresh fish, just boiled in water, without salt, pepper or butter; mutton, beef, and potatoes without the faintest seasoning."
Nellie Bly,Could I pass a week in the insane ward at Blackwell's Island? I said I could and I would. And I did.
Nellie Bly,"But here let me say one thing: From the moment I entered the insane ward on the Island, I made no attempt to keep up the assumed role of insanity."
Nellie Bly,"All the asylum clothing is made by the patients, but sewing does not employ one's mind. After several months' confinement the thoughts of the busy world grow faint, and all the poor prisoners can do is to sit and ponder over their hopeless fate."
Franz Boas,The disease of mutual distrust among nations is the bane of modern civilization
Franz Boas,"The existence of any pure race with special endowments is a myth, as is the belief that there are races all of whose members are foredoomed to eternal inferiority"
Franz Boas,"We do not discuss the anatomical, physiological, and mental characteristics of man considered as an individual; but we are interested in the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes."
Franz Boas,"We all know scientists who in private life do not come up to the standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches."
Franz Boas,"This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning."
Franz Boas,The historical development of the work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science.
Franz Boas,The disease of mutual distrust among nations is the bane of modern civilization.
Franz Boas,"Remember that in every single case in history the process of adaptation has been one of exceeding slowness. Do not look for the impossible, but do not let your path deviate from the quiet and steadfast insistence on full opportunities for your powers."
Franz Boas,Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth.
Franz Boas,My parents had broken through the shackles of dogma.
Franz Boas,"My father had retained an emotional affection for the ceremonial of his parental home, without allowing it to influence his intellectual freedom."
Franz Boas,"Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy."
Franz Boas,"It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life."
Franz Boas,"In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past."
Franz Boas,"I object to teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be."
Franz Boas,"I hope I may have succeeded in presenting to you, however imperfectly, the currents of thought due to the work of the immortal Darwin which have helped to make anthropology what it is at the present time."
Franz Boas,"Furthermore, the study of the present surroundings is insufficient: the history of the people, the influence of the regions through which it has passed on its migrations, and the people with whom it came into contact, must be considered."
Franz Boas,"Ethnological phenomena are the result of the physical and psychical character of men, and of its development under the influence of the surroundings."
Franz Boas,"If we were to select the most intelligent, imaginative, energetic, and emotionally stable third of mankind, all races would be present."
Bruce Bochy,I didn't think gender was even an issue anymore.
Bruce Bochy,I think he's still feeling the effects from the broken toe. I don't think he's fully recovered; he's trying to find his swing right now. That's why I want to give him a couple of days off to clear his mind.
Bruce Bochy,We had trouble executing the whole series. We have to bounce back.
Bruce Bochy,He had trouble gripping the ball.
Bruce Bochy,"Honestly, that wasn't a very good outing. His velocity was fine, but he had trouble getting the ball down. His stuff was good, and that's encouraging, but he made way too many mistakes."
Bruce Bochy,"Obviously, we're looking at at least a couple of months. They feel they can get his strength back before the end of the season."
Bruce Bochy,He didn't have a full tank. It's tough to pitch when you're not at full strength. He's still battling this thing. He hasn't gained all of his weight back.
Bruce Bochy,"We're not at full strength. I don't want to make an excuse, but it's floored some guys. It's zapped some guys. It's hit us hard."
Bruce Bochy,"You know what, that's one of the greatest feats in all of sports, ... You know what, it's not that easy. Especially with all of those rookies they've played."
Bruce Bochy,We may give them all extra rest.
Bruce Bochy,It's up to him now to continue his progress and get back to playing like we think he can.
Bruce Bochy,"There's some pride here, ... We wanted to get that game. There's been a lot of talk about not finishing over .500. It'd be nice to play well the rest of the way."
Bruce Bochy,"I'll just chalk it up as an off night for him,"
Bruce Bochy,"Miguel was starting the game that night. But he's out there hitting, and Ash knocked him down by accident. Miguel got right back in there and about hit Ash with a line drive."
Bruce Bochy,"Woody threw the ball well, just had some tough luck in the (two-run) first inning."
Bruce Bochy,He deserves a shot to try to get a 'W.' He's had some tough luck.
Bruce Bochy,"I thought Clay was outstanding. He was a victim of bad luck there in the sixth and got to his pitch count [78 pitches], so he came out. After that inning, we came back."
Bruce Bochy,Chan Ho did a great job. We need him to do what he did.
Bruce Bochy,Nobody got hurt. We got knocked out early in the first round.
Bruce Bochy,"To be honest with you, I sure hope so. They have a heck of a team over there."
Bruce Bochy,"I hate to think that Trevor Hoffman would not be in a San Diego uniform, ... When you think of Trevor, you think of San Diego."
Bruce Bochy,"He doesn't play golf or poker like most players. He loves the outdoors. One thing about Ryan, he takes excellent care of himself. He doesn't stay out late and abuse himself. His interests are different. I do think he'll have a good year. He knows what's at stake."
Bruce Bochy,Liney's been unbelievable. He's been giving us what we need.
Bruce Bochy,"When you do it three out of four games, you really believe it,"
Bruce Bochy,"I think overall with his game, he's a little rusty. He's a major-league player; he's a major-league hitter. He's going to be back up here. I just think, at this point, he needs some time down there."
Bruce Bochy,"Ryno is a presence, a force, ... When he's right, he can carry the ballclub. I thought he swung pretty good [on Monday night, going 1-for-3]. He needs to quit breaking it down [mentally] and go up there and let it go. When you struggle, you're getting ideas from everybody. He needs to keep it simple."
Bruce Bochy,"He's an impact player, one that's going to the Hall of Fame. Those guys have a swagger to them with their presence."
Bruce Bochy,"We're talking about a guy who's going into the Hall of Fame. He's got great presence, and what he's accomplished in the game is pretty remarkable, especially being a catcher. It's amazing, everybody knows about his power but this guy is a lifetime .300 hitter. He's a smart hitter, and what you appreciate when you watch Mike, even though he's a catcher and can't run like (Mike) Cameron, he's full-bore all the time. I mean, he gives you everything on the field."
Bruce Bochy,The failure to add on runs after a big first inning has been a problem. We've talked about it. We have to come out if it.
Bruce Bochy,They are perfect in their execution.
Bruce Bochy,I wouldn't put him in the five-hole if I didn't think he was (capable). I think he's got discipline. He's got a nice swing and I think he could be a very productive guy in our lineup hitting in the 5-6-7 hole.
Bruce Bochy,"I'd like to get him going. He's had some success here. I'd like to get him swinging with confidence, because I know if Ryno is swinging well and swinging with confidence, we're a different ballclub."
Bruce Bochy,"There's going to be a little more sense of comfort with him now. He knows this club, he knows the city, so it's nice to have him on the bench. He gives us depth and insurance in case something happens."
Bruce Bochy,"The pitching staff has a sense of comfort with him. He has stepped in and done a great job. He has helped stabilize this team behind the plate, and given us some offense, too."
Bruce Bochy,Our objective is to get to the playoffs and play good baseball. We'll figure that out once that happens.
Bruce Bochy,He just thinks about baseball. He said he doesn't go out. He just wants to go to the ballpark.
Bruce Bochy,"That was an efficient, well-played ballgame on our part. We needed that after the [12-2] beating they put on us [Friday night]."
Bruce Bochy,"At this age, I can't wear him into the ground. It's just too demanding a position. When you catch as much as he has over the years, it takes a toll on you. He can't do the things on a regular basis that he used to."
Bruce Bochy,"It's hard to throw much better than that, ... He made it look easy. He had great command, good sinking action and was getting ground balls. He made adjustments, and it looks like he took it out there."
Bruce Bochy,His presence and ability to do some damage can help get this offense clicking.
George Bodenheimer,"Changes in our management ranks presented an opportunity to redefine our structure. Aggregating all our creative energies in one division; placing all sales and marketing in one area to sell our growing menu of services; consolidating oversight of all technology; and affirming the centralized management of all international businesses are powerful statements. I'm excited about the prospects of this realignment and the people leading these areas. Not only does this reaffirm ESPN as the leading sports media entity, it will strengthen our commitment to serving sports fans."

George Bodenheimer,"Given the prolonged work stoppage and the league's TV ratings history, no financial model even remotely supports the contract terms offered."
George Bodenheimer,"Keith Jackson is a man of great character and a legendary broadcaster. For decades, his unmistakable style defined college football for millions of fans. While we hate to say goodbye, we understand his decision and wish him the very best."
George Bodenheimer,"You look at the body of work that has been completed here over 36 years: the great games, the stars, the story lines, the part of Americana that 'Monday Night Football' is, it's really a magnificent piece of work."
George Bodenheimer,History shows that baseball has grown as TV and media coverage have grown. Our mission is to serve fans and do it in all our media.
George Bodenheimer,"We have tremendous confidence in the ability of the league and players association to deal effectively with this issue, and it appears they are."
Tom Bodett,"They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."
Tom Bodett,"In school, you're taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you're given a test that teaches you a lesson."
Tom Bodett,"The difference between an optimist and a pessimist? An optimist laughs to forget, but a pessimist forgets to laugh."
Tom Bodett,You can make a new friend but you can't make an old one.
Tom Bodett,"The difference between school and life? In school, you're taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you're given a test that teaches you a lesson."
Jim Boeheim,They did a good job on him. They made him work for everything. He couldn't get any penetration.
Jim Boeheim,Scheduling is too much in this league for television and not enough for the players.
Jim Boeheim,"Scheduling is too much in this league for television and not enough for the players. It's very disheartening to look at scheduling and see that. Granted, TV's important, but it shouldn't run the league."
Jim Boeheim,"We didn't have quite enough patience on offense. When we got shots and really we got some good ones, and in the second half we got a lot of good ones. We just didn't make anything."
Jim Boeheim,"They could be in third place with a little luck. That's how close the league is. The difference is so minute between teams. Look at West Virginia, (they've had) one after the other of close, tough games, and as good as Connecticut is, against Pitt, it's a one-point game late at home. It makes for great games, I guess."
Jim Boeheim,"First of all, I want to start off with a profound abject apology for my language yesterday."
Jim Boeheim,It's an overwhelming feeling to be here. It's a tremendous honor to be here and walk through this building.
Jim Boeheim,We looked like a team that's been out playing a lot and is tired and is ready to go home.
Jim Boeheim,"He was very hard on me, ... It didn't matter if it was ping-pong or golf or pool, he'd try to beat me. He's definitely the person who taught me how to compete."
Jim Boeheim,Jim and I talked before the game (Monday) about this. It just doesn't make sense. Too many good teams. It's too difficult to stack the deck against people.
Jim Boeheim,I think some kids will get to college and realize it might be good to be here for two years or three. It's a good rule. I think it will prove to be beneficial to everybody in the long run.
Jim Boeheim,He made some bad choices and got in some bad situations but we need him to make plays. We don't have other guys to make plays.
Jim Boeheim,We just have to play better. We're in control of our fate. We just have to play better basketball down the stretch.
Jacob Boehme,"When thou art quiet and silent, then art thou as God was before nature and creature; thou art that which God then wats; thou art that whereof he made thy nature and creature: Then thou hearest and seest even with that wherewith God himself saw and heard in thee, before every thine own willing or thine own seeing began."
Jacob Boehme,You are at enmity with yourself.
Jacob Boehme,"I therefore became very melancholy and highly troubled. No Scripture could comfort me, though I was quite well versed in it."
Wade Boggs,"I talked to Wade and he said he regrets that he had other commitments and could not be here,"
Wade Boggs,"The things he did inspired me to play the game at that level, ... When I retired in 1999, I grounded out to second and gave it everything I had running down to first base in my last at-bat. I always felt if I disrespected the game by not hustling and giving everything I had, it's circumstances of cheating the fans  you're cheating the fans, you're cheating your teammates and disrespecting the name that's on the front of your jersey."
Wade Boggs,"This journey started about 42 years ago in a little town of Brunswick, Georgia."
Wade Boggs,"Then there's Johnny Pesky, hit me countless number of ground balls and improved my fielding so much."
Wade Boggs,"The owner of the New York Yankees, Mr. George Steinbrenner who I had the greatest respect for, I want to thank him for giving me the opportunity to win that special ring in 1996."
Wade Boggs,"Our lives are not determined by what happens to us but how we react to what happens, not by what life brings us but the attitude we bring to life."
Wade Boggs,"One guy that I wish was here right now, Ted Williams, helped me so much, our long talks, not about hitting but about fishing, one of Ted's passions, and I wish he was here today to share this with me because I owe so much to Ted Williams."
Wade Boggs,My journey took a surprising turn in 1992. I left Boston and who would have ever thought I would wind up with the New York Yankees?
Wade Boggs,My God... What are the headlines going to be like on Monday if the Yankees don't make the playoffs?
Wade Boggs,"Looking back on those days and little leaguer, the Hall of Fame is not even a blinking star, but through baseball travels and moving up the ladder, that star begins to flicker."
Wade Boggs,"In life, so many things are taken for granted, but one thing I can honestly say is that I took every day, enjoyed the game of putting on that uniform and playing the great game of baseball."
Wade Boggs,I played the game one way. I gave it everything I had. It doesn't take any ability to hustle.
Wade Boggs,"I have a message for the young kids. Life is about obstacles, endeavors in life are not to be overlooked."
Wade Boggs,Humbled by the fact that never in a million years would I ever thought that I would be on the same stage with all these great Hall of Famers and enshrined to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Wade Boggs,"Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad, and that's why I call you dad, because you are so special to me. You taught my the game and you taught me how to play it right."
Wade Boggs,"A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results."
Wade Boggs,I didn't get over 1300 walks without knowing the strike zone.
John Bogle,"We now have an equity fund industry that's [worth] $2 trillion, and if everyone wants their $2 trillion back tomorrow, they're not going to get it,"
John Bogle,The Commission's new proposals for compensation disclosure provide a timely opportunity to rectify the previous omission of compensation data for mutual- fund executives.
John Bogle,"[Mutual funds] don't last as long as you would expect; for example in the 1990s over 50 percent of all the mutual funds that have been in business during the decade are no longer here, ... If you invest in a firm you want to hold it long-term, but if the fund doesn't exist your option is nil."
David Bohm,"Yet, in spite of this world-wide system of linkages, there is, at this very moment, a general feeling that communication is breaking down everywhere, on an unparalleled scale."
David Bohm,"Yet it looks as if the thing we use to solve our problems with is the source of our problems. It's like going to the doctor and having him make you ill. In fact, in 20% of medical cases we do apparently have that going on. But in the case of thought, its far over 20%."
David Bohm,"What is the source of all this trouble? I'm saying that the source is basically in thought. Many people would think that such a statement is crazy, because thought is the one thing we have with which to solve our problems. That's part of our tradition."
David Bohm,"We havent really paid much attention to thought as a process. we have engaged in thoughts, but we have only paid attention to the content, not to the process."
David Bohm,Thought is creating divisions out of itself and then saying that they are there naturally.
David Bohm,"Thought is constantly creating problems that way and then trying to solve them. But as it tries to solve them it makes it worse because it doesn't notice that it's creating them, and the more it thinks, the more problems it creates."
David Bohm,Thought has been constantly evolving and we can't say when that system began.
David Bohm,"This kind of overall way of thinking is not only a fertile source of new theoretical ideas: it is needed for the human mind to function in a generally harmonious way, which could in turn help to make possible an orderly and stable society."
David Bohm,This is another major feature of thought: Thought doesn't know it is doing something and then it struggles against it is doing. It doesn't want to know that it is doing it.
David Bohm,"Therefore it would be wrong and misleading to break it up into my thought, your thought, my feelings, these feelings, those feelings."
David Bohm,"Then there is the further question of what is the relationship of thinking to reality. As careful attention shows, thought itself is in an actual process of movement."
David Bohm,"So one begins to wonder what is going to happen to the human race. Technology keeps on advancing with greater and greater power, either for good or for destruction."
David Bohm,"Similarly, thought is a system. That system not only includes thought and feelings, but it includes the state of the body; it includes the whole of society - as thought is passing back and forth between people in a process by which thought evolved from ancient times."
David Bohm,"People are no longer primarily in opposition, nor can they be said to be interacting, rather they are participating in this pool of common meaning which is capable of constant development and change."
David Bohm,One thus sees that a new kind of theory is needed which drops these basic commitments and at most recovers some essential features of the older theories as abstract forms derived from a deeper reality in which what prevails in unbroken wholeness.
David Bohm,"My suggestion is that at each state the proper order of operation of the mind requires an overall grasp of what is generally known, not only in formal logical, mathematical terms, but also intuitively, in images, feelings, poetic usage of language, etc."
David Bohm,"In relativity, movement is continuous, causally determinate and well defined, while in quantum mechanics it is discontinuous, not causally determinate and not well defined."
David Bohm,I would say that thought makes what is often called in modern language a SYSTEM. A system means a set of connected things or parts.
David Bohm,"During the past few decades, modern technology, with radio, TV, air travel, and satellites, has woven a network of communication which puts each part of the world in to almost instant contact with all the other parts."
David Bohm,"But you don't decide what to do with the info. Thought runs you. Thought, however, gives false info that you are running it, that you are the one who controls thought. Whereas actually thought is the one which controls each one of us."
David Bohm,"But the way people commonly use the word nowadays it means something all of whose parts are mutually interdependent - not only for their mutual action, but for their meaning and for their existence."
David Bohm,"And thought struggles against the results, trying to avoid those unpleasant results while keeping on with that way of thinking. That is what I call 'sustained incoherence."
David Bohm,A new kind of mind thus beings to come into being which is based on the development of a common meaning that is constantly transforming in the process of the dialogue.
David Bohm,"A corporation is organized as a system - it has this department, that department, that department... they don't have any meaning separately; they only can function together. And also the body is a system. Society is a system in some sense. And so on."
David Bohm,"Indeed, the attempt to live according to the notion that the fragments are really separate is, in essence, what has led to the growing series of extremely urgent crises that is confronting us today."
David Bohm,Individuality is only possible if it unfolds from wholeness.
David Bohm,Suppose we were able to share meanings freely without a compulsive urge to impose our view or conform to those of others and without distortion and self-deception. Would this not constitute a real revolution in culture.
David Bohm,The ability to perceive or think differently is more important than the knowledge gained.
David Boies,The only reason for them to collusively not to sell is to try to continue the scarcity that has driven natural gas prices to historic highs.
David Boies,Did you or others on behalf of Microsoft tell Intel that Microsoft would hold up support for Intel's microprocessor if Intel did not cooperate with Microsoft?
David Boies,"In the roughly six hours that the counting of the votes took place, a very large amount of progress was made. If the count had continued yesterday afternoon and this morning, that count would be largely completed, with possibly the exception of one or two counties that were outside of the Tallahassee area,"
David Boies,Is the term 'concerned' a term you are familiar with in the English language?
David Boies,"I think, your honor, you could say -- and this is not that different from what we have argued -- that as long as the manual recounts will not impair the final certification in time to permit the selection of electors by December 12, that those manual recounts must be included."
David Boies,"Absolutely your honor. In Sony, the court found that sports programming was a significant non-infringing use and that was 7.3 percent of all of the uses of the Betamax. They talked about the significance of one movie that was uncopyrighted,'My Man Godfrey.' They talked about one television show, 'Mister Rogers,' and that was significant."
David Boies,"The first thing, your honor, is that any candidate could have requested a manual recount in any county, so that the manual recount provision is something that by statute is given to the candidates. And wherever there has been a manual recount requested, the counties have gone forward, and indeed some of the results that have already been certified have been results that included manual recounts."
David Boies,"Microsoft's interest is in dominating technology that would prevent an alternative [operating system] platform, even if it means giving away [software] for free. Microsoft is not interested in revenues, they're interested in blocking competition."
David Boies,"This summer, we're going to totally divorce Sun."
David Boies,"I think when you have as many lawyers that are involved on both sides, there is a danger that they all try to find something to do."
David Boies,What company is most likely to be a potential entrant for operating-system competition?
David Boies,"Microsoft had an opportunity to ask any questions it wanted to about the nature of those sensitive business discussions. Unless Microsoft wants to claim that, like some indigent criminal defendants, they are unable to procure competent counsel on their own, it's really up to them to ask those questions."
David Boies,"The court heard Judge (Charles) Burton (of the Palm Beach County canvassing board), called by the defendants, testify that they had been able to identify the clear intent of the voters such to add a net 215 votes to Vice President Gore."
David Boies,"Whether you think their witnesses are credible or non-credible ... they've admitted monopoly power, they've admitted the absence of competitive constraints, they've admitted raising prices to hurt consumers, they've admitted depriving consumers of choice and they've admitted that the reason that they did that was because they were afraid that consumers would in their view make the wrong choice, which is the non-Microsoft choice,"

Rain Bojangles,Fear is the question. Love is the answer.
Anquan Boldin,"Coach Green talked about teams in the league, how some teams are going to get better, some teams are going to level off and pack it in. We don't want to be one of those teams. We want to build on this going into next year."
Anquan Boldin,"Your body will tell you when you're ready to go, ... and I think I'm at that point right now."
Anquan Boldin,"As an athlete, you think you are OK and you go by how you feel. But sometimes it's not that simple,"

It's about this team, it's about winning, and anything I can do to help him, I'm going to do. He did it when I was out there. I've got to stay involved, stay into it, stay in the meetings, because I'm going to be back. When I'm ready to go, I don't want to be behind."
Kyle Boller,I've never had any foot problems before. It's concerning because it's my plant foot.
Kyle Boller,"Ask yourself the question, if someone booed you when you got hurt, would you feel good about it? ... I've been through some tough times. I know there are people that are supporting me and pulling for me. So those people that cheered, they can do that if they want. They have the right to do it. But I've given 110 percent, and I've worked hard, and I'll continue to work hard."
John Bollinger,"What worries me is that we haven't really seen a sign of strength, a point where the bears are overpowered by the bulls and throw in the towel, ... That would indicate a dramatic shift -- essentially the breaking of the camel's back."

John Bollinger,"The pain level is as severe as anything the market has ever inflicted on investors before,"

Michael Bolton,"I'd like to write again with Bob Dylan again. I have some ideas about where I want to go and I'd love to work with him, at least lyrically. It was a really painless writing experience, again I was intimidated and star-struck - in awe of his brilliance and the music that I loved as a kid, the songs of his I did in clubs. When I was in his presence, I was a kid, trying to quiet my mind from this mantra of 'Oh my god this is Bob Dylan!'"

Erma Bombeck,"Do you know what you call those who use towels and never wash them, eat meals and never do the dishes, sit in rooms they never clean, and are entertained till they drop? If you have just answered, A house guest, you're wrong because I have just described my kids."

Erma Bombeck,"I was too old for a paper route, too young for Social Security and too tired for an affair."

Erma Bombeck,"When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, I used everything you gave me."

James Bond,"What we really need is to get back some of the optimism [in the Middle East peace process] we had five years ago and I'm sure there's going to be a change in the climate within a week,"
James Bond,He (Blackman) was still there where he had fallen the night before . . . I didn't try and wake him.

Julian Bond,He always had such a fierce determination to fight segregation in every possible way.

Julian Bond,I was a Georgia state legislator for a great many years.

Julian Bond,I now teach at American University and the University of Virginia.
Julian Bond,"I do think that some of us began to realize that this was going to be a long struggle that was going to go on for decades, and you'd have to knuckle down. A lot of people in our generation did that. They didn't drop out and run away."
Julian Bond,Griffin Bell later apologized to me for that decision.
Julian Bond,"First, this middle class I think owes its existence to both affirmative action and the expansion of opportunity for people with skills and training."
Julian Bond,"Ever since I've become chairman, there have been profiles of me in People, George, The Washington Post, The Detroit News, and all of them could have been written by the same person."

Julian Bond,"But even at the height of these scandals, even at the time when our finances were at their worst, the NAACP branches - the grassroots - kept plugging away. They kept doing what they do, and they do it well."
Julian Bond,But ambition does funny things to people.
Julian Bond,"Any time someone carries a picket sign in front of the White House, that is the First Amendment in action."
Julian Bond,"As skills and energy became more of a demand, people who didn't have skills just got left behind, got shuttled to the side. Education didn't keep up with their promise. Education didn't prepare them for this new world. Jobs went overseas."

Julian Bond,"People see America through particular lenses, either their profession, their race or their gender. So the party that speaks to our racial perceptions and offers solutions to the racial difficulties which we face is the party that's going to be rewarded with our votes."
Robin Bond,These guys are life. They have no idea how much we appreciate them.
Robin Bond,We've come a million miles from the bad old days. But no law changes the basic fact that employers want to do what's good for business. Their job is not necessarily to do what is good for you.
Robin Bond,"Schedule your vacation around the schedule of your business. For instance, if you work in accounting, don't plan on vacationing in March."
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"The mark of solitude is silence, as speech is the mark of community. Silence and speech have the same inner correspondence and difference as do solitude and community. One does not exist without the other. Right speech comes out of silence, and right silence comes out of speech."
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"The essence of optimism is that it takes no account of the present, but it is a source of inspiration, of vitality and hope where others have resigned; it enables a man to hold his head high, to claim the future for himself and not to abandon it to h"
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"If you do a good job for others, you heal yourself at the same time, because a dose of joy is a spiritual cure."
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,Gratitude changes the pangs of memory into a tranquil joy
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,A God who let us prove his existence would be an idol
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"To understand reality is not the same as to know about outward events. It is to perceive the essential nature of things. The best-informed man is not necessarily the wisest. Indeed there is a danger that precisely in the multiplicity of his knowledge he will lose sight of what is essential. But on the other hand, knowledge of an apparently trivial detail quite often makes it possible to see into the depth of things. And so the wise man will seek to acquire the best possible knowledge about events, but always without becoming dependent upon this knowledge. To recognize the"
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,"Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility."
Pierre Bonnard,"Draw your pleasure, paint your pleasure, and express your pleasure strongly."
Pierre Bonnard,Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.
Pierre Bonnard,A painting that is well composed is half finished.
Josh Boone,"A chance to redeem ourselves. We just weren't ourselves in the Villanova game. They took us out of our offense and defense and in the second half we didn't get out on shooters as much as we could. If we do the same thing against West Virginia, it's going to be the same thing because they're a great three-point shooting team as well."
Josh Boone,"Once again, we've had another wake-up call and we know we can't sleep through a game."
Josh Boone,"Just being tough and running. Those are the two main things. We?re going to have to be tough every play. We?re going to have to not let them force us out of our offense, and we?re going to have to run as much as we can, especially the big men."
Josh Boone,I don?t think there?s anything that you can really build on. It?s just the knowledge that you need to approach every game like it?s the last game you?re going to play.
Josh Boone,It helps a lot but it's not just experience. It has a lot to do with conditioning and the depth of our team. The last couple of games we've really been able to just wear other teams down toward the end of the game and really start to pull away.
Neal Boortz,I don't believe in atheists.
Neal Boortz,There is nothing quite so depressing as waking up to face a day when you know that you are going to have to deal with a government office or bureaucrat.
Neal Boortz,"If it is wrong for you to take money from someone else who earned it, to take their money by force for your own needs, then it is certainly just as wrong for you to demand that the government step forward and do this dirty work for you."
Neal Boortz,Freedom isn't for wimps.
Neal Boortz,"The key to accepting responsibility for your life is to accept the fact that your choices, every one of them, are leading you inexorably to either success or failure, however you define those terms."
Neal Boortz,"Wallow too much in sensitivity and you can't deal with life, or the truth."
Neal Boortz,"Free speech is meant to protect unpopular speech. Popular speech, by definition, needs no protection."
Neal Boortz,A lot of people out there pay good lip service to the idea of personal freedom... right up to the point that someone tries to do something that they don't personally approve of.
Neal Boortz,"The main purpose of Social Security is to redistribute wealth, to make an increasingly large number of Americans dependent on government for their basic needs in their retirement years."
David Booth,"We've got good talent; everyone works hard; and we all get along great. There's no cliques on the team like there's been in the past. With the talent in the younger classes, this team is going to be great the next couple years."
David Booth,"We're one of the only teams without a superstar. Our success isn't determined by one player, it's determined by the team."
David Booth,"Today, men write more than women, but it's on screen. The computer has made men free to write, and they're writing more than in the history of the world."
David Booth,I don't think we were as prepared on Saturday. We didn't come out with that same fire that we did on Friday.
David Booth,I don't dictate what humans should read. Only 15-20 percent of men read fiction. The rest don't.
David Booth,The schools are in danger of becoming tours where people visit old-fashioned times. We have to find ways to unite the outside and the inside of school.
David Booth,Christmas is a big deal in our family. A regular tree from any old lot just wouldn't do.
David Booth,Literacy is such a complicated adventure today.
Paul Booth,"It seems like yesterday that he was starting his first game as a freshman. If memory serves me correct, the first time he played he had 10 points, 10 assists and no turnovers, so I kind of knew after that night we had something special."
Paul Booth,They get their points in bunches and they get a lot of them off turnovers. Our kids have worked hard for this game.
Paul Booth,We called timeout and asked the kids to try not to foul. But (the Blazers) are very quick and continued to attack the rim and we continued to foul. Tonight someone was looking over us in the sense that they didn't make their free throws.
Paul Booth,"I don't think we played fantastic. Our transition defense was suspect. We made some bad decisions early in the second half, but then we picked it up. We questioned ourselves, but we have the answers now."
Steve Booysen,"The improved margin can be attributed primarily to the implementation of IFRS, which requires certain fee income directly related to the acquisition of loans to be treated as part of the net interest margin."
Steve Booysen,"The group's cost-to-income ratio is in line with the ratio reported for March 2005 if the costs relating to the Barclays transaction and synergy initiatives are excluded. However, if the Barclays related costs are included, the cost-to-income ratio deteriorated from 56.6% in March 2005 to 58.0% in December 2005 owing to top-line income growth, at 17.9%, lagging expenditure growth over the period."
Steve Booysen,This low charge is underpinned by the further improvement in the number and value of non-performing loans and increased success in the recovery of previously written-off amounts.
Scott Boras,"We learned from [ Alex Rodriguez ], when Seattle tried to trade him during his last year [that] it was a very difficult thing to do, ... If your team is remotely in the race you're better off keeping the player because clubs aren't going to give up much for a short, two-month stay."
Scott Boras,"I don't think high school players should be drafted unless clubs are required to pay the guys over $5 million. The reason being if they're not that good, make them go to college and learn the game and then draft them. But if you draft a high school player you have to guarantee his future. And if the player is not that good the team won't take the risk. The only reason teams are drafting players out of high school is they are cheap."
Scott Boras,"The Japanese teams start practicing in mid-January. They have a decisive advantage. For the American hitters, particularly the power hitters, it's not there yet. You take power away from the American players, all of a sudden you're going to have close games."
Scott Boras,"Kevin didn't have me pursue any teams because he wanted to see how his health was. He decided after the painful process last year he was not going to play. His arm is still remarkably good, but it's about his back. He had to endure a lot to throw last year."
Scott Boras,"He spoke to many Dominican friends and American friends, and many American players. If he was going to play in the classic, he was going to honor his citizenship and play for the United States."
Scott Boras,"The economics of the game have never been better, [which] proves that investment in players, star players, is the way to go. The fact is if an owner wants to win there are premium players out there. And we know the revenues are there for them to pursue them."
Scott Boras,"They had a conversation early in the week. They exchanged some dialogue, and they're going to talk again later."
Scott Boras,"His strength has increased since he left college by about 15, 20 percent. So he comes to spring training really after a six . . . seven-month extensive training program."
Scott Boras,"Greg's drag, ... may be his own choice."
Scott Boras,"When they drafted Pelf, he had thrown a lot of innings. We all felt he would benefit from a break, so we didn't even really start serious talks until January."
Scott Boras,Alex has made the decision to participate in the World Baseball Classic for the United States. He decided that he should honor the country where he's a citizen.

David Borenstein,'Tis nobler to lose honor to save the lives of men than it is to gain honor by taking them.

David Borenstein,Nineties style isn't.
David Borenstein,One cannot subdue a man by holding back his hands. Lasting peace comes not from force.
Anita Borg,We'll try to be a catalyst for development projects that include women at all levels - in the design and development process.
Anita Borg,Women will change the corporation more than we expect.
Anita Borg,"None of these devices address that women keep track of many people's lives, not just their own."
Anita Borg,"Leaders of the future will have to be visionary and be able to bring people in - real communicators. These are things that women bring to leadership and executive positions, and it's going to be incredibly valuable and incredibly in demand."

Victor Borge,"When an opera star sings her head off, she usually improves her appearance."

Victor Borge,I only know two pieces; one is 'Clair de Lune' and the other one isn't.
Victor Borge,The difference between a violin and a viola is that a viola burns longer.
Victor Borge,"I don't mind going back to daylight saving time. With inflation, the hour will be the only thing I've saved all year."
Victor Borge,Laughter is the closest distance between two people.
Victor Borge,My father invented a cure for which there was no disease and unfortunately my mother caught it and died of it.
Victor Borge,"Humor is something that thrives between man's aspirations and his limitations. There is more logic in humor than in anything else. Because, you see, humor is truth."
Jorge Borges,"Like all writers, he measured the achievements of others by what they had accomplished, asking of them that they measure him by what he envisaged or planned."
Jorge Borges,"Time is the substance from which I am made. Time is a river which carries me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire."
Jorge Borges,Your unforgivable sins do not allow you to see my splendor
Jorge Borges,"Reality is not always probable, or likely."
Jorge Borges,Life itself is a quotation.
Jorge Borges,The truth is that we live out our lives putting off all that can be put off; perhaps we all know deep down that we are immortal and that sooner or later all men will do and know all things.
Jorge Borges,The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb.
Jorge Borges,"Literature is not exhaustible, for the sufficient and simple reason that a single book is not. A book is not an isolated entity: it is a narration, an axis of innumerable narrations. One literature differs from another, either before or after it, not so much because of the text as for the manner in which it is read."
Jorge Borges,One concept corrupts and confuses the others. I am not speaking of the Evil whose limited sphere is ethics; I am speaking of the infinite.
Jorge Borges,Democracy is an abuse of statistics.
Jorge Borges,"Every writer ''creates'' his own precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future."
Jorge Borges,"To be immortal is commonplace; except for man, all creatures are immortal, for they are ignorant of death; what is divine, terrible, incomprehensible, is to know that one is immortal."
Jorge Borges,"In general, every country has the language it deserves."
Robert Bork,[Roberts has always been popular and has always been the] big man on campus. ... I can fend for myself on the way down.
Robert Bork,Only 1.5 Percent of Law Professors Sign Letter Opposing Roberts.
Robert Bork,"In a constitutional democracy the moral content of law must be given by the morality of the framer or legislator, never by the morality of the judge"
Robert Bork,"[Law is] vulnerable to the winds of intellectual or moral fashion, which it then validates as the commands of our most basic concept."
Robert Bork,a disaster on every level.
Robert Bork,The opposition reflected the polarization that existed in this country.
Robert Bork,"Those who made and endorsed our Constitution knew man's nature, and it is to their ideas, rather than to the temptations of utopia, that we must ask that our judges adhere"
Robert Bork,"[One noted legal authority endorses the White House response.] As I understand it, you can get marijuana whether or not you're really sick at all, ... Whether or not it really helps with pain or illness, effectively it's the legalization of marijuana."
Robert Bork,"When a judge assumes the power to decide which distinctions made in a statute are legitimate and which are not, he assumes the power to disapprove of any and all legislation, because all legislation makes distinctions."
Robert Bork,"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution...."
Robert Bork,An egalitarian educational system is necessarily opposed to meritocracy and reward for achievement. It is inevitably opposed to procedures that might reveal differing levels of achievement.
Norman Borlaug,Yet food is something that is taken for granted by most world leaders despite the fact that more than half of the population of the world is hungry.
Norman Borlaug,"Without food, man can live at most but a few weeks; without it, all other components of social justice are meaningless."
Norman Borlaug,"Therefore I feel that the aforementioned guiding principle must be modified to read: If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread; otherwise there will be no peace."
Norman Borlaug,There are no miracles in agricultural production.
Norman Borlaug,The green revolution has an entirely different meaning to most people in the affluent nations of the privileged world than to those in the developing nations of the forgotten world.
Norman Borlaug,"The forgotten world is made up primarily of the developing nations, where most of the people, comprising more than fifty percent of the total world population, live in poverty, with hunger as a constant companion and fear of famine a continual menace."
Norman Borlaug,The destiny of world civilization depends upon providing a decent standard of living for all mankind.
Norman Borlaug,"Plant diseases, drought, desolation, despair were recurrent catastrophes during the ages - and the ancient remedies: supplications to supernatural spirits or gods."
Norman Borlaug,"Nevertheless, the number of farmers, small as well as large, who are adopting the new seeds and new technology is increasing very rapidly, and the increase in numbers during the past three years has been phenomenal."
Norman Borlaug,"Man's survival, from the time of Adam and Eve until the invention of agriculture, must have been precarious because of his inability to ensure his food supply."
Norman Borlaug,Man seems to insist on ignoring the lessons available from history.
Norman Borlaug,"Man can and must prevent the tragedy of famine in the future instead of merely trying with pious regret to salvage the human wreckage of the famine, as he has so often done in the past."
Norman Borlaug,"For, behind the scenes, halfway around the world in Mexico, were two decades of aggressive research on wheat that not only enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient with respect to wheat production but also paved the way to rapid increase in its production in other countries."
Norman Borlaug,Food is the moral right of all who are born into this world.
Norman Borlaug,"During the past three years spectacular progress has been made in increasing wheat, rice, and maize production in several of the most populous developing countries of southern Asia, where widespread famine appeared inevitable only five years ago."
Norman Borlaug,"Contrasting sharply, in the developing countries represented by India, Pakistan, and most of the countries in Asia and Africa, seventy to eighty percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, mostly at the subsistence level."
Norman Borlaug,"Cereal production in the rain-fed areas still remains relatively unaffected by the impact of the green revolution, but significant change and progress are now becoming evident in several countries."
Norman Borlaug,"Almost certainly, however, the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind."
Norman Borlaug,"Civilization as it is known today could not have evolved, nor can it survive, without an adequate food supply."
Marco Boschetti,"If [the target's] average pay is half of the buyer's average pay, guess whattheir payroll is going up 50%. All those things need to be allowed for within the projection model in which you value the business, which is all a function of the CFO."
Marco Boschetti,"We believe this success is a direct consequence of companies' improved management of the M&A process, from target selection and pricing, to due diligence to implementation. In the future, this learning curve will certainly continue. So, while gaining competitive advantage through M&As is now a legitimate business strategy for growth, long-term success will depend on increasingly sophisticated M&A capability."
Marco Boschetti,"In some countries, it's easier to play games, or their liabilities are less transparent."
Amar Bose,"We did experiments with the Boston Symphony for many years where we measured the angles of incidence of sound arriving at the ears of the audience, then took the measurements back to MIT and analyzed them."
Amar Bose,"There was a time when I was wondering about this business of going public, so I visited about a half-dozen companies in the Boston area, all of them formed by MIT faculty and all had gone public."
Amar Bose,"The prejudice was so bad in the United States at that time that a dark person with a white person would not be served in a restaurant. My father, mother, and I would try it occasionally. We would sit there, and the food would never come."
Amar Bose,"The food we ate was Indian, and both my mother and father were very deep into the ancient philosophy of India, so it could well have been an Indian household."
Amar Bose,The excitement level for me working on projects is really not a bit different from when I was 26.
Amar Bose,Research in this country is going down.
Amar Bose,"One hundred percent of our earnings are reinvested in the company, and a great deal of that goes to research."
Amar Bose,I'm forming a charitable institution for education.
Amar Bose,I really wanted to do research. That has never changed.
Amar Bose,"I loved music, and in my ninth year at MIT, I decided to buy a hi-fi set. I figured that all I needed to do was look at the specifications. So I bought what looked like the best one, turned it on, and turned it off in five minutes, the sound was so poor."
Amar Bose,I had studied violin from age 7 to 14.
Amar Bose,But today the quickest way to save your bottom line is to cut off research.
Amar Bose,"At MIT, I had the good fortune for seven years to teach network theory, which is basic to many disciplines, to one-third of the undergraduate student body. It was an experiment to see how high we could bring their level of understanding, and it exceeded all of my expectations."
Amar Bose,I hope that the institution will succeed in maximizing students' potential in the same way. I will give all of my stock to this institution. It will own the Bose Corporation and be funded by the Bose Corporation.
Amar Bose,"At 13, I realized that I could fix anything electronic. It was amazing, I could just do it. I started a business repairing radios. It grew to be one of the largest in Philadelphia."
Amar Bose,All military and most commercial aircraft use our designs that process power from jet engines.
Chris Bosh,"The mood always lightens after a win. People are nicer, the food tastes better, practice is a lot more fun,"
Chris Bosh,It's all about concentration and repetition. That's all it is.
Chris Bosh,Just a Coke and a smile.
Chris Bosh,I think coach knows I can make plays. He wanted to get me over the hump with plays like that because we play of lot of games where we're in that situation.
Chris Bosh,I had a turnover and three missed shots down the stretch. I just have to make sure I calm my nerves.
Chris Bosh,"I haven't won on my birthday since college, so it's good to play hard and get a win by double figures."
Chris Bosh,"Sometimes when I have a 1-on-1 advantage and teams don't do a good job of either doubling or clogging the paint, that works to my advantage."
Chris Bosh,"The whole coaching staff talked about going to the line as much as possible, taking advantage of the mismatches and getting to the free-throw line. Whenever we play unselfish at home or on the road, we are a tough team to beat. When we play unselfish, we play better defense and we move the ball and play better offense."
David Boston,Cool. I need a big-time running back!
David Boston,It's been swollen the last three or four weeks and the doctors just wanted to make sure there was nothing wrong.
David Boston,"I made my bed in Arizona, and I was going to lie in it. But as soon as they didn't name me their franchise player, I knew they didn't want to win. I had a chance to pick what I wanted in a team, and the first thing was a strong running game."
Nelson Boswell,I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one another next morning.
Nelson Boswell,The first and most important step toward success is the feeling that we can succeed.
Nelson Boswell,The difference between greatness and mediocrity is often how an individual views a mistake.
Nelson Boswell,Here is the simple but powerful rule... always give people more than they expect to get.
Nelson Boswell,"What we must try to be, of course, is ourselves and wholeheartedly. We must find out what we really are and what we really want."
Ian Botham,You will attract the younger generation and they might well prove tougher than the older generation. What we are trying to do is to look at the future and see what we can do to bring some stability back to people's lives.
Ian Botham,The most famous cricketers are too big to play county cricket.
Ian Botham,Freddie and the England boys will all be coming along.
Ian Botham,Freddie has promised his support and will be doing more than one town. The other England boys are coming along at various stages.
Ian Botham,Bloody medieval most of them
Ian Botham,"If you can change three lives in 10, three lives in a hundred, that's got to be good, hasn't it?"
Leon Botstein,To subject colleges to uniform standards is to trivialize what goes on in higher education. Excellence comes in many unusual ways. You cannot apply the rules of high-stakes testing in high schools to universities.
Leon Botstein,"At best, most college presidents are running something that is somewhere between a faltering corporation and a hotel."
Leon Botstein,"It means a lot to my children. For them, it's a big deal because the Grammy nominations are so visible on the pop side."
Mark Boucher,I hope our public give them a bit of stick because we've taken a serious amount.
Mark Boucher,"We've got to back our bowlers against their tail. The wicket has flattened out a bit but the history of the Wanderers shows that the ball does something early in the morning. We'll have to make sure our bowlers are fired up, we don't have any runs to play with."
Mark Boucher,It was something special. Test cricket is a different ball game but I really enjoyed it and hopefully we can take some of that momentum into the Tests.
Mark Boucher,"It's one of my best moments in cricket. We always knew we'd be up against it. We tried to keep it simple, we knew we had to get a good start and Herschelle and Graeme (Smith) did fantastically well."
Mark Boucher,I'm at a loss for words. That is my best moment in cricket by far.
Mark Boucher,"If there's a Test match up for grabs and we've got to win it by bowling short balls at him, so be it."
Mark Boucher,"I also decided to take a few chances when the balls were pitched short. Luckily it worked, even though one or two shots went flying over the wicketkeeper's head. When you get runs against weaker countries you aren't always that appreciative but when you make runs against the Aussies it feels really good."
Richard Boucher,"We have been working with Italian authorities, and we'll continue to work with them as they investigate those who have been arrested."
Richard Boucher,"It remains important for North Korea to disclose their activity and to work with others on what we have all agreed on, which is the denuclearization of the peninsula,"
Richard Boucher,We've given ourselves another five months to work through this.

Richard Boucher,"In this context, we think the Palestinians have not done enough to fight terror and to end the violence."
Richard Boucher,"immediate, credible steps to end terror and violence."
Richard Boucher,against a backdrop of a well-documented campaign of violence and intimidation against the opposition.
Richard Boucher,"Much of the violence that we see now is being created by the gangs that were once aligned with the Aristide government. Without that factor, Haiti would be much closer to the rule of law and farther away from gang violence. So it's critical for the actors who supported these groups and who supported this violence to be part of ending it."
Richard Boucher,the need to end the cycle of violence is still there.
Richard Boucher,"The steps that need to be taken now are steps by Chairman Arafat to stop the violence,"
Richard Boucher,"What we're trying to do now is get the parameters accepted in a way where the reservations are reconcilable and, therefore, we know that both sides are in a position to negotiate seriously."
Richard Boucher,"We are actively considering all these legal issues and trying to work with the other governments involved to make sure that their concerns are satisfied,"
Richard Boucher,"We support the emergence of China in the region and on the world stage in many areas, as it's doing, ... we also expect China to play by the rules, to adopt the various standards of conduct that other responsible international players use."
Richard Boucher,"takes into account our discussions with Iraqis, with other [Security Council] members, with coalition partners, Arab states and others in the region."
Richard Boucher,And we do know that it doesn't bring security for Lebanese.
Richard Boucher,Each post will look at its security posture and reopen at an appropriate time.
Richard Boucher,Our view is that it should be referred to the U.N. Security Council. That's where we think the next steps are.
Richard Boucher,whether or not he violated the Department of State security standards.

Richard Boucher,"Unfortunately, in addition to these wild charges and ridiculous statements that we've seen, we haven't seen any concrete progress on reversing the negative trends,"
Richard Boucher,"The Israelis need to understand that incursions like this will not solve the security problems. They only make matters worse. As a consequence, we believe the Israelis should withdraw their forces from this area."
Richard Boucher,a very long-standing practice not to comment on matters of that kind.
Richard Boucher,We've always made clear that we felt that Somalia and the situation that existed there made it a potential haven for terrorists.
Richard Boucher,"People at posts were looking forward to having their families back with them, and at that time we operated on the best security information we had."
Richard Boucher,All the cars were lined up. The bags were packed. People were ready to go. At any moment we could have gotten in the motorcade and departed. This was real.

Richard Boucher,"Anyone with information on this attack is encouraged to contact local law enforcement, the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, the nearest FBI office or the Diplomatic Security Service immediately."
Richard Boucher,After careful consideration of the law and all the information that's available ... we came to the conclusion that the U.N. Population Fund monies go to Chinese agencies that carry out coercive programs.

Richard Boucher,"We have made quite clear that the influence that Syria has, and others have, on Hezbollah needs to be used in a positive direction and needs to be used to try to restrain these kinds of attacks."
Richard Boucher,"I think the secretary has made quite clear over the past few days that the ideas and parameters that were discussed in the last few months were President Clinton's parameters, ... And therefore, when he left office, they were no longer a U.S. proposal or a presidential proposal."
Richard Boucher,We'll look at it when it comes out and see if there are any ideas we want to deal with at that point.
Richard Boucher,"I can't program every step of the way of what would, we would hope, be a coordinated series of steps. But the intention is to go to the next round of talks and to begin addressing these issues in a way that's appropriate for the beginning of the process."

Richard Boucher,"We reject any criticism, any allegations that our human rights efforts have diminished."
Richard Boucher,We believe it's a very important and necessary step toward resolving the crisis in Macedonia.
Richard Boucher,"But what also matters to us is the degree of cooperation we get, the degree of transparency we get, and the degree of commitment we get towards avoiding a repetition."

Richard Boucher,The Iraqis have been able to put into place the kind of monitoring and control systems that are necessary
Richard Boucher,"in doing that, there may be economic costs, there may be economic consequences. And we are prepared to help Turkey, as [a] friend and an ally, with those economic costs and consequences."
Richard Boucher,"The United States will ensure that responses to this reward notice will be kept in strict confidence, ...

Individuals providing information leading to the arrest or conviction of those responsible for the attack on the USS Cole may be eligible for protection of their identities and relocation with their families to the United States.
Richard Boucher,"We don?t see a competition between [the United State and] Russia and China. A lot of what we do here is to give the countries of the region the opportunity to make choices and keep them from being bottled up between two great powers, Russia and China."
Richard Boucher,"U.S. diplomatic efforts are being coordinated with the international community in order to help diffuse tension between India and Pakistan. The crisis, though showing signs of abating, is not yet over."
Richard Boucher,"North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons is a matter of great concern to the entire international community, and especially to countries in the region, all of whom are interested in participating directly in the talks."
Richard Boucher,Clearly having Milosevic face international justice for international crimes remains a top priority for the international community.
Richard Boucher,"The international community has made quite clear they want to see the North Korean missile program curbed. The Russians share that desire and we'll be talking to them about how to do it, as well as talking to the allies."

So that these states are allowed to continue to do what they need to do vis-a-vis their trade with Iraq, and particularly in civilian goods for the people of Iraq."
Richard Boucher,"Everybody is aware that we almost came to an end without an agreement the other night, ... It's not jovial. It's not acrimonious. I think a serious mood is the best way to describe it."
Richard Boucher,"I'd have to say these people who we're sending out will conduct assessments, provide advice, help people get organized,"
Richard Boucher,"We have plenty of warnings for American citizens around the world, and it's just advice to people to tell them what to expect. And governments do that because they have an obligation to their own citizens."
Richard Boucher,"There's no question that the requirement is on Arafat right now to take strong and irreversible action, ... reviewing what our policy, what the next steps ought to be."
Richard Boucher,We've had very productive meetings regarding military cooperation with Saudi Arabia in the event of military action against Iraq.

Richard Boucher,"The president's back, we have been working very hard in his absence, and we look forward to his determination, his energy, and his seriousness in carrying the ball and moving forward from here."

Anatoli Boukreev,"I don't know what being an Everest guide means. I am a coach, not a guide."
Anatoli Boukreev,"What we can do now is contribute to a clearer understanding of what happened that day on Everest in the hope that the lessons to be learned will reduce the risk for others who, like us, take on the challenge of the mountains."
Anatoli Boukreev,"This year my role is clear: I am a coach, a coach to sportsmen."
Anatoli Boukreev,"There are many questions, but I cannot answer because I'm not a businessman, I am a climber."
Anatoli Boukreev,"People respected my experience, they hire me, they pay me what I am worth to coach their team."
Anatoli Boukreev,"I will advise them on how to reach the summit, I will show them how, and I will help them, but I cannot be responsible for their safety."
Anatoli Boukreev,"I want this book to be facts, to be important, to be history."
Anatoli Boukreev,"I travel to Jakarta, I see what an important country it is. I've been working with them for a year."
Anatoli Boukreev,"I told them, you can succeed - it's not likely the first time, maybe 25 per cent, but you CAN succeed. You can also die. By April 16 they had already been to camp III, well ahead of most teams."
Anatoli Boukreev,"I think that people ran out of oxygen and don't really know what happened up there, maybe some of them just made things up because they weren't sure what had happened."
Anatoli Boukreev,"I see the psychology of this team, I see they respect me very much as a climber, not like last year - these people value what I bring to them."
Anatoli Boukreev,I said to Scott that the ascent seemed to be going slowly and that I was concerned descending climbers could possibly run out of oxygen before their return to camp IV.
Anatoli Boukreev,I respect Everest very much.
Anatoli Boukreev,I offer my expertise and experience for hire in order to help a group of people reach the summit.
Anatoli Boukreev,I explained I wanted to descend as quickly as possible to camp IV in order to warm myself and gather a supply of hot drink and oxygen in the event I might need to go back up the mountain to assist descending climbers.
Anatoli Boukreev,"I am not sure the others are as committed as Rob Hall and Scott Fischer. I think there is more business now, and I know it will be impossible to stop this Everest business."
Anatoli Boukreev,"Concerned that others were not coming onto the summit and because I had no radio link to those below me, I began to wonder if there were difficulties down the mountain. I made the decision to descend."
Anatoli Boukreev,Climbing is what I do.
Anatoli Boukreev,"A review of summit day photographs will show that I was clothed in the latest, highest quality, high altitude gear, comparable, if not better, than that worn by the other members of our expedition."
Robert Bourassa,You only need a few people to effect a kidnapping.
Robert Bourassa,"The opposition parties, by attacking my relations with the federal government, in the last seven years, have not hesitated to score points."
Robert Bourassa,One can always debate questions back and forth.
Robert Bourassa,It is very difficult to know what may be in the back of the mind of public figures.
Robert Bourassa,I have always said that we did not expect a revolution in the streets.
Jay Bouwmeester,You can't worry about it. I'm getting some chances. It would be definitely nice (to score).
Jay Bouwmeester,"It's very exciting. First off, you didn't really think you'd have the opportunity. Then, to realize you're going to get to go, it's a pretty big honor."
Jay Bouwmeester,"We had a great group of guys, and it was a lot of fun going over there. And to win, there is nothing better than that. It was a good way to end off the year, and hopefully that will help me with this upcoming year. Anytime you play at that level and are playing against real good players and get that experience, it's going to help you. Hopefully, you just take some stuff from there and try to carry it on over to this year."
Bobby Bowden,We let them express themselves. How would you like to approach this game? Just kinda fun . . . nothing like a quiz the day before the game.
Bobby Bowden,"And we're not good enough to do that, ... You've just got to continue to remind players, it's not worth it, it's not worth it, it's not worth it. You do try to get them to be aggressive, but the aggression has got to shut off at a certain time."
Bobby Bowden,You can't take anybody lightly now. You're just asking for trouble.
Bobby Bowden,"I get to sleep. The phone doesn't ring ... If I have a two-hour flight, I get to sleep for an hour-and-a-half."
Bobby Bowden,I wanted to see more of the other runners.
Bobby Bowden,"If you've got a pitcher throwing a no-hitter, you don't take him out and rest him and try to bring him back."
Bobby Bowden,"He tried to go, but it didn't feel good, ... I don't think it's anything major. A couple days rest and he should be OK."
Bobby Bowden,"Lee's reputation was probably more heralded than the other guy in the state, ... But Weatherford made the best of it."
Bobby Bowden,"You've got to put it into perspective with Oklahoma's quarterbacks, ... They went through the same thing. Auburn's quarterback is struggling. I just have to get back to reality. Our guys are young too."
Bobby Bowden,You've got to put it into perspective with Oklahoma's quarterbacks. They went through the same thing. Auburn's quarterback is struggling. I just have to get back to reality. Our guys are young too.
Bobby Bowden,"I'm pretty hot right now, because that was a pretty frustrating offensive performance,"
Bobby Bowden,There is a lot of learning that has to be done.
Bobby Bowden,"He died right after he retired, and seeing that made me feel more conscious of a man needing a motive to live. If I ever got out of coaching, I would have to get a job somewhere, or I'm afraid I'd wilt on the vine, too."
Bobby Bowden,"Last time you're playing at home (this season), I thought we'd go out there and jump all over them. We're just not a dominating team right now."
Bobby Bowden,The corners. That was the biggest question mark. There is no position in football more vital than corners. They determine how much blitzing you do.
Bobby Bowden,I don't consider that him . That was a reaction to the disease.
Bobby Bowden,"The thing that's very important is the direction you're going. I think we're heading forward. It was hard to tell who the best team was, but they were a much more mature football team than we were."
Bobby Bowden,"I think he can be a coach, if that's his desire to do it. When he was here, he gained a lot of respect among his teammates just by the way he played. He played a level ahead of most people, so I think he can bring that into coaching."
Bobby Bowden,"He's got tools. He's fast, tall, rangy, great desire, great human being."
Bobby Bowden,He's got a year under his belt and 12 games under his belt and that makes a big difference. Experience is so valuable when it comes to making good decisions.
Bobby Bowden,"Jeffrey catches all the criticism. But he doesn't do anything I don't tell him to do. I have to know everything he's doing. I have to know what plays he's calling and working on. So it's as much my fault as anybody's. But nobody is going to believe it, because it's your kid."
Bobby Bowden,I've always said it takes more courage to stand back there and throw a ball knowing you're fixing to get drilled than anything I can think of in football.
Bobby Bowden,"Well, (Ann) brought a tree and bought Christmas packages for the whole world, and what she didn't buy, she charged. I'm the only one to lose money at a bowl."
Bobby Bowden,"There are changes. Just like all times, there are good boys and some who are mischievous."
Bobby Bowden,"I want my boys to be saved,"
Bobby Bowden,"To have the kind of year you want to have, something has to happen that you can't explain why it happened. Something has to happen that you can't coach."
Bobby Bowden,"If somebody mistreats you, treat 'em good. That kills 'em."
Bobby Bowden,"He doesn't know the meaning of the word fear, but then again he doesn't know the meaning of most words."
Bobby Bowden,Don't go to the grave with life unused.
Bobby Bowden,"A better ending could not have been scripted. Of course, if we had won, that would have been better."
Bobby Bowden,I guess I'll retire someday if I live that long.
Bobby Bowden,He who gets the best players usually wins.
Bobby Bowden,"We have both reached the age where when things go bad, the first thing is you're too old, you're over the hill. I think Penn State did a smart thing staying with him."
Bobby Bowden,"He has the ability to play in the NFL. If there are extenuating circumstances, I support a decision to enter the draft, but you can make more money by staying an extra year."
Bobby Bowden,Antonio is an outstanding athlete and there is no doubt that he has the ability to play in the NFL.
Jim Bowden,"He takes the ball every day, he never complains and he gets the job done. He has nasty stuff. He warms up quick to get in a game."
Jim Bowden,"I believe that Dana Brown is one of the best young amateur talent evaluators, especially when it comes to pitching, in Major League Baseball,"
Jim Bowden,"He's out there, he's doing what the manager is directing. He's making a personal sacrifice for the organization."
Jim Bowden,"Brian continues to be one of the best defensive catchers in the game, shutting the running game down. Offensively, his on-base percentage and slugging percentage continue to improve every single year. His strikeouts continue to be reduced every year."
Jim Bowden,"I think we've made some progress in development, ... But overall, we've got a long way to go. I felt very strongly that we needed to make a change at the top in that department."
Jim Bowden,"Jamey was not going to make this team. And because of how strong our personal feelings were toward Jamey, we felt we owed it to him to make this move prior to the start of camp."
Jim Bowden,The doctors gave us the go-ahead to sign the player. They understood that it was a four-year deal with significant money. We wanted clearance and to make sure there wasn't a health risk. I would not have done the deal if the doctors didn't clear it.
Jim Bowden,"When these players lose it, they can't control it. It's a physical thing, not a mental thing. He's got the eye of the tiger. When I met with (Sosa), that's the one thing I was convinced of. His brain would do everything it could to succeed because he'd like to prove to people that he can still play."
Jim Bowden,"We have compassion for his position on where he's coming from, but we have a job to try to win baseball games with the team we have. We're not going to give the player away."
Jim Bowden,"[Pitching coach] Randy St. Claire and I both think that we would like to start him off in Potomac, have a little success and then we'll move him. Based on the surgery that he had, we are going to bring him along slowly. If he plays well, then we'll move him as soon as his pitching says we should move him."
Jim Bowden,"I'm a big believer in makeup and character and leadership, and Brian's a special person as well as a special player."
Jim Bowden,"I couldn't be more pleased to add one of the best young pitching minds in baseball to our coaching staff. John's high energy, passion, temperament and knowledge will provide invaluable resources for all of our pitchers."
Jim Bowden,There's just a difference of opinion. There's kind of an agreement to disagree on where he falls.
Jim Bowden,"Everybody has challenges, everybody has obstacles, everybody has adversity, ... What's unique about this situation is that there are so many positive things ahead of this franchise."
Jim Bowden,"He looks good, totally different guy -- different mechanics, different arm action. I didn't recognize him."
Jim Bowden,It's a very sensitive issue with Alfonso. We respect him and we respect his ability as a baseball player. The position change and what's important to the team is something we'll continue to address appropriately. We don't want it to become a soap opera.
Tommy Bowden,"This is again a very challenging schedule. We will face seven teams that won at least seven games last year, including two of the top teams in the ACC, within our first three games â€” both on the road. Plus, we have to go to Virginia Tech."
Tommy Bowden,"He's a tough guy. He's a mean guy. Whether those are appropriate words to say, I don't know. But again, that's how the game's played, and there's a level we need to play with defensively we haven't reached yet in those aspects."
Tommy Bowden,"I think I messed Charlie up last year, and he's too good of a person, too good of a talent not to be more productive than he was last year. I take sole responsibility for him not being productive."
Tommy Bowden,"That's the one thing you sacrifice when you go with more of a game-type format. But, it's more fan-friendly and the players like it more. If I have the numbers, I'll probably keep doing this, but you've got to have the numbers."
Tommy Bowden,We are having a hard time running the ball on offense so that's where it starts is up front defensively.
Tommy Bowden,We've six guys battling for two spots. We're in the best position to find two quality guys since I've been here.
Tommy Bowden,"From an evaluation purpose, you don't get that much done."
Tommy Bowden,But it can be a negative if you run into injury problems.
Tommy Bowden,"He looked good, but he's looked good for a while in practice and everything. I don't think his problem is going to be inconsistency in practice. He's always practiced good as far as work ethic and workout habits."
Tommy Bowden,"The determining factor's going to be amount of practice time, ... If he practices a lot, I would think his shoulder's not going to be really sore. If it's sore, then he won't practice. That's kind of the way it's been."
Tommy Bowden,They see the potential of this program being realized.
Tommy Bowden,"He's got tremendous potential. His performance has not matched his potential. Potentially, you can see what he's capable of doing. Consistency is his next step. Talent he has."
Tommy Bowden,"All of my comments since he has been here is he has had tremendous potential, and his performance had not matched his potential to this point. But I think, potentially, you can see what he is capable of doing. Now consistency is his next step."
Tommy Bowden,"It's been six, seven years. I think I understand, but I'd like them to have patience, too, as I patiently wait."
Tommy Bowden,Too many mistakes in the red zone by the offense. That's kind of is going back to last year with some of the same problems we had.
Tommy Bowden,I was disappointed in some mistakes we made in the red-zone and that is an area we are continuing to work on this spring.
Tommy Bowden,He's got a background here in the state. He brings a lot of instate knowledge and this is an awful important state from a recruiting standpoint.
Tommy Bowden,I wouldn't be too worried because he has done too many good things and showed so much improvement to be concerned about what happened today with split teams.
Tommy Bowden,I wouldn't be too worried. He's done too many good things and has shown too much improvement to be worried about half a day with split teams.
Tommy Bowden,"It was a time where you worry about having your team buckle, but giving it to James made it easy."
Tommy Bowden,He is a pretty good kicker. We are giving him some heavy work right now. He is kicking just as good if not better.
Tommy Bowden,It was one of those drives where you want to milk the clock as much as you could and giving the ball to James makes it pretty easy.
Tommy Bowden,"The rule is made to create equality and it's great equality if you have an airport in town. If you get bad weather, commercial flights can get in while private planes can't fly, so the advantage was already there for larger cities that get commercial flights. It's definitely a disadvantage."
Tommy Bowden,"We get paid well to hurt. She doesn't, ... It's a completely different environment. It's not nearly as much fun as it used to be."
Tommy Bowden,"He's had a very good spring. He's stayed healthy. He's hungry to learn the position. His enthusiasm is good. He's been a really good leader, and that's something the jury was kind of out on ? his ability to lead a team."
Tommy Bowden,"He has looked really, really good. He has good enthusiasm."
Tommy Bowden,I think we broke a record for concession sales â€” buying more drinks and popcorn and hot dogs. It's great for those people. We make more money.
Tommy Bowden,I couldn't help but think he would get better in that aspect. He shows the desire and has the skills to help us out next year.
Tommy Bowden,"Dad is 76. He takes naps during the game, so he might miss something."
Tommy Bowden,"The job description of this profession is criticism, ... Jeff was well aware when he went into it. That's why my son's in law, and not going into the profession."
Tommy Bowden,You're trying to get a comfort zone with the parents. You want the family to feel comfortable with me in charge of their son.
Tommy Bowden,"I've been here seven years and he's been my quarterback for four. He's sitting up here with a college degree. ... what a great ambassador for college football. His leadership skills and how he responded after a disappointing year last year, which was my fault. The way he handled it to the media might have put a couple more years on my contract."
Tommy Bowden,"You see blood hurting, husband or son, ... Somebody's hurting Sunday, which reflects back on her. We get paid well to hurt. She doesn't."
Tommy Bowden,"Sure, there is some pressure. But I don't know â€” at that age, first time being around â€” if the pressure is as great as the homesick. I think the homesick would be the number one issue."
Tommy Bowden,"It takes a very mature young man (to do what he did). He's made good decisions for his age, choices guys his age don't usually make. He's a very humble person and he's been taught well by his mother about how to receive praise."
Tommy Bowden,"I've seen him be successful throwing the football his sophomore year, I've seen that. I've seen him react through adversity, I have seen that. I'd never seen him react to a new system because we didn't have one. I'd say that'd be the most impressive thing."
Bruce Bowen,"They have a wonderful economic-development program here, and they actually recruit gun businesses."
Bruce Bowen,"I can't allow that to take my edge off. Whoever is going to play his spot, I have to look at them as I do him."
Bruce Bowen,"They've made a sacrifice for us, to protect us and our families. I think more than anything else there's a profound appreciation for them."
Bruce Bowen,"We had more people distributing the ball in the second half and I was the beneficiary of some of those passes. When we do that, somebody is going to hit the wide-open shot."
Bruce Bowen,"We had opportunities, ... We just made a couple mental mistakes down the stretch? That?s what bothers us the most."
Bruce Bowen,"I think so. Not to disrespect them (Magic), but it's not like you're going up against Phoenix right now. You expect their numbers to be up a little bit, but they scored 54 points in the first half. I don't care how you look at it, that's not defense to our standards."
Bruce Bowen,I took him home in two tin cans. He was buried in Nebraska.
Bruce Bowen,"We thought about the way we played them last time at home, because when you get smacked at home, you don't like that. You go back to the drawing board and figure out what you can do to turn it around."
Bruce Bowen,"It's not a matter of we were playing a game, and then we had to stop the game, ... It was just coming into warming up, so we can always get warmed up."
Bruce Bowen,We did a better job in the second half of the game tonight.
Bruce Bowen,Watching the players in their environment was impressive. They were all great guys. I was like a kid in a candy store.
Bruce Bowen,We should pay you the wholesale rate for ... your electricity.
Bruce Bowen,"[Even when he failed to make the play successfully, Duncan was actively involved. He determined where Detroit's defense went, certainly helped lure Detroit's big men into big foul trouble. And when the Spurs saw Duncan being Duncan instead of some reluctant all-star, they were transformed back into champions themselves from a bunch of guys who'd lost three of four games in the Finals and were reeling. What did they do differently to get him jump-started?] We said, 'Here Mr. Two-time Finals MVP . . . Here's the ball, ... That's all it took. That's not a major adjustment. 'Hey Tim, here.'"
Bruce Bowen,"We players understand we have the best lives in the world. We owe a debt of gratitude to all our fans, everyone who supports us."
David Bowie,I wanted to create an environment where not just my fans but all music lovers could be a part of the same community.
David Bowie,You can neither win nor lose if you don't run the race.
David Bowie,"When you think about it, Adolf Hitler was the first pop star."
David Bowie,Pixies and Sonic Youth were so important to the eighties.
David Bowie,Nearly all the synth work on Heathen is mine and some of the piano.
David Bowie,I've never responded well to entrenched negative thinking.
David Bowie,I'm just an individual who doesn't feel that I need to have somebody qualify my work in any particular way. I'm working for me.
David Bowie,I'm always amazed that peole take what I say seriously. I don't even take what I am seriously.
David Bowie,"I went through all the musicians in my life who I admire as bright, intelligent, virtuosic players."
David Bowie,I wanted to prove the sustaining power of music.
David Bowie,"I think it all comes back to being very selfish as an artist. I mean, I really do just write and record what interests me and I do approach the stage shows in much the same way."
David Bowie,"I never could get over the fact that The Pixies formed, worked and separated without America taking them to its heart or even recognizing their existence for the most part."
David Bowie,"I had to resign myself, many years ago, that I'm not too articulate when it comes to explaining how I feel about things. But my music does it for me, it really does."
David Bowie,I felt I really wanted to back off from music completely and just work within the visual arts in some way. I started painting quite passionately at that time.
David Bowie,But I've got to think of myself as the luckiest guy. Robert Johnson only had one album's worth of work as his legacy. That's all that life allowed him.
David Bowie,"And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought, I'm going to learn the saxophone. When I grow up, I'm going to play in his band. So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan."
David Bowie,"I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't be boring."
David Bowie,I'm an instant star. Just add water and stir.
David Bowie,I always had a repulsive need to be something more than human.
David Bowie,"When I heard Little Richard, I mean, it just set my world on fire."
David Bowie,What is very enlightening for me right now is that I sense that I'm arriving at a place of peace with my writing that I've never experienced before.
David Bowie,Tony Visconti and I had been wanting to work together again for a few years now. Both of us had fairly large commitments and for a long time we couldn't see a space in which we could get anything together.
David Bowie,"To not be modest about it, you'll find that with only a couple of exceptions, most of the musicians that I've worked with have done their best work by far with me."
David Bowie,The truth is of course is that there is no journey. We are arriving and departing all at the same time.
David Bowie,Sometimes you stumble across a few chords that put you in a reflective place.
David Bowie,It amazes me sometimes that even intelligent people will analyze a situation or make a judgement after only recognizing the standard or traditional structure of a piece.
David Bowie,I believe that I often bring out the best in somebody's talents.
David Bowie,"However, there's no theme or concept behind Heathen, just a number of songs but somehow there is a thread that runs through it that is quite as strong as any of my thematic type albums."
David Bowie,Heathenism is a state of mind. You can take it that I'm referring to one who does not see his world. He has no mental light. He destroys almost unwittingly. He cannot feel any Gods presence in his life. He is the 21st century man.
David Bowie,"Frankly, I mean, sometimes the interpretations I've seen on some of the songs that I've written are a lot more interesting than the input that I put in."
David Bowie,But I'm pretty good with collaborative thinking. I work well with other people.
David Bowie,"I'm not a prophet or a stone aged man, just a mortal with potential of a superman. I'm living on."
Pat Bowlen,"Come on, We have huge television contracts."
Pat Bowlen,"It's been written about here, on the national level, talked about on ESPN and all the rest of it. It's taken on a life of it's own. I'm not saying we're not interested in T.O., but I think the level of interest attributed to us is way beyond where we are."
Pat Bowlen,I'm holding my breath here. I think we've just got to take our time and make sure everybody's opinions are heard so you don't get into a contentious situation.
Pat Bowlen,"I don't put any significant amount on one or the other. We've got everything done, labor, television; Paul, obviously, he feels he's taken it as far as he can. So let's let the process go forward and hear what everybody has to say, but I do think it is one job with a strong support system around it."
Pat Bowlen,"I'm not for splitting the job up. I think the commissioner should be the commissioner, but I think he's got to have some very strong people around him."
Pat Bowlen,The job Paul has done in his years as commissioner is unprecedented.
Pat Bowlen,To go out and win this game would be a great step in the right direction for this whole organization.
Matt Bowling,We were trying to go aggressively to the basket and I felt like we were doing that. But we just couldn't get to the foul line. We were being aggressive but we weren't shooting any free throws.
Matt Bowling,His numbers speak for themselves. He took a big step from last year and we hope he takes another big step next season.
Matt Bowling,I think it's going to be a lot of fun because it's a wide open race. We're excited to get started and see how it all works out.
Matt Bowling,"That's our composure right there. We never hit the panic button. We never showed it with our body language or our demeanor that we were struggling for a bit. We've been in a lot of close ballgames this year, and we knew that we were capable of pulling out a win in the end."
Matt Bowling,"We felt pretty comfortable despite the tempo. That's the beauty of our team. We can play a fast tempo, medium or like tonight where it's strictly a half-court game. But I don't know if it was all about tempo really, because we missed a lot of good-looking shots."
Clint Bowyer,You see those guys give and take with each other. Then they look in the mirror and somehow they know it's us back there and they're attitude changes quite a bit.
Clint Bowyer,"It will be hard, but it's not impossible,"
Clint Bowyer,"It's tough, Kevin's a determined individual and he liked being 'The Man,'  ... But the thing I have working for me is I am the closest in age to him as any teammate he's ever had and we are good friends. I think the key will be for us to just keep trying to help each other."
Clint Bowyer,"It's tough, Kevin's a determined individual and he liked being The Man, ... But the thing I have working for me is I am the closest in age to him as any teammate he's ever had and we are good friends. I think the key will be for us to just keep trying to help each other."
Clint Bowyer,"Consistency is still going to play out in the end. Dover is a tough race track. It's my second time being here. We didn't fare too well in the spring, but we've reacted pretty good. We've bounced back, and I think the car's pretty good this weekend."
Clint Bowyer,"It's the strongest rookie field the series has ever had. It's a heck of a class. The neatest thing is most of us were in the Busch series last year, so we all know each other."
Barbara Boxer,"I question the wisdom of putting someone in that position who I believe has shown zealotry on the issue of reproductive health, including family planning, ... What it says to me is that there's this focus on anti-choice that I'm afraid is going to be a diversion."
Barbara Boxer,"But it's hard to believe that Californians are going to go into a voting booth and say, 'I'm going to vote for Matt Fong because I am mad at Bill Clinton."
Barbara Boxer,We didn't learn our lesson after the '93 World Trade Center bombing; we didn't learn our lesson after Sept. 11. We don't need anymore failures.
Barbara Boxer,"I think everybody remembers when Dr. Rice went on television and talked about the mushroom cloud that we could get, courtesy of Saddam Hussein,"
Barbara Boxer,"You can count on Social Security, and with every fiber of my being, I will make sure it is there not only for my generation, but for my children's generation and for my grandchild's generation."
Barbara Boxer,Your sacrifice appears to be nothing.
Barbara Boxer,"Clearly, he was wrong to have that relationship in the first place, ... right to take full responsibility."
Barbara Boxer,"Ellen is like me in the sense of her passion for the issues, ... But this is a woman who goes into the Senate kicking and screaming, she really doesn't want to do this at all."
Barbara Boxer,"I don't think they would attack a man this way, ... They're demeaning what she has achieved in her life. It's an over-the-top attack that I don't believe you'd see on a man or a married woman."
Barbara Boxer,"Really, life is complicated enough without having a bunch of Senators deciding what we should do in the privacy of our own homes."
Barbara Boxer,"What's important to me is that justice be done, ... and that people who are alleging that they were abused in anyway, you know, have a process, and that whatever that process is and the results of it is, has to be accepted. That's the way we operate in this country."
Barbara Boxer,We have fought for social justice. We have fought for economic justice. We have fought for environmental justice. We have fought for criminal justice. Now we must add a new fight - the fight for electoral justice.
Barbara Boxer,People are concerned about fairness and justice at a time of sacrifice. ... Your sacrifice appears to be nothing.
Barbara Boxer,"Let's not rewrite history, it's too soon for that,"
Barbara Boxer,"Now, in an unbelievable rewriting of history, you talk about this bolder mission we undertook in response to 9/11 to transform the Middle East with Iraq as an anchor,"
Barbara Boxer,"I would tell her to do everything she could to spare other families this grief, to get us off this cycle of violence."
Barbara Boxer,"When service members are discharged, we should express our gratitude for their profound personal sacrifice, not hand them a bill for their hospital food."
Barbara Boxer,This bill will finally provide the permanent protection against future drilling that Californians have demanded for a generation.
Barbara Boxer,I would not run for president. I really like what I'm doing now. People say I'm giving them energy and hope.
Barbara Boxer,Law enforcement officers are never 'off duty.' They are dedicated public servants who are sworn to protect public safety at any time and place that the peace is threatened. They need all the help that they can get.
Barbara Boxer,"We have the greatest hospitals, doctors, and medical technology in the world - we need to make them accessible to every American."
Barbara Boxer,"The American people need to know the truth. The American people need to see the truth. In a democracy, letting the people know the truth is the essence of what it means to be free."
Barbara Boxer,"While we have men and women dying to bring democracy abroad, we've got to make it the best it can be here at home, and that's why I'm doing this."
Barbara Boxer,"On the other side of this debate they are very good at getting votes. And they are very good at being politicians, but I don't think they are worth a wit in the gynecological operating room! I don't want them in that operating room, telling a doctor what procedure to use for my daughter, or my niece."
Barbara Boxer,"If we turn our back on the people of this country who need to work for a living, we shouldn't be here, to be honest, because that has to be an essential part of what we do to protect the country, from the standpoint of defense, protect workers and make sure they have jobs."
Barbara Boxer,"When the people take a look at this plan and they see that the people in our country -- the elite few who earn over a million dollars get back a hundred thousand a year, and the average family gets back a few hundred dollars a year -- they'll realize that this plan isn't fair,"
Barbara Boxer,"You don't unite this country when you pick someone for your Cabinet who is so far out of the mainstream that it really divides the country,"
Barbara Boxer,"Our country is sick at heart at the spin and false expectations. They want the truth, and they deserve it."
Barbara Boxer,The White House has embarked on a mission to convince the people of our country that Social Security is in dire need of drastic change in order to save it for all workers.
Barbara Boxer,"When you take a stand out of deep conviction, people know. They may not even agree, but they ask, 'Do I want someone who is willing to take a hard stand and someone I can trust to do that when the chips are down?' They want that."
Barbara Boxer,"To my constituents, today's hearing is about shared sacrifices in tough times versus oil company greed, ... Working people struggle with high gas prices and your sacrifices appear to be nothing."
Barbara Boxer,"Medical professionals, not insurance company bureaucrats, should be making health care decisions."
Barbara Boxer,"I'll tell you who mentioned it constantly, my opponents and the press. Constantly, ... But I've held community meetings. I opened up the floor, there's 300, 400 people. They could ask me whatever they want. Never, ever once [do people ask]."
Barbara Boxer,"I am pro-choice and he says Roe vs. Wade is wrong. I oppose new offshore oil drilling; he doesn't. He would build 'Star Wars' and take the money out of the Social Security surplus,"
Barbara Boxer,"These measures are all about a power grab by Gov. Schwarzenegger that hurts our children, our schools and our teachers."
Barbara Boxer,"A proposed rule on human pesticide testing that fails to protect children and families should be shelved immediately. A protective rule must be issued in its place,"
Barbara Boxer,"What George Bush did is he picked his tax cut and then sort of built a budget around it, ... Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer."
Barbara Boxer,"My publisher couldn't believe the timing,"
Barbara Boxer,"They will experience some increased anxiety ... going to school. They will be more frightened than they might normally be, and it's up to the parents to ask the children what they are feeling."
Barbara Boxer,"I think Mr. Bolton needs anger management at a minimum, and he does not deserve to be promoted,"
Barbara Boxer,"If you can't repeal her right to choose, take away her ability to pay for what is legal,"

Brandon Boyd,I have an open door policy when it comes to blame
Brandon Boyd,Big Brother is watching... look busy.
Brandon Boyd,I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal.
Brandon Boyd,Music has to be written while people are still excited about a particular melodic or rhythmic sequence. The idea doesn't come out the same if we're not really excited about it.
Brandon Boyd,I have always idolized eccentric people.
Brandon Boyd,"Music has always been my back door to life. It is important for people to find something that excites them. I like the concept that if you do what excites you, you will be rewarded generously, whatever form reward takes, which is not necessarily money."
Brandon Boyd,"I'll make music, whether or not anyone is listening, for the rest of my life. It's a natural form of expression for me, the same way I draw and write and sing."
Brandon Boyd,I think I grew a grey watching you procrastinate.
Brandon Boyd,"It's great to want to be part of something, but it's a different thing completely to believe wholly in some type of movement, and to give everything for that something."
Brandon Boyd,"We are very fortunate to live in this country, but at the same time, the reason the forces are so much more destructive here is because they are faceless."
Brandon Boyd,"I am tapping into a place in you that is unexplored, and very dangerous, but I think essential to the creative life of an artist."
David Boyd,"Make eye contact, smile, shake firmly with [the palm of] your hand perpendicular to the floor, pump twice."
David Boyd,It will take more than a state law to serve as a statewide plan. They'd want to see something detailed.
David Boyd,"Thankfully, law enforcement thwarted their successful efforts at theft,"
David Boyd,"Remember, ... the gentleman always leads."
Jim Boyd,They were playing Cover-2 and the corner was up a little bit tight and the safety never came over. It was an excellent throw and Caleb takes it in for a touchdown. Now we're down one touchdown and we're feeling pretty good about ourselves.
Jim Boyd,"I knew it had been awhile, but I didn't realize it was that long. Our philosophy is a little different. We don't start with an easy schedule. We try and get teams that will really challenge us and really prepare us well for district play. You do that and you're going to take your lumps, but you're going to be better. You just don't progress unless you play the best."
Jim Boyd,"Standard residential land has been going for over $150,000 per acre for a while."
Jim Boyd,The dogs shed a lot of blood in these things.
John Boyd,"It would be great to beat (Plainview), but we're just trying to get better before our next district game on Jan. 3. If a win comes with that, that would be great, but we're definitely going to have to shoot better or it could be a real long day."
John Boyd,"If a parent says, 'You got problems here,' well, what problems? We have to have evidence. We have to have good enough reason to take action."
John Boyd,"The sellers in the auction have the power rather than the buyer. They set the date for the auction and the closing, they set the price and the property is sold as-is. The owner is the power-broker in the sale."
John Boyd,"Premature birth affects us all. I am proud to be asking people to join me in walking for someone they love, because when we walk for one baby, we are walking to save all babies."
Todd Boyd,"In order to really move a shoe, you need to get to the finals on a regular basis, or you need to be a pop culture icon, like Allen Iverson."
Todd Boyd,The new-school hip-hop generation exists with a mandate to 'keep it real'; this has to do with embracing a hard-nosed truth about the world and letting the chips fall where they may.
Todd Boyd,"I think the O.J. Simpson case is the ultimate reality TV show. I think it really changed the way we think and talk about race and celebrity; the way trials work now. Whenever there's a big case now, you can guarantee that it's going to be on television somewhere because of O.J."
Todd Boyd,A lot of it is luck. You need to play the right role at the right time.
Todd Boyd,Frankly I love the word 'nigga.' It is my favorite word in the English language because no other word incites more controversy today.
Todd Boyd,"particular culture and, until that culture is changed, you're not going to see any drastic changes in overall representation."
Todd Boyd,"What's funny is a lot of conversation these days is about Hollywood and the effects of popular culture, but I never hear anyone mention that there are images from Iraq on television every day, ... I mean, it is violent. And yet it is almost like it is not on television. People are just real selective about what they choose to point fingers at."
Todd Boyd,He's a good athlete with game-changing ability. Sometimes we use him as a decoy. He also plays both ways all the time and has one interception for a 100-yard touchdown (in a 48-20 victory over Briggs on Sept. 2).

Earl Boykins,He's a good friend of mine. I look forward to him being on our team. . . . I can't worry about what another man does off the court.
Earl Boykins,"Tonight we showed that you don't have to shoot great to still get the victory. As long as you do all the other things on the court, you can be OK."
Earl Boykins,"I knew I was going to have the soreness. I knew that I was going to have a little pain. I don't think it hindered me doing the things that I want to do. . . . I think my shot was off. It was evident. But my speed, my quickness and my ball-handling were there. So the shot will come."
Earl Boykins,He's done an unbelievable job at Air Force. He was a good coach when we had him. Some unfortunate things happened and it didn't work out. It wasn't because of his coaching ability.
Mary Boyle,A lot of what was going on was already against the rules. There just wasn't any enforcement.
Mary Boyle,It was about rules that were broken and there was no enforcement for breaking them whatsoever.
Mary Boyle,"The bottom line is that the system is broken and people are pushing against it looking for every single loophole. If you address the heart of the problem with public financing, you wouldn't have this constant end-run around the rules."
Mary Boyle,We think the heart of the problem is there's no enforcement. There's no one watching to see is anyone getting gifts or not.
Mary Boyle,Voinovich is a good-government guy. He is an ally with us on a number of issues.
Mary Boyle,Basically we think it's a pathetic piece of legislation. This does nothing to curb the 'anything goes' culture in Washington.
Mary Boyle,"We will miss him. He brought energy, creativity and vision to our board for the last eight years, as well as a sense of humor."
Mary Boyle,"We are really disappointed. For Congress to produce any kind of credible reform, they need an enforcement mechanism."
Mary Boyle,We don't want members of Congress to just sit behind their desks all the time.
Mary Boyle,We don't want members of Congress sitting behind their desk all day long.
Mary Boyle,Part of what the K Street Project was about was making lobbyists indispensable to Congress because of the money they were raising.
Mary Boyle,"The states are way out ahead of Congress on this. This is not some kind of crazed, untested idea. This is going on in the states. ... It's bringing accountability to state government and that's what we need here."
Mary Boyle,Congress has kind of proven it's not capable of policing itself.
Mary Boyle,"While lobbyists are not allowed to pay for a trip, the parent company can. Which is confusing, because the lobbyist can come along."
Mary Boyle,This gives them an incredible advantage over their challengers.
Peter Brabeck,"It's nothing. It's a storm in a teacup, ... There is no risk to safety."
Peter Brabeck,"Nestle has achieved record levels of growth and profits, ... We are now harvesting the results of our relentless push for continuous improvement."
Peter Brabeck,"No doubt one of the most pressing problems, and one that is significantly underestimated these days, is the unsustainable growth of freshwater withdrawal."
Vic Braden,Learn to think like a winner. Think positive and visualize your strengths.
Vic Braden,Losers have tons of variety. Champions just take pride in learning to hit the same old boring winning shots.
Vic Braden,The moment of enlightenment is when a person's dreams of possibilities become images of probabilities.
Bill Bradley,"Look, I don't think it's negative campaigning when you tell the truth about somebody's record."
Bill Bradley,There's something about Al Gore I don't trust. I don't quite know what it is.
Bill Bradley,"I was stunned by the verdict. It shows that racial profiling seeps so deeply in our society that a wallet in the hand of a white man looks like a wallet, and the wallet in the hand of a black man looks like a gun."
Bill Bradley,"You should rest assured. You are going to get Social Security benefits as long as you are alive,"
Bill Bradley,"If you want to get into people's living rooms, you have to get into their living rooms, ... Your come-from-behind underdog speech brings tears to my eyes."
Bill Bradley,"Imagination allows us to escape the predictable. It enables us to reply to the common wisdom that we cannot soar by saying, Just watch!"
Bill Bradley,"[Accusing Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush of hypocrisy, Bradley said both men have said they support changing the soft money system.] However, ... both reportedly have directed their top fund-raisers to begin raising soft money to the general election."
Bill Bradley,"Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny, but I say, in a world of new possibilities guided by goodness, we can and we will,"
Bill Bradley,"We are not going to turn our eyes away from what is happening in Grozny tonight,"
Bill Bradley,"I exercise regularly on the Stairmaster,"
Bill Bradley,"There is a lot of enthusiasm out there for the candidacy,"
Bill Bradley,"This energy is going to carry us all the way, ... Whoever would have thought we'd be met by this kind of crowd in the middle of the night?"
Bill Bradley,We are well below our debt limit.
Bill Bradley,"I've brought copies of these votes for members of the panel of journalists participating in the debate,"
Bill Bradley,I fully support the American and NATO troops who are now in danger overseas.
Bill Bradley,I hope that all leaders in this country will be innovative in trying to find ways to reach out to people to challenge their best instincts as opposed to playing to their worst instincts.
Bill Bradley,"That (strategy) was not in conflict with the way I have run my campaign, ... It shows respect for the voters, to point out that something is untrue."
Bill Bradley,serious questions about our policy. We are escalating our commitment without establishing a clear exit strategy.
Bill Bradley,"However, I have serious questions about our policy. We are escalating our commitment without establishing a clear exit strategy. As with Bosnia, we run the risk of becoming bogged down in a quagmire whose end we cannot predict or control,"
Bill Bradley,"There are issues such as what are we going to do with this enormous (budget) surplus that we have. I think Al Gore clearly has the vision of what to do with that. It's a much better vision than that of George W. Bush,"
Bill Bradley,"The most important thing we can do is use our authority to petition to get access to markets, ... The problem with agriculture in America is serious. In Iowa, it's dead serious."
Bill Bradley,"We have to repair that trust ... I think anytime a public official lies, he undermines his own authority and squanders the public trust."
Bill Bradley,"You are an integral part of America,"
Bill Bradley,"Every time I have some moment on a seashore, or in the mountains, or sometimes in a quiet forest, I think this is why the environment has to be preserved."
Bob Bradley,That actually works well but we'll try to keep the rest the same. They had Sunday and Monday off and now we'll work hard through this week. Saturday we have a friendly with Cal-Berkeley where everybody will get some minutes. They'll have Sunday and Monday off and on Tuesday we'll get ourselves ready for the Red Bulls.
Bob Bradley,We're a different team. We are making progress. That doesn't mean it's always going to happen all at once. The game can be cruel sometimes. I still remind the players that that's true on all levels. I mentioned Bayern Munich-Manchester United to them today because that is one of the most obvious examples.
Bob Bradley,It's very important to work hard during this time to build a very good roster from top to bottom. We have a big group of players in. There are some that we will quickly let go and we will bring others in and try to use this time to look at different possibilities for how to improve our roster.
Bob Bradley,"I think you have to make it a two-way game that puts them under pressure and highlights some of the areas where they are not as strong. Give them credit. They've had a good season. They're a balanced team and work hard. They've got a bunch of players that have been together, know each other and seem to have fun playing together."
Bob Bradley,"He's still working his way back into full fitness and it's a wet field, so it didn't feel like it made sense to use him. We'll gauge where he is and hopefully we can keep moving along."
Bob Bradley,"I think Ryan has experience, he's a good competitor. The question is can his experience and competitiveness help us as we go down the stretch? That's the reason why we picked him up."
Bob Bradley,In the back I hope that the addition of Claudio Suarez will help because I feel that his experience will go a long way in terms of organization.
Bob Bradley,Our people's standard of living has gone way up. People have been able to buy washers and dryers and cars. They've put new roofs on their homes. We've been able to buy more Christmas gifts than ever before.
Bob Bradley,"I think (Wynne as first pick) is the general consensus -- most people would say he's the likely No. 1, and he's earned that. He's obviously a special kind of athlete. And when you talk about somebody who can adjust and play right away, his athletic qualities allow him to do that."
Bob Bradley,"Landon has the ability to drift wide if he thinks things are tight in the middle. It's just important that as a team we can keep track of him and whoever is called on is ready to deal with him, especially his speed. His timing, his running into the attack is something that works real well for him."
David Bradley,UH-Downtown has a very severe space deficit at this time.
David Bradley,"Rollover risk has been known for a long time, and it hasn't hurt S/UV sales. Everyone always assumes that an accident will happen to someone else and not to them."
David Bradley,"Rollover risk has been known for a long time, and it hasn't hurt S/UV sales, ... Everyone always assumes that an accident will happen to someone else and not to them."
David Bradley,"To me, it's now our turn. It's time now to build something we can all be proud of health care facility wise, and it will serve us another 30 or 40 years."
David Bradley,We're just trying to replicate excellence.
David Bradley,"To me, it looks like an opportunity for school choice. I'd also like to see a pilot program to allow true school choice ? vouchers."
David Bradley,"He's an obvious choice. He's head of marketing and customer interface, he's the most senior ranking American executive with a relatively high profile with the press."
David Bradley,"We have traditional college-age students in the day, and at night a different crowd comes in."
John Bradley,"It would be nice to have a personal stockpile, but I believe that the disadvantage for society is so much greater than my own personal interest in staying well,"
John Bradley,We wanted to break our school record. We definitely think we could get it at nationals.
John Bradley,"It was kind of boring for me because I was all alone out front, but it was a good race. I did my best time for the year, so I am happy with that. There are still three people who could possibly beat me, so we will just have to wait and see."
Marion Bradley,A babe at the breast is as much pleasure as the bearing is pain
Marion Bradley,"[T]he House of Maidens was for little girls whose whole duty in life was to spill things, break things, and forget things . . . until they had spilled, broken, and forgotten everything they could, and thus made room in their lives for a little wisdom."
Marion Bradley,Some knowledge and some song and some beauty must be kept for those days before the world again plunges into darkness.

Michael Bradley,"It's mandatory evacuation, but it's mandatory without the force, ... If they make it mandatory mandatory, we'll be back by."
Michael Bradley,"It is long overdue to have adequate representation, and second, it's being done in a bipartisan fashion."
Michael Bradley,We all believe it's important to have well-educated children. Those are the areas we want to focus on.
Milton Bradley,We got along as well as we could. It didn't work for me.
Milton Bradley,I didn't think about it. I was just trying not to embarrass myself out there.
Milton Bradley,"I'm just being too picky at what I swing at. I'm not being my normal aggressive self. The bottom line is (the umpires) aren't going to change, so I've got to change."
Milton Bradley,"He'd run so close so many times this season, it wasn't like he was running badly. He's been very unlucky, and sometimes would have needed 10 more strides to collar the leader, or in the case of the Nunthorpe, probably two."
Milton Bradley,"Any problems reported have been exaggerated, but nonetheless, my wife and I have resolved all issues. The incidents reported will remain private and personal."
Milton Bradley,"I want people to say Milton Bradley was a pretty good ballplayer and a pretty good person. Anybody who is going to stand between me getting there, then they need to be eliminated."
Milton Bradley,"He hasn't had enough at-bats the past two years to be sharp right away. But when you're that good for that long, people just expect you to be."
Milton Bradley,"I thought it was gone. People told me the ball doesn't carry here at night, but I guess I had to see it for myself. It all worked out in the end. ... It feels good to perform like this. I'm coming in here new and I just want to let my game speak for itself."
Milton Bradley,I haven't seen anybody pitch better all year. It was definitely a special night for him.
Milton Bradley,"The events written about are very regrettable, ... Any problems reported have been exaggerated but nonetheless, my wife and I have resolved all issues. The incidents reported will remain private and personal. At this time, I am choosing to handle this matter and all future matters directly and confidentially with the Dodgers. While I continue to work on my off the field issues, my energy is also directed towards preparing for season-ending knee surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation."

Milton Bradley,white people never want to see race in anything. There's race involved in everything. There's race involved in baseball.
Milton Bradley,"I couldn't be happier. I'm playing major league baseball and having fun. I'm a California guy - it's exciting for me. I wish the Dodgers well, wish their team well."
Milton Bradley,"For some people, all their life is baseball. All they care about is how many hits they get, how many runs they drive in and how many plays they make. They're just looking for a plaque."
Milton Bradley,"Some people, that's all their life is ? is baseball ... how many hits they get, how many runs they drive in, how many plays they make, ... They're working for a plaque. I'm not working for a plaque. I'm working to put food on my table."
Milton Bradley,"I have a life besides baseball. This isn't my life. I play because I can. A lot of people say Milton Bradley is a good person. I'm trying to be a good person. But anybody who stands between me getting there, they need to be eliminated. Something needs to be done. I'm not going to revert to the person I was last year and in the past. I'm starting to get respect because I earned it."
Milton Bradley,Wedge felt my effort wasn't good enough for the Cleveland Indians. But the Dodgers are just fine with my effort and I'm perfectly alright with that.
Milton Bradley,There is nothing like playing for the team you grew up rooting for.
Milton Bradley,I'm getting tired of answering the same questions every day.
Milton Bradley,"But I am delighted to be a Dodger, I grew up a Dodger fan and now my dreams have really come true."
Omar Bradley,I am convinced that the best service a retired general can perform is to turn in his tongue along with his suit and to mothball his opinions.
Omar Bradley,"If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner."

Omar Bradley,"The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Our is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants."

Tom Bradley,Who bravely dares must sometimes risk a fall.
Tom Bradley,Never give up. Keep your thoughts and your mind always on the goal.
Tom Bradley,"Wednesday, we were going really hard against [the offense]. And we couldn't stop him."
Tom Bradley,The only thing that will stop you from fulfilling your dreams is you.
Tom Bradley,Fabian is the only one I saw pitch last season. He pitched well against us in a couple games. Control problems got after him a couple other times. He needs to work on keeping his arm slot consistent.
Ben Bradshaw,Once the legislation is enacted our law will be worthy of our reputation as a nation of animal lovers. This bill is aimed at those few who do not properly fulfil their responsibilities for the animals in their charge.
Ben Bradshaw,"Once this legislation is enacted, our law will be worthy of our reputation as a nation of animal lovers."
Ben Bradshaw,"I'm sure that problems that arose between America and Germany in the election campaign can be rapidly overcome. Tony Blair can play a role there but I think that Gerhard Schroeder wants the same thing,"
Terry Bradshaw,"I can't believe how poised he's been. It's difficult to imagine that this is his second pro season. He made so many passes on the run today in Denver. He completed passes on the run. He had plenty of touch, and when he could, he stepped into his throws and fired some tight passes. Ben is going to be very good for a long time."
Terry Bradshaw,People respect you more if you just play and blow something out than if you take the easier road. That's how we think. You get more respect and people play harder for you. Just play till you blow it. Just play till it goes.
Terry Bradshaw,"It's been tough, but it has been fun. This business has its ups and downs, just like any other one. You get out of it what you put into it."
Terry Bradshaw,"I just like to catch fish, I don't care if it weighs half a pound or 10 pounds. But I can't do a lot of casting. I can work a jig or a worm. But not for long, especially if the big ones are biting. Those big bass will make it hurt after a while."
Terry Bradshaw,"As a player, it says everything about you if you made the Hall of Fame. But, then again, boy... there's something about winning a Super Bowl."
Terry Bradshaw,"After three failed marriages, I know what it's like to be replaced. So that's kind of how Joey Harrington must feel today... A former No. 1 choice looks to me like he's going to be a bust in Detroit."
Terry Bradshaw,I know this golf tournament has my name on it but it's not about me. It's about the Louisiana Tech family. There is nothing greater than being a part of the Bulldog family.
Terry Bradshaw,"You've got to stand up and do your own battles. My daddy taught me that a long time ago, that you fight your own battles. The only way to shut everybody up is to win."
Terry Bradshaw,"When Brian told me he grew up in New Mexico, I told him I thought it is cool that people from other countries play football. He corrected me on my geography and agreed to sit down with me anyway."
Terry Bradshaw,What's the worst thing that can happen to a quarterback? He loses his confidence.
Jim Brady,"Our goal is to consider consolidation of all the different groups that are doing economic development work, possibly under the leadership of one director."
Jim Brady,This is like Murphy's Law personified.
Jim Brady,That's something we're always looking atlooking to find new audiences.
Jim Brady,That's something we're always looking atâ€”looking to find new audiences.
John Brady,"They trust one another and maybe a little more than some other teams because they have known each other since they were in grade school. Maybe that allows them to face whatever, being nervous, to take on whatever comes. They don't let anything bother them."
John Brady,"We didn't think he was playing as well as he was capable. He did get in some early foul trouble, but I don't think he was as mentally sharp as we needed him to be."
John Brady,"We travel one of our academic advisors with our team. We try to stay in tune to what our players need to do on the road and what they're missing in the class, particularly the ones that need some more attention."
John Brady,The outstanding ones are usually gone. You have to start over with freshman and sophomore talent.
John Brady,"They have their own way of communicating, their own language that I'm not privy to and their own way of doing things."
John Brady,I think we kind of quit playing to win and (started) playing not to lose. We had it going. We just didn't finish it off. It's a game we let go.
John Brady,I give him a lot of credit for showing that kind of discipline.
John Brady,He played on sheer determination.
John Brady,"We were going to double team him on ball screens and not let him get a comfort zone of coming off the screen with the ball. We were going to bump him every time he tried to go through the lane. The unique thing about it, you can play good defense, but when you can play good defense aggressively as we did without fouling, I think that's a key."
John Brady,"I think they have a comfort zone in terms of personalities, where they understand each other and there's no friction ever. Sometimes I think they're disagreeing with one another too much and they say, 'Coach, that's OK. We've done this for years.' I have to back off. They have their own little language how they deal with each other."
John Brady,"It's not Christmas, it's New Year's. But maybe we gave them a game."
John Brady,"He plays hard, has a great body and is a scary enough shooter. He's a good defender and competitor. I like the way he plays, by what I've seen in games and on tape. He can certainly lift their team and make them play better. We'll have to pay extra attention to him, on and off the ball."
John Brady,"I think on any given night, any good college basketball team can beat another one, particularly in a tournament situation."
John Brady,"He had good height and was a very good athlete, but it was only his first year of playing quarterback."
John Brady,Tyrus is a tremendous athlete who we need back.
John Brady,"I think the ability of Felix to guard Darrel Mitchell as he did -- a bigger guy, a physical guy on Darrel -- we never really got ourselves in a rhythm on offense. It seemed like to me we were always struggling on offense. For the most part, our execution wasn't where it needed to be."
John Brady,"The ability to step up and make free throws shows you a lot about our team. We're a little young ourselves, but we're making plays with the youth that we have, which is quite encouraging."
Kyle Brady,"I'm finally starting to come along. I'm glad about that. Still trying to work hard and learn the little things, you know? You still can always get better at something."
Kyle Brady,"I am blessed and have been very fortunate to have played for some great coaches, ... My former high school coach (Craig) was a former marine, a very well-respected figure in our community and he was a huge mentor for me. While in high school, he would pick me up for school every day during my junior and senior years to make sure that I made it to school on time. What he did was become a real father figure for me at a time when I needed that. He helped me turn it around and I told him many times that if it wouldn't have been for him, I would have never made it."
Kyle Brady,"As a professional football player, I have quite a bit of time in the off-season to pursue other goals, ... I would drive by this little airport every day on the way to work and see these planes coming in and landing. I looked at it and said to myself, 'Hey, I think I can do that.'"
Kyle Brady,"The 1994 season at Penn State was just a fabulous experience, ... We knew we had outstanding talent, but we also had a bunch of guys who were very focused, knew what they wanted and understood what it would take to get the job done and we went out and did it against some outstanding teams. When you see a bunch of young men coming together like that for a common goal, it is very satisfying."
Kyle Brady,"It's a great opportunity. Obviously, there's going to be some adversity up there as far as playing at their stadium against the reigning world champions and all the other things that will be spoken about all week long. It's a great opportunity for us to show what kind of team we think we are."
Tom Brady,We played hard. We just came up short.
Tom Brady,"I think it was great fortune that night. I'm glad the referees got the play right,"
Tom Brady,He wanted students to understand the diversity of the world and it was something he said all the time to the kids. This is just so sad.
Tom Brady,"Sometimes, getting up in the morning and brishing your teath is the hardest part of the day - it all just hurts."
Tom Brady,"My sisters like cooking at my place. It has a bit more room, and the food tastes a little bit better. A big pot of spaghetti and sauce, some warm French bread - works all the time. I think I've been eating pasta for 26 years."
Tom Brady,I've had just about everything punched. I've had things grabbed that just shouldn't be grapped.
Tom Brady,"WIth football you can have up to 28 guys you consider starters, and if they can pick up the slack when some aren't playing so well, you don't have to turn those two game losing streaks into six-game losing streaks."
Tom Brady,"Mentally, the only players who survive in the pros are the ones able to manage all their responsibilities."
Tom Brady,"A lot of times I find that people who are blessed with the most talent don't ever develop that attitude, and the ones who aren't blessed in that way are the most competitive and have the biggest heart."
Tom Brady,I could talk food all day. I love good food.
Billy Bragg,"Were it not for the Clash, punk would have been just a sneer, a safety pin and a pair of bondage trousers."
Billy Bragg,"There are quite a few honest songwriters out there writing about relationships and their own personality traits. But for some reason, once they step out of the bedroom, their honesty doesn't seem to come with them."
Billy Bragg,"The most important thing for anyone, I think, is to be engaged, whether you're an artist or a journalist is to be engaged in the process at some level."
Billy Bragg,"That taught me one lesson which is that you're naive to believe that bands can change the world. Bands are very naive to think that just if their audience thinks that they can change the world, that they can. That was quite a lesson for my career, really."
Billy Bragg,My upbringing was very straightforward suburban working class upbringing.
Billy Bragg,"Most of the people that I went to school with - I went to secondary school - we were educated to go and work in the line at Ford's, and if we were lucky, technical skilled labor. I sort of rejected that, and thought I wanted to do something else."
Billy Bragg,"It's not a very popular subject amongst my audience, who are by nature more internationalist, but I don't choose what to write about, I don't choose my subjects, they kind of choose me."
Billy Bragg,"In that sense, I became politicized because the people in the coal mining villages who were involved in the struggle knew why they were there. But they couldn't understand why some pop star from London would want to be there."
Billy Bragg,I try and write honestly about what I see around me now.
Billy Bragg,"I enjoyed so much working with the guys from Wilco, and riffing off of them, and having someone come up to me with ideas, because normally in the studio it's me who has to come up with all the ideas."
Billy Bragg,I came into this whole business by going to see Rock Against Racism gigs with the Clash.
Billy Bragg,"By the time I was 19, punk had occurred. It had a completely different cultural dynamic to it which rejected everything and started again from the year zero."
Billy Bragg,"By the end of the miner's strike I was defining myself as a socialist, clued in and looking for the next opportunity to defeat the Tories."
Billy Bragg,"But, in the end, even a song that's as politically bland as Blowin in the Wind, you probably wouldn't get up and sing that now, whereas some of Bob Dylan's love songs that were contemporary with that, like say Girl from the North Country, you can still get up an play now."
Billy Bragg,An isolationist America is no bloody use to anyone.
Billy Bragg,All musicians start out with ideals but hanging on to them in the face of media scrutiny takes real integrity. Tougher still is to live up to the ideals of your dedicated fans.
Billy Bragg,Being spokesman for a generation is the worst job I ever had.
Billy Bragg,"I'm trying to make a case for those people who don't have a sense of belonging that they should have, that there is something really worthwhile in having a sense of belonging, and recasting and looking at our modern history."
Lakhdar Brahimi,"[U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked the Northern Alliance] to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and treat these questions with as much humanity as possible, ... elsewhere, everywhere."
Lakhdar Brahimi,"What we have learned from that struggle is the importance of freedom, the importance of mobilization, the importance of justice, equality, and so on."
Lakhdar Brahimi,"The elections scheduled to take place by January 2005 are the most important milestone in this process. Until that time, any Iraqi governing body that exists will be less than fully representative,"
Lakhdar Brahimi,"You who are taking this responsibility must show unprecedented courage and leadership. You must place the interests of your people first above all other concerns only then will this process, this attempt to break cycle of misery and destitution conflict and violence stand a chance of success,"
Lakhdar Brahimi,"The Iraqi authorities, the [Coalition Provisional Authority] will really need to see how they can provide security for us if they want us to come back. It's useless to bring in large numbers of people if they are confined to bunkers."
Lakhdar Brahimi,Bremer is the dictator of Iraq. He had the money. He has the signature. Nothing happens without his agreement in this country.
Lakhdar Brahimi,"The sooner a credible Iraqi government is in place to lead the way, the better, especially because the absence of such a sovereign government is part of the problem in the first place,"

Bruce Braley,"Even though we're working toward a single player system, it's not at work now."
Bruce Braley,"Anytime you mention a penalty to people on a fixed income, they immediately and justifiably become concerned."
Bruce Braley,"This election is about your future ... You have to decide if you want a candidate with the same old tradition or one with a fresh new perspective, one who is willing to stand up. That is me."
Taylor Branch,"But the more information that comes out, the more explicable and human historical events become. The details make the story real."
Taylor Branch,The lessons that come from discovery of the Movement's story should point us forward.
Taylor Branch,"This era liberated everyone, if you look at the long span of history, beginning with white southerners. Until black people struggled for equal rights, white women couldn't serve on juries. Almost 30 states restricted service. That's so foreign to us today."
Constantin Brancusi,"What is real is not the external form, but the essence of things... it is impossible for anyone to express anything essentially real by imitating its exterior surface."
Constantin Brancusi,"To see far is one thing, going there is another."

Elton Brand,"It was our getaway game, so we wanted to get this victory."
Elton Brand,"We were last in three-point field goals, and that makes a big difference in wins and losses,"
Elton Brand,We can be proud of ourselves but we still have goals. We have to be looking forward to the next round. This is absolutely satisfying. It's like vindication because we worked hard and this organization didn't give up.
Elton Brand,"We had them. We built a 20-point lead, but they kept fighting. It's a lesson-learned. Overall, we came out with a victory."
Elton Brand,"Without a doubt,                                                                                                                         the swagger level goes up, ... Sam Cassell has been talking trash as soon as he came here. That's what we need. We need somebody that's confident like that, saying, hey, jump on our bandwagon or get left behind. We haven't had that."
Elton Brand,"Without a doubt, the swagger level goes up, ... Sam Cassell has been talking trash as soon as he came here. That's what we need. We need somebody that's confident like that, saying, hey, jump on our bandwagon or get left behind. We haven't had that."
Elton Brand,Having an all-time record under our belts says a lot about this team. We pride ourselves on defense and boxing out.
Elton Brand,"After practice, you see him talking to him, going through drills, taking shots. Of course that's his direct competition, but you see him wanting to help the young guy."
Elton Brand,Somebody said he did it in college. They had tape.
Elton Brand,"It means a lot, from our management all the way down to the ball boys. Even though it's just one game, it means a lot. We have to protect the home-court advantage."
Louis D. Brandeis,"The right to be alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by civilized man."
Louis D. Brandeis,"To declare that the end justifies the means, to declare that the government may commit crimes, would bring terrible retribution."
Louis D. Brandeis,"The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding."
Louis D. Brandeis,There are no shortcuts in evolution.
Louis D. Brandeis,Most of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.
Louis D. Brandeis,Fear of serious injury alone cannot justify oppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears.
Louis D. Brandeis,"Our government... teaches the whole people by its example. If the government becomes the lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy."
Nathaniel Branden,The Art of Living Consciously.
Nathaniel Branden,"To preserve an unclouded capacity for the enjoyment of life is an unusual moral and psychological achievement. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the prerogative of mindlessness, but the exact opposite: It is the reward of self-esteem."
Nathaniel Branden,"Persons of high self esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard. Their joy is being who they are, not in being better than someone else."
Nathaniel Branden,"For the rational, psychologically healthy man, the desire for pleasure is the desire to celebrate his control over reality. For the neurotic, the desire for pleasure is the desire to escape from reality."
Nathaniel Branden,"In a world in which the total of human knowledge is doubling about every ten years, our security can rest only on our ability to learn"
Nathaniel Branden,"Sometimes the subconscious mind manifests a wisdom several steps or evenyears ahead of the conscious mind, and has its own way of leading us toward ourdestiny."
Nathaniel Branden,"[This is a very minor criticism, however, especially considering how repetition works magnificently in other areas. In fact, repetition is at the heart of the book's power.] It's not just that you raise your level of awareness in regard to some problem, but you sustain the level of awareness over time, ... It isn't so much that an awareness heals, but it is sustained awareness that heals."
Nathaniel Branden,"Reason and emotion are not antagonists. What seems like a struggle between two opposing ideas or values, one of which, automatic and unconscious, manifests itself in the form of a feeling."
Nathaniel Branden,"In any culture, subculture, or family in which belief is valued above thought, and self-surrender is valued above self-expression, and conformity is valued above integrity, those who preserve their self-esteem are likely to be heroic exceptions"
Nathaniel Branden,"In a world in which the total of human knowledge is doubling about every ten years, our security can rest only on our ability to learn."
Nathaniel Branden,"Productive achievement is a consequence and an expression of health and self-esteem, not its cause."
Nathaniel Branden,Self esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves.
Nathaniel Branden,"Live with integrity, respect the rights of other people, and follow your own bliss."
Nathaniel Branden,"There is overwhelming evidence that the higher the level of self-esteem, the more likely one will be to treat others with respect, kindness, and generosity."
Nathaniel Branden,"A woman in love will do almost anything for a man, except give up the desire to improve him."
Nathaniel Branden,The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.
Marlon Brando,"With women, I've got a long bamboo pole with a leather loop on the end. I slip the loop around their necks so they can't get away or come too close. Like catching snakes."
Marlon Brando,Never confuse the size of your paycheck with the size of your talent.
Marlon Brando,It's the hardest thing in the world to accept a 'little' success and leave it that way.
Marlon Brando,Acting is the expression of a neurotic impulse. It's a bum's life. The principal benefit acting has afforded me is the money to pay for my psychoanalysis.
Marlon Brando,"My mind is always soothed when I imagine myself sitting on my South Sea island at night,"
Marlon Brando,"He's the kind of guy that when he dies, he's going up to heaven and give God a bad time for making him bald."
Marlon Brando,I have eyes like those of a dead pig.
Marlon Brando,"Kowalski was always right, and never afraid. He never wondered, he never doubted. His ego was very secure. And he had the kind of brutal agressiveness that I hate. I'm afraid of it. I detest the character. (his feelings about one of his most famous characters, Stanley Kowalski from 'A Streetcar Named Desire')"
Marlon Brando,"I went home and did some rehearsing to satisfy my curiosity about whether I could play an Italian. I put on some makeup, stuffed Kleenex in my cheeks, and worked out the characterization first in front of a mirror, then on a television monitor. After working on it, I decided I could create a characterization that would support the story. The people at Paramount saw the footage and liked it, and that's how I became the Godfather."
Marlon Brando,The only reason I'm in Hollywood is that I don't have the moral courage to refuse the money.
Marlon Brando,"If you want something from an audience, you give blood to their fantasies. It's the ultimate hustle."
Marlon Brando,I don't mind that I'm fat. You still get the same money.
Gil Brandt,"You can have the talent at one level, but when you get to the next level, it just doesn't happen. It's like the young guy selling insurance. One year, he sells $6 million of life insurance, and then his bosses say, 'Wait until he really learns how to sell.' But then he's got a boat and a country-club membership, and all of a sudden, he's not as good. That's what happens with players."
Gil Brandt,I would imagine they are getting a reputation as a passing team. And Texas has a reputation now that they can go out and get anybody.
Gil Brandt,That shows the quality of their program. Very seldom do you even have one player who starts as a rookie.
Gil Brandt,"They both have a truckload of players, and very good underclass players. The mother lode is at both places."
Gil Brandt,It's like a golf tournament where a bunch of guys are 10 handicappers and a few guys are zero handicappers. Thomas is a zero handicapper.
Gil Brandt,"When you say 47 percent out of the first 10 picks made the Hall of Fame, that's a high percentage."
Gil Brandt,I'm afraid he's in for a crushed ego.
Gil Brandt,"No one wants the blame for the bad decisions and everybody fights for the credit on the good decisions, ... When you need a consensus, what happens is maybe this year I side with you and the next year I side with another guy to balance things out. That's not making the best decision for the franchise."
Gil Brandt,"Mommas, let your babies grow up to be left tackles."
Gil Brandt,"You've got a captive audience of all 32 teams, and that's something you don't have at (an on-campus session). If you do well here, there are a lot of people who take notice."
Gil Brandt,I think he has the ability to play much better than he has been. This is another guy who has to understand that he's now moving up a class.
Richard Branson,"India is an incredibly vibrant market, which Virgin already, through Virgin Atlantic, has the pleasure of working in. I am delighted that Virgin Comics will not only help to launch the Indian comic market and spin it into the West, but will develop new and exciting talent."
Richard Branson,It's incredible to get people to turn out right in the middle of no where.
Richard Branson,Records are made to be broken. It is in man's nature to continue to strive to do just that.
Richard Branson,"Well, I'm somebody who is just living...living life, and if I get frustrated by something, then I like to try to put it right,"
Richard Branson,"Wine, like life, is meant to be enjoyed. All the pomp and ceremony currently associated with wine just gets in the way of enjoying it."

Richard Branson,We told him he had to land alive.
Richard Branson,"He was a larger-than-life figure, with a wicked sense of humor, and a great friend."
Richard Branson,"I am so excited by the thought of Virgin Cola taking on Coke and Pepsi in their home territory, ... I have always believed that you can never truly be an international cola until you have launched in the home of the colas -- America."
Richard Branson,Anyone would feel an enormous sense of guilt going to one of these places - and if you're in a position to do something about it you've got to make an effort.
Richard Branson,"Thank you to the Chinese government,"
Richard Branson,Some of the magic will be lost now that the girls are only four. It's sad to see people so close split in this way.
Richard Branson,"Our vision of the future is a complete deregulation of everything from routes and airline access rights, all the way through to changing ownership and control regulations which would allow mergers and acquisitions,"
Richard Branson,"We've got an engaging, edgy, vibrant, fun product, ... It may or may not work, but we're going to give it our best shot."
Richard Branson,"We are effectively in an emergency situation. But we are friends with the Chinese people, and this is a sporting event. We have no choice but to go over China, and we would be enormously grateful if they let us in."
Richard Branson,I love the freedom that my phone gives me.
Richard Branson,"I love the freedom of movement that my phone gives me. That has definitely transformed my life,"
Richard Branson,"We'd love to be involved with the creation of something very special, something quite large and something quite exciting."
Richard Branson,I think it's very important that the competition authorities listen to the slightly smaller companies (and) try to create a level playing field so that the consumer gets the benefit of choice and gets the benefit of competition. ? I wish Pepsi well in that and I hope that Pepsi will not behave in the same way when we come knocking on the doors of some of the big retailers that they are in.
Richard Branson,It is not for me (to decide). It is up to the company to decide whether the price is fair or not.
Richard Branson,"British Airways was doing everything they could do to put Virgin Atlantic out of business -- what's become famous here as the dirty tricks campaign, ... We felt that we needed the financial muscle to combat them. And I still had a lot to prove at Virgin Atlantic whereas we proved that we could, you know, build and run a successful record company."
Richard Branson,"If I was a businessman, or saw myself as a businessman, I would have never gone into the airline business."
Richard Branson,Like getting into a bleeding competition with a blood bank.
Richard Branson,"I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It's done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer."
Richard Branson,"Ridiculous yachts and private planes and big limousines won't make people enjoy life more, and it sends out terrible messages to the people who work for them. It would be so much better if that money was spent in Africa - and it's about getting a balance."
Richard Branson,"Business opportunities are like buses, there's always another one coming."
Richard Branson,I believe in benevolent dictatorship provided I am the dictator
Richard Branson,"He gave me a lot of very useful advice when I set up Virgin Atlantic 21 years ago. Perhaps his best advice was to make sure that I took BA to court before they bankrupted us -- not after, as he did."
Richard Branson,"He gave me a lot of very useful advice when I set up Virgin Atlantic 21 years ago. Perhaps his best advice was to make sure that I took BA to court before they bankrupted us â€” not after, as he did."

Richard Branson,I think the most important thing is that in the last seven days we've just had the greatest adventure of our lifetimes.
Richard Branson,"In any adventure like this, there are always uncertainties."
Richard Branson,"I am slightly biased, but I think it is an incredible achievement -- the last great aviation record left."
Fernand Braudel,"The fundamental reality of any civilization must be its geographical cradle. Geography dictates its vegetational growth and lays down often impassable frontiers. Civilizations are regions, zones not merely as anthropologists understand them when they talk about the zone of the two-headed ax or the feathered arrow; they are areas which both confine man and undergo constant change through its efforts."
Fernand Braudel,"When discussing the rise and fall of empires, it is well to mark closely their rate of growth, avoiding the temptation to telescope time and discover too early signs of greatness in a state which we know will one day be great, or to predict too early the collapse of an empire which we know will one day cease to be. The life-span of empires cannot be plotted by events, only by careful diagnosis and ausculation--and as in medicine there is always room for error."
Fernand Braudel,Social science virtually abhors the event. Not without reason; the short-term is the most capricious and deceptive form of time.
Wernher von Braun,There is just one thing I can promise you about the outer-space program -- your tax-dollar will go further.
Wernher von Braun,Our sun is one of 100 billion stars in our galaxy. Our galaxy is one of billions of galaxies populating the universe. It would be the height of presumption to think that we are the only living beings in that enormous immensity.
Wernher von Braun,"It will free man from his remaining chains, the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet. It will open to him the gates of heaven."
Wernher von Braun,"We can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming."
Wernher von Braun,"For my confirmation, I didn't get a watch and my first pair of long pants, like most Lutheran boys. I got a telescope. My mother thought it would make the best gift."
Wernher von Braun,Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing.
Wernher von Braun,"It will free man from the remaining chains, the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet."
Richard Brautigan,It's strange how the simple things in life go on while we become more difficult.

Richard Brautigan,"I didn't know the full dimensions of forever, but I knew it was longer than waiting for Christmas to come."
Richard Brautigan,"Probably the closest things to perfection are the huge absolutely empty holes that astronomers have recently discovered in space. If there's nothing there, how can anything go wrong?"
Ross Brawn,"The fuel capacity is a little bit smaller because the engine uses less fuel. There is more space in the back of the car because the engine is shorter. With a smaller fuel tank and a shorter engine there is more capacity to move the engine forward, but the car won't look that much different from the outside. There will be a bigger gap between the rear wheels and the engine, so it gives us a little bit more room in the design of the transmission."
Ross Brawn,"How nice it is to do a launch with the new car running outside, a very pleasant background."
Ross Brawn,"It was obviously very frustrating to have come so close to winning a race but after the season we had last year, we can take a great deal of encouragement from today's performance."
Ross Brawn,"We need to see how things progress before we make those sort of predictions or scenarios,"
Ross Brawn,This is very frustrating for us. We have had various problems with the engine but we'll get over them. I'm convinced of that.
Ross Brawn,I think there's a huge potential from a driver point of view and from a commercial point of view you can imagine the potential it would have as well.
Ross Brawn,You can see he's got huge potential.
Ross Brawn,I'm quite happy with the choice and it's really up to him to prove next year whether he's a long-term Ferrari driver or not.
Ross Brawn,I don't think he wants the tag of America last year as his first victory. So for sure it's the first proper victory of an Aldo Costa-designed car. It's a good precedent for the future.
Ross Brawn,"This winter and next year he'll do a few more serious tests. It's a kind of open-ended agreement,"
Donna Brazile,I was motivated to be different in part because I was different.
Donna Brazile,"America's story is one of expanding opportunity and suffrage, and one of our fundamental principles is that every eligible citizen is entitled to cast his or her vote and have that vote counted,"

Bertolt Brecht,Science knows only one commandment - contribute to science.
Bertolt Brecht,Don't tell me peace has broken out.
Bertolt Brecht,"Literary works cannot be taken over like factories, or literary forms of expression like industrial methods. Realist writing, of which history offers many widely varying examples, is likewise conditioned by the question of how, when and for what class it is made use of."
Bertolt Brecht,Right is its own defense.
Bertolt Brecht,Society cannot share a common communication system so long as it is split into warring factions.
Bertolt Brecht,"A man who sees another man on the street corner with only a stump for an arm will be so shocked the first time he'll give him sixpence. But the second time it'll only be a three penny bit. And if he sees him a third time, he'll have him cold-bloodedly handed over to the police."
Bertolt Brecht,"The atomic age made its debut at Hiroshima in the middle of our work. Overnight, the biography of the founder of the new system of physics read differently."
Bertolt Brecht,What's breaking into a bank compared with founding a bank?
Bertolt Brecht,"Everyone chases after happiness, not noticing that happiness is right at their heels."
Ed Breen,"Our organic revenue growth was 2% in the quarter, which was a bit stronger than expected in Fire and Security but weaker in Healthcare, primarily due to the challenges we are facing in our retail business. Electronics continued to grow at the 3% pace we had anticipated,"
Ed Breen,We believe that separation is a logical next step in Tyco's evolution.
Ed Breen,"We are very good at doing design and living next door to our customer. We've been moving with them. It's the reason we've got 30,000 Tyco electronics employees right now in China in 21 locations."
Drew Brees,"We went into a couple of sports equipment stores and asked if they had heard of Darren Bennett, ... They all said he's great; he made it to America."
Drew Brees,"He is aggressive and he has a nose for the end zone, ... Giving the ball to him is our best bet."
Drew Brees,"Now the expectation is to be (in the playoffs). Everybody knows that, and they know we can do it. We've done it. So why can't we do it again this year?"
Drew Brees,"We've gone on the road and won at two very difficult places. We've got another hostile environment this week, but we know that we can win wherever we play if we execute and do the things we need to do."
Drew Brees,"Obviously I'd like to get this thing operated on as soon as possible. We're all very optimistic. The doctors are very optimistic, saying that this is something that they've seen before, done before, It shouldn't be a big deal."
Drew Brees,"It's my job to get us in good plays, or more importantly, out of bad plays. That's what I did."
Drew Brees,"Obviously if Gates turns out missing the first game because of this, that's disappointing for everyone in this locker room because he is big part of our team and we don't want to see that happen."
Drew Brees,I feel like I'm getting the reps I need to prepare myself for the season. Each week I'm feeling more comfortable and getting better.
Paul Bremer,The fact of the matter is that we are facing a small group of bitter-enders who are basically trying turn the tide of history.

Paul Bremer,"You know, the country is basically peaceful."
Paul Bremer,"Saddam spent 35 years stealing and wasting money, and all of these systems are very fragile and brittle, and you try to fix one thing and something else gets in trouble."

They are quality individuals who will maintain the integrity and academic excellence we have built within The Ohio State University's men's lacrosse program. They all bring a desire to compete for another conference championship and a trip to the NCAA tournament.
Joe Breschi,We outscored them 6-2 in the second half. Guys kept fighting and that's a product of our program. These kids believed that they can win and keep fighting.

George Brett,I don't think I can play any other way but all out. I enjoy the game so much because I'm putting so much into it.
George Brett,"Even today, if the Royals win six games all year, if they're going to go 6-156, I hope they beat the Yankees six times."
George Brett,"If they stay within the organization, the obvious choice is Frank White . The thing is, if you hire him, it's going to be very difficult to fire Frank White if things don't go well. He's a local guy. He played at the academy. And he made such an impact on this community. He was a great player. God, it would be tough. You'd almost be saying, 'Frank, you've got five years or six years or 10 years.'"
George Brett,"If I stay healthy, I have a chance to collect 3,000 hits and 1,000 errors."
George Brett,A woman will be elected President before Wade Boggs is called out on strikes. I guarantee that.
George Brett,"I could have played another year, but I would have been playing for the money, and baseball deserves better than that."

George Brett,"If a tie is like kissing your sister, losing is like kissing you grandmother with her teeth out."
Corey Brewer,"You know, all year we've been talking about staying focused because that's what's going to get us to the Final Four. We were just telling each other we have to stay focused for two more minutes, we are going to Indianapolis. That's what we did. We are on the way to the Final Four."
Corey Brewer,It wasn't anything serious. It didn't bother me the rest of the game.
Corey Brewer,"It's like we told each other, it's March now, let the madness begin. We can't lose any more. That's just the way it is. We just can't lose."
Corey Brewer,I guess you could say we're learning.
Corey Brewer,"You hate to guard Lee Humphrey. If you back off a little bit, it's going up and it's going in."
Corey Brewer,I hit my head hard. I'm not going to lie. It knocked me out for a little while.
Corey Brewer,They all have famous fathers and nobody knows my dad. He's just a normal guy.
Corey Brewer,My mom gave me these earrings for Christmas.
Corey Brewer,George Mason is a very balanced team. They have good guards and the ability to make a lot of threes in transition and they also shoot a high percentage inside.
Lamon Brewster,"I always said I would fight a man in his living room and now I am getting to prove that,"
Lamon Brewster,"Andrew Golota was the only thing keeping me from the land of milk and honey, ... I've got more than just heart. I've got skills. I was an F-16, and he was a B-52 Bomber. And I shot him down."
Lamon Brewster,[So what's the secret  to Simon's un-Homer like success?] Fun. Having fun at what you do  and if you're working with talented people like I was with the Simpson's  that helps a lot. Luck helps too. I thought we were going to do only thirteen  episodes of the Simpsons and look what ended up happening. ... What  I did right with Lamon was that I stuck with him through thick and thin.  It took Lamon a long time for things to come together so he could be where  he is right now. Of all the four champions he's the most talented. Lamon's  a real world champion. He'll fight anyone anywhere. Soon enough people  are finally going to realize that he's the true heavyweight champion of  the world. He'll probably have to beat Vitali to achieve that status.  I know he'll beat Vitali and only then will Lamon get the recognition  he deserves.
Lamon Brewster,"It was just my willpower, my determination. I had to wait a long time,"
Lamon Brewster,"It's an honor fighting on his birthday, because of what he did for my idol, my hero, Joe Louis,"
Lamon Brewster,"You earned it, baby. We both deserve to be at the top, but you won."
Mike Brey,I know we can shoot free throws better than we have. We have to work on that a little bit because that's a good weapon for us. If were getting to the bonus by using those big guys we've got to convert.
Mike Brey,It was important for them to be able to smile in the locker room. Hopefully that's good therapy.
Mike Brey,It was important for them to smile a little bit in the locker room. We haven't been able to do that in awhile. Hopefully that's good therapy for us as we get back to work.
Mike Brey,"It's very intense. No. 1, you have your current team on campus and in school, so you feel torn a little bit. You're very responsible for those young men who have already signed with you and are on your watch, academically and athletically. But you need to be out a couple days a week evaluating."
Mike Brey,We had a little killer instinct to start the second half.
Mike Brey,Dean being nicked up for them is like Quinn being hurt for us. And I don't want to think about it.
Mike Brey,"Your frame of mind is a little different after that and human nature kicks in. Our losses - not only a couple in a row, but any one of them - we felt like we could have won. It takes its toll."
Mike Brey,"We needed to go into that locker room with a smile. Human nature says, too, that after going through what we've been through, you need to go into the locker room and smile and pat each other on the back a little bit."
Mike Brey,Got after them a little bit. They knew they could be better. Luke Zeller's offense was a key to giving us some breathing room.
Mike Brey,"He's the guy I'm most concerned about, you know, because he's giving it everything, plus he's running the locker room, he's keeping guys' heads up. I think he did a great job of that since Syracuse (on Wednesday night) and then he was really ready to be aggressive and set the tone."
Mike Brey,Luke's been very solid there. He's come a long way with his post defense and his defensive rebounding. (Fordham) left him alone and he made shots and gave us a double-digit lead we didn't relinquish.
Mike Brey,"His goal is to become a head coach and he could be a head coach probably very soon. If you learn another system from another guy, that certainly can help your public relations when you become a head coach."
Mike Brey,"[When] you're in the business as long as I am, you see a little bit of everything. This is pretty weird though - what we've been through. I will say that. This is pretty weird. But we'll keep riding on this [win] and keep building."
Mike Brey,"I think he's going to be on an NBA roster, with that body and that length."
Mike Brey,The weight of the world was on their shoulders. I think it showed up in play and in body language.
Mike Brey,Our players have been punched hard and taken some body blows.
Mike Brey,"I'll go to bed with a Chris Quinn runner for the rest of my life. It's the law of averages, but it didn't work out. He makes that shot a lot, and he had a clean look, too."
Mike Brey,I don't know if anybody's shocked. We felt they were going to be a pretty good basketball team and maybe were being undersold a little bit in the preseason.
Mike Brey,"It feels like we played seven league games. It was a great college basketball game. We gave ourselves a chance to win, but Pitt made plays when they had to."
Mike Brey,I think our fans will rally with this group. There's one thing with this basketball team: They've fought and they've dug and they've been a pretty good example for people.
Stephen Breyer,"Remember, 100 or 150 years ago, you could walk down the street, your neighbors might see you, they'd watch what you do,"
Stephen Breyer,a hallmark of American justice in the last 30 years.
Stephen Breyer,"It's hard,"
Stephen Breyer,Virginia is now pursuing an execution schedule that leaves less time for argument and for court consideration than the court's rules provide for ordinary cases.
Stephen Breyer,"You will read in the newspaper more often about federal courts, but the law that affects people, the trials that affect human beings are by and large in the state courts."
Stephen Breyer,"You can have many different selection systems, but the bottom line has to be a system that, once the judge takes office that judge will feel that he or she is to decide the case without reference to the popular thing or the popular will of the moment."
Stephen Breyer,Would I want to be judged by whether or not I was popular? Wouldn't I want to be judged on what was true as opposed to what might be popular?
Stephen Breyer,"Well, just that there would be somebody in the office and the voters - it was more or less an understanding in the entire community, as long as that person was doing a good job on the merits, nobody was going to run against him."
Stephen Breyer,"Well it's fairly important that everyone have a lawyer and so we have a system that you can't convict a person without a lawyer, even if he's guilty."
Stephen Breyer,We developed a system of protecting human liberty such that judges and independent judges are a necessary part of that protection.
Stephen Breyer,"We can speak about the institution, but ultimately the bar is the group that both is in touch with the public on the one hand and understands the judicial institution on the other."
Stephen Breyer,"We are selected, but I grew up in California and in San Francisco and there was a system of electing judges."
Stephen Breyer,"Ultimately, the question of campaign contributions will be decided by the public."
Stephen Breyer,To threaten the institution is to threaten fair administration of justice and protection of liberty.
Stephen Breyer,There are loads of countries that have nice written constitutions like ours. But there aren't loads of countries where they're followed.
Stephen Breyer,"People have to be educated and they have to stick to it. If people lose that respect, an awful lot is lost."
Stephen Breyer,"Once you're in a system where there are contributions being made, it's certainly not the case that everybody expects something back."
Stephen Breyer,It's important to every American that the law protect his or her basic liberty.
Stephen Breyer,Independence means you decide according to the law and the facts.
Stephen Breyer,Independence doesn't mean you decide the way you want.
Stephen Breyer,"I think it shows that if you have one group of people doing it, you'll get another group of people doing it."
Stephen Breyer,I mean those people who are interested in good government will certainly contribute in order to make certain there's some counter-balance to those whose interests in good government is less.
Stephen Breyer,Every citizen has to figure out what kind of government he or she wants.
Stephen Breyer,"But once the person is selected, at that point that person is independent."
Stephen Breyer,"At the same time, we do live in a democracy. And for that reason I think it is appropriate to have some element of public control."
Stephen Breyer,"And the problem is once you get into this campaign business and begin to have a lot of money, then the person on the bench begins to think - what's going to happen if I decide the case this way or that way?"
Stephen Breyer,"And in that confirmation process, I sat for 17 hours in front of a senate judiciary committee."
Stephen Breyer,"And if a judge is going to be criticized for letting off a person and it turns out that person was innocent, that would be a pretty bad criticism."
Harry Bridges,"I'm a working stiff. I just happened to be around at the right time, and nobody else wanted the job."
Harry Bridges,"Everything is produced by the workers, and the minute they try to get something by their unions they meet all the opposition that can be mustered by those who now get what they produce."
Harry Bridges,"Neither, I must say with all due respect, is it the power of teachers and students. Basically the true and real power is with working people of all colors, of all beliefs, of all national origins."
Harry Bridges,"I'm a machine man, and I head a machine."
Daniel Briere,"Throughout the season we were expecting the calls to go down, the referees to stop calling the new rules. They kept it going all year."
Daniel Briere,"I never saw him. It was careless on my part, but it wasn't on purpose. Sometimes that's going to happen."
Daniel Briere,"You lose a couple games and you think it's bad luck and it'll come back, but with such a long losing streak, it made us take a look at everything again and make sure we make the adjustments before the playoffs. I really meant it when I said this will make us a better team."
Daniel Briere,"It's not going to be easy, but it's great for the fans. We get to see the Leafs, Canadiens, Bruins and Senators more often. It's better for travelling as well. There's a lot of positives, but emotion will be a big factor."
Daniel Briere,That's why we're a good team. We keep finding ways to win and there's no doubt it doesn't matter who scores. ... The depth of our team is what makes the difference and it showed tonight.
Daniel Briere,"I think it went well. I saw the doctors again this morning and they both told me that it looked good. Right now it's a tough time, but at the same time I'm on the upswing. It's recovery time. And I'm happy we finally found out what was wrong and I can look forward to coming back on the ice."
Daniel Briere,Hopefully it will keep us going in the right direction.
David Briggs,"We'll see an avoidance of major pharma, maybe with a move toward medical technology and biotech."
David Briggs,"The market seems trapped between 1,200 and 1,212 on the S&P. We'll probably see a little strength later in the week, at the very least to offset last week's weakness; and if we see the S&P dip below 1,200, then I think some bargain hunters will come out."
David Briggs,"Early next week you've got a trade deficit number and retail sales, and those reports could be volatile."
David Briggs,"Reality is setting in. It is going to be extremely difficult for the market to rally. The market showed resilience from $40 to $60 a barrel, but I don't know about $70."
David Briggs,A lot of people are not sure what to do and that uncertainty is playing itself out in the marketplace.
David Briggs,"The market has been in this, essentially, seven percent range, for five months now, ... Unfortunately, the summer months during election years tend to be pretty directionless, with people not wanting to make moves until they know what's going on with the election."
David Briggs,"The market has been in this, essentially, seven percent range, for five months now. Unfortunately, the summer months during election years tend to be pretty directionless, with people not wanting to make moves until they know what's going on with the election."
David Briggs,"There's not a lot of conviction out there. It's a strange year-end, you just get a sense that people are content, waiting for the new year."
David Briggs,"There basically is an absence of sellers in the market. It seems the market is a little ahead of itself, but people are reluctant to sell. People are still putting money to work here in the market."
Lance Briggs,"The offense put us up, and we let them drive down the field. It was just simple mistakes. We'll get better."
Lance Briggs,"Missed tackles are just mistakes for whatever reason -- putting my head down and not seeing what I'm doing, coming off my feet, whatever. I tend to not wrap sometimes, and I still get away with getting tackles. Some guys you don't wrap, and they're going to run through tackles. You just have to make plays when they're there."
Lance Briggs,"As far as this year, our goals are through the sky right now, ... Some of the goals we have right now, a lot of people might think are unattainable or farfetched. We believe with the unit we have put together, we can do it."
Lance Briggs,"That was probably one of the games where we started to get some respect, started to get noticed a little bit."
Lance Briggs,"It means a lot because the benchmark is the '85 Bears and their defense, and if we come anywhere close to where they were at least people can say we had a good defense that year."
Lance Briggs,"We never stop believing,"
Shannon Briggs,"I'm not ripping and running the streets no more, hitting the clubs and all that. I'm wiser. I'm not a jitterbug anymore. I'm settled down."
Shannon Briggs,[Briggs was in good spirits on Wednesday. He was friendly and accessible and seemed to be in good fighting shape. He joked he weighed 375 pounds but conceded he's more likely in the 245-255 pound range. He said he didn't plan on losing any more weight (] Guys are big now ... I just want to win fights and have fun and just make the best out of my career.
Shannon Briggs,"I have more power in the later rounds. People used to say I have no endurance; that I was only strong for three or four rounds. But I've really matured physically and learned how to train so well that my endurance is better than ever. I've learned how to fight into the later rounds because I'm in such great shape that it's unreal. I used to be afraid a fight would go into the later rounds, now I welcome it."
Shannon Briggs,It would be great for the sport and the division. One title. One champion.
Sarah Brightman,I don't want to see pictures of Hollywood stars in their dressing gowns taking out the rubbish. It ruins the fantasy.

Sarah Brightman,"Anything can happen to anyone at any time and you shouldn't just live through the days, or you lose them. You should do what you can to enjoy every moment."

Sarah Brightman,"People have said there is an integrity about me, and I think there is. I don't try to follow a trend. I have my own little path."
Sarah Brightman,I can't be a wife. I'm not that sort of person. Wives have to compromise all the time.
Sarah Brightman,"I am not quite sure where home is right now. I do have places in London and Milan, and a house in Spain. I guess I would say home is where my mother is, and she lives in Spain."

Rod Brind'Amour,"Coming into the middle of the season, especially on a team doing real well and trying not to rock the boat, I know he feels a lot of pressure that way."
Rod Brind'Amour,"We fought hard and we were there. We had it, we had our opportunity to win, and we let it slip away. It's very disappointing because we did fight back. It's one thing if we got down three and they just finished the game off. We came back and got ahead. We had that game. That's the frustrating part, but we're not dead."
Rod Brind'Amour,We're getting contributions from different guys every night. One night the goaltending steals us the game and another night one player gets us up with a goal here or there.
Rod Brind'Amour,"We're getting contributions from different guys every night. One night, the goaltending steals us the game, and another night, one player gets us up with a goal here or there."
Rod Brind'Amour,"That's a bonus to look back at. Obviously, that year [2002-03] sucked. But it's just the nature of it. When you're not good, you get a good, young player [in the draft]."
Rod Brind'Amour,"You can't win giving up that many no matter how well you play offensively. You have to shut other teams down. We're erratic, too erratic, I think."
Rod Brind'Amour,"The schedule is just kind of crazy, there's too many games. There's no time to just get away from the game."
Rod Brind'Amour,"It certainly lit a fire under us, anyway. It got us kinda going again, because obviously the momentum had swung the other way."
Rod Brind'Amour,"We know what we're supposed to be doing and you don't magically come up with a new plan. It's execution. At the end of the day, either your goalie stands on his head or you had better execution, and I think we had better execution."
Rod Brind'Amour,We're definitely going to have to play with more energy [against Buffalo]. We just weren't good in our end [against Pittsburgh].

They are more loved by poor people than any other historical figures in recent memory."

Rhonda Britten,Let go of what you think life should be so you can experience the life you have.
Bruce Brobst,They got four in the first and we had an opportunity to come back and we didn't. Their pitcher struggled and we couldn't capitalize on that. We had to answer back and didn't. They did capitalize. They hit the ball well.
Bruce Brobst,"I said to the guys - I've got to give you a lot of credit. It's cold, it's Friday night and we've got a game at 11 in the morning. To come back and win this game is just huge for us."

Lou Brock,"When I was a kid, I used to imagine animals running under my bed. I told my dad, and he solved the problem quickly. He cut the legs off the bed."
Jon Brockman,I was just trying to make myself more confident and more aggressive and to get involved. Because the person passing the ball has to have confidence that you are going to do something with it. They have to believe that their pass is going to be worthwhile.

Martin Brodeur,"We definitely put ourselves in a better spot than before we started, but there's a lot of work to do still."
Martin Brodeur,"We're trying to survive and get in the playoffs, so these wins are huge."
Martin Brodeur,"I think being up, being down, trying to be consistent in the playoffs is probably the hardest thing, because it doesn't matter if you lose 2-1 or 7-1 â€” it's still one game. The bottom line is to advance."
Martin Brodeur,"Talent is not enough to win. It's necessary to know how to form a real team, and we didn't manage that this year."
Martin Brodeur,"To me, he was always a safety valve, knowing that I had one of the best competitors in the game in front of me. To be the captain of three Stanley Cup teams, you don't do that by chance. It's because you've done something great in your career."
Martin Brodeur,It's a rivalry and they're playing hard. We're not happy they're not doing well against the rest of the league. They're taking points away from us.
Martin Brodeur,He's getting more and more responsibility. And you mature when you get those responsibilities. We're looking for him to bring some toughness and stability on our defense.
Martin Brodeur,"The progress that I've made in two days has been tremendous, ... I think one week at the most and I'll be ready to go."
Martin Brodeur,"For us defensively, we take a lot of pride in it. This year it's a little different because of the circumstances of the CBA. There are no bonuses. The guys are definitely out for just pride and feeding off that performance to move on to the next game."
Martin Brodeur,"Definitely, it would be nice. That's what I'm planning to do. ... It's not something I'm going to regret all of my life. But it's going to be nice if we're able to do it. We know there's a lot of work ahead of us to get it done."
Martin Brodeur,"He's just quick in everything he does. I think before, he didn't have an opportunity to get open because of his size and the clutching and grabbing. Now he's able to get in those areas where nobody can touch him."
Martin Brodeur,I just have a hard time stopping him in breakaways. I stop it all night long during the game.
Martin Brodeur,It's kind of nice to have (a shutout) on (Stevens') night. We played a tough opponent. It was a playoff atmosphere out there. It's a great day for Scott and it became a great day for us at the same time.
Martin Brodeur,I feel good and I feel re-energized. That night off was good for me and I feel like I'm ready to go.
Martin Brodeur,"We didn't give them our best game, that's for sure. We turned the puck over, made a lot of mistakes. (But) Rick played tremendous. He made the saves when he needed too."
Martin Brodeur,"It's mind boggling. You're thinking about it and you are shaking your head saying, 'How did we do this?' We don't say there are 11 games left, let's win them all. We needed a lot of help from everybody but we still needed to win 11 games. I think it's amazing."
Martin Brodeur,I'd love to know what it is so we can try to prevent it.
Martin Brodeur,"It's a skill that I worked all my life, and it's been taken away. That's kind of tough to take."
Martin Brodeur,"To my knowledge, it's a phantom goal,"
Martin Brodeur,We're not kids. At least we're informed of the possibilities.
Martin Brodeur,It felt a little hurt but now it's fine. No problem.
Martin Brodeur,"It was nice to have home ice advantage against these guys and we took advantage of it. The guys played well offensively, we buried some great opportunities and special teams again was a big factor. We put ourselves in a great position but we've got to make the best out of it."
Martin Brodeur,"He's been always really good against us. I don't remember the last time (the Devils' scored five goals on Hasek). I'm sure we did it, but I'm not sure when. We had so many opportunities tonight early in the game and he still made some great saves."
Martin Brodeur,It's like preseason now. I guess maybe a memo was sent down to call games tighter again.
Martin Brodeur,"It went our way for three games. It could go the other way for three games, also."
Martin Brodeur,"[More insulting still, the New Jersey Devils declined to stay in Ottawa between Games 1 and 2 of their Stanley Cup semifinal series against the Senators last week, flying home to spend 48 hours in the relative Babylon of East Rutherford.] If you look around, ... there's not much to do around here."
Martin Brodeur,I played 25 minutes and 35 minutes in two games. I shouldn't be tired. I'm tired of getting scored on.
Martin Brodeur,"I think it's funny that we have to answer these things (about Gretzky). After all, the highlight of our lives is playing in the Olympics right now. It's a great opportunity to compete at the highest standard of hockey. So for people to waste their time asking these questions, we just brush them off and move on."
Martin Brodeur,"It was fun to play the game again. It's going to be the same for every team. Everybody is in the same boat. It's like riding a bicycle, you go back to it and it's like you never left it."
Martin Brodeur,"I rode the wave for a while and it was fun, but you can understand now why I was saying I was not for [the shootout] when I was winning. This is the reason why. I thought we played a decent hockey game and everybody's bummed out."
Martin Brodeur,"While you're fighting for a playoff spot, you might as well try to get the best spot possible."
Martin Brodeur,"This is going to be such a huge event for my family, my friends. It's going to be such a fun experience. My dad won a bronze in 1956 and now, 50 years later, going back to the same country, I'm going to try and win a medal as well."
Martin Brodeur,"I saw everybody in front of me, and their eyes were going crazy. It was a scary five or six seconds. They finally told us there was a mechanical problem and they couldn't get the plane in the air."
Martin Brodeur,"It is important that we have a balanced squad, youth blending with experience."
Martin Brodeur,"It was a good experience for me just to meet him. He's a real gentleman, a nice guy. There's not a bad thing I could say about the guy."
Martin Brodeur,He's not the quickest guy out there. He does it with experience. And you can't buy experience.
Martin Brodeur,We've still got a lot of time before they exercise their option.
Martin Brodeur,"Definitely, it's a little crisis. It's not the end of the world."
Martin Brodeur,We're going to get through this crisis we have now.
Martin Brodeur,"He's a young guy. When you have the privilege of playing for the greatest hockey country, there are only so many players. It's not that he's not worth being there, it's just because he's in a situation that Team Canada has a new wave of young players."
Martin Brodeur,The team has the confidence to throw me in the net every night and that makes it a lot easier when you know you're going to get over 65 starts every year.
Martin Brodeur,"This was huge, especially against a team like that. Hopefully, we'll build some confidence and get some momentum going forward."
Martin Brodeur,"We have no excuse to not get back to where we were at or even better. I think the competition will be greater from now on because of the stretch drive. Some teams are going to try to secure playoff spots. Some teams are going to try to get back in the mix. Some teams, like us, are trying to stay alive and move up with the big guys."
Martin Brodeur,We're going to have a good competition and that's what you want.
Martin Brodeur,"I could have stayed in. It was my choice. When the team is struggling, why be in there for the sake of being there?"
Martin Brodeur,Some of the stuff he would tell us was really out of character.
Martin Brodeur,"I think there was a big transition in Canada, having younger guys being part of Team Canada now. I think it's nice we had a chance to perform with each other. At least you don't come in and it's a brand-new atmosphere. Now Team Canada has been doing these pre-Olympic training camps in the summer also, where we got together. I think everybody's really anxious to see each other again."
Martin Brodeur,My skate got caught and I twisted it. I heard it twist and I couldn't get up. All my body weight fell on it. I had to be really hurt to leave the game. We were still in the game at that point.
Martin Brodeur,"[The NHL testing] just started in January, so it's OK. It's flushed out of his body, but from now on, the guy's got to be careful. Everybody is educated now. It's not like you don't know. Now, you have to know. That's your responsibility as an athlete. I think his was just an unfortunate situation that happened to him that's really isolated -- I hope."
Martin Brodeur,I don't think you can blame the new guys for the way we've been playing.
Martin Brodeur,"[Starting for the Canadian Olympic team has given Martin Brodeur a distinct advantage. He was the first goalie to get the NHL's newly legislated smaller pads, pants, and other gear.] Goalies that like to react to pucks won't have a problem, ... Those goalies that block shots instead of stopping shots, will find it's going to be a little tougher for them, especially in close."
Martin Brodeur,Definitely it was key not having him around. We took advantage of him not being around. That's good.
Martin Brodeur,"[Devils netminder Martin Brodeur said the team is prepared for Stevens' absence, having learned how to play without him for much of the last NHL season.] We got used to not having him around, ... We really have a sense of what it's going to be like without Scott Stevens. At the same time we're going to have to learn about life without Scott Niedermayer, too. It's two tough blows to take..."
Richard Brodhead,"If you were at a university where the president meted out punishment based on what he reads in the newspaper, it would be a pretty dangerous place."
Richard Brodhead,"Many lives have been touched by this case. It has brought pain and suffering to all involved, and it deeply challenges our ability to balance judgment with compassion. As the legal process unfolds, we must hope that it brings a speedy resolution and that the truth of the events is fully clarified."
Richard Brodhead,"It's understandable to feel badly when terrible things may have happened at a place you love, and I've heard from many of you who have expressed sadness, anger, outrage, and frustration about the lacrosse situation."
Richard Brodhead,"While we await the results of the investigation, I remind everyone that under our system of law, people are presumed innocent until proven guilty. One deep value the university is committed to is protecting us all from coercion and assault. An equally central value is that we must not judge each other on the basis of opinion or strong feeling rather than evidence of actual conduct."
Richard Brodhead,"In times like these, let us remember that justice is served in the courtroom, not in the media or at the hands of individuals."
Richard Brodhead,"And he taught all of us who know anything about the history of this place most of what we know,"
Richard Brodhead,"[Duke] wrote of his wish to support a form of education 'conducted along sane and practical lines,'  ... He goes on to specify that he means 'sane and practical as opposed to dogmatic and theoretical.' At first hearing you might have thought he meant sane and practical as opposed to insane and impractical, or kooky and clueless."
Richard Brodhead,"She was once described as an action verb disguised as a person,"
Harold Brodkey,"I have thousands of opinions still, but that is down from millions, and as always, I know nothing."
Harold Brodkey,"Athletes have studied how to leap and how to survive the leap some of the time and return to the ground. They don't always do it well. But they are our philosophers of actual moments and the body and soul in them, and of our maneuvers in our emergencies and longings."
Harold Brodkey,"His brutish explosions of anger, his displays of vanity on stage were seen by pretentious and unpretentious reviewers alike as having an immediacy new to the theater."
Harold Brodkey,"True stories, autobiographical stories, like some novels, begin long ago, before the acts in the account, before the birth of some of the people in the tale."
Harold Brodkey,"This identity, this mind, this particular cast of speech, is nearly over."
Harold Brodkey,"Memory, so complete and clear or so evasive, has to be ended, has to be put aside, as if one were leaving a chapel and bringing the prayer to an end in one's head."
Harold Brodkey,"Me, my literary reputation is mostly abroad, but I am anchored here in New York. I can't think of any other place I'd rather die than here."
Harold Brodkey,"It is like visiting one's funeral, like visiting loss in its purest and most monumental form, this wild darkness, which is not only unknown but which one cannot enter as oneself."
Harold Brodkey,"It bothers me that I won't live to see the end of the century, because, when I was young, in St. Louis, I remember saying to Marilyn, my sister by adoption, that that was how long I wanted to live: seventy years."
Harold Brodkey,"In New York one lives in the moment rather more than Socrates advised, so that at a party or alone in your room it will always be difficult to guess at the long term worth of anything."
Harold Brodkey,"If you like to read, sometimes it's interesting just to go and see what the reality is, of the word, of the seedy or not so seedy fiction writer, the drunk or sober poet... Sometimes you can go looking for illumination."
Harold Brodkey,"I was always crazy about New York, dependent on it, scared of it - well, it is dangerous - but beyond that there was the pressure of being young and of not yet having done work you really liked, trademark work, breakthrough work."
Harold Brodkey,"I look upon another's insistence on the merits of his or her life - duties, intellect, accomplishment - and see that most of it is nonsense."
Harold Brodkey,"I have thousands of opinions still - but that is down from millions - and, as always, I know nothing."
Harold Brodkey,I feel sorry for the man who marries you... because everyone thinks you're sweet and you're not.
Harold Brodkey,"I can't change the past, and I don't think I would. I don't expect to be understood. I like what I've written, the stories and two novels. If I had to give up what I've written in order to be clear of this disease, I wouldn't do it."
Harold Brodkey,"I awake with a not entirely sickened knowledge that I am merely young again and in a funny way at peace, an observer who is aware of time's chariot, aware that some metamorphosis has occurred."
Harold Brodkey,"I am sensible of the velocity of the moments, and entering that part of my head alert to the motion of the world I am aware that life was never perfect, never absolute. This bestows contentment, even a fearlessness."
Harold Brodkey,"I am in an adolescence in reverse, as mysterious as the first, except that this time I feel it as a decay of the odds that I might live for a while, that I can sleep it off."
Harold Brodkey,"Being ill like this combines shock - this time I will die - with a pain and agony that are unfamiliar, that wrench me out of myself."
Harold Brodkey,Almost the first thing I did when I became ill was to buy a truly good television set.
Harold Brodkey,"Public radio is alive and kicking, it always has been."
Adrien Brody,But you pick yourself up. The advantage of being a bigger name is it costs them too much money to cut you out of a movie.
Adrien Brody,Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind.
Adrien Brody,"This has been an amazing, amazing journey,"
Adrien Brody,"Of course I think it's relevant to what is happening today, ... We experience a lot of oppressive forces and we're powerless to a certain extent."
Adrien Brody,"I'm sure it would be fun annihilating all my enemies too. I'm not really drawn to that, but as a character I can see it being a lot of fun."
Tom Brokaw,"As I walked the beaches with the American veterans who had returned for this anniversary, men in their sixties and seventies, and listened to their stories, I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done,"
Tom Brokaw,"While attendance at traditional churches has been declining for decades... the evangelical movement is growing, and it is changing the way America worships."
Tom Brokaw,"What we have to do is put this in a coherent form for them at the end of the day, and on the big events, give them the kind of context that they deserve."
Tom Brokaw,What I think is that Fox has done a very smart job of carving out their place.
Tom Brokaw,"There has been some research, by the way, that shows that, as people are coming up into their parenting ages, they gravitate back to the evening news."
Tom Brokaw,"Speaking generally, people who are drawn to journalism are interested in what happens from the ground up less than they are from the top down."
Tom Brokaw,"Peter, of the three of us, was our prince. He seemed so timeless. He had such elan and style."
Tom Brokaw,Our obligation at the network is where do we fit into that and how can we best capitalize on that to make sure that our piece of that remains important to those young people.
Tom Brokaw,I'm not going to sit on the porch of the old anchorman's home with a drool cup.
Tom Brokaw,"I think they are paying a lot more attention to news now, by the way, in part because of national-security issues. A lot of young people have friends or family in the military today."
Tom Brokaw,"David Brinkley was an icon of modern broadcast journalism, a brilliant writer who could say in a few words what the country needed to hear during times of crisis, tragedy and triumph."
Tom Brokaw,Cable penetrates 70 percent of American audiences now.
Tom Brokaw,The response to 'The Greatest Generation' and the books that followed has been one of the most satisfying experiences of my life.
Tom Brokaw,"It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced."
Tom Brokaw,Judy Miller is the most innocent person in this case. I really thought that was outrageous that she was jailed and we needed as journalists to draw a line in the sand in a strong but thoughtful way.
Tom Brokaw,TV is a fickle business. I'm only good for the length of my contract.
Tom Brokaw,Peter will have a place in this brotherhood forever.
Tom Brokaw,"It's all storytelling, you know. That's what journalism is all about."
Tom Brokaw,"Peter is an old friend. I'm heartbroken, but he's also a tough guy. I'm counting on him getting through this very difficult passage."
Tom Brokaw,"We all made each other better at what we do. And we had a common DNA, if you will: We were all reporters first and anchors second."
Tom Brokaw,Don't overstate Fox News. It's still much smaller than the least of the network niches.
Tom Brokaw,"It makes it all the more poignant because of the absence of our colleague Peter Jennings. We had hoped that he would be here tonight so we could have a reunion, a celebration."
Tom Brokaw,You are educated. Your certification is in your degree. You may think of it as the ticket to the good life. Let me ask you to think of an alternative. Think of it as your ticket to change the world.
Tom Brokaw,It's easy to make a buck. It's a lot tougher to make a difference.
Anita Brookner,Romanticism is not just a mode; it literally eats into every life. Women will never get rid of just waiting for the right man.
Anita Brookner,I was brought up among the sort of self-important women who had a husband as one has an alibi
Anita Brookner,"Life... is not simply a series of exciting new ventures. The future is not always a whole new ball game. There tends to be unfinished business. One trails all sorts of things around with one, things that simply won't be got rid of."
Anita Brookner,Time misspent in youth is sometimes all the freedom one ever has.
Anita Brookner,"In real life, it is the hare who wins. Every time. Look around you. And in any case it is my contention that Aesop was writing for the tortoise market. Hares have no time to read. They are too busy winning the game."
Anita Brookner,"In real life, of course, it is the hare that wins. Every time. Look around you."
Anita Brookner,"No blame should attach to telling the truth. But it does, it does."
Anita Brookner,"There are moments when you feel free, moments when you have energy, moments when you have hope, but you can't rely on any of these things to see you through. Circumstances do that."
Anita Brookner,Great writers are the saints for the godless.
Anita Brookner,"It will be a pity if women in the more conventional mould are to be phased out, for there will never be anyone to go home to."
Anita Brookner,Writing novels preserves you in a state of innocence - a lot passes you by - simply because your attention is otherwise diverted.
Anita Brookner,Old men should have more care to end life well than to live long.
Anita Brookner,You have no idea how promising the world begins to look once you have decided to have it all for yourself. And how much healthier your decisions are once they become entirely selfish.
Anita Brookner,"A complete woman is probably not a very admirable creature. She is manipulative, uses other people to get her own way, and works within whatever system she is in."
Anita Brookner,It is my contention that Aesop was writing for the tortoise market. hares have no time to read.
Anita Brookner,"Like many rich men, he thought in anecdotes; like many simple women, she thought in terms of biography."
Anita Brookner,What is interesting about self-analysis is that it leads nowhere - it is an art form in itself.
Anita Brookner,Good women always think it is their fault when someone else is being offensive. Bad women never take the blame for anything.
Anita Brookner,"All good fortune is a gift of the gods, and you don't win the favor of the ancient gods by being good, but by being bold."
Anita Brookner,You never know what you will learn till you start writing. Then you discover truths you never knew existed.
Anita Brookner,A man of such obvious and exemplary charm must be a liar.
Anita Brookner,"Real love is a pilgrimage. It happens when there is no strategy, but it is very rare because most people are strategists."
Anita Brookner,The lessons taught in great books are misleading. The commerce in life is rarely so simple and never so just.
Anita Brookner,"The essence of romantic love is that wonderful beginning, after which sadness and impossibility may become the rule."
Anita Brookner,Accountability in friendship is the equivalent of love without strategy.
Aaron Brooks,The traveling has taken a toll on us. [Sunday] we felt great because we didn't travel.
Aaron Brooks,"Sometimes we got caught up into the hype that we are a running team, and that would cause us to do a lot of stuff. Now we're looking at playing smart and taking what's available."
Aaron Brooks,Extremely embarrassed. We were questioning our pride.
Aaron Brooks,"Ray Lewis, Ed Reed â€” you look at what they accomplished last year and it's a great opportunity for us. I'm just looking forward to going out there against those guys."
Aaron Brooks,"I had my house phone always forwarding to my cell phone, anyway, ... I thought: Eliminate the middle man, which is my house phone."
Aaron Brooks,"In the back of our minds, we know we have to give them one tiny bit of hope."
Aaron Brooks,I hope not. We're going to come back strong. We have to look forward to the next game. ... Hopefully we'll finally be settled into our routine there in San Antonio. That will help out a lot.
Aaron Brooks,"Unfortunately, it's our new home, temporarily, ... We're going to have to accept that and be as comfortable as possible and get into a normal schedule for the regular season."
Aaron Brooks,Traveling out here was uncalled for. Try not to patronize us next time and tell us it's a home game. But those were the circumstances and we lost.
Aaron Brooks,"Try not to patronize us next time, ... and fly us out to New York and say it's a home game."
Aaron Brooks,"Try not to patronize us next time, traveling us to New York, saying we're playing a home game."
Aaron Brooks,"Try not to patronise us the next time we come to New York for a home game, but those were the circumstances."
Aaron Brooks,"It's not a home game when you have to [travel] four hours,"
Aaron Brooks,"We're definitely giving away games. (It) definitely is a matter of finishing, but we've got to not put ourselves in the situation."
Aaron Brooks,"It's not the game,"
Aaron Brooks,"The two games we won, we played mistake-free football,"
Aaron Brooks,"It is shocking for any team. I mean this is the NFL. The parity that is around the football league, most games are close. They pretty much dominated on both sides of the ball."
Aaron Brooks,"It is shocking for any team, ... I mean this is the NFL. The parity that is around the football league, most games are close. They pretty much dominated on both sides of the ball."
Aaron Brooks,"Any time they've got No. 4 on their football team, anything can happen. They could have an eight-game winning streak from here on out, so I'm not really too concerned about that. I'm only concerned about us as a football team going up there and trying to get a victory."
Aaron Brooks,"As a football team, we're not looking for any handouts. We'll band together as a team. We want to go out there and shed a lot of blood, sweat and tears. We want to make our people proud of us. We feel like that is our civic duty."
Aaron Brooks,"As a football team, we're not looking for any handouts, ... We know it's going to be difficult, we know it's going to be hard. We're going to be fine and we're not going to use this as a crutch and say, 'Feel sorry for us and let us win this football game.' We're going to remain true to ourselves, stay as one as a football team."
Aaron Brooks,I don't know what it was. We just definitely didn't match their intensity. They had a lot more fire than we did.
Aaron Brooks,We expect to get the job done. There won't be any excuses being made.
Aaron Brooks,"I doubt very seriously I will be a New Orleans Saint again, so I can look forward to moving on."
Aaron Brooks,"Actually Malik (Hairston) called the meeting. It started as a conversation, then it got kind of heated, so they called everybody over. We just questioned everybody's heart."
Aaron Brooks,"It started as a conversation, a couple of guys over at the house. It started as a conversation, but then it got kind of heated, and we called everybody over and we had a meeting about it."
Aaron Brooks,Coach is very frustrated. And he should be.
Aaron Brooks,Just about everywhere we go a hurricane hits. You just can't believe it. ... It's like a black cloud. We may not be able to play in Baton Rouge if it hits like that.
Aaron Brooks,It's a new beginning for us.
Aaron Brooks,That was a great rebound. His basketball IQ is great. That was one where we knew we had the game.
Charles Brooks,Beautiful. It makes me want to cry.
Charles Brooks,"She's going to run into some tough girls up there. She'll be ready though, because she's been there before."
Charles Brooks,"I was very shocked at that. If there's trouble, he's the head coach. Who is supposed to stem it?"
Charles Brooks,"I couldn't believe it. The firefighters came out and they were holding Brandy in a blanket, like a baby."
Charles Brooks,She can drive you crazy with that desire to be a perfect athlete.
Derrick Brooks,I just had to smile at him. And he smiled back at me.
Derrick Brooks,"We are in second place, one game back. But we're by no means out of it. I guess it's a little down because of the way we lost. It appears we got dominated. ... It could be a whole lot worse than where we are at."
Derrick Brooks,"Our field-goal team has really stepped up to the plate and answered all the criticism that they had. Closing out games, whether it's kicking offense or defense, that's something that we haven't done well in the past two seasons and that's something we've done well this year. Obviously, it's the difference in three or four wins."
Derrick Brooks,"We'd share a conversation, make sure he's OK. What with Tony being in Indianapolis, if he needed someone to talk to or just hang around, he had my phone number."
Herb Brooks,You're playing worse and worse every day and right now you're playing like it's next month.
Herb Brooks,"We should be dreaming. We grew up as kids having dreams, but now we're too sophisticated as adults, as a nation. We stopped dreaming. We should always have dreams."
Herb Brooks,Maybe I'm sort of like the players - there's still a lot of little boy in me.
Herb Brooks,"Everything goes in cycles, to a degree."
Herb Brooks,Great moments are born from great oppurtunities.
Herb Brooks,This is your moment. You're meant to be here.
Herb Brooks,"You're looking for players whose name on the front of the sweater is more important than the one on the back. I look for these players to play hard, to play smart and to represent their country."
Herb Brooks,"If I'd have went on the ice when this thing happened, someone would have speared me or something. It's a great feeling of accomplishment and pride. They had to do it; it was their moment."
Herb Brooks,I'm a dreamer.
Herb Brooks,"You know, Willie Wonka said it best: we are the makers of dreams, the dreamers of dreams."
Kix Brooks,That's just a part of your soul. I couldn't be complacent about that no matter how much I wanted to. Sometimes thinking I have to write songs for an album feels like I have to study for an exam. Then as soon as I start writing I remember how much I love the process. We both do.
Kix Brooks,"They asked us last night if we'd be interested in doing some more shows with them, and we said, 'Yeah.' So we're just kinda looking at all the options right now. It would be fun to do some more shows with them. We're just trying to see how our schedules work out."
Kix Brooks,"We've got our friends in the world of sports,"
Kix Brooks,"He gave us a lot of freedom, and he has a lot of respect for what we do."
Kix Brooks,"They haven't come up with the force of nature that can stop us. Because we live to play, and no matter what it takes, we WILL find a way to make it happen. It may not be according to the original plan, but we don't care... we just wanna get out there and shake it up."
Kix Brooks,"When they said they wanted to experience it, I thought, 'Come on.... We're gonna show you a real good time!' And they gave me almost a whole day, so they sure did get a lot of ground covered...I don't know how often they have to go 4-wheeling or climb trees to do what they do, but that day, they did. Thank heavens those guys are athletic and have a sense of humor, 'cause we tore it up."
Kix Brooks,"We were influenced by classic country acts like Merle Haggard and George Jones and Hank Williams but also by Clapton and the Stones and all the rock acts like that. I mean, what guitar player didn't start out with 'Satisfaction'?"
Phillip Brooks,"O little town of Bethlehem, How still we see thee lie; Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by"
Phillip Brooks,A prayer in its simplest definition is merely a wish turned Godward.
Phillip Brooks,Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men! Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for power equal to your tasks.
Phillip Brooks,It does not take great men to do great things; it only takes consecrated men
Phillip Brooks,"A man who lives right, and is right, has more power in his silence than another has by his words."
Phillip Brooks,"As you emphasize your life, you must localize and define it... you cannot do everything."
Phillip Brooks,"The best advisers, helpers and friends, always are not those who tell us how to act in special cases, but who give us, out of themselves, the ardent spirit and desire to act right, and leave us then, even through many blunders, to find out what our own form of right action is."
Rich Brooks,"That's what happens when you get Jacob Tamme at tight end. All of a sudden, those other guys don't get quite as many snaps."
Rich Brooks,"Now I don't have to worry about which side of the ball is doing real well now because now it's going to be Louisville, ... So both sides of the ball have to do well."
Rich Brooks,"Hopefully, we'll get in some good fundamental work and get some guys healthy. We've got some guys that need to freshen up."
Rich Brooks,"Tim will get more comfortable, ... He's a great talent, but he's a freshman. He'll be a good punter, and he'll learn from it. He was nervous, and I can't say that I blame him. I was nervous, too."
Rich Brooks,"I was extremely pleased with the way our guys are running around, how physical we are and how we're hitting people."
Rich Brooks,"Running backs take a beating because the guys chasing them are bigger, stronger and faster than at any time in the history of the game. I'd love to have a guy you can hand the ball 25 times a game and he'd always get 100 yards, but that's not an easy thing these days."
Rich Brooks,"It would be nice to see John step up, ... This is a great opportunity for him. If he's ever going to do it, this is a chance for him to rise to the occasion."
Rich Brooks,I think it gives both schools an opportunity to go out and play someone different.
Rich Brooks,"Roger made plays all fall camp and has earned the opportunity,"
Rich Brooks,"The last play was not a great call, but we wanted him to get that opportunity to catch the ball. In another four to five days, that pass will be incomplete because Ravi will go up and knock it away. He has the ability to help this team. We'll just see how it all shakes out."
Rich Brooks,"It's probably pretty well-timed. From a physical standpoint, it's a good opportunity to get people freshened up."
Rich Brooks,"We're trying to sell him. He's got to make up his mind if he wants to pursue this, and I hope he does because I think with his size and hand-eye coordination he could help. The learning curve will be fast, but I think he can pick it up pretty fast."
Rich Brooks,The learning curve is going to be fast.
Rich Brooks,"I've had other guys try to influence recruits, but never as demonstratively as Micah. He didn't want to be the only top recruit ... he wanted to get us some help down here."
Rich Brooks,I only hope we can learn from this game and get better.
Rich Brooks,I hope he's really wild on Sept. 4.
Rich Brooks,That (the 9-1 mark) doesn't mean anything this week. The history of the series is something people need to write stories about or talk about (on the radio). It doesn't really have anything to do with the game.
Rich Brooks,"He really did halfway decent for a guy with three days of practice, ... Based on our health at that position, I would expect Eric's snaps to go up this week."
Rich Brooks,"He really did halfway decent for a guy with three days of practice. Based on our health at that position, I would expect Eric's snaps to go up this week."
Rich Brooks,"Those are the type of lengths that build resentment, hatred and passion."
Rich Brooks,"At Oregon, we were on the quarter system and didn't start school until September, so we'd play three games before school started. One year, I lost a game at Ohio State and went back to two-a-days the next week. You can't do that anymore. You used to be able to outwork somebody in preparing for a game, but now everybody's limited to the same amount of time."
Rich Brooks,"The momentum will really get going when we start winning games. I think we've turned the corner, but we've got to get to the straightaway and accelerate."
Rich Brooks,"it would have been a lot more interesting game, and you never know what can happen."
Rich Brooks,"They do a good job with the quarterback run game and with the option, ... Somebody once told me that you couldn't win in the SEC with the option, but doggone it, somebody's doing it and they're doing it pretty well."
Rich Brooks,"We have to show a marked improvement in the next two weeks, in my opinion, throwing the football."
Rich Brooks,"I still feel very good about our team. I still think we're going to be a much-improved football team, ... We can talk about it all we want. Now we have to go out and prove it."
Rich Brooks,He just decided he wanted to give football a fair shot. He missed it quite a bit and I think he liked the idea of playing with his brother.
Rich Brooks,"The last six years I was (at Oregon), we were a very good football team, and since then they have only had one losing season, ... The continuity there is what turned Oregon into a consistent winner. It was nice to see that and reaffirm that we actually did know what we were doing. We did have a plan that worked and were given the time to implement that."
Rich Brooks,"That was a different football team than this year mentally,"
Rich Brooks,"Bo played a great football game, ... He tackled, he covered, he played his heart out. I'd like more of (the tackles) not to get to him, but it's good when he's flying around and getting to the football, and not only did he tackle, he put some hits on people."
Rich Brooks,He's got to make some decisions about his life about how much he wants to put into football and getting an education.
Rich Brooks,"The last six years I was there we were a very good football team and since then they have only had one losing season,"
Rich Brooks,"We can't have a quarterback fumble the ball three times and expect to beat anybody. You don't fumble a football, that's the bottom line. But I'm going to give him a lot of credit for making some great throws too, doing some great things."
Rich Brooks,We tried to talk him out of (quitting football). He did some real good things and I think he would have done well on the football field.
Rich Brooks,"He played a great football game. He tackled, he covered. He played his heart out. I would like more of them (opposing players) not to get to him, particularly in the running game, but it is good when he's flying around and getting to the ball. Not only did he tackle, but he put hits on people and was a very physical corner. We need that."
Rich Brooks,"I can coach football. My coaches can coach football,"
Rich Brooks,He's a program guy. He's our 'Rudy.' I'm just thrilled he got the opportunity to experience something like that in an SEC football game.
Rich Brooks,"I'm going to see the draw play in my dreams for the next three weeks, ... Everybody in the stadium knew it was coming, and we still couldn't stop it."
Rich Brooks,"The defense continues to fly around and be physical, but you've got to be able to score when you have the ball like that."
Rich Brooks,"I can't deal in speculation, ... That's out of my control. All I can do is try to make sure we have a better football team. I think we will be improved. As to how that translates into wins, I don't know."
Rich Brooks,"At this point, am I concerned? You bet I am. Am I totally alarmed and shaken and (losing) confidence in him? Absolutely not."
Rich Brooks,This is the best competition we've had since I've been here. We just need a guy who will make plays in crunch time.
Rich Brooks,Make no mistake about it -- it's a very serious competition and a close one.
Rich Brooks,"Vanderbilt and us are in probably the toughest six-team division (SEC East) in college football. It makes it very difficult to have a breakthrough year. Stanford, by and large, doesn't have as large a hill to climb."
Rich Brooks,"We wanted to sign two quarterbacks last year and didn't. Since I've been here, we didn't have choices at quarterback. Now we have choices ... I'm excited to have a quarterback roster that looks like an SEC quarterback roster, instead of one semi-experienced guy and a freshman, then a bunch of walk-ons."
Rich Brooks,We need to see how adversity is dealt with as a team. I hope they have the resolve to roll up their sleeves and get it done.
Rich Brooks,It's great to have Aaron back in school. During his absence he's gained strength and weight (now weighs 298 pounds). He will bring intense competition to the left tackle position during spring practice.
Rich Brooks,Maurice gives us an option as a big back with athletic ability who also has good receiving skills. His basketball success in high school indicates his great athletic ability.
Rich Brooks,"He has the ability to come out and help us. We had to sell him. He's an athlete, he's got size."
Rich Brooks,I think Ravi has the ability to come out and help us. We'll see what happens.
Rich Brooks,"We are thrilled to get a guy like Will, who has a strong arm and outstanding athletic ability. For a quarterback to graduate early and come in for winter conditioning and spring practice is a huge advantage."
Richard Brooks,Don is really the reason we're here. He's got a gigantic heart. He said he was going to get us in a place and he did.
Richard Brooks,I've lost loved ones and friends that have died out there for unknown respiratory problems.
Richard Brooks,It's unbelievable. I believe when the door closes I'm going to be on the other side of the door.
Terry Brooks,"When I was a kid, we had to rely on our imaginations for entertainment."
Terry Brooks,"What is interesting to me is how the characters respond, how they change and grow by facing what often seem overwhelming difficulties."
Terry Brooks,I haven't made up my mind about doing anymore Landover books.
Terry Brooks,"I didn't want readers to have to make allowances for what they couldn't see, but to be able to say to themselves that the fabric of the magic detailed was perfectly believable."
Terry Brooks,Fantasy is the only canvas large enough for me to paint on.
Terry Brooks,"Even after Sword was published, I was still only thinking about the next book, Elfstones."
Terry Brooks,But I am the same storyteller as always.
Terry Brooks,A world in which elves exist and magic works offers greater opportunities to digress and explore.
Terry Brooks,"Hurt leads to bitterness, bitterness to anger, travel too far that road and the way is lost."
Terry Brooks,"Growing up, I didn't have a lot of toys, and personal entertainment depended on individual ingenuity and imagination - think up a story and go live it for an afternoon."
Pierce Brosnan,This man called President Bush has a lot to answer for. I don't know if this man is really taking care of America. This government has been shameful.

Dr. Brothers,"I think we should follow a simple rule: if we can take the worst, take the risk."
Dr. Brothers,"Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success."
Dr. Brothers,"Donâ€™t fool yourself that you are going to have it all. You are not. Psychologically, having it all is not even a valid concept. The marvelous thing about human beings is that we are perpetually reachingfor the stars. The more we have, the more we want. And for this reason, we never have it all."
Dr. Brothers,"The person interested in success has to learn to view failure as a healthy, inevitable part of the process of getting to the top.  - (Diane Bauer)"

Dr. Brothers,"A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success."
Dr. Brothers,"Accept that all of us can be hurt, that all of us can and surely will at times fail. Other vulnerabilities, like being embarrassed or risking love, can be terrifying, too. I think we should follow a simple rule: if we can take the worst, take the risk."
Dr. Brothers,"Listening, not imitation, may be the sincerest form of flattery."
Dr. Brothers,Love comes when manipulation stops; when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you. When you dare to reveal yourself fully. When you dare to be vulnerable.
Dr. Brothers,"Being taken for granted can be a compliment. It means that you've become a comfortable, trusted element in another person's life."
Dr. Brothers,The best proof of love is trust.
Dr. Brothers,"If Shakespeare had to go on an author tour to promote Romeo and Juliet, he never would have written Macbeth."
Dr. Brothers,I don't give advice. I can't tell anybody what to do. Instead I say this is what we know about this problem at this time. And here are the consequences of these actions.
Dr. Brothers,"An individual's self-concept is the core of his personality. It affects every aspect of human behavior: the ability to learn, the capacity to grow and change. A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success in life."

Earl Browder,This radical transformation of world power relationships reflects primarily in the case of both the USA and the USSR the growth of the productive forces.
Earl Browder,"The social system grows rigid but the productive forces continue to expand, and conflict ensues between the forces of production and the social conditions of production."
Earl Browder,The American Communists had thrived as champions of domestic reform.
Earl Browder,"Such hopes are, however, tempered by years of disillusioning memories, which remind us all that it takes two sides to make a peace."
Earl Browder,"But I made no efforts to organize my supporters to hold on to the apparatus. Consequently I was soon expelled and my followers, who did not change coats overnight, quietly left or were expelled from the party."
Earl Browder,"Because capitalist society has expanded the productive forces so enormously, the social conditions under which it arose lag behind and become fetters holding back the further growth of productive forces."
Adam Brown,"We had a big rally on Friday, so any weakness this morning is basically the market trying to unwind some of the strength from Friday."

Adam Brown,"As an individual investor, you're basically lending to the government for an additional 30 years compared to the 10-year note, but getting no extra risk premium. That being said, there will be structural demand for the new bond."
Adam Brown,"The language will give you an insight into whether there has been a shift in their feelings on the economy and on rates, or whether they feel they are getting to a reasonable level and they want to give themselves more flexibility."

Alton Brown,"I started cooking in college to get girls, ... I was pathetic. Girls didn't want to go out with me. But I found that if I offered to cook for a girl, there was more of a chance that she'd say yes."
Alton Brown,"Well, Food Network has complete control, since they own everything. But the way I like to put it is this: If you don't like Good Eats, it's my fault."
Alton Brown,"The problem is I am both a procrastinator and a power junkie, so I am very frustrating to work with."
Alton Brown,Take ice. Ice is fascinating to me. Ice is the one thing in our world that went from an agricultural product to being manufactured.
Alton Brown,So I quit my job and went to the New England Culinary Institute for the full two years and worked in the restaurant industry after that until finally I thought I had a grasp on what I needed to do what I do.
Alton Brown,"Seriously. I'm not very bright, and it takes a lot for me to get a concept - to really get a concept. To get it enough that it becomes part of me. But when it happens I get real excited about it."
Alton Brown,Recipe writers hate to write about heat. They despise it. Because there aren't proper words for communicating what should be done with it.
Alton Brown,My feeling has always been that Good Eats would have never happened had it been left to a committee.
Alton Brown,"My college degree was in theater. But the real reason, if I have any success in that milieu, so to speak, is because I spent a lot of years directing, I spent a lot of years behind the camera."
Alton Brown,"Last year, I made a refrigerator in my basement. And I needed to because I needed to figure how - you know there is no such thing as cold. There is only less heat."
Alton Brown,"It's not perfect by any means, but I do think I wrote a pretty good argument for it being better than shoving your hand over the fire."
Alton Brown,"In the end the French chef that nearly killed me became one of my best friends, and she could never quite understand how that happened."
Alton Brown,"I'm going from doing all of the work to having to delegate the work - which is almost harder for me than doing the work myself. I'm a lousy delegator, but I'm learning."
Alton Brown,"I love to have battles of the wits with people that can dish fast and dirty - and it leads to problems occasionally, 'cause I can sound mean without attempting to be mean."
Alton Brown,I love poking fun at myself. I have a rather mean sense of humor.
Alton Brown,"I looked for a very long time, knowing that it had to happen, but it took me a long time to find someone with the same background and whatnot and I finally found him."
Alton Brown,I like television. I still believe that television is the most powerful form of communication on Earth - I just hate what is being done with it.
Alton Brown,"I kept thinking, 'Somebody has to make a food show that is actually educational and entertaining at the same time... a show that got down to the 'why things happen.' Plus, I hated my job - I didn't think it was very worthwhile."
Alton Brown,"I have nothing but sympathy for the people who are forced to work with me. I'm better now at picking out those that want to play that game with me, and those that don't."
Alton Brown,I had kicked around the idea for Good Eats when I was directing commercials.
Alton Brown,I can't talk about anything or write about anything if I don't understand it. So a lot of the stuff that I go through and a lot of the time that I spend is understanding.
Alton Brown,"For me, it was kind of like going into the military or something. And anybody - any male - who has ever worked in a French kitchen knows what I am talking about when I say that."
Alton Brown,Enough people have now mentioned Bill Nye the Science Guy to me that I now desperately avoid it all costs.
Alton Brown,"Although I don't take myself very seriously, I do take my work extraordinarily seriously."
Alton Brown,"A lot of food shows need only to tempt. Some food shows only need to inspire, to empower. And there are a lot of shows that do that."
Alton Brown,"My first book is really about heat. That book, for me, was an exploration of heat as ingredient. Why we don't talk about heat as an ingredient, I don't quite understand, because it is the common ingredient to all cooking processes."
Bruce Brown,I liked running here a lot. I felt like I was generating a lot more momentum on this track. It's too bad I can't come back next year.
Bruce Brown,"The goal of today's event is to get people to think about public policy and for what it's worth, that's the goal of the League of Women's Voters. To be aware of what's going on, to go vote, to when you get in there, to know what you're voting for."
Bruce Brown,I'm living in the middle of a nightmare.

Dale Brown,"I was greedy, vain, selfish and took bad advice from financial professionals I trusted."
Dale Brown,I think that's the advantage to us in selling lottery tickets. We're sitting here close to the Arkansas line and we have a lot of people that come into Oklahoma from other states.

Dr. Brown,Our study found that aspirin treatment was associated with a 24 percent reduction in the risk of the most common type of stroke in women and a 32 percent reduction in heart attacks in men.
Dr. Brown,"In both men and women, there was an approximately 70 percent increase in the risk of bleeding associated with the taking of aspirin. And it is known that the bleeding risk associated with aspirin is dose-related."
Dr. Brown,"Aspirin prevents the blood in the body from clotting, and because stroke and heart attack are both caused by the formation of blood clots in the body, anything that prevents blood clotting from forming would be expected to have a beneficial effect in those diseases."
Dr. Brown,"In other words, 81 milligrams a day gives as much benefit as higher doses with potentially less risk of bleeding."
Eric Brown,"The music is really bigger than us, because it did have an impact on people. This is something we can have forever. It doesn't have to be the same struggling band situation, which is hard to maintain."
Eric Brown,"Well, to be honest I think I'm a better short story writer than a novelist. Novels I find very hard, hours and hours, weeks and weeks, of conscious thought - whereas short stories slip out painlessly in a few days."
Eric Brown,"I think it's a short story writer's duty, as well as writing well about emotions and characters, to write story."
Eric Brown,The boys are playing pretty well. Our strength is probably our line play and we have some quality backs. It's just a fun group of kids to coach. They seem to know what it takes to win.

George Brown,So we're going to be looking into our legal options.
George Brown,What this is about is not the money. It's about their integrity.

Gilbert Brown,"I'm so happy for Jerome because he was just another inner-city kid like the rest of us, but he made it big without big-timing people. He's living every little leaguer's dream of playing in the Super Bowl, and to do it in his hometown is just unbelievable."

Gordon Brown,"If 2005 was the year of commitments, 2006 must be the year of delivery. That's why, when the G8 finance ministers meet in Moscow in only a few days time, I will put on the agenda how we can meet the commitments to fund this specific plan."
Gordon Brown,"We had a discussion of what we at this historic time could as European Union finance ministers do to improve that process in peace and development,"
Gordon Brown,"This is not a time for timidity, ... Nor is it a time to fear reaching too high. This year, the year of the U.N. special summit as well as the year of Britain's G8 presidency in Gleneagles, is our chance to help reverse the fortunes of a continent, and it is our opportunity to help transform the lives of millions."
Gordon Brown,"I think you've seen that ministers around the world have been affected by the strength of public opinion, churches, faith groups, and it does have an impact."
Gordon Brown,"The initiative launched today is about delivering one of the great rights, the right of education."
Gordon Brown,"The fundamentals of the world economy are sound, low inflation, relatively stable and sound finances in the major industrial countries, and an ability to build from that so that the future is one that we can face with confidence."

Gordon Brown,I don't think anybody should be in any doubt that not only will the reforms continue but in future years they are going to have to be intensified.
Gordon Brown,Our financial discipline has made extra resources available.
Gordon Brown,"I think to design for a grand total less than 300 would be impractical, ... We could fill a smaller facility up within months if the judges start sentencing the way they need to and should Å  We would be overcrowded within days of opening a new facility, and it's pointless to spend all of this money and be right back where we started."
Gordon Brown,"What we've already got is the 100 percent debt write-off for the poorest countries. It's already achieved, we've won it. We've got a doubling of aid from Europe that's to build schools and hospitals, particularly in Africa. That's already agreed. The next stage, over the next few days, is to see if we can go further."
Gordon Brown,"You are our great sporting heroes, you're legends of sport in our time, we owe you an incredible debt of gratitude for what you've achieved."
Gordon Brown,"We need to make our economy more pro-competition and pro-enterprise. Wherever there are barriers to companies, we will remove them."
Gordon Brown,"If 2005 was the year of commitments, 2006 must be the year of delivery. That's why, when the (Group of Eight) finance ministers meet in Moscow in only a few days time, I will put on the agenda how we can meet the commitments to fund this specific plan."
Gordon Brown,A world class economy will need world class education - and that means continuing to reform our schools.
Gordon Brown,"For we can now understand why it was that a man true to his conscience, in circumstances of such controversy, leave government in a way that not only manifested an absence of rancor but won applause, not just from those who agreed with him but those who disagreed with him."
Gordon Brown,"I'm hoping to that we can add Sweden, South Africa, China, Australia, Canada."
Gordon Brown,I sense a new spirit in Britain: that the people of Britain want this massive demonstration of generosity to be given enduring purpose.
Gordon Brown,"We can find common qualities and common values that have made Britain the country it is. Our belief in tolerance and liberty which shines through British history. Our commitment to fairness, fair play and civic duty."
Gordon Brown,"In our view, if we are to avoid the disappointments of Seattle and Cancun, then Europe and America must move together and Europe should lead the way in rejecting agricultural protectionism,"
Gordon Brown,"I think Europe has got to face up with America to the fact that protectionist policies are not only damaging the world economy, but damaging in the long run the European and American economies,"
Gordon Brown,"America knows it has got to deal with its deficit problems so that it, too, can promise it is making its proper and best contributions to the world economy."
Gordon Brown,"Europe and America should go to Hong Kong with a common position that by 2010 we will eliminate export subsidies, we will reduce the tariffs that are being charged and we will open our markets finally to developing countries,"
Gordon Brown,"What is gained by debt relief and aid can be lost if we don't get a proper trade agreement in Hong Kong,"
Gordon Brown,I am delighted that Dr. Greenspan has agreed to be honorary adviser. His advice on issues relating to global economic change will be much appreciated.
Gordon Brown,"It is absolutely critical that we take the actions having agreed that action is necessary,"
Gordon Brown,I believe the monetary authorities have sought to take action to head off the possibility of higher inflation over the course of the next two years.
Gordon Brown,"The first action we must take is to tackle the cause of the problem, ensuring concerted global action is taken to bring down world oil prices and stabilize the market for the long term."

Harry Brown,"I'm not sure of any direct influence, but some of my most successful poems are short poems. They have kind of a distilled focus, like Dickinson. They're very elliptical. She is quite elliptical - she distills down to the core. But my poetry doesn't sound like Dickinson's."
Harry Brown,"I thought it was like a gift from God. I hate that we had the disaster, but it gave us some joy."
Harry Brown,"We came down to see the steam cars and there were more than just steam cars, but old gasoline-powered cars and a replica of the Stanley Steamer that set the record 100 years ago."
Hubie Brown,"It's all the doors that are open to you by management and athletic directors, ... In coaching, it's your staff and players who make it happen. In TV and with clinics, it's the opportunities that are open to you. TV is a team game also with the play-by-play guy, the producer and the director."
Hubie Brown,"He's really a major addition. He's playing extremely well, blending into the chemistry. We're learning where to play him and how to play him."
Hubie Brown,This is a tremendous honor because I'm stepping into this class with three coaches that I have the greatest respect for. They are coaches' coaches.
Ian Brown,In a way it's good not to be Christmas number one because people would see the record as a novelty.
Ian Brown,"Sure, of course. My boys know I'm famous. They see me on the TV but they'd rather watch 'The Simpsons.' But I'm definitely a cool father. I take them to the zoo and the beach and the countryside and to buy them sneakers. I play soccer with them. I just taught them how to play chess."
Ian Brown,"It's a bit lame at the moment. The best things in Britain are the bands being sent over from America. And otherwise, it's all boy bands and old established bands. It's just B*Witched and the Spice Girls. (He laughs.) Of course, I have all the bootlegs."
Jason Brown,The bad thing is that you are almost promoting what you are trying to protect against. You are upsetting the fan that went out and purchased the record.
Jason Brown,"It's a great opportunity for us. We've had two tough ones the past two weeks, and we're looking to get things going again. It's a big game for us, and playing CSU makes it that much better."
Jason Brown,"That's out of us now. We've had two lessons on that, made some mistakes and not taken advantage of opportunities and now we're going to let loose, play solid football and take advantage of the opportunities we do get and limit our mistakes."
Jason Brown,"We, as a team, didn't think he meant anything by it. He's not that kind of person. I personally wasn't offended. I think people saw today how sincere he was and he didn't mean anything by it."
Jason Brown,"We were just taking what they were giving us and mixing in the run to try to keep them off balance,"
Jason Brown,"Being from Colorado, a lot of my friends are up there. It's going to be nice to go up there again. The last time I played up there, we lost. We get a second crack at it. We just have to go up there, play a great game and come out on top."
Jason Brown,"You?re just drained after a game like this. With all the energy and emotion you put in, with the way (DeSalvo) pitched, you have to get that win. It would have been so disheartening to have lost."
Jeff Brown,"He was concerned with the fact that she a 16-year-old dating a 19-year-old,"
Jeff Brown,"Technology will wipe away this issue in the next five years. The new consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will all have parental controls so that game systems are far beyond television and DVDs in the ability they give to parents to restrict content."
Jeff Brown,"Gasoline looks lower than we had expected, it doesn't fit with the economic story and the car sales story. But it is unclear whether they are restricting what people can consume or whether drivers have had a strong price reaction."
Jeff Brown,I'm glad to see there's a little bit of progress in the city.
Jeff Brown,"This is greatest I've felt in my entire life, hands down."
Jeff Brown,"It hits home to everybody, especially when you know who it is. We?re at the point now, we?re just as frustrated as everyone else."
Jeff Brown,The way we started didn't surprise me. We had two mercy-rule games in two weeks. Not very competitive. So the first five minutes didn't surprise me. But I thought we got a little better as the game went on.
Jeff Brown,"We felt like not only was (the compliance check failure) unintentional, but that we took many, many steps to prevent it."
Jeff Brown,I tried ... to warn the board that we were facing a disaster and obviously I was not persuasive enough.
Jeff Brown,"[IBM was proud of its achievement.] Pass-one hardware had to be fully functional, ... One week after CPU power-on, a demo game was running with full-chip functionality."
Jim Brown,We are trying to see who can perform under those conditions.
Jim Brown,The parents are the key.
Jim Brown,"Why? That little guy, man. In one year, that little guy has brought about a miracle."
Jim Brown,"After Florida, Virginia is the fastest growth market on the East Coast."
Jim Brown,"This is the most critical line in the dirt in our state's history. Not only for the disaster but for the opportunity it has created. In the past, we have either not had the motivation or the money or the consensus."
Jim Brown,Nick has been solid all summer. He's played in the Lima Juniors and Toledo Juniors and dedicated himself to getting better. He's playing great and is really striking the ball well.
Jim Brown,A huge crisis like this lets new leadership step forward.
Jim Brown,"In some people's minds, a casino is going to open and a community is going to be magically transformed from a frog to a prince overnight, ... It's not that simple at all. And if anyone believes so, they're fooling themselves."
Jim Brown,I had a choice to be lazy or lean.
Jim Brown,"I had a choice to be lazy or lean, ... If I hadn't changed, things probably would catch up with me."
Jim Brown,"The growing need for companies to comply with a wide variety of regulatory requirements creates new and difficult challenges that can distract an organization from adding value to its products, [and] yet achieving compliance is essential to protecting the value of its innovations."
Jim Brown,Midway is a gold mine for Southwest. This is seen by a lot of frequent fliers and business travelers as a low-fare alternative to O'Hare.
Jim Brown,"There is a reasonable possibility there may be further money that can be distributed to charities, and the Salvation Army has made known their desire to receive some of it. I'm glad to hear from them, and I can understand if they felt they were unfairly singled out, but they weren't."
Jim Brown,"I was just a big guy running down with a big, deep pocket and little short stick putting it against my chest."
Jim Brown,I loved the game. We played because we loved it.
Jim Brown,"I'm not interested in trying to work on people's perceptions. I am who I am, and if you don't take the time to learn about that, then your perception is going to be your problem."
Jim Brown,"I came from Long Island, so I had a lot of experience at the stick. I played in junior high school, then I played in high school. The technical aspect of the game was my forte. I had all that experience, then I had strength and I was in good condition."
Jim Brown,Our research indicates that employing enhanced collaboration technologies in product development can have a significant impact on a company's ability to innovate and meet their product development targets. The real world stories presented at the ITS events offered excellent examples of how leading manufacturers are leveraging open design collaboration capabilities such as JT technology to streamline communication throughout their supply chains and bring innovative products to market faster.
Jon Brown,We wore down in the fourth quarter with Harrisburg's size and strength. We're down by three and they go on a 10-point run and our shots are all coming up short.
Jon Brown,I have mixed emotions. We battled for three quarters but they made a little run in the fourth and we got frustrated.
Jon Brown,not a complete disaster.
Jon Brown,"The thing about it was, I was just playing and did what coach Martin coaches. He really stresses throwing the unders, throw the wide routes. And that's really what I did was just throw completions."
Josh Brown,"I'm ecstatic, there aren't words to describe it. It's an unbelievable feeling."
Josh Brown,"I felt great. I got a lot of sleep, and I felt like I did everything to put myself in the proper position. The 54-yarder, I felt like I hit it well, but it was bad luck. It just sailed on me at the end. And then the 50-yarder was very uncharacteristic of me. I got around on it too much."
Josh Brown,"I took my helmet off, that way they couldn't throw me to the ground. There is a little planning in there."
Josh Brown,"This was a rush-on kick. You run out there, you line up, you kick it and you go home."
Josh Brown,It's a pretty good time -- if you don't mind giving up basically every Friday and Saturday night.
Keith Brown,"They're branches off the original technology fund. In the next several years, we see accelerated opportunities in those two areas."
Keith Brown,"I'm extremely disappointed with the way we played. I'm the head coach, that's my fault, I take full responsibility. I can't say anything. I don't think there was anything that we did well."
Keith Brown,"It's really amazing that in a town with a 6, 000 population that you'd have two quality senior girls basketball teams like we do."
Kevin Brown,"There is a kind of revolution going on, on the corporate desktop."
Kevin Brown,"Customers choose Quantum for their product innovation, the superior value they provide, and their outstanding customer support. Quantum is making it easy for customers to integrate security into their backup process. We look forward to working together to help our customers achieve success."
Kevin Brown,"It's amazing how many times helmets save lives. Kids' bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets, even your old high school football helmet; they all will protect your head from flying debris."
Kevin Brown,"[With the 19 state laws already passed and Congress focusing on the issue, even enterprise customers normally opposed to regulations recognize that a national law is likely, said Kevin Brown, vice president of marketing for Decru Inc., a storage security vendor.] In today's legislative environment, I don't think you're going to get a bill that just cancels the state laws, ... They'd love to have less regulation in general, but in this case, I think everybody's fairly realistic. What enterprises are looking for is guidance."
Kevin Brown,But it seems to be because of a scheduling conflict. He's done a lot and been supportive. He's spoken about this issue on the Senate floor.
Kevin Brown,"And a lot goes on below that 2,000-foot level. Even with all the advanced algorithms and computers, radar is not that accurate. It only infers what might be happening. We just don't get the whole picture from radar."
Kevin Brown,I couldn't have picked anybody better. He's a terrific coach and he'll do a great job. He was an outfielder and I was an infielder (at LU) and we sort of melded our systems together (at Glass).
Kevin Brown,"Our belief is that the patent covers a narrow method of Web crawling that's specific to Lycos, ... We believe our method is different."
Kwame Brown,"I want to assure everyone that I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing and look forward to the truth coming out when this matter is fully investigated. On the advice of my attorney, I cannot comment further."
Kwame Brown,We are going to pound them down low and see what kind of success we have.
Kwame Brown,"Guys like Kobe and Lamar know where they should be (in the Lakers' offense), ... I'm still learning where I'm supposed to be."
Kwame Brown,Guys like Kobe and Lamar know where they should be (in the Lakers' offense). I'm still learning where I'm supposed to be.
Kwame Brown,I just thank God that I'm out of Washington.
Kwame Brown,I just thank God that I'm out of Washington and looking forward to getting here and turning things around for myself and my family.
Kwame Brown,"The thing is, the whole thing stems from Gilbert telling them not to put me in the game. I didn't come to practice because I was going to be a distraction. I was going to slap ... him. I'll admit it, what I did was wrong -- not showing up was wrong -- but I ain't saying what I would've done if I showed up would've been right. Being that I didn't show up I didn't put my hands on nobody. How a teammate, a supposed friend, would go to a coach and tell him don't put me in a game, I would've done something seriously wrong to him."
Kwame Brown,"I couldn't see nothing. I was bleeding, eyes watering."
Kwame Brown,I feel good and the energy and the respect my teammates are showing me means a lot. They are looking for me in the post. It started off in practice where everyone is coming together and we are showing up better prepared for the game.
Kwame Brown,I'm not interested in that conversation. That's a non-starter for me. That cap is rock solid. It can cost whatever ... but this is what we're going to spend.
Kwame Brown,"I don't go with the notion that baseball's just going to walk in three days. I understand the consequences if I vote yes, and I understand the consequences if I vote no."
Kwame Brown,I don't see baseball backing out. Why would they leave in a market that's flourishing and that wants them? I think we'll come up with something that's a win-win situation.
Larry Brown,He's not nearly as aggressive because of his shoulder. But you don't want to look for excuses. We've got to look for ways to get better.
Larry Brown,I don't worry about what guys make. You worry about the contribution they make to your team. That's the thing that's most important. Because guys are making a lot of money doesn't always equate to wins.
Larry Brown,"I think if you look at the M.O. of this team all year, we have had trouble making stops. We have turned the ball over, we lead the league in turnovers, points of turnovers, and assist-to-turnovers. I keep telling them if you want to play playoff basketball, you've got to take care of the ball and execute. We don't get it and we have to keep working on it."
Larry Brown,"It's hard with Stevie because he's not aware of any of the [plays]. [Plus], if you get in foul trouble, you're turning the ball over, you're having trouble getting stops, how would you play?"
Larry Brown,"When he gets into a little better shape and stays out of foul trouble, he'll stay in the game for longer stretches."
Larry Brown,"Acquiring a player of Steve's level and talent is very exciting for this team. In Steve, we have added a veteran that could help us in many areas, and assist with our young players' development."
Larry Brown,"Acquiring a player of Steve's level and talent is very exciting for this team. In him, we have added a veteran that could help us in many areas, and assist with our young players' development."
Larry Brown,Acquiring a player of Steve's level and talent is very exciting for this team.
Larry Brown,"Dr. Callahan told me let's shut it down awhile and give him some time to rest because he hasn't done anything (like this) in two years, ... It's a lot different than working out on your own and then all of sudden being in this kind of environment. So we're going to shut it down a little bit. Hopefully he'll be back the beginning of next week. We'll know a lot more then."
Larry Brown,"My responsibility is to try to coach everybody and try to make everybody better. And when you find out that there's some that don't want to buy in, then you've really got to move on."
Larry Brown,"It's a killer when you lose a quality player like him, especially when you're struggling. It's tough. The way things are going, it gives some other people an opportunity to play and hopefully they get better because of the experience."
Larry Brown,"I'm just proud of them because that's a quality team and we managed to survive, and then we figured out a way to win."
Larry Brown,"It's a quality win for us on the road. We moved the ball great and got a lot of open shots because we gave the ball up. Controlling the tempo on the road is the way we've got to play ... You look at the stat sheet, and the nicest thing for me is I feel like a lot of people are playing together and trying to make everybody better."
Larry Brown,I don't know if we'll find out a lot about our progress until after this is over and we can start working in the summertime.
Larry Brown,"Until I coached Detroit I never inherited a winning team, ... This is a work in progress but I do think some of the changes that have been made are really positive ones."
Larry Brown,"It's been a struggle. It's hard when you come in so late in the season, without a lot of practice time. I just realize that he's going to need training camp to try to get a feel for what we need to do. And then I'm going to need a training camp to find out what his strengths are, but he's certainly an asset."
Larry Brown,"From my perspective, it's a big step forward."
Larry Brown,"You're coaching a storied franchise, ... I want to see this franchise respected, being a contender every year, having people come to the Garden and saying, 'Man, they played the right way.'"
Larry Brown,I've got to figure out a way to get some passion.
Larry Brown,"Our first team didn't shoot all that well. The Magic had 14 steals to our zero. To me, by accident, you can get a steal. That makes me think we weren't aggressive defensively."
Larry Brown,"To them, after the conditions they were living in, this was almost like a dream,"
Larry Brown,I think Tony's played him a lot. For the most part he did a tremendous job on him.
Larry Brown,I hope I can make a difference. I'm going to try my hardest to make this franchise proud of the team we put out there.
Larry Brown,"When I was announced as the Olympics coach, I thought that was the single greatest honor I could ever have, but I think standing here in Madison Square Garden with Isiah [Thomas] and my family here, this tops it all,"
Larry Brown,"I really didn't know what to expect, to be honest with you. You hate to put three of them out there together, playing in an NBA season against quality teams. That puts a lot of pressure on them. But they're good kids, they want to get better. It's going to speed up their growth, so we have to have some other people step up and we have to do a better job coaching them. But they're getting better."
Larry Brown,It was the kind of game where you hate to see anybody lose.
Larry Brown,"It's a pretty amazing memorial. It puts games in perspective, I think."
Larry Brown,"When you don't have practice time and you get away with winning some games, you get a false sense of who you are."
Larry Brown,He's got such a good work ethic. We'll have to see what the future brings for Brian. I assume he's going to follow in (his father's) footsteps.
Larry Brown,"We've always cooked at the fire department to raise funds. We've probably cooked up a ton of barbecue. We decided let's do it competitively, and here we are,"
Larry Brown,"He keeps telling me he wants to come back. If the doctors give him the OK, we'll do it, but we'll just go day to day. It would be great to have him back, but if not, I'll get to play Steve more and Jamal more and Nate."
Larry Brown,"We gave him as much time as we possibly could, but the doctors aren't going to let him play if they think he's going to do any damage. So we'll just get straight about what's going on. From what they tell me, it's about pain."
Larry Brown,"The direction is not going the way we would all like and we've got to do something about that. This is a pretty good time from now until All-Star break to kind of assess where we're going, but I do really feel good about a lot of the pieces here and I think a lot of them have a chance to get a lot better."
Larry Brown,"After that conversation everything was very positive. I thought he really bought into what we were trying to do. It was not a great experience for me, the fact that we lost, but it was a great experience to see his growth."
Larry Brown,"The thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three-year commitment, which I think is tremendous. We had guys that committed and then all of a sudden 9/11 happened, and then there were injuries."
Larry Brown,He beat me in my first college game and made me feel good. He was a pretty special man. He was always wonderful to me. He's what all coaches should be about.
Larry Brown,It's all about making shots. The key to a Game 7 for a coach is to treat it like any other game.
Larry Brown,"We've got to know. We'll wait and see what happens at the beginning of [next] week and hopefully he'll be ready to play. If not, we'll worry about that then."
Larry Brown,"We're going to shut him down a little bit. Hopefully, he'll be back at the beginning of next week and we'll know a little bit more. Hopefully he'll be ready to play. If not we'll worry about that then."
Larry Brown,"Basketball started for me in this city and I want to be here when it's finally time for me to stop, ... I'm not here to retire. I'm here to help build something that will be around for a long time."
Larry Brown,"I think his best basketball is in front of him,"
Larry Brown,"You have to do something in your life that is honorable and not cowardly if you are to live in peace with yourself, and for the firefighter it is fire."
Larry Brown,I'm happy writing full-time and I've been making a living off it so far. I haven't had any complaints with it at all. I'm happy.
Larry Brown,"If I had my druthers, at my age I would rather be with a more established team. But this is fun. I enjoy coaching. It's probably a much different challenge than I've had recently, but that's OK."
Larry Brown,"If I had my druthers, at my age I would rather be with a more established team, ... But this is fun. I enjoy coaching. It's probably a much different challenge than I've had recently, but that's OK."
Lee Brown,"I'm not going to write any blank checks, but in a general concept, I support it, ... The big item is the land, and conceptually we have agreed to do that from the beginning."
Lee Brown,"It's unbelievable what's happening here, ... We have problems all over the city, flooding all over downtown and every other part of the city."
Lee Brown,to preserve and protect life and property.
Lee Brown,"We believe the System One represents a revolutionary technology offering a simplified, less labor-intensive and yet more flexible approach for the treatment of kidney dysfunction."
Lee Brown,"Tonight, my friends, another barrier has fallen in the city of Houston. The doors of opportunity have opened all of Houston's children. They now know that any child can grow up to lead this city."
Lee Brown,"As an industry, maybe we can approach the governor to force CARB to back off and wait for the National Clean Diesel Standards to go into effect, and we can use diesel from more sources (refineries) until then."
Lee Brown,"It looks bad, there is no doubt about that, but let us not rush to judgment,"
Lee Brown,"We are not in a crisis situation, but we are taking proactive steps,"
Lee Brown,a campaign based on the conviction that the best decision-making is neighborhood decision-making in which people have a real say in the policies that affect their communities and their lives.
Lee Brown,"For someone to vote against it they can't really represent a very important segment of our community,"
Leslie Brown,"She was such a joy. When you talked to her, she just glowed."
Leslie Brown,I don't like holding this sign. It's demeaning and I hate it with all the teas in China.
Leslie Brown,I don't think our heads were really in the game. I think we are a better than what we showed today. I just don't think our intensity was at the right level it should have been.
Linda Brown,They could serve slop. They saved my son's life.
Linda Brown,My husband and I were anxious to return home to raise our young daughter.
Linda Brown,They do not have a right to buy more democracy than the rest of us. All levels of government would be for sale to the highest bidder.
Linda Brown,Pat Locke is very community minded and she knew that this would be a great place for it [the money] to go.
Linda Brown,The passion for children is in her heart.
Lisa Brown,"This is a time for people to come together, let go of differences, recognize their similarities, and share who they are and where they come from. It has been shared by tribal elders that in order for healing to begin, we must let go of resentments or harsh feelings."
Lisa Brown,"I'm not in any pain right now. I feel normal, I just can't lift heavy things like I did before,"
Lisa Brown,"Often when people go through trials, they can either draw near to God or be driven away from him. For both Brian and Mel, this made them grow in their faith."
Lisa Brown,We were just glad to be challenged. It is good that we got to experience overtime and penalty kicks under pressure before we start league play.
Lisa Brown,I am extremely proud of these dancers. We are a new program competing against teams who have been dancing for years. Our dancers showed great sportsmanship and enthusiasm.
Lisa Brown,"The community always comes out of hibernation to help make the walk a success. Walkers, sponsors, people with MS and volunteers come together ... that's why I look forward to the walk every year."
Lisa Brown,Our prayer is that this event would unify our faith community and glorify God.
Mack Brown,"He loves the fight, the come-from-behind. He loves the pressure on him. That's where I gained so much respect for him."
Mack Brown,"I used to really worry about it. I used to fight it, and it used to make me mad and now I understand sometimes when you win one, you get too much credit and therefore when you lose one, you get too much criticism. I understand we're probably OK until next Saturday ... and then it probably will be I just can't win any one of them again, but that's all right."
Mack Brown,"Selvin is 100 percent, ... He's gotten his speed back. He's gotten his vision back. He's bigger and strong, and he's definitely ready to go."
Mack Brown,"The trust that I gained is the way he competes when we're in trouble,"
Mack Brown,Plan on being behind. Plan on getting yourself in trouble.
Mack Brown,"We'll have the inexperience at quarterback, but we think the talent is there."
Mack Brown,He (Snead) has been throwing already with the other guys. They have been very impressed with his arm strength. He and Colt should have a great grasp of what's going on in the spring. Our job is to get both these guys ready to play.
Mack Brown,"I don't think we'll ever answer all the critics in sports,"
Mack Brown,"They miss the spring sports in their senior year and they miss being the stud walking around the hallways, as compared to being a rookie again. We feel it's something they have to buy in to. They have to want to do it. If we encourage it and they miss their senior prom and their football banquet, then it just doesn't work out."
Mack Brown,(Ginn) is as good as any player out in space as I have ever seen. We do not feel like Holmes gets near the publicity he deserves. So both of those guys are as good as anybody we will play this year at (wide receiver).
Mack Brown,"I don't think you ever silence critics. They'll be critics in the morning, that's part of the deal."
Mack Brown,I don't think you ever silence critics. They'll be critics in the morning. That's part of the deal.
Mack Brown,"His best asset is to make plays with his feet, ... When he starts running, and everybody comes up, that's when he stops and throws."
Mack Brown,"We're running the ball perfect, 300-some yards a week."
Mack Brown,"We couldn't make a first down running the ball. They were tough and got after our tail. They'll bring an excited bunch in here. I'm sure they'll want to get away from the distractions of the family issues with the flood, and they have nothing to lose."
Mack Brown,"We feel like we still have David Pino and Greg Johnson, who are quality kickers and punters and can step up and help [McGee], ... Richmond is a fifth-year senior, he is older, and he has not had any trouble in two-a-days."
Mack Brown,What we're going to do is enjoy this run right now. We'll be in spring practice Feb. 24 and get ready to start over because next year's team hasn't won a game.
Mack Brown,We told them at the end of practice that you work 352 days for 13 Saturdays. This is their first chance to be seen as this football team. It's an exciting time.
Mack Brown,It has been a very good week of practice ... the most focused I've seen them because they can't wait until Saturday. They know it is going to be a great test.
Mack Brown,I've been planning this one for 33 years and now I really don't know what to say.
Mack Brown,I've never seen an athletic performance from a quarterback like Vince Young did tonight.
Mack Brown,"Vince's performance today was the best I've ever seen him, ... They weren't going to allow us to run the ball, which was fine."
Mack Brown,Vince's performance was the best today that I've ever seen him.
Mack Brown,"Vince's performance was the best today that I've ever seen him,"
Mack Brown,I was not surprised that he was disappointed. I thought people were really foolish to think a person at 21 years old wouldn't be disappointed if he was standing up there and someone announced he didn't win the Heisman.
Mack Brown,"It's important in recruiting. A lot of these young people and their parents have a dream to play in the NFL. To some families, it's not that important, but I would say very few players who go to Texas or Ohio State don't have that dream."
Mack Brown,"Those guys have really come on and improved. You don't know how they will respond Saturday night, but we will see it when you see it."
Mack Brown,"[Young passed for three touchdowns, ran for another and Jamaal Charles set a Texas freshman debut record Saturday night with 135 yards rushing for the Longhorns, who travels to No. 6 Ohio State next weekend.] It will be a fun game for college football, ... The buildup started in early spring."
Mack Brown,"We don't have to be the best team of all time, just tomorrow night."
Mack Brown,"Everybody's got scholarships and everybody's got good players. If it's a night where it's not working well, you better hang on and you better make some plays,"
Mack Brown,"This is one night we can hook 'em and hold down the little finger, because we're No. 1."
Mack Brown,The turnovers killed us. You can't make mistakes like that and expect to win.
Mack Brown,"It's a group that fits our needs from top to bottom. We signed young men who can play a lot of different positions, and the class gives us added strength in just about every position on the field."
Mack Brown,I have never been around a guy who has a better memory. Gil remembers everything.
Mack Brown,"We love Vince and appreciate all the great things he's done for the University of Texas on and off the field. We'll miss him, but want him to do as well in the NFL as he did in college."
Mack Brown,"I told him he was the luckiest human being in the world. He just said, 'Coach, I love you and thank you for bringing me to Texas."
Mack Brown,"I would say if you're ranked No. 1, you better be really good, because it takes on a life of its own. Everyone complained that we had the best recruiting class in country but we only won 10 games. I said, 'Yeah, I know, we were terrible.' Chris Simms finished as the school's all-time passing leader, Cory Redding starts for Detroit, and some people think that class wasn't a success."
Mack Brown,"If you win the national title will it be the greatest thing that's ever happened in your life? No. I asked Bobby Bowden once, and he said the second national championship's a lot tougher than the first one, so don't get excited about it."
Mack Brown,"Don't let this be the best thing that ever happens in your life. Maybe it'll be the best sports event, but don't let it be the best thing. Make sure you're a better father than this today. Make sure you're a better husband than this today. Because this goes away. ... It's a game."
Mack Brown,"What I needed to do was a little better job staying up with their times, not just my times. It's made a difference in my happiness and enjoying them more."
Mack Brown,"With Selvin hurt, you have to credit Jamaal, ... He did a great job of running, receiving and protecting."
Mack Brown,"The [BCS has] got to hope there's not more than two undefeated teams at the end or they've screwed up again, very honestly, ... That's what they've got to hope."
Mack Brown,"The (BCS has) got to hope there's not more than two undefeated teams at the end or they've screwed up again, very honestly, ... That's what they've got to hope."
Mack Brown,"The (BCS has) got to hope there's not more than two undefeated teams at the end or they've (messed) up again, very honestly. That's what they've got to hope."
Mack Brown,"I'm excited to accept on behalf of our team and our assistant coaches, ... It's a huge honor, but much more than one person."
Mack Brown,We can't have videos of practice and have people going home and putting it on the Internet.
Mack Brown,The highlight of our history was running the ball.
Mack Brown,This is arguably one of the best teams in school history. It's been a great run.
Mack Brown,"We think he's 100 percent with his health. He's gotten his vision back. He's bigger and stronger. (But) he hasn't done it since Arkansas last year, and it was a bad experience."
Mack Brown,"If you've got two beautiful girls, I don't think you have to pick. If there are two beautiful girls, I don't think I'm going to say, 'Her hair's a little shorter' or 'Her hair's a different color'. These are two great offenses. It's hard to score to 50 points. How many times in the history of college football have two teams averaging 50 points played against each other at the end of the year?"
Mack Brown,"That says a lot about the history of the two schools and the games. People have told me that the two schools are very similar. They are two of the biggest state institutions in the country, both very good academic schools and are in the capital (cities). We each have a lot of fans and a lot of talk and publicity about football. (Football) is really important at both places."
Mack Brown,They've made the plays to win the game and we haven't.
Mack Brown,He flipped the switch and took over our team. It's fun to have a mature guy who's not (just) surviving at quarterback. He's getting better every play.
Mack Brown,These two teams have been talked about for a month. It's a fun and exciting thing but now it's time to let the games begin.
Mack Brown,"When you're 1-10 it's a hurtful period. It's not who makes fun of you because you feel worse about yourself. It's because someone gave you a chance to run their program, and you aren't running it very well. That's what you're proud of for Texas, that they've asked you to do something and you've gotten it to this point."
Mack Brown,"I thought I put entirely too much pressure on myself. We were winning, and I wasn't having fun. I don't want to act like I was depressed or miserable. But instead of worrying about what wasn't fixed, I needed to start enjoying what we'd accomplished."
Mack Brown,"It's been a fun year so far. We just want to keep it going. One thing I've learned at Texas, we've been playing football for 112 years and there were expectations 112 years ago. It hasn't changed."
Mack Brown,"Our friendship has come out of respect, ... Gary's honest, and his program goes by the rules. I know those kids are disciplined, and we've got a lot of people on my staff who have been around the Colorado program that assured me of those things early. I've been able to see those things first-hand by being around Gary more."
Mack Brown,"Our friendship has come out of respect. Gary's honest, and his program goes by the rules. I know those kids are disciplined, and we've got a lot of people on my staff who have been around the Colorado program that assured me of those things early. I've been able to see those things first-hand by being around Gary more."
Mack Brown,"I'd just like to say, look at the year. Vince Young is a great football player and to me, the most valuable player on our football team for sure, and on any team in the country."
Mack Brown,"It was a great football game. It's surreal sitting there in the fourth quarter and you're down by two scores and you still think you're going to win. But we never, ever thought we would lose the ballgame."
Mack Brown,"It was very emotional for me. Football will miss Bill Snyder. More than that, the kids of Kansas State will miss him. He'll be in the Hall of Fame. Nobody will ever do for a school in football, in my estimation, what he's done for Kansas State."
Mack Brown,When you're a football player at the University of Texas and you're playing in the national championship game the players understand the scrutiny is going to be a little more than usual. I think we'll handle it.
Mack Brown,"Next year's team hasn't won a game. There's not going to be another Vince Young. We can win football games at Texas because we won them before Vince got here, and we'll win them afterwards."
Mack Brown,I'm proud of these kids. I'm proud of these coaches. High school football in Texas is unbelievable.
Mack Brown,"He said, 'Your biggest problem is making football important again at Texas.' It had not been good for a while."
Mack Brown,"I think when I get through and I'm gumming my food, it will mean a lot ... As far as today, it would give these kids, these coaches and this university something we haven't done since we've been here. Secondly, it gives you a chance to play for a national championship and that doesn't happen many times in peoples' lives, if ever."
Mack Brown,"It's not about the music, it's about what they care about, ... They say old people get off the fashion train. I needed to get back in touch with our team."
Mack Brown,"I knew about Texas from being around coaches in my family, but I didn't realize it was such a national place until I got here. When you say something at Texas, it's talked about nationally, not just in your neighborhood."
Mack Brown,"When you're the home team, there are more distractions because your friends are around and your family is around. Sometimes it's easier to play on the road than it is at home."
Mack Brown,Now he's in the hall of fame.
Mack Brown,"Hopefully that will be a play-changing experience for him. He is a guy with so much pride, he puts as much pressure on himself as I've ever seen. That's why it was such a great play."
Mack Brown,"Tremendous speed. He can jump sideways, ... And he doesn't seem to be bothered by the environment."
Mack Brown,"[Texas coach Mack Brown doesn't seem to share Tressel's and Castiglione's enthusiasm for such matchups. In a conference call with reporters earlier this week, Brown intimated the 'Horns, who scheduled the Ohio State series roughly a decade ago when the program was struggling financially and competitively, might not have made the same choice under the present circumstances.] At places like ours, we're going to fill up our stadium regardless of who we're playing, ... so we'd actually make more money playing another game at home, getting our guys ready for our conference schedule. So I don't see this continuing [beyond next year's game in Austin]."
Mack Brown,"This bunch, all year, has controlled their own destiny, and they did the same today."
Mack Brown,"Right there I told the defense, 'You stop this play and we're going to win the national championship."
Mack Brown,"We weren't real proud of our run defense. We'll try to stop the run first (against Baylor). If you can't stop the run, you've got problems."
Mack Brown,He's the best at laughing and dancing and then competing when it's time to take the snap that I've ever seen.
Mack Brown,We'd like for those two guys to get settled and started and learn the offense before they are criticized.
Mack Brown,"They may be the best linebackers in the country right now. You look at what they've been able to accomplish. They're tough, they can run, they're seniors and they're all pro prospects."
Mack Brown,"I think I was the only one in the country who anticipated this. I told the guys....they're going to pull it all out because they've got nothing to lose. I was really, really not proud of myself that I was right."
Mack Brown,"The message is we are one of the top two teams in the country. We won by 62, and that's without running it up. We have to enjoy this ride, enjoy this moment."
Mack Brown,This is a great time of year for football programs across the country.
Mack Brown,I don't know if there's a better defensive back in the country.
Mack Brown,One of the reasons we've improved so much is Vince has improved his confidence and his poise and the fact that he's leading and running our football team.
Mack Brown,He flipped the switch and had confidence and took over our team. This is now Vince Young's team.
Mack Brown,"At times we didn't even play that good. But we played hard, and we played with confidence."
Mack Brown,"I think it sent the message, ... that this team was going to play with confidence and be aggressive the rest of the day."
Mack Brown,"There were 23 commitments before the end of the summer,"
Mack Brown,It will be a fun game for college football. The buildup started in early spring.
Mack Brown,"I think he will be, ... one of the great quarterbacks to ever play college football before he leaves Texas."
Mack Brown,This is a great game for college football. It's a game that every college football fan will watch.
Mack Brown,"They are the team in college football right now. We understand that we have an opportunity, because we're playing so well, to beat the team that's been the best. That's the goal we set a year ago. We felt like we'd be playing SC in this game. And all of that has happened."
Mack Brown,"What a fun week for us, for Ohio State and for college football, ... It is unusual anymore to have matchups like this out of conference. I am proud that we are going to a place that cares about football like we do and that has the storied history that we do."
Mack Brown,"I think he's one of the great players ever to play college football. If he comes back next year, which we think he will, he'll have a great shot to win the Heisman."
Mack Brown,He's one of the greatest players ever to play college football. He's the most competitive person I've ever been around. He didn't speak to me when we went for the field goal on fourth and 4. I knew he wouldn't. I had to go over and suck up to him.
Mack Brown,That has to be as good a college football game as there could be. Texas and Michigan should come down to the last two seconds.
Mack Brown,"What a fun week for us, for Ohio State and for college football. It is unusual any more to have matchups like this out of conference. I am proud that we are going to a place that cares about football like we do and that has the storied history that we do."
Mack Brown,"[The Lone Star State's best college football team is alone at the top of the Bowl Championship Series standings, but even the Texas Longhorns know Monday's rise might be fleeting.] It's a compliment, ... We understand the rankings can change weekly. What we have to do is concentrate on winning."
Mack Brown,"We have an opportunity to beat the team that's been the best in college football. That's a goal that we set a year ago. We felt like we'd be back in this game, and we felt like we'd be playing SC in this game, and all of that has happened now."
Mack Brown,"A year and a half ago, there were people who questioned whether Vince Young could be a major college quarterback."
Mack Brown,"This is a great game for college football. It's a game that every college football fan will watch, and because of that, I think everyone has really embraced it. This isn't a week for a weak guy. You'd better walk with a swagger."
Mack Brown,We're playing what some argue is the best team in college football history.
Mack Brown,He's one of the great players to play college football.
Mack Brown,"Look at what he has accomplished at the highest level of college football. He's 27 hours away from graduation. He has done everything right on and off the field. He's got character. He's got intelligence. He's got a burning desire to succeed. He has a great heart. He competes as hard as anybody I've ever been around. There's no downside. If he stays healthy, he'll be one of the great ones to ever play."
Mack Brown,"What they are doing in college football is unheard of, offensively, ... It's amazing."
Mack Brown,"He's one of the great players to ever play college football. He was the best player on any team this year. If he comes back, he's got a great chance to win the Heisman next year."
Mack Brown,"I like Pete, so that makes this week easier. If you don't like the other coach, it's a longer week."
Mack Brown,"Usually the coach of the year is the guy that overcame something. We didn't overcome anything. We just won a big game at the end and we hadn't been doing that. For Joe to do what he's done over the last few years and turn his program completely around is really, really special. I don't think there's any question he's deserving of this award."
Mack Brown,Coach (Darrell) Royal said guys like him are quick as a puff of smoke.
Mack Brown,"The worst thing for a coach is to try to convince him to come back. After all he's meant to this university, how ungracious of us to be to force him to make a selfish decision."
Mack Brown,"Who ever knows what a No.1 recruiting class is? They should be rated after four years, after we've seen what they've done."
Mack Brown,"This is a class that grew up together. They're meeting expectations, and expectations were high."
Mack Brown,"Everywhere I went, he knew the coaches, their wives and their children's names. He sent anniversary and birthday cards on Cowboys stationery. He turned most into Cowboys fans."
Mack Brown,He's not an athlete playing quarterback. He's a quarterback who happens to be a great athlete. He reads defenses as well as any quarterback in the country. You never hear about that part of his game.
Mack Brown,"Honestly, these two programs probably get as much attention as any in America."
Mack Brown,"Because they're old. They're my age. Today, in a head-on battle, it's no contest. But on that stage, at that time, they were the best team in the country. And they always will be. And that's what this team is trying to be for the 2005 season."
Mack Brown,"A guy has adversity and picks himself up and fights through it,"
Mack Brown,"They can beat you with designed runs, they can beat you with play-action and they can beat you by freelancing off a busted play."
Mack Brown,"They can beat you with designed runs, they can beat you with play-action and they can beat you by freelancing off a busted play,"
Mack Brown,"This team has shown the ability to put an exciting win behind them, ... This will be the biggest test of getting them back and getting them ready to go because there will be less attention in this game (Oklahoma State) than there was the last three. I think they're enjoying the ride. We told them that you don't get into this position that many times in your lifetime, so you really need to enjoy it."
Mack Brown,"Good teams enjoy the hype, and they have the ability to focus. Young people come to Texas and SC for this game, and it's been a long time for us to get back to this game, and we took a baby step last year in this environment. I've talked to the kids about it. The only difference between this year and last year is the stakes are bigger."
Matt Brown,I've kept my self from thinking about her; it's just not worth the heartach.
Matt Brown,It was a very good game. Maxwell is a super team and they took every opportunity and ran with us. We just came out a little on top.
Matt Brown,I'm looking forward to the opportunity to establish strong relationships with the transportation industry and provide recruitment services to meet their needs. This is another example of The Employment Guide's commitment to being a top Internet career site.
Matt Brown,We all love it and we'll surely be working on adrenaline.
Matt Brown,"You've got to take what life throws at you. Some of it's crappy and some of it's not. Scott got cancer and he just took it the best he could, and he had friends to back him up and help him along with it."
Matt Brown,"No shots were fired, and no one got hurt,"
Matt Brown,The (Internet Service Provider) called me at home at 10 p.m. Tuesday to tell me what had happened.
Matt Brown,"Through some negotiations with our SWAT team, he came out peacefully. Thank goodness it's ended peacefully."
Matt Brown,"Most of my goals this year have been in the third or fourth quarter, so being able to build on a lead early in the game was nice."
Matt Brown,"We knew this was going to be an even match because Petoskey is a very experienced team, so our girls had to rise to the occasion and they did,"
Matt Brown,"The girls are playing really good tennis right now and we just need to continue to work on improving,"
Matt Brown,"This is a great program. Nothing is more fun than watching these little kids get out there and scrap with each other to do their best. It's all about having fun, because if they don't have fun with it now, they won't want to do it later, and compete at the high school level."
Matt Brown,"We're hoping to attract the 25-and-up demographic with relatively well-known entertainment but it doesn't always work out that way. Upstairs, we're aiming for a more mature high-end clientele that wants a premium experience."
Matt Brown,"We stayed focused and didn't let up because our desire and energy to win our tournament was evident with our tenacious play,"
Paul Brown,"At The Principal, we work hard to make sure our clients - and their plan participants - are satisfied with every aspect of the service we provide. We're gratified to know that our clients are happier than ever before, and we plan to continue our commitment to top-notch service and ongoing improvement."
Paul Brown,You can literally travel around inside the mummy's head. You can see the hair is still on the child. You can see the pool of resin in the back of her head.
Paul Brown,"You can literally travel around inside the mummy's head. You can see the hair is still on the child, you can see the pool of resin in the back of her head. It's the best scan ever of a mummy."
Paul Brown,"You can literally travel around inside the mummy's head, ... You can see the hair is still on the child, you can see the pool of resin in the back of her head. It's the best scan ever of a mummy."
Paul Brown,"You can literally travel around inside the mummy's head, ... You can see the hair is still on the child. You can see the pool of resin in the back of her head."
Paul Brown,"Optimist fits our model of being an advisor to our clients. We want to provide service beyond what most typical banks offer. We want to have longer, more meaningful conversations with clients to figure out exactly what their needs are and provide them with advice that quickly gets them to their business goals. (With Optimist) our relationship managers can actually sit down with a client or prospect, tie the business's income statement and balance sheet together, and get critical answers right away. Business owners, especially small business owners, don't have a lot of time. They really do rely on someone who can suggest alternate ways of doing thingsâ€”especially when those suggestions lead to greater business success for them."
Paul Brown,"Users were virtually unanimously opposed to paying for current generation mobile TV offerings due to frustrations with perceived network quality and performance. Out of more than 50 test users, more than half experienced network-related problems over three consecutive nights of testing."
Paul Brown,"There are relatively few movers and shakers, a small group of people who make the decisions,"
Paul Brown,"This can only mean stepping into the future. I don't know the plans yet, but I'm optimistic."
Paul Brown,Football is a game of errors. The team that makes the fewest errors in a game usually wins.
Paul Brown,You can learn a line from a win and a book from a defeat.
Paul Brown,"When you win, say nothing. When you lose, say less."
Paul Brown,A winner never whines.
Paul Brown,The key to winning is poise under stress.
Paul Brown,What we have currently available is what we have available.
Rebecca Brown,"But it wasn't until the 1970s that manga dealing with romantic relationships forming between females began to pop up,"
Rebecca Brown,"Yes, there is a topic (the Constitution), but what we have to think about is whether we think it is appropriate for the government to select a topic."
Rebecca Brown,"There is no implication that we have to celebrate the Constitution, and we are not asked to adopt any point of view."
Rhonda Brown,I don't think these kids know how fortunate they are. This helps make the first year great if they have some scholarships.
Rhonda Brown,It tells you how low diversity is at other institutions.
Rhonda Brown,"We have a great girls and guys track program and cross country program, too. We want to be known as a school that's well rounded. You can do a lot things there besides play football. Basketball happens to be one of them, but we've got a nationally renowned speech and debate team, too."
Richard Brown,We really won't see the story until we get into the spring and see the spring sales activity.
Richard Brown,"To be able to offer processor speeds up to 1.5GHz within such a low power envelope is a remarkable advance for the x86 market, placing us clearly ahead of the competition and enabling more powerful embedded and silent systems."
Richard Brown,"We believed there was demand for low-power, low-cost processors, and it has been tougher than we had originally anticipated, but now finally we think we have a clear space in the market."
Richard Brown,"To be able to offer processor speeds up to 1.5GHz within such a low power envelope is a remarkable advance for the x86 market, placing us clearly ahead of the competition and enabling more powerful embedded and silent systems. With these unprecedented levels of performance and power efficiency, the new Via Eden processor looks set to extend our leadership in markets such as thin clients, where increasingly intelligent, stylish x86 devices require more powerful yet still very cool processing capabilities."
Richard Brown,"We've seen more than 1,000 people at the clinic about STDs, and more than 40 percent of them were infected."
Richard Brown,"We've had three calls in reference to that rope swing in the past roughly six months, in reference to injuries,"
Richard Brown,"PS 152's parents, teachers and students have spent many years raising tens of thousands of dollars for a school computer room - only now to see that dream callously erased by the defendant, who allegedly used the association's funds as her own private piggy bank, ... Her alleged conduct is a betrayal of the trust of the parents who elected her to serve as their leader."
Richard Brown,"I think that music videos began to be approached by young filmmakers as a form where they could do something interesting and innovative around the late '80s. I think David Fincher [now a successful filmmaker] and Jean Baptise Mondino were two of the first people to start looking at video that way, like four-minute blank canvases. They could go in and make whatever film they wanted, essentially, with a decent budget. So it became like film school for some really talented guys. Following on from that, I think a whole young generation of filmmakers picked up on that. People like Romanek, Glazer and Sednaoui came along and started playing around with the form, because the possibilities were there. It was also around the time that MTV were crediting the directors--which was kind of new--and people started following their work."
Richard Brown,They couldn't put the deal together and come through at the required time with the required amount of earnest money. We've had quite a bit of inquiry about the second bid.
Richard Brown,It all boils down to how much money you're going to spend.
Richard Brown,"Michael Jackson even agreed to do it, but then life got in the way."
Richard Brown,A smoker applying for life assurance will find themselves facing almost double the premium of a non-smoker. Add that to the price of the cigarettes and the cost of smoking plainly threatens your wealth â€“ not just your health.
Richard Brown,"Many people are tempted to lie about their smoking habits when applying for life assurance, but this is a false economy. Should you become ill or die from a smoking related condition, your insurance won't pay out â€“ and then you'll fully understand what smoking has cost you."
Richard Brown,"It's a big number, it's about 4 percent of personal income,"
Richard Brown,"It was my hope that the defendant had learned that he had a responsibility to obey the law, ... It is obvious that the lesson was lost on the defendant."
Richard Brown,"This government has been using the clause far too much I think,"
Richard Brown,"We've had five straight years of record earnings for the industry, we haven't seen a bank failure in six quarters. That is a historic strong financial performance for the industry that's taken place under a very benign set of economic conditions and that's not necessarily going to persist in the future."
Richard Brown,"We both sort of coach together. We share practices. And the children come over after school, and they're watching us practice. Sometimes, they'll even get out there and work out with the team."
Richard Brown,"Both of his children go here so he is just really supportive, just a good fellow, don't know what got into him, I'm just sorry that it happened."
Ron Brown,They showed so much improvement.
Ron Brown,Every new idea is an impossibility until it is born.
Ron Brown,"It's just like golf. You get your drive, you miss a putt and you still make par."
Ron Brown,"While the first quarter is typically our weakest of the year, we are encouraged by the strong level of new orders, many of which reflect improved pricing."
Ronnie Brown,"Hopefully, we can go in and establish the running game early and open up some things for the passing game."
Ronnie Brown,I feel pretty fresh and pretty confident in the things I've learned over the past few weeks.
Ronnie Brown,"I thought I was, but I guess not. It's just one of those mistakes. You've got to protect the ball, even when you're fighting for extra yards."
Ronnie Brown,"[While he gets his bearings, he's still living in a hotel, although he's found a place in the Fort Lauderdale area.] I don't have any furniture, ... Someone's working on it for me."
Ronnie Brown,I knew I was going to have a good game sooner or later.
Ronnie Brown,"It's kind of relieving, you know, that everybody kind of had faith in me, to come out here, be on this level, and everybody calls your name,"
Ronnie Brown,"I was in disbelief, ... You can't imagine a disaster like this is hitting so close to home and affecting so many people."
Scott Brown,"Fourteen feet in high school will give you a good shot at state title. It may not win it, but you'll sure have a good shot."
Scott Brown,"There are some encouraging signs in retail sales, but if you look at what the source of consumer spending is, it's really income growth, and wage growth has been lackluster, suggesting the consumer will not be robust going forward."
Scott Brown,"We definitely plan on making inroads in the market. We're in the process of planning some special packages. We have a number of successful plans already - our four-packs, 2-For-Tuesday drink specials, our kids' promotions. We're formulating some new plans to bring some options to the Elmira fans that might take some of sting out of driving 55 miles with rising gas prices."
Scott Brown,It's going to be relatively soft labor market over the course of the year.
Scott Brown,It doesn't take much. One spouse loses a job or is unemployed for even a little while.
Scott Brown,"I started looking into the cost of the equipment because it is a really good fitness program, especially when I only have a PE budget of a couple hundred bucks."
Scott Brown,"We did real well. Having three girls in five events and we got 10th, I'll take that."
Scott Brown,"They'll still see the risk as toward weakness, ... compromise move."
Scott Brown,The city has received numerous complaints about them. Our goal is not to issue citations and tie up the courts. Our hope is they'll comply after we give them notice.
Scott Brown,"A lot of boys that had never been on a swim team before that gave it a shot. I was very happy, they all, except for a couple stuck with it all year."
Shannon Brown,"I was self-conscious about it because I would get stares. I could not wear certain hairstyles. If I had a bad hair day, I could not wear it up because it would be out there for the world to see."
Shannon Brown,There's a lot of tradition and pride with what we've done in the NCAA tournament over the last few years. We've been the type of program that looks forward to when the tournament comes around and everybody really starts paying attention to college basketball.
Shannon Brown,We didn't do what we had to do to get the job done. They did.
Shannon Brown,"Of all the goals we have, winning the conference is the first big one. We've just got to come out and play like we know how to play. If we do that, we can get four rings â€” the Big Ten, the Big Ten tournament, another Final Four and the national championship."
Shannon Brown,"Who knows what happened? But it happened, and now you've just got to come back and keep fighting. They're good players, they're going to bounce back out of it; all they've got to do is keep being aggressive. If you stop, you'll never get out of it."
Shannon Brown,"Right now, we really don't fear anybody, so the seeding doesn't mean that much."
Shannon Brown,It was bad execution of offense.
Shannon Brown,It was a bad execution of our offense.
Shannon Brown,"It helps a lot. You won't get too excited, that high emotion where your blood flows too much, where you're throwing the ball away. You know how to keep your composure and just go out there, relax and play basketball."
Shannon Brown,That was just emotion coming out. I don't know what to say. I was just trying to take the contact and get it off the backboard. The crowd was going crazy. They got me going.
Shannon Brown,"I feel like it was meant for me to be in college. Not at all am I disappointed or mad at coming back. College is one of the most fun times of your life, and I'm having an excellent time at Champaign."
Shannon Brown,"I feel like it was meant for me to be in college, ... Not at all am I disappointed or mad at coming back. College is one of the most fun times of your life, and I'm having an excellent time at Champaign."
Shannon Brown,"Great kid, great character. He's super talented, obviously, but you throw in the character, and being a super kid, good leader, that's what sets him apart from a lot of people."
Sheldon Brown,"I don't care what Hugh says. Quite frankly, the guys I am playing with I trust, and I trust the leaders we have. I am around them every day, and Hugh isn't around them every day."
Sheldon Brown,"When it comes to physical blows, you have problems."
Sheldon Brown,"He was one of my favorite teammates. He worked me like crazy in practice. I'm still trying to figure out the other part of him. It's not about the money with him. But it's the only way he thinks he can talk to the organization, by saying things about the quarterback."
Sheldon Brown,You can't have spectators watching when he gets the ball. You need all 11 men to run to the ball when he has it.
Sheldon Brown,"I think a lot of the leaders here were young guys and we expected management to handle the situation, that they'd explain what the rules and regulations were. That didn't happen."
Sheldon Brown,"We're all professionals here -- been there, done that. We have leaders in this locker room. It really doesn't matter. If they brought him back, we'd still have a job at hand to do. . . . We believe we can get it done. We just came off a Super Bowl season, so why wouldn't we think that?"
Sheldon Brown,It's hard to listen to negative criticism for a week. But it's good to look it in the face and be a man about it. You need a whipping every now and then to let you know you aren't as good you think you are.
Steve Brown,Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly until you learn to do it well.
Steve Brown,"We are trying to put it together, but we have further to go than we thought. We have the talent and the ability, and now we have to figure out how to put our best races together on the same day."
Steve Brown,"When (former Gov. George Ryan's) administration tried to roll back the sales tax, it just went into the pockets of refiners and retailers and had no effect on prices,"
Steve Brown,"When (former Gov. George Ryan's) administration tried to roll back the sales tax, it just went into the pockets of refiners and retailers and had no effect on prices."
Steve Brown,It is a spending plan that has some spending ideas beyond what we think the revenues are.
Steve Brown,"We'd be happy to take a look at it, but they need to show a revenue source."
Steve Brown,"I just want them to start telling the truth about evolution. Evolution has occurred, but parts of it are flat-out unproven theories. They're not telling students that in school."

Sam Brownback,It is imperative that America remains at the forefront of space exploration and discovery. It is our job here in Congress to take this report and move forward expeditiously in getting Americans in space safely aboard an American vehicle.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"The works of women are symbolical. We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight, producing what? A pair of slippers, sir, to put on when you're weary -- or a stool. To stumble over and vex you... ''curse that stool!'' Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean and sleep, and dream of something we are not, but would be for your sake. Alas, alas! This hurts most, this... that, after all, we are paid the worth of our work, perhaps."

And how I felt it beat under my pillow, in the morning's dark. An hour before the sun would let me read! My books!"
Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Girls blush, sometimes, because they are alive, half wishing they were dead to save the shame. The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow; They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats, and flare up bodily, wings and all. What then? Who's sorry for a gnat or girl?"

Dick Bruna,"I come from a family of business people, but I had the idea I wanted to become an artist."
Dick Bruna,"However, my father was a publisher and it was expected that I would become a publisher as well - in his firm."
Dick Bruna,Each book first begins with a little idea.
Dick Bruna,"But we discovered that, although I liked publishing, the commercial side meant nothing at all to me."
Dick Bruna,But I don't sit down and think: this is meant for children.
Dick Bruna,"Before he went to sleep, I told him a little story about a rabbit we saw run around the beach house we rented."
Dick Bruna,"A few years ago, I had an exhibition at a museum in Holland where, for the very first time, I saw how much Miffy had changed over the years."
Doug Bruno,"I?m really kind of oblivious to it. I think the players are, too. I just think these kinds of streaks come and go, and this one has just kind of happened. I?m impressed by our players? mental ability to respect our opponents."
Doug Bruno,"I think it's fair to call any of the other 10 teams dark horses. These teams that (No. 4) St. John's and DePaul are facing Sunday are capable of beating us, so that makes them a dark horse."
Doug Bruno,"Resurrecting the kids from the Carolina defeat and bringing them back to the point to be able to beat LSU, that's a huge dynamic. That's a huge achievement."
Doug Bruno,"Pitt is a good basketball team. They have talented players, who play at a high level, and are deserving of playing in the next tournament (the NCAA)."
Doug Bruno,"We weren't very smart, which is a nice way to say we played dumb."
Tedy Bruschi,It's the No. 1 stat that we have to win. We always want to get the ball. Make tackles and get the ball.
Tedy Bruschi,"I can play linebacker, that's all, ... We all have our own individual jobs to do and, right now, we all have to get better at doing them."
Tedy Bruschi,"The week preceding the game is just as important, if not more important, to prepare yourself mentally to make sure you know the ins and outs of the opposition. It's all about getting ready for Jacksonville. It's a one-game season."
Tedy Bruschi,"I'm a football player by trade. That's what I do, ... So I did everything I could to make myself a football player again."
Tedy Bruschi,"It's been discouraging at times, to tell you the truth. To see Willie go, especially, and to see Adam go, too. I've been with Willie and Adam for a long time. I spoke with both and wished them well. But the bottom line is this: Move on. We're going to miss them, but they're not going to help us win any football games so I can't focus on who's not here."
Steven Brust,"There are millions of ways for people to die, if you number each vital organ, each ways it can fail, all the poisons from the earth and the sea which can cause these failures."
Steven Brust,"But once you allow yourself to recognize necessity, you find two things: One you find your options so restricted that the only course of action is obvious, and, two, that a great sense of freedom comes with the decision."
Steven Brust,A young man without ambition is an old man waiting to be.
Steven Brust,One nice thing about putting the thing away for a couple of months before looking at it is that you start appreciate your own wit.
Steven Brust,All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool.
Steven Brust,I'd rather be running the game than playing it.
Steven Brust,Minneapolis has two seasons: Road Removal and Snow Repair.
Steven Brust,"Every once in while, a person will do something obvious and direct that is no more than it appears to be. I think they do it to throw you off."

Steven Brust,"No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will cramp his style."
Steven Brust,"To seek understanding before taking action, yet to trust my instincts when action is called for. Never to avoid danger from fear, never to seek out danger for its own sake. Never to conform to fashion from fear of eccentricity, never to be eccentric from fear of conformity."
Jean Bruyere,The exact contrary of what is generally believed is often the truth
Jean Bruyere,"Outward simplicity befits ordinary men, like a garment made to measure for them; but it serves as an adornment to those who have filled their lives with great deeds: they might be compared to some beauty carelessly dressed and thereby all the more attractive."
Jean Bruyere,We are valued in this world at the rate we desire to be valued.
Jean Bruyere,A person's worth in this world is estimated according to the value they put on themselves.
Jean Bruyere,"Nothing more clearly shows how little God esteems his gift to men of wealth, money, position and other worldly goods, than the way he distributes these, and the sort of men who are most amply provided with them."
Jean Bruyere,"Poverty may be the mother of crime, but lack of good sense is the father"
Jean Bruyere,A mediocre mind thinks it writes divinely; a good mind thinks it writes reasonably
Jean Bruyere,"There are certain things in which mediocrity is intolerable: poetry, music, painting, public eloquence. What torture it is to hear a frigid speech being pompously declaimed, or second-rate verse spoken with all a bad poet's bombast!"
Jean Bruyere,A man can keep a secret better than his own. A woman her own better than others.
Jean Bruyere,The sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love

Jean Bruyere,"Avoid lawsuits beyond all things; they pervert your conscience, impair your health, and dissipate your property."
Jean Bruyere,The noblest deeds are well enough set forth in simple language; emphasis spoils them
Jean Bruyere,A position of eminence makes a great person greater and a small person less.
Jean Bruyere,"False greatness is unsociable and remote: conscious of its own frailty, it hides, or at least averts its face, and reveals itself only enough to create an illusion and not be recognized as the meanness that it really is. True greatness is free, kind, familiar and popular; it lets itself be touched and handled, it loses nothing by being seen at close quarters; the better one knows it, the more one admires it."
Jean Bruyere,"It is the glory and merit of some men to write well, and of others not to write at all"
Jean Bruyere,It requires more than mere genius to be an author.
Jean Bruyere,"As long as men are liable to die and are desirous to live, a physician will be made fun of, but he will be well paid"

Jean Bruyere,A man of the world must seem to be what he wishes to be thought.
Jean Bruyere,Liberality consists less in giving a great deal than in gifts well-timed.
Jean Bruyere,"To be among people one loves, that's sufficient; to dream, to speak to them, to be silent among them, to think of indifferent things; but among them, everything is equal."
Jean Bruyere,The great gift of conversation lies less in displaying it ourselves than in drawing it out of others. He who leaves your company pleased with himself and his own cleverness is perfectly well pleased with you.

Jean Bruyere,They that have lived a single day have lived an age.

Jean Bruyere,It's motive alone which gives character to the actions of men.
Jean Bruyere,We can recognize the dawn and the decline of love by the uneasiness we feel when alone together.
Jean Bruyere,Between good sense and good taste there lies the difference between a cause and its effect.
Jean Bruyere,"Making a book is a craft, like making a clock; it needs more than native wit to be an author."
Jean Bruyere,There is no road too long to the man who advances deliberately and without undue haste; there are no honors too distant to the man who prepares himself for them with patience.

Jean Bruyere,"Time makes friendship stronger, but love weaker"

Jean Bruyere,All of our unhappiness comes from our inability to be alone.
Jean Bruyere,The giving is the hardest part; what does it cost to add a smile?
Jean Bruyere,"One seeks to make the loved one entirely happy, or, if that cannot be, entirely wretched."
Jean Bruyere,"At the beginning and at the end of love, the two lovers are embarrassed to find themselves alone."
Jean Bruyere,Politeness makes one appear outwardly as they should be within.
Jean Bruyere,"We should keep silent about those in power; to speak well of them almost implies flattery; to speak ill of them while they are alive is dangerous, and when they are dead is cowardly."
Jean Bruyere,There is not in the world so toilsome a trade as the pursuit of fame; life concludes before you have so much as sketched your work.
Jean Bruyere,"When life is unhappy it is hard to endure, when it is happy it is terrible to think of it ending. Both amount to the same thing in the end."
Jean Bruyere,The regeneration of society is the regeneration of society by individual education.
Jean Bruyere,"From time to time there appear on the face of the earth men of rare and consummate excellence, who dazzle us by their virtue, and whose outstanding qualities shed a stupendous light. Like those extraordinary stars of whose origins we are ignorant, and of whose fate, once they have vanished, we know even less, such men have neither forebears nor descendants: they are the whole of their race."
Jean Bruyere,Out of difficulties grow miracles.
Jean Bruyere,"The duty of a judge is to administer justice, but his practice is to delay it"
Jean Bruyere,"One should never risk a joke, even of the mildest and most unexceptional charters, except among people of culture and wit."
Jean Bruyere,The pleasure we feel in criticizing robs us from being moved by very beautiful things.
Jean Bruyere,"Criticism is often not a science; it is a craft, requiring more good health than wit, more hard work than talent, more habit than native genius. In the hands of a man who has read widely but lacks judgment, applied to certain subjects it can corrupt both its readers and the writer himself."
Jean Bruyere,Logic is the technique by which we add conviction to truth
Jean Bruyere,The wise person often shuns society for fear of being bored.
Jean Bruyere,"There are only three events in a man's life; birth, life, and death; he is not conscious of being born, he dies in pain, and he forgets to live"
Jean Bruyere,"Modesty is to merit, as shades to figures in a picture, giving it strength and beauty"
Jean Bruyere,"No more we meet in yonder bowers Absence has made me prone to roving; But older, firmer hearts than ours, Have found monotony in loving."
David Bryan,We were productive in the '90s. It just was the music scene then was just grunge. We never really lost our following and we never really became a grunge band. We became what we were . . . we just kept evolving what we were into a better us.
David Bryan,"There is solidarity in the industry and if we have to, we'll show them where the food comes from and if it's not on the shelves, they'll realize there's a problem."
David Bryan,"We're a global band. In 1995, we played 42 countries. So when America did that trend, when grunge came in, we didn't change to be that. We stayed true to who we were, played the world and continued to grow."
Andy Bryant,There is no good valuation model to determine the fair value of unexercised employee stock options. Including an unreliable estimate of the fair value of options in the income statement would distort earnings.
Andy Bryant,It's kind of been a nasty winter. One of those that has people talking about making plans to move away.
Andy Bryant,A lot of people believe who spends the most money wins. I don't believe that. It's how you spend the money.
Andy Bryant,"Our response to this downturn will be similar to others in our history, ... It may sound a bit trite, but Intel has the financial strength and management conviction to continue to invest in its key products and processes through these difficult times and emerge a better, more competitive company."
Andy Bryant,Operating results for the quarter are consistent with our outlook in July. We continue to see healthy growth worldwide in the PC market and in Intel's revenue and gross profit.
Andy Bryant,Growth is led by mobile computing with good demand for our mobile processors in all geographies.
Andy Bryant,"Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is 47 percent, plus or minus a couple of points. The change from the second quarter is driven largely by lower average selling prices of microprocessors."
Andy Bryant,"Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is 47 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, ... The change from the second quarter is driven largely by lower average selling prices of microprocessors."
Andy Bryant,"Sometimes it is important to have a different and original idea itself to promote something. Often times, creativity is the key for attention grabbing and instant impact."
Andy Bryant,"This early progress in profitability is the result of a year-long effort and a validation of Intel's conviction that profits, not revenue, finance growth, ... Our financial strategy over the last year has been to preserve profits and protect financial health while proceeding with investments that make Intel more competitive."
Andy Bryant,"The results are consistent with the outlook (we announced) in October. Growth in emerging markets, demand for (notebook computers) and demand in manufacturing are delivering healthy growth in Intel's revenue."
Andy Bryant,Competition is pretty fierce out there right now.
Andy Bryant,"Looking back we are comfortable that our business has stabilized and the year-to-year declines we saw in 2001 are behind us,"
Andy Bryant,It appears that the Intel architecture business will return to seasonal patterns showing more strength in the second half.
Bear Bryant,"He'll never change,"
Bear Bryant,"It's not the will to win, but the will to prepare to win that makes the difference."
Bear Bryant,Bear Bryant's Three Rules for coaching: 1) Surround yourself with people who can't live without football. 2) Recognize winners. They come In all forms. 3) Have a plan for everything.
Bear Bryant,We believe there is nowhere else like this in Exeter and we are offering something different. We have so much here and because the different age groups are separated we can cater for their needs better.
Bear Bryant,"The fun never goes out, but it changes with the years, with winning and losing."
Bear Bryant,"Never quit. It is the easiest cop-out in the world. Set a goal and don't quit until you attain it. When you do attain it, set another goal, and don't quit until you reach it. Never quit."
Bear Bryant,Nearly every coach I've talked with tells me that the attention you get from media and other people is the thing you miss most. I don't know if that's right.
Bear Bryant,"It's been years since I've had a real input in the game anyway. For this game, I've just tried to keep all the other stuff away from the players and coaches."
Bear Bryant,"If we'd beaten 'em, I wouldn't be going out."
Bear Bryant,"If I miss coaching that much, I could go to some little school where they didn't recruit, where all the kids wanted to go. I believe I could find somewhere to coach."
Bear Bryant,"I've had many a player tell me all through high school and right up until signing day that they were coming to Alabama, then they signed with somebody else."
Bear Bryant,I'm happy with the coach we have. I think any one of the ones I asked them to consider would've been good.
Bear Bryant,"I want to make sure I don't interfere with the success of that team next year. I don't see any way I could go to practice like most of 'em do, and not hurt the team. I'd go nuts if I tried doing that."
Bear Bryant,I want to go home while it's quiet around there and get my mail out the first thing. Then I'll help them in recruiting if I can.
Bear Bryant,I think when it really hit me that I had to get out to keep the program from going down was after the Mississippi Southern game this year.
Bear Bryant,"I think I'm telling the truth. I sat by Ray Perkins at the Hall of Fame dinner in New York, and at that time he didn't know he was our coach and I didn't either."
Bear Bryant,There's no substitute for guts.
Bear Bryant,"Show class, have pride, and display character. If you do, winning takes care of itself."
Bear Bryant,"If you believe in yourself and have dedication and pride - and never quit, you'll be a winner. The price of victory is high but so are the rewards."
Bear Bryant,I hope to get out before they start football next year.
Bear Bryant,"I feel bad about it. I've been telling them for 10 years that this had to happen, was going to happen. I think they can get jobs."
Bear Bryant,I can remember loving to recruit. I knew I was going to do my best. But traveling and recruiting doesn't appeal to me any more. It's not as much fun as it used to be.
Bear Bryant,"Georgia Tech beat us and Mississippi Southern tied us last year, and Texas beat us after we had the game won. We only played about five games the way we were capable of playing and lost one of those."
Bear Bryant,You never know how a horse will pull until you hook him to a heavy load.
Bear Bryant,"I plan on staying at Alabama for the rest of my career. I guarantee that I'll be here for you through it all, regardless of what happens."
Bear Bryant,"I didn't have a thing to do with picking a coach, and didn't want to. But I didn't think they'd pick one I didn't like."
Bear Bryant,"Back 12 years ago, when Dr. Mathews was president here, we had a plan that when I got ready to quit, we'd bring a certain guy in and he'd take over that day and I'd leave. But as time wore on, I realized that wouldn't have been good at all."
Bear Bryant,I ain't nothing but a winner.
Bear Bryant,"In a crisis, don't hide behind anything or anybody. They're going to find you anyway."
Bear Bryant,"If you whoop and holler all the time, the players just get used to it."
Bear Bryant,"A good, quick, small team can beat a big, slow team any time."
Bear Bryant,"It's nice to have the opportunity to play for so much money, but it's nicer to win it."
Bear Bryant,Never be too proud to get down on your knees and pray.
Bear Bryant,"There's a lot of blood, sweat, and guts between dreams and success."
Bear Bryant,"Winning isn't everything, but it beats anything that comes in second."
Bear Bryant,No coach has ever won a game by what he knows; it's what his players know that counts.
Bear Bryant,Don't give up at half time. Concentrate on winning the second half.
Bear Bryant,"If anything goes bad, I did it. If anything goes semi-good, we did it. If anything goes really good, then you did it. That's all it takes to get people to win football games for you."
Bear Bryant,There's no use fussing on a boy who doesn't have any ability.
Bear Bryant,"Players can be divided, roughly, into four types. Those who have ability and know it, those who have it and don't know it, those who don't have it and know it, and those who don't have it but don't know it."
Joe Bryant,I'm very excited and a championship is on our mind.
Joe Bryant,"We used to go to the playground and, of course, (Kobe) wanted to shoot the basket. But all the kids wanted to play soccer. So he had to play soccer with Italian kids. He used to be a good goalie."
Joe Bryant,"I told Elizabeth, 'I wish I could go back to bed and wake up and it would be a bad dream,' ... I even asked her if she thought it would work. If I went back to sleep, it would be a bad dream."
Joe Bryant,"It really wasn't (enough), the cost of injury and the cost of accidents have increased so much that those numbers are antiquated. I've seen numerous cases where someone gets in an accident and their $5,000 insurance is not enough and they owe a large additional amount."
Kobe Bryant,"We're starting to play with more of a purpose now, and a clear concept of what we're trying to accomplish out there."
Kobe Bryant,The party?s just getting started. This is where the fun starts.
Kobe Bryant,"Phil and I kind of have an understanding, ... A lot of things are said without being said. I'm the type of person, I can just move on from something."
Kobe Bryant,"If you hear (evacuees) talk on television, it seems that they have a feeling on top of the emotional devastation that they're on an island by themselves. As Americans, we rally around our people. We're going (to Houston) to let them know that we care for them and will be there to support them."
Kobe Bryant,"If you hear (evacuees) talk on television, it seems that they have a feeling on top of the emotional devastation that they're on an island by themselves, ... As Americans, we rally around our people. We're going (to Houston) to let them know that we care for them and will be there to support them."
Kobe Bryant,"His strength is really to get everybody on the same page, ... He's masterful at doing it. We're just going to follow his lead. Anybody who wins that many championships puts the opposition in a defensive position."
Kobe Bryant,"The guy said NBA players are one in a million, ... I said, 'Man, look, I'm going to be that one in a million.'"
Kobe Bryant,"It's such a learning curve. Once you start getting it, it usually comes at the end of the season. Everybody is pretty much in rhythm and in tune with one another, and then you start playing better."
Kobe Bryant,"You guys can go in there anytime. Crack open a book. Expand your imagination and read and learn because that is truly the key to success. The more you know, the more power you gain."
Kobe Bryant,It's a huge honor. I'm very proud to be a part of the team and us trying to gain back what we feel is ours -- and that's the gold medal.
Kobe Bryant,"I absolutely hate it. I just hate it. I don't want to hear any comparisons between me and him. Enough is enough. He had a brilliant career, obviously, one of the greatest careers ever, if not the greatest, and I'm here playing with my team and we're trying to do great things. Just let the past be the past. Just embrace what I'm doing. Stop trying to compare it to what he did. Just enjoy what's going on now."
Kobe Bryant,"I've pretty much done all I can here and, you know, God will carry me the rest of the way, so I'm pretty comfortable with that."
Kobe Bryant,"It doesn't bother me at all. Do I hold any hard feelings? Not at all, ... Life is too short to sit around and hold grudges. I don't hold any whatsoever."
Kobe Bryant,"We just did not execute in overtime, and the execution was really simple, ... They just got the ball to Jason and let him operate."
Kobe Bryant,"We just did not execute in overtime, and the execution was really simple. They just got the ball to Jason and let him operate."
Kobe Bryant,It's their versatility and their execution that sets them apart. They think the game. We've got some catching up to do if we are going to make this a rivalry again.
Kobe Bryant,"We're a really young team that comes into this hostile environment playing against a championship contender. And we didn't play well. I mean, at all. And we found ourselves in a position where we should've won this ballgame."
Kobe Bryant,"I like watching the Pistons. It looks familiar to me. Everybody is on the same page. For me, that's entertaining basketball."
Kobe Bryant,"When we all walked in, you could feel their spirits being uplifted, like they felt very encouraged and happy that we were there. It was just real cool to see that. To be able to go back (to New Orleans), play a game there and be able to uplift them again, that's special."
Kobe Bryant,He's such a quiet kid. That was the most emotion we've seen out of him all year. I think he was waiting for this moment to go in and compete against Shaquille. I had the same thing when I first came into the league (in 1996) and competed against Michael (Jordan).
Kobe Bryant,Not even in my dreams.
Kobe Bryant,"I didn't even know the record existed until a couple of days ago. I never, in my wildest dreams, dreamed of being in such great company like Elgin. There have been a lot of great players in this franchise and I have learned a lot from some of them."
Kobe Bryant,"[? In their summary of the conversation, police said Bryant told them that he should have paid the woman to keep quiet -- and mentioned another NBA player who he said had done that. Bryant said the player would pay women] not to say anything, ... treats a woman with respect, therefore, they shouldn't say anything."
Kobe Bryant,"I'm playing against great players, playing against the best in the world. The competition - that's what I've always wanted."
Kobe Bryant,Sometimes I do wonder what college would have been like. But I made my decision.
Kobe Bryant,"It really doesn't matter to me. We're just talking about clothes. I can understand what the NBA is trying to do. I love my sneakers, but we're just talking about clothes."
Kobe Bryant,"[The circumstances were enough to lead Bryant, who has had to be more vocal as the official leader of the Lakers for the first time, to have a few words before the road trip began.] Before we left, ... I told the guys, 'I don't know about you, but I'm excited about this trip. We all know what people are saying, that by the time we get back from this trip we'll be out of the number eight spot. Well, this is our chance. Let's do something special.'"
Kobe Bryant,"When I was 14 or 15 he started cheating. He'd elbow me in the mouth, rip my lip open."
Kobe Bryant,"Oh, hi Kobe. Yes, well, about the book ..."
Kobe Bryant,"I dont want to be the next Michael Jordan, I only want to be Kobe Bryant."
Kobe Bryant,"Everyting negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise."
Kobe Bryant,"What I'm doing right now, I'm chasing perfection."
Kobe Bryant,These young guys are playing checkers. I'm out there playing chess.
Kobe Bryant,There's been a lot of talk of me being a one-man show but that's simply not the case. We win games when I score 40 points and we've won when I score 10.
Kobe Bryant,My parents are my backbone. Still are. They're the only group that will support you if you score zero or you score 40.
Kobe Bryant,"I'll do whatever it takes to win games, whether it's sitting on a bench waving a towel, handing a cup of water to a teammate, or hitting the game-winning shot."
Kobe Bryant,That is experience and age. They are veterans and knowing what they need to do within their system to maximize the whole. They have guys who are extremely talented.
Kobe Bryant,I just think it's an accomplishment on this path that we're on to try and get back to the top.
Kobe Bryant,"I think it's an accomplishment on this path that we're on to try to get back to the top. It's just about the journey, enjoying the journey, and the accomplishments and achievements that we have along the way just makes the journey that much more exciting."
William Cullen Bryant,"How shall I know thee in the sphere which keepsThe disembodied spirits of the dead,When all of thee that time could wither sleepsAnd perishes among the dust we tread?"
William Cullen Bryant,"Tender pauses speakThe overflow of gladness,When words are all too weak."
William Cullen Bryant,"That delicate forest flower, With scented breath and look so like a smile, Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould, An emanation of the indwelling Life, A visible token of the upholding Love, That are the soul of this great universe."
William Cullen Bryant,"Thy early smile has stayed my walk;But midst the gorgeous blooms of May,I passed thee on thy humble stalk."
William Cullen Bryant,"Autumn, the year's last, loveliest smile."
William Cullen Bryant,"There is a power whose careTeaches thy way along that pathless coast, --"
William Cullen Bryant,"Pain dies quickly, and lets her weary prisoners go; the fiercest agonies have shortest reign"

William Cullen Bryant,"The words of fire that from his penWere flung upon the fervid page,Still move, still shake the hearts of men,Amid a cold and coward age."
William Cullen Bryant,And wrath has left its scar -- that fire of hellHas left its frightful scar upon my soul.
William Cullen Bryant,"But I behold a fearful sign,To which the white men's eyes are blind;Their race may vanish hence, like mine,And leave no trace behind,Save ruins o'er the region spread,And the white stones above the dead."
William Cullen Bryant,"The praise of those who sleep in earth, The pleasant memory of their worth, The hope to meet when life is past, Shall heal the tortured mind at last."
William Cullen Bryant,"Ah! never shall the land forget How gushed the life-blood of her brave -- Gushed, warm with hope and courage yet, Upon the soil they fought to save."
William Cullen Bryant,"Ah! never shall the land forgetHow gushed the life-blood of her brave --Gushed, warm with hope and courage yet,Upon the soil they fought to save."
William Cullen Bryant,Yet will that beauteous image makeThe dreary sea less drearAnd thy remembered smile will wakeThe hope that tramples fear
William Cullen Bryant,"And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side. . . ."
William Cullen Bryant,"To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language."
William Cullen Bryant,Eloquence is the poetry of prose.
William Cullen Bryant,"A stable, changeless state, 'twere cause indeed to weep."
William Cullen Bryant,"All that tread, the globe are but a handful to the tribes, that slumber in its bosom."
William Cullen Bryant,The groves were God's first temples.
William Cullen Bryant,"A world of blossoms for the bee, Flowers for the sick girl's silent room, For the glad infant sprigs of bloom, We plant with the apple tree."
William Cullen Bryant,Poetry is that art which selects and arranges the symbols of thought in such a manner as to excite the imagination the most powerfully and delightfully.
William Cullen Bryant,"Weep not that the world changes - did it keep a stable, changeless state, it were cause indeed to weep."
William Cullen Bryant,"Childhood, with all its mirth,Youth, Manhood, Age that draws us to the ground,And last, Man's Life on earth,Glide to thy dim dominions, and are bound."
John Bryson,"I'm outraged at being abandoned there by the government, ... I felt totally helpless."

It means that even after I die, you can still see my face and hear my voice and speak to me in your heart. For as long as you remember me, I am never entirely lost. When I'm feeling most ghost-like, it is your remembering me that helps remind me that I actually exist. When I'm feeling sad, it's my consolation. When I'm feeling happy, it's part of why I feel that way. If you forget me, one of the ways I remember who I am will be gone. If you forget, part of who I am will be gone.

The stammer of joy at somebody else's joy. Whatever words or sounds you use for sighing with over your own life. These are all prayers in their way. These are all spoken not just to yourself but

Joe Bugel,"He's a mean dude. He'll attack you. You don't have to worry about him holding the flank and blocking for our receivers. I'll tell you what, he's the best without the football we've had. When he doesn't have the ball, he's a raving maniac, and you don't see that too much in the NFL."
Joe Bugel,"You know that's always going to be tough, because we're taking a running back and moving him up to a tight end position. He's coming on, but he's still light years away and it's going to be hard work to make it up in the next three weeks."

Joe Bugel,He is one of the most enjoyable players to coach because he doesn't mind being criticized. He wants to be told what he's doing wrong. He doesn't want you to be his friend. He wants you to be his coach.
Joe Bugel,"Dock's a different man now. He plays at a very high level now. He has bought into everything and he's playing explosively. At 345 pounds, you need to knock people around."
Joe Bugel,"Believe it or not, he was here seven days a week, ... We'd come in on Sundays, and he'd be on that treadmill. And he'd say, 'I'm going to show you, coach. I deserve that money.'"
Joe Bugel,"A lot of times it's appearance, how a guy looks. Is his shirt tucked in, what kind of socks he wears, how he walks. That's very, very important. Because you're being evaluated every minute of the day. Every time you're walking through the lobby, someone is watching you. Because we're talking a lot of money, a very important decision."

Jason Bumblis,"I knew we could force them into a lot of turnovers. When we do give up a basket, we like to come back down the other way and try to get a quick, easy score. That breaks the heart of the other team when you do that. Nobody's been able to run with us all year."
Jason Bumblis,"It was kind of the same thing that happened against Duquesne. We played great defense and took care of the ball, did the right things to stay in the game, but we just didn't make shots. It's a simple game. If you don't do that, it doesn't matter what else you do."
Jason Bumblis,"We don't have a lot of size. We can't control how tall we are, but we can control how well conditioned we are."
Jason Bumblis,"We've tried to jump ahead of teams early to get our confidence and maybe shake the other team's. But Duquesne believes they're the best team every year, so we know they'll have their confidence."

Charlotte Bunch,America is like an unfaithful love who promises us more than we got.
Charlotte Bunch,"Women have a lot to say about how to advance women's rights, and governments need to learn from that, listen to the movement and respond."
Lonnie Bunch,It's important for this museum to have a good idea of the vision of others.

Lonnie Bunch,"This is too important to fail, because it is holding a nation's--holding a people's--culture in my hands, ... My litmus test will be, Would my ancestors be happy?"
Gisele Bundchen,"Sometimes when it's too hot, I just sleep in my underwear. If it's colder, I sleep in pajamas. I don't like to feel closed in. I like no pillows. I like very fluffy beds. I sleep on my stomach and sometimes on my side, but never on my back. Now, if I have my boyfriend with me, I kick him out of bed, because I move around a lot. I'm the worst person. I steal blankets."
Gisele Bundchen,"I'm a very private person. I like staying home and doing my stuff. I hate people invading on my privacy. I hate talking about my private life. You almost feel like they're invading your space, you know? I really hate that. I think that's very disrespectful and I think they should have a law against that."
Gisele Bundchen,"If you have your wife, and you are proud of something she's done, wouldn't you go and support her in something? That is what I was trying to do."
Gisele Bundchen,"The more you trust your intuition, the more empowered you become, the stronger you become, and the happier you become."
Jim Bunning,"We'll leave it there and see what the other major league sports do, ... We are very anxious to rid all professional sports of any ... steroids or amphetamines."
Jim Bunning,"We have heard a lot of talk from professional sports leagues that they would do something to clean up this mess, but so far it has been just that: a lot of talk, ... Hopefully Congress' action will light a fire under their feet to come to an agreement before we do it for them."
Jim Bunning,"The hard line is for the good of the kids,"
Jim Bunning,"Today, Medicare provides health insurance to about 40 million seniors and disabled individuals each year. The number is only expected to grow as the baby boomers begin retiring."
Jim Bunning,"I told him that at the Hall of Fame ceremonies. That's an alternative he has, and I think he should use it. Integrity of the game  where does that put the players union? I think it would be the right thing to do at this point."

Jim Bunning,"If they would take seriously the bills before the Congress and negotiate some kind of settlement that is close to the bills in the House and in the Senate, then I think major league sports and their unions could get away without having legislation passed by the Congress, ... I don't see that happening."
Jim Bunning,"Basically, he says, 'In your face. Twenty games, take it or leave it.' That's completely unacceptable to the Congress,"
Jim Bunning,"It seems as though there are Members in this body who want to filibuster just about everything we try to do, whether it is stopping judicial nominations, the Energy bill, or this Medicare bill."
Jim Bunning,"This offers the fans, I think, the almost certainty that there will be nothing but baseball to worry about. The focus will be on baseball and not on labor unrest."
Jim Bunning,"But what matters now is whether the agreement is followed as it has been outlined to me, other members of Congress and the public,"
Jim Bunning,"This is what I had hoped for all along, for the two private parties to come to an agreement on their own without Congress having to do it for them, ... not as tough as I would like."
Jim Bunning,see what the other major league sports do. ... We hope this agreement by major league baseball will stimulate the other sports to stiffen their penalties.
Jim Bunning,"It's unfortunate we've come to the point where Congress has to take action but the leagues and the players have left us no other choice,"
Jim Bunning,Hopefully Congress' action will light a fire under their feet to come to an agreement before we do it for them.
John Bunting,"I found out I don't have to worry about the quarterback, ... We need to find a way to run the ball. We did not run very well."
John Bunting,I still think there's enough talent that they should be able to find their way on to the field. It will be interesting to see as we play the first couple of games who in fact does touch the field.
John Bunting,"We were focusing on running the ball more in the first half and we stuck with it, ... In the second half, they blitzed about every play."
John Bunting,We wasted a pretty good defensive performance â€” best one we've had around here in a long time.
John Bunting,"You get an opportunity [defensively] at third-and-long, third-and-5, second-and-20, and you let them stay on the field? ... You're not going to win many ballgames that way. We've got to get a heck of a lot better at that."
John Bunting,That was one grand M.O. -- missed opportunity. We have to do a much better job of finishing the job.
John Bunting,They have really put their noses to the grindstone in terms of learning what to do (and are) focusing on the right keys and reads and responding in a way that makes us successful.
John Bunting,"Well, our two-game season is over. The opener and the home opener and we're 0-2. That's the bottom line."
John Bunting,"Kevin has done an outstanding job in improving our football field, ... Our field is among the best in the ACC."
John Bunting,"He's simply the most unique athlete I've ever seen on the football field, and I had [linebacker] Derrick Thomas in Kansas City. Julius just has every tool you want in a football player."
John Bunting,"For me to sit there and tell that the tip of the nose of the football is way up too high to (punter) David Wooldridge, that took him coaching me to learn how to do that,"
John Bunting,an old-fashion clavicle buster.
John Bunting,"I'm not looking for excuses, I'm looking for reasons to win."
John Bunting,"We played with a lot of emotion, then got kicked in the stomach in the third quarter. It's a tough one."
John Bunting,Frank has a proven record as one of the top offensive minds in the country and is the absolute best fit for the North Carolina football program.
John Bunting,I think it's also important for our offensive line to finish blocks. We're still searching for consistency. We've got to finish blocks better and that includes wide receivers that are involved in the run game. And our runners have to continue to get better in terms of their vision in seeing things.
John Bunting,"[Coach John Bunting estimated one or two players lined up out of position on about half the Tar Heels' defensive snaps in Saturday's 69-14 loss.] They took advantage of a lot of mistakes we made on defense, ... They made some big plays, and obviously we made some turnovers, too."
John Bunting,"Mark has a great reputation for developing players and forming relationships with players. He has good character, and other coaches that I have spoken with have nothing but high praise for Mark. His familiarity with Frank and the offense here will help with the transition, and we can be better faster because of his knowledge."
John Bunting,"That game was fierce, ... The most noteworthy thing in my book was how incredibly hard Georgia Tech played in every aspect of the game. We've got to take care of our business and try to play a little bit like the way they played: force the issue, make some plays and don't turn the ball over."

Warren Burger,Crime and the fear of crime have permeated the fabric of American life.
Warren Burger,Respondent's expectation that his garden was protected from observation is unreasonable and is not an expectation that society is prepared to honor.
Warren Burger,"It is not unprofessional to give free legal advice, but advertising that the first visit will be free is a bit like a fox telling chickens he will not bite them until they cross the threshold of the hen house."

Guy Burgess,"The problem of dealing with conflict on a large, sort of society-wide scale, is a bit analogous to building a complex aircraft. You need a whole lot of different parts. You can't fly an airplane with just a jet engine, you need wings, you needs control surfaces, you need avionics, you need a seat for the pilot, fuel tanks, all sorts of stuff."
Guy Burgess,"We can't make the whole system with which society deals with conflict perfect. Can't design it. But we can identify pathological dynamics that make it especially bad. And some of these we know how to fix. There are terrible conflicts that arise out of misunderstandings and people just think someone else is doing something terrible when they're not, and we know how to fix that."
Guy Burgess,"The roster of Nobel Peace Prize winners, though it has some strange people on it from time to time, tends to feature folks who fought for social justice in a nonviolent and constructive way somehow."
Guy Burgess,"We have different personalities and different skills and the kind of things that we do, we can do together that neither of us can do separately. We've been working together so closely that it's kind of hard to decide what's my work and what's her work, it's ours really."
Guy Burgess,"Disarming behavior, where you have two sides involved in a conflict that everybody has stereotypes of the evil other side that is convinced that they would never ever do something reasonable. If a leader on one of those sides were to defy those stereotypes then it would change everything."
Guy Burgess,"One of the reasons we're so fascinated by the Internet, is that it has the ability to eliminate what we call information friction."

Edmund Burke,"I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophists, economists and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is gone forever."
Edmund Burke,Nobody makes a greater mistake than he who does nothing because he could only do a little
Edmund Burke,"He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves, and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper. This amicable conflict with difficulty helps us to an intimate acquaintance with our object, and compels us to consider it in all its relations. It will not suffer us to be superficial."
Edmund Burke,"In this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood; binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic ties; adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family affections; keeping inseparable and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our state, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our altars."
Edmund Burke,"There is a courageous wisdom; there is also a false, reptile prudence, the result not of caution but of fear"
Edmund Burke,Facts are to the mind what food is to the body
Edmund Burke,"Some decent, regulated preeminence, some preference given to birth, is neither unnatural nor unjust nor impolite"
Edmund Burke,"In the weakness of one kind of authority, and in the fluctuation of all, the officers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and full of faction, until some popular general, who understands the art of conciliating the soldiery, and who possesses the true spirit of command, shall draw the eyes of all men upon himself. Armies will obey him on his personal account. There is no other way of securing military obedience in this state of things."
Edmund Burke,"Young man, there is America, which at this day serves for little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners."
Edmund Burke,"A people who are still, as it were, but in the gristle, and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood."
Edmund Burke,"But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever."
Edmund Burke,"Adversity is a severe instructor, set over us by one who knows us better than we do ourselves, as he loves us better too. He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper. This conflict with difficu"

John Burke,We would have our traffic-safety officer review the egress in and out of the driveway.
John Burke,"If you had a high-risk search, he would be the first to go through the door."
John Burke,"He controlled the night in the city of Albany. Everything had to go through him, whether you were working with another agency, you had to go through him. If you wanted to make an arrest, you had to go through him, unless, of course, a cop witnessed a crime."
John Burke,"It's worked out so far, but a wireless alert wouldn't hurt,"
John Burke,"If you remain too local, you become limited and parochial. In the other direction, you can become too detached from the people you are aiming to serve."
Mike Burke,"We made so much progress over the year, going from No. 26 in the preseason all the way to the final eight. But we should have had it. None of that means anything unless we're up there with the final four."
Mike Burke,"That's been our problem all year. We have problems getting in and finishing. If you can't score inside the box, you can't win, and that's what happened tonight. We had the opportunities to put it in and we didn't."
Mike Burke,"For example, our district electricity budget will be approximately $40 million next year whether we have 173,000 students or 176,000 students. However, 3,000 less students could reduce annual operating revenues by $18 million."
Mike Burke,"I think it's human nature to go out there with that mind-set. Defense wins championships, just like the Rhinos used to do."
Robert Burke,They're shopping like women -- more frequently and impulsively.
Robert Burke,It's hard to improve upon perfection.
Robert Burke,It's just something else to have fun with.
Robert Burke,"We at Bergdorf have not been - and are not - interested in the men's collection. The women's has more fashion, more sophistication, and a sexier edge to it."
Robert Burke,"Entirely too much energy of our state police force is spent controlling honest citizens, simply because it is something they can succeed in doing."
Sean Burke,"I didn't have any trouble. One rebound I gave up was a little tentative, but I can't say that I had any trouble. ... It was a good test. I don't see it being any problem at all."
Sean Burke,"They've been in the same school for five years now. I need to get settled first and then maybe they'll come halfway through the year at the (Christmas) break. But, I don't know. It's hard. I will miss them and want them here, but I know how hard it will be on them to move."
Sean Burke,"I like being settled, ... I'm not a guy that wants to get moved around, but it is the reality of the game right now."
Sean Burke,"Then we just went right into scrimmaging with the practice. It was really intense, very organized."
Sean Burke,"It was nice the way we did it getting some goals in the first period. Even though we let them in a little bit in the second, we buckled down in the third. So, overall, it was a great, sound game."
Sean Burke,"If this is a regular-season game, you are unhappy and miserable, but I was only unhappy with two goals that I feel I should have had. But at this point, it was nice just to get into the game-day routine."
Sean Burke,"Two goals I wasn't happy about, but I saw a lot of pucks and that's what you need at this time of year."
Sean Burke,It's the toughest stretch I've been involved with in all the years I've played. It's just a disaster right now.
Sean Burke,"Comfort, that's probably the wrong word. I think the past two games maybe we have been a little too comfortable. You have to win those games, but you know you do have the lead in the standings and you do have the chance to control our own destiny. You have to win those games, and we have to find a way to do that now. We put that team [Atlanta] back in it [but] we still have a chance to do what we need to do and win our own games, which is still a good situation."
Sean Burke,"I can't say that I would do anything differently as a coach, ... You have to go, if you have a guy playing well, you have to play him, that's the way it is."
Sean Burke,"I don't know how good a coach he'll be. But I'm sure if he wants to be a good one, he will. He'll be as competitive as he always was as a player."
Sean Burke,"Under the circumstances, I'd have to say it was. There's been a lot of scrutiny on us lately. But by no means are we out of the woods here. It's one win, but it's a huge win. ... Every night, you have a new opportunity and tonight was nice just to put some of that other stuff behind us."
William Burke,It's any race director's dream to come here. I don't know where else you'd go in the world to have this atmosphere and have all the things going on that we have going on here as in Las Vegas.
William Burke,"Post-9/11, money has been spent on nuclear radiation measurement technology that doesn't work. Here we are again. Are we going to â€¦ take the technology that will actually do the job?"
William Burke,"Post-9/11, money has been spent on nuclear radiation measurement technology that doesn't work. Here we are again. Are we going to take the technology that will actually do the job?"
William Burke,"I am looking forward with great enthusiasm to serving another four years on the AQMD Board, ... We have accomplished a great deal in the last decade, but we also have an enormous challenge ahead of us if we are to succeed in cleaning up the Southlands smog. I really appreciate the confidence placed in me by the Speakers of the Assembly that have appointed me."
Nate Burleson,"I was surprised, but we didn't really struggle because we moved the ball. It's just that at the end of every drive, we made a physical error, and you really can't battle back from those, especially against a very good defense."
Nate Burleson,He was a living legend in my household.
Nate Burleson,"I was very happy to see Randy get in the end zone. That's what he does. He's one of the biggest threats in the game right now, and I know he's going to continue to do well all season."
Nate Burleson,It's always good to be home. This is a business trip. Any kid that plays football would appreciate playing the sport in the town where he grew up.
A.J. Burnett,"It just goes back to let everybody else worry about the Rocket. Let him take the show, and hopefully I can creep in from behind and take their feet out from under them. Them, not Roger."
A.J. Burnett,It [pain in the elbow] came on pretty good in the fourth inning. This really is frustrating for me. I feel about two inches tall. It's tough not to be able to go more than four innings.
A.J. Burnett,"It was mainly the pitch in the second, I felt a little different, no pain, nothing like that as far as the first inning. But I wasn't loose. You know, live arm, the same giddy up that I have had in the past. I was kind of worrying about that and as soon as I threw that pitch I knew what it was."
A.J. Burnett,I had more of an opportunity to use it (yesterday) than in the previous game because I'd given up a hit early in both my innings and had to work from the stretch. I was just working on going over the head with the glove and staying a little more quiet ? with more of a direction towards home plate.
A.J. Burnett,"I was still upset. But I got some good phone calls last night ... and that eased me up a little bit and made me feel better. It's good news, but any setback at this time is not good news. But the best came from it."
A.J. Burnett,"He's just speaking his mind, and that's true, a lot of it is mental. Coming back from this is going to be a lot more mental than physical. But what I was throwing with was not mental. It was pain. When the pain goes out, I just have to get it in my head that I am well and I am ready to go again."
A.J. Burnett,I was really blown away how J.P. spoke about the things he had in mind for this team.
A.J. Burnett,"Not today, the season. It's a waste. ... Kids are out there busting their butts, and there's still nothing but negativity."
A.J. Burnett,Every play they made behind me pumped me up even more and gave me the energy to keep going.
A.J. Burnett,"I have always been a very passionate player and person. I often wear my emotions on my sleeve, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. I hope that my teammates always respect that of me, as I trust they know my commitment to winning. For those I've offended, I offer my most sincere apologies."
A.J. Burnett,"Obviously, there's a step before [pitching on Saturday]. Baby steps. I'm not going to go out and pitch if I'm not ready. The good thing is it's only been a handful of days [since the injury], so I shouldn't be that far behind."
Carol Burnett,"Words, once they are printed, have a life of their own."

Carol Burnett,"I'm so happy that we can share the many years of music and sketches from our shows with the students of UCLA and people interested in the entertainment industry,"
Carol Burnett,Comedy is tragedy plus time.
Carol Burnett,"I have always grown from my problems and challenges, from the things that don't work out, that's when I've really learned."
Carol Burnett,Giving birth is like taking your lower lip and forcing it over your head.
Carol Burnett,"It costs a lot to sue a magazine, and it's too bad that we don't have a system where the losing team has to pay the winning team's lawyers."
Carol Burnett,We don't stop going to school when we graduate.
Daniel Burnham,"Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will themselves not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die."

Bill Burns,"The idea is to get all of this information together and then look at it from a weak-link-in-the-chain-of-preparedness perspective. If you look at how many people need shelter and then you look at potential shelters to see if they will, in fact, fail ... you can find the weak link and fix it."
Bill Burns,"[How parents react can vary dramatically.] Some experience joy, fulfillment, and relief, ... They may see a new world of opportunity opening up before them. They are now free to focus on their own needs. They are free to do things they may not have been able to do for the past 18 years. Other parents will feel loneliness and anxiety â€“ the pain of loss and the anxiety of letting go. They may find themselves asking: 'My work is done. Now what?' Or, 'What is my purpose in life?'"

George Burns,"I like women to be attracted to me. See, when you get 60 years old, and they know you're 60, the only women you can get are 55-year-old women, and I like younger women."
George Burns,"Everyday happiness means getting up in the morning, and you can't wait to finish your breakfast. You can't wait to do your exercises. You can't wait to get out -- and you can't wait to come home, because the soup is hot."

George Burns,Too bad all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxi cabs and cutting hair
George Burns,The reason we're doing this now is because I'm booked to play Pasadena the week of my 100th birthday
George Burns,"People ask me what I'd most appreciate getting for my eighty-seventh birthday. I tell them, a paternity suit."
George Burns,You know you're getting old when you stoop to tie your shoelaces and wonder what else you could do while you're down there.
George Burns,"This is the sixth book I've written, which isn't bad for a guy who's only read two."
George Burns,I'd rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate.
George Burns,"I don't believe in dying. It's been done. I'm working on a new exit. Besides, I can't die now - I'm booked."
George Burns,"Happiness? A good cigar, a good meal, a good cigar and a good woman - or a bad woman; it depends on how much happiness you can handle."
George Burns,"It's good to be here. At 98, it's good to be anywhere."
George Burns,Everything that goes up must come down. But there comes a time when not everything that's down can come up.
George Burns,"You've got to be honest; if you can fake that, you've got it made."
George Burns,"First you forget names, then you forget faces. Next you forget to pull your zipper up and finally, you forget to pull it down."
George Burns,Too bad that all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxicabs and cutting hair.
George Burns,I look to the future because that's where I'm going to spend the rest of my life.
George Burns,"Look to the future, because that is where you'll spend the rest of your life."
George Burns,I can't afford to die; I'd lose too much money.
George Burns,How can I die? I'm booked.
George Burns,Retirement at sixty-five is ridiculous. When I was sixty-five I still had pimples.
George Burns,Too bad all the people who know how to run this country are busy running taxicabs or cutting hair.
George Burns,"If it's a good script I'll do it. And if it's a bad script, and they pay me enough, I'll do it."
George Burns,Be quick to learn and wise to know.
George Burns,"Acting is all about honesty. If you can fake that, you've got it made."
George Burns,Smartness runs in my family. When I went to school I was so smart my teacher was in my class for five years.
George Burns,"If you ask what is the single most important key to longevity, I would have to say it is avoiding worry, stress and tension. And if you didn't ask me, I'd still have to say it."
George Burns,"The most important thing in acting is honesty. If you can fake that, you've got it made."
George Burns,"It takes only one drink to get me drunk. The trouble is, I can't remember if it's the thirteenth or the fourteenth."
George Burns,"The secret of a good sermon is to have a good beginning and a good ending, then having the two as close together as possible."
George Burns,If you live to the age of a hundred you have it made because very few people die past the age of a hundred.

George Burns,Nice to be here? At my age it's nice to be anywhere.
George Burns,"I would go out with women my age, but there are no women my age."
George Burns,I was always taught to respect my elders and I've now reached the age when I don't have anybody to respect
George Burns,I'm at the age now where just putting my cigar in its holder is a thrill.
George Burns,At my age flowers scare me.
George Burns,I smoke ten to fifteen cigars a day. At my age I have to hold on to something.
George Burns,"I'm very pleased to be here. Let's face it, at my age I'm very pleased to be anywhere."
George Burns,I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.

Ken Burns,"[Sometimes, for example, we assume the people hearing us don't know anything. I've read a commentator saying that the new] Jazz ... OK, we got that part, move on."
Ken Burns,"You need, as a historian, essential triangulation from your subject and the only way you get that triangulation is through time."
Ken Burns,"You know, you meet some people, and do a lot of interviews, and you come across a Buck O'Neill and you know you are going to know him for the rest of your life. The same thing happened with Curt Flood."
Ken Burns,You don't work on something for six years and be blind to the myriad of other approaches.
Ken Burns,"You can learn as much about the history from reading about the present as you can vice versa, that is learning about the present through history, which is what I do for a living."
Ken Burns,"Wynton told us that Miles sold out, just wanted to make more money, just wanted to sell more records. I don't believe that Miles sold out but I'm not in a position to say."
Ken Burns,"When you are editing, the final master is Aristotle and his poetics. You might have a terrific episode, but if people are falling out because there are just too many elements in it, you have to begin to get rid of things."
Ken Burns,"When a documentary filmmaker, working in the style that I do, suggests that there has been a shooting ratio of 40 hours to every one hour of finished film, that doesn't mean that the other 39 are bad."
Ken Burns,We're having a hard time understanding where jazz is going. What happened to jazz?
Ken Burns,"To say that an artist sells out means that an artist is making a conscious choice to compromise his music, to to weaken his music for the sake of commercial gain."
Ken Burns,"The way I work, the interview never becomes larger than the person being interviewed."
Ken Burns,The stories from 1975 on are not finished and there is no resolve. I could spend 50 hours on the last 25 years of jazz and still not do it justice.
Ken Burns,"The genius of our country is improvisation, and jazz reflects that. It's our great contribution to the arts."
Ken Burns,"The flame is not out, but it is flickering."
Ken Burns,"One of the things I really like about Ford's films is how there is always a focus on the way characters live, and not just the male heroes."
Ken Burns,"Like a layer on a pearl, you can't specifically identify the irritant, the moment of the irritant, but at the end of the day, you know you have a pearl."
Ken Burns,"Jazz is a very accurate, curiously accurate accompaniment to 20th century America."
Ken Burns,"In most films music is brought in at the end, after the picture is more or less locked, to amplify the emotions the filmmaker wants you to feel."
Ken Burns,"I treat the photograph as a work of great complexity in which you can find drama. Add to that a careful composition of landscapes, live photography, the right music and interviews with people, and it becomes a style."
Ken Burns,I think my expectations for myself are much more severe and much more direct. You can't work on a film for six years without being your own toughest critic. So you can't really be distracted by the expectations based on your previous performance.
Ken Burns,I subscribe to William Faulkner's' view that history is not just about what we were before but who we are now.
Ken Burns,"I record all of my music with authentic instruments in a studio before we start editing, doing many, many versions. The music shapes the film as we edit so it has an organic relationship to the content."
Ken Burns,"I read cover to cover every jazz publication that I could and in the New York Times, every single day reading their jazz reviews even though I didn't put them in the films. I wanted to know what is going on."
Ken Burns,"I never, ever want to apologize for a film. If it's bad I'll say it's my fault. And that's what I can say so far in all the films that I've done, that if you don't like it, it's entirely my fault."
Ken Burns,I have made all my films for my children with the exception of my first film because my oldest daughter wasn't born when I was making the film about the Brooklyn Bridge.
Ken Burns,"I grew up certain for a while that I was going to be an anthropologist, until film turned my head."
Ken Burns,"I enjoy total creative control right now. Nobody tells me to make it longer, shorter, better, sexier, more violent, whatever."
Ken Burns,I don't use composers. I research music the way I research the photographs or the facts in my scripts.
Ken Burns,I can understand why some of these drummers and bass players become cult figures with all of their equipment and the incredible amount of technique they have. But there's very little that I think satisfies you intellectually or emotionally.
Ken Burns,I began to feel that the drama of the truth that is in the moment and in the past is richer and more interesting than the drama of Hollywood movies. So I began looking at documentary films.
Ken Burns,"History is malleable. A new cache of diaries can shed new light, and archeological evidence can challenge our popular assumptions."
Ken Burns,"By its very nature, no one person can ever be the center of jazz."
Ken Burns,A jazz beat is a dynamic changing rhythm.
Ken Burns,History's just been made for sale to an inside deal.
Ken Burns,"In a sense I've made the same film over and over again. In all of them I've asked, 'Who are we as Americans?"
Ken Burns,Louis Armstrong is quite simply the most important person in American music. He is to 20th century music (I did not say jazz) what Einstein is to physics.
Ken Burns,"I think we too often make choices based on the safety of cynicism, and what we're lead to is a life not fully lived. Cynicism is fear, and it's worse than fear - it's active disengagement."
Ken Burns,"Good history is a question of survival. Without any past, we will deprive ourselves of the defining impression of our being."
Ken Burns,I have made a film about jazz that tries to look through jazz to see what it tells us about who we are as a people. I think that jazz is a spectacularly accurate model of democracy and a kind of look into our redemptive future possibilities.
Ken Burns,"I think the problem with a lot of the fusion music is that it's extremely predictable, it's a rock rhythm and the solos all play the same stuff and they play it over and over again and there's a certain musical virtuosity involved in it."
Robert Burns,"This website is not your usual 'read-some-copy, look-at-some-pictures' travel site. I don't know of any other travel Web site that focuses on virtual photographic tours. Travel planners and tourists can now take an online tour around San Diego with 360-degree virtual photography.

Robert Burns,Learn taciturnity and let that be your motto!
Robert Burns,My brother knew this young lady. They went to high school together. It's not like they met one another recently. They've known each other for years.
Robert Burns,When chill November's surly blast make fields and forest bare.
Robert Burns,"Your lines, I maintain it, are poetry, and good poetry.... Friendship... had I been so blest as to have met with you in time, might have led me  God of love only knows where."
Robert Burns,"Morality, thou ly bane, Thy tens o' thousands thou has slain!"
Robert Burns,"I pick my favourite quotations and store them in my mind as ready armour, offensive or defensive, amid the struggle of this turbulent existence."
Robert Burns,The best plans of men and mice often go awry
Robert Burns,Man's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn
Robert Burns,"But to see her was to love her, Love but her, and love forever"
Robert Burns,The golden hours on angel wings  Flew o'er me and my Dearie;  For dear to me as light and life  Was my sweet Highland Mary
Robert Burns,"I want someone to laugh with me, someone to be grave with me, someone to please me and help my discrimination with his or her own remark, and at times, no doubt, to admire my acuteness and penetration."
Robert Burns,The heart and benevolent and kind the most resembles God.
Robert Burns,"Had we never lov'd sae kindly, Had we never lov'd sae blindly, Never met -- or never parted -- we had never been broken-hearted."
Robert Burns,The best laid schemes o' mice and men Gang aft a-gley; And leave us naught but grief and pain For promised joy
Robert Burns,Fain would I hide what I fear to discover
Robert Burns,"While Europe's eye is fix'd on mighty things, The fate of empires and the fall of kings; While quacks of State must each produce his plan, And even children lisp the Rights of Man; Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention, The Rights of Woman merit"
Robert Burns,Critics! Those cut-throat bandits in the paths of fame.
Robert Burns,"Inspiring bold John Barleycorn! / What dangers thou canst make us scorn! / Wi' tippenny, we fear nae evil; / Wi' usquebae, we'll face the devil!"
Robert Burns,And there begins a lang digression about the lords o' the creation.
Tommy Burns,"It's funny because I played offensive guard in high school, ... I didn't move to defensive end until I came to Valley."
Tommy Burns,"I was born into a drug infested environment back in October of 1984, ... I witnessed things that many only see in movies. I saw a lot of gang violence and drug use while I was growing up. I used to see people dying all around me."
Tommy Burns,There is a doubt about him and I wouldn't think the manager would risk him if he isn't 100 percent because we need everyone on the button for this game.
Tommy Burns,"With that, I sort of became numb to my surroundings and soon was dealing with all this corruption around me,"
Richard Burr,"The terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, changed the way we think about security."
Richard Burr,"We often take for granted that our lights will come on when we flip the light switch, but the reality is that our reliability standards and the current state of the transmission grid leave us all vulnerable to blackouts."
Richard Burr,"He (McVeigh) is deeply concerned and always has been about police overreaching, particularly federal police. And this is a case where we now know partly that the FBI has done a lot of covering up, delaying things, not wanting to give over things, and our research suggests that there's a whole lot more of that, and that they're not now being honest that they've given us everything. So we think it's very serious."

Richard Burr,"I have never quite been able to imagine how one does it, but I've seen many people do it, and it is a process of gathering one's own internal strength."
Richard Burr,We're not using Waco as an excuse. Waco is an event that happened that many people felt impassioned about. One of them was Tim McVeigh.
Richard Burr,"If Tim changed his mind, a petition could be filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, but that's not going to happen."
Richard Burr,Do you love the Tim in this picture?
Richard Burr,"When you sift through the realities, ... you will come to the conclusion that the right sentence is a life sentence."
Richard Burr,"Where we are right now is having a considerable amount of evidence that the FBI is still withholding information. What has been turned over and what has not been turned over, together, create a tapestry of what we believe is a fraud on the court perpetrated by the government."
Richard Burr,"see through the stereotypes, which were made due to a lack of information."
Richard Burr,"If there are witnesses the government interviewed who suggest other people were involved or that Tim McVeigh was not involved, those are critical matters that would have to be investigated."
Richard Burr,"This good young man believed that the federal government was the enemy,"
Richard Burr,It is critical that we have a comprehensive energy plan to provide affordable and reliable supplies of energy so that our economy will not be dependent on foreign sources of energy.
Richard Burr,"Thirty-one states have a 211 presence, but until 100 percent of North Carolina and 100 percent of the country is involved, we haven't finished our job,"
Richard Burr,Congress must not do something just for the sake of doing something. We must carefully and thoughtfully consider the implications of any action and whether that action will help or hinder our ultimate mission of protecting U.S. citizens from terror.
Richard Burr,People in this community rejected that. We don't know why.
Richard Burr,They usually pray for the governing body that they make the right decisions during the year.
Plaxico Burress,We've got kind of one of those offenses where we respond when we need to. I just wish we could've responded a little earlier.
Plaxico Burress,"Last year taught me to just take my job more seriously, ... I have to remember that I'm doing what I love to do and I've got the best job in the world. I've got to treat it that way."
Plaxico Burress,Three or four balls just doesn't suit me very well.
Plaxico Burress,I want to go out and show my ability and what I can do.
William Burroughs,Man is an artifact designed for space travel. He is not designed to remain in his present biologic state any more than a tadpole is designed to remain a tadpole.
William Burroughs,A functioning police state needs no police.
William Burroughs,"Black magic operates most effectively in preconscious, marginal areas. Casual curses are the most effective."
William Burroughs,Language is a virus from outer space.
William Burroughs,Your knowledge of what is going on can only be superficial and relative.
William Burroughs,In deep sadness there is no place for sentimentality.
William Burroughs,"My general theory since 1971 has been that the word is literally a virus, and that it has not been recognized as such because it has achieved a state of relatively stable symbiosis with its human host; that is to say, the word virus (the Other Half) has established itself so firmly as an accepted part of the human organism that it can now sneer at gangster viruses like smallpox and turn them in to the Pasteur Institute."
William Burroughs,The face of evil is always the face of total need.
William Burroughs,There couldn't be a society of people who didn't dream. They'd be dead in two weeks.
William Burroughs,Which came first the intestine or the tapeworm?
William Burroughs,"Writing prejudicial, off-putting reviews is a precise exercise in applied black magic. The reviewer can draw free-floating disagreeable associations to a book by implying that the book is completely unimportant without saying exactly why, and carefully avoiding any clear images that could capture the reader's full attention."
William Burroughs,Smash the control images. Smash the control machine.
William Burroughs,How I hate those who are dedicated to producing conformity.
William Burroughs,"So cheat your landlord if you can and must, but do not try to shortchange the Muse. It cannot be done. You can't fake quality any more than you can fake a good meal."
William Burroughs,The youth rebellion [1968] is a worldwide phenomenon that has not been seen before in history. I do not believe they will calm down and be ad execs at thirty as the Establishment would like us to believe.
William Burroughs,"Any belief in Creators or Purpose is wishful thinking. And when you point out that perhaps ALL thinking is wishful, reactions of intense irritation give evidence that we are not dealing with logic but with faith."
William Burroughs,"If you rap your knuckles against a window jamb or door, if you brush your leg against a bed or desk, if you catch your foot in a curled-up corner of a rug, or strike a toe against a desk or chair, go back and repeat the sequence. You will find yourself surprised how far off course you were to hit that window jamb, that door, that chair. Get back on course and do it again. How can you pilot a spacecraft if you can't find your way around your own apartment?"
William Burroughs,"America is not a young land: it is old and dirty and evil before the settlers, before the Indians. The evil is there waiting."
William Burroughs,America is not so much a nightmare as a non-dream. The American non-dream is precisely a move to wipe the dream out of existence. The dream is a spontaneous happening and therefore dangerous to a control system set up by the non-dreamers.
William Burroughs,My purpose in writing has always been to express human potentials and purposes relevant to the Space Age.
William Burroughs,In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen.
William Burroughs,It is doubtful if shame can exist in the absence of sexual libido.
Cliff Burton,"When a man lies, he murders some part of the world. These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives. All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?"
Cliff Burton,You don't burn out from going too fast. You burn out from going too slow and getting bored.
Cliff Burton,"Why should we change onstage? We're not trying to be something big and fancy, it's just us, doing what we do, we'd like to keep it that way."
Cliff Burton,We do what we want. We don't care what anyone else thinks.
Cliff Burton,To live is to die.
Cliff Burton,"Personally, I would say the 'master' of this whole thing is fate... Whoever is on the playing field is fair game, and it's up to them to avoid being used."
Cliff Burton,"Every once in awhile we may fall on our face, but we insist on doing what we wanna do."
Cliff Burton,Control your life through insanity.
David Burton,"Everyone's vision is that Wellington can be more than the winter equestrian capital. I think it can be the equestrian capital -- winter, spring and fall."
David Burton,"Japan's recovery is really firmly based and it is driven by domestic demand. For the rest of Asia, the pace of growth is expected to continue at a decent level this year and next."
David Burton,"I think it (Japan's economic outlook) will certainly be revised upwards, probably significantly, in light of the strong performance recently."
David Burton,"It also occurred to me, what's the nature of the emergency? They did not point that out."
David Burton,"I know what itâ€™s like, ... I know what these men are going through. I know every one of them, and it pains me that Iâ€™m not over there with them."
David Burton,"There is scope to do more, ... a favorable environment to allow greater exchange rate flexibility."
David Burton,"I think everybody feels a little bit of compassion, that wants to help out in some way and this is our kids'â€š way of wanting to do it. The kids really initiated everything."
Richard Burton,The Welsh are all actors. It's only the bad ones who become professional.
Richard Burton,I've done the most awful rubbish in order to have somewhere to go in the morning.
Richard Burton,Little islands are all large prisons: one cannot look at the sea without wishing for the wings of a swallow.
Richard Burton,Indeed he knows not how to know who knows not also how to un-know.
Richard Burton,"False friendship, like the ivy, decays and ruins the walls it embraces; but true friendship gives new life and animation to the object it supports."
Richard Burton,This diamond has so many carats it's almost a turnip.
Richard Burton,"How strange are the tricks of memory, which, often hazy as a dream about the most important events of a man's life, religiously preserve the merest trifles."
Richard Burton,"An actor is something less than a man, while an actress is something more than a woman."
Richard Burton,"If you're going to make rubbish, be the best rubbish in it."
Richard Burton,When I played drunks I had to remain sober because I didn't know how to play them when I was drunk.
Richard Burton,Our July was a record month as far as total vehicle sales for cars and trucks.
Richard Burton,"The County salutes the tremendous contributions of groups such as the American Red Cross and also the potential assistance of community and faith-based organizations, and looks forward to partnering with them as we seek to come along side those in need,"
Richard Burton,Travelers are like poets. They are mostly an angry race.
Richard Burton,"Some people may want to look at a new car, but then not want to invest that much. And then they switch over to a used car."
Richard Burton,I might run from her for a thousand years and she is still my baby child. Our love is so furious that we burn each other out.
Richard Burton,You may be as vicious about me as you please. You will only do me justice.
Richard Burton,"I rather like my reputation, actually, that of a spoiled genius from the Welsh gutter, a drunk, a womanizer; it's rather an attractive image."
Richard Burton,"How strange are the tricks of memory, which, often hazy as a dream about the most important events of a man's life, religiously preserve the merest trifles"
Richard Burton,"There is no Heaven, there is no Hell; These are the dreams of baby minds; Tools of the wily Fetisheer, To fright the fools his cunning blinds"
Richard Burton,They lard their lean books with the fat of others work.
Richard Burton,"At 34 she is an extremely beautiful woman, lavishly endowed by nature with a few flaws in the masterpiece: She has an insipid double chin, her legs are too short and she has a slight potbelly. She has a wonderful bosom, though."
Leo Buscaglia,Each of our acts makes a statement as to our purpose.
Leo Buscaglia,When we cling to pain we end up punishing ourselves.
Leo Buscaglia,"No amount of time can erase the memory of a good cat, and no amount of masking tape can ever totally remove his fur from your couch."
Leo Buscaglia,Time has no meaning in itself unless we choose to give it significance.
Leo Buscaglia,"Love yourselfâ€”accept yourselfâ€”forgive yourselfâ€”and be good to yourself, because without you the rest of us are without a source of many wonderful things."
Leo Buscaglia,Most of us are pawns in a game of love we don't understand.
Leo Buscaglia,"The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing, and becomes nothing. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn and feel and change and grow and love and live."
Leo Buscaglia,"Love is not some complex, mystical abstraction. It is something accessible and human that we learn through our everyday experience, as often at times of failure as in moments of ecstasy."
Leo Buscaglia,Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations. Don't over-analyse your relationships. Stop playing games. A growing relationship can only be nurtured by genuineness.
Leo Buscaglia,"A loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself -- to laugh with me, but never at me; to cry with me, but never because of me; to love life, to love himself, to love being loved. Such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart."
Leo Buscaglia,"Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain"
Leo Buscaglia,"Love can never grow old. Locks may lose their brown and gold. Cheeks may fade and hollow grow. But the hearts that love will know, never winter's frost and chill, summer's warmth is in them still."
Leo Buscaglia,"Don't hold to anger, hurt or pain. They steal your energy and keep you from love."
Leo Buscaglia,Find the person who will love you because of your differences and not in spite of them and you have found a lover for life.
Leo Buscaglia,Happiness and love are just a choice away.
Leo Buscaglia,It is difficult for some people to accept that love is a choice. This seems to run counter to the generally accepted theory of romantic love which expounds that love is inborn and as such requires no more than to accept it.
Leo Buscaglia,"I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, 'No, I won't do it, I won't behave his way anymore. I'm lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving,' and then you do it."
Leo Buscaglia,"There are two big forces at work, external and internal. We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, disasters, illness and pain. What really matters is the internal force. How do I respond to those disasters? Over that I have complete control."
Leo Buscaglia,Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.
Leo Buscaglia,"Love always creates, it never destroys. In this lie's man's only promise."
Leo Buscaglia,Don't smother each other. No one can grow in shade.
Leo Buscaglia,We all need each other.
Leo Buscaglia,Only the weak are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.
Leo Buscaglia,"I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, No, I won't do it, I won't behave his way anymore. I'm lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving and then you do it."
Leo Buscaglia,"What love we've given, we'll have forever. What love we fail to give, will be lost for all eternity."
Leo Buscaglia,We are no longer puppets being manipulated by outside powerful forces: we become the powerful force ourselves.
Leo Buscaglia,Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself.
Leo Buscaglia,Don't smother each other. No one can grow in the shade.
Leo Buscaglia,Life lived for tomorrow will always be just a day away from being realized.
Leo Buscaglia,"If I don't have wisdom, I can teach you only ignorance."
Leo Buscaglia,"If we wish to free ourselves from enslavement, we must choose freedom and the responsibility this entails."
Leo Buscaglia,It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them.
Leo Buscaglia,Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations.
Leo Buscaglia,Change is the end result of all true learning.
Leo Buscaglia,The easiest thing to be in the world is you. The most difficult thing to be is what other people want you to be. Don't let them put you in that position.
Leo Buscaglia,"Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."
Leo Buscaglia,"Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy."
Leo Buscaglia,Life is uncharted territory. It reveals its story one moment at a time.
Leo Buscaglia,"The fact that I can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another's, smile at someone and receive a smile in return, are to me continual spiritual exercises."
Leo Buscaglia,I still get wildly enthusiastic about little things... I play with leaves. I skip down the street and run against the wind.
Leo Buscaglia,"Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life."
Leo Buscaglia,"Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love."
Leo Buscaglia,What we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life.
Leo Buscaglia,"A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world."
Kyle Busch,"I can't see what I'm doing from inside the race car while I'm outside it, so I guess I'll have to have a sit-down (with Stewart) and figure out what went wrong. I want to clear the air because I don't want to get dumped at Atlanta. Atlanta will hurt."
Kyle Busch,"I know Jimmie is a chase driver, but it doesn't much matter to me, I'm trying to race as hard as I can to win,"
Kyle Busch,It's a really great race track the way it is now.
Kyle Busch,"With about 40 laps to go, it's time to race and time to get after it and that's what I was doing. If I did something and aggravated Stewart, well, I'm sorry."
Kyle Busch,That young man has been impressive!
Kyle Busch,"All in all, it's just a great experience to be out here and run with the best of them. We need to build a championship team for next year."
Kyle Busch,We talked a little bit. It was a good conversation. A civil one. We just talked about what I aggravated him with last week and we both decided to move along and see how we can race the rest of the year.
Kyle Busch,We're trying to get there. It would be exciting to put our names in the record books as brothers.
Gary Busey,I've been told by doctors and surgeons that I have the energy of ten men who have normal jobs.
Gary Busey,Fear is the dark room where the Devil develops his negatives.
Gary Busey,"Imagine the peace symbol. The peace symbol has three pieces in it. One piece is emotion, that's your body. Another piece has spirit in it, that's your fuel. Another piece has intellect in it and that's your steering wheel. You can never overdo the fuel that goes into the body, which is the emotions and the steering wheel to drive it."
George H. W. Bush,"Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more, it is a matter of expecting more."
George H. W. Bush,"I am mindful of the difference between the executive branch and the legislative branch. I assured all four of these leaders that I know the difference, and that difference is they pass the laws and I execute them."
George H. W. Bush,it is possible for good people to disagree on this issue.
George H. W. Bush,I think I'd be a better president because I was in combat.
George H. W. Bush,"I have opinions of my own, strong opinions, but I don't always agree with them."
Reggie Bush,"Whatever happens in this game, it won't have any effect on me. Obviously it will just [affect] who gets the first pick in the NFL draft. ... Like I said from Day 1, I won't be worried about it until after the season."
Reggie Bush,This has all been blown out of proportion due to my public image. There is nothing to worry about. We've done nothing wrong.
Reggie Bush,The relationships that I have built here with my teammates and with the students here has been great. It's something that will last forever.
Reggie Bush,"It's going to be a great, long relationship."
Reggie Bush,We pride ourselves on being able to make those kinds of plays. We were surprised they came up with the stop there.
Reggie Bush,I'm hoping to be the No.1 pick. That's what I'm planning.
Reggie Bush,"We've been looking for a house for two to three months. I was looking for a house for my parents, something to take care of them. That's the fun thing about this process. You get to buy your parents nice things. It just happened that we found one."
Reggie Bush,I'm not too disappointed. It is the nature of the beast.
Reggie Bush,I shoved him as hard as I could.
Reggie Bush,It's like everybody is telling me I'm going pro. They're not giving me an option. Everybody else feels like I should go pro. Right now I'm not worried about that.
Reggie Bush,"All the hype is going to be there, everything from outside is going to be there for a great game."
Reggie Bush,I think I'm overdue for a punt return. We wanted to really focus on putting fear back in people's hearts of kicking deep to us.
Reggie Bush,"I'm taking this whole experience in and just enjoying being back here, playing for the national championship in Los Angeles. It isn't getting sweeter than that."
Reggie Bush,"That just means that the Texans get the first pick, and that's it. There's no real emotion that played into it. Like I said, I'm not even focused on what's going on with the NFL right now. We need to be worried about what's going on with this game and winning the national championship."
Reggie Bush,"I thought, this is what college football is all about. I thought, these are the moments you remember forever."
Reggie Bush,I have faith in him and his play-making ability. Just the fact I know Matt and I know what kind of player he is. He's not going to give up. He's not always going to win the game with his arm.
Reggie Bush,He's a game breaker just like I am. And he has the ability to do the same thing. You have to respect a guy like him.
Reggie Bush,"I could see where people could make that comparison (of Bush with Sayers). With all the cut-backs, ability to make people miss, I could see some similar characteristics."
Sophia Bush,"To be happy, it first takes being comfortable being in your own shoes. The rest can work up from there."
Sophia Bush,Sometimes people play hard to get to know that the other person's feelings are real
Sophia Bush,Marriage is not about age; it's about finding the right person.
Nolan Bushnell,"Blood and gore loses its cartoon defense. If you think we've got problems now, you'll see we have additional problems once the cartoon defense goes away."
Nolan Bushnell,The ultimate inspiration is the deadline.
Nolan Bushnell,"The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer."
Nolan Bushnell,"Everyone who's ever taken a shower has an idea. It's the person who gets out of the shower, dries off and does something about it who makes a difference."
Jerry Buss,"[In a rebuttal to recent published reports, Lakers owner Jerry Buss said that he has not reached any understanding with Jackson about returning as Lakers coach and denied that Jackson wants the role of team president. Jackson said Saturday night that he would wait until June to make a decision about returning to coaching. He said he was still trying to gauge his emotional and mental readiness after 11 months away from basketball.] Phil has very definitely told me that he is capable of coaching, ... He has not told me whether he wants to coach or not. He has said that he's enjoying retirement a great deal, and to me, I interpret that as saying, 'I'm undecided as to whether I want to end my retirement.'"
Jerry Buss,"You're sitting and watching, and it's like a miracle unfolding in front of your eyes and you can't accept it. Somehow, the brain won't work. The easiest way to look at it is everybody remembers every 50-point game they ever saw. He had 55 in the second half."
Jerry Buss,"We're very pleased to have Phil return to the Lakers as our head coach, ... His record speaks for itself and his success in this sport is unparalleled. Quite simply, Phil is the best coach in the business and probably the greatest coach of all time."
Jerry Buss,"We're very pleased to have Phil return to the Lakers as our head coach. His record speaks for itself and his success in this sport is unparalleled. Quite simply, Phil is the best coach in the business and probably the greatest coach of all time."
Mike Butcher,I'm looking forward to having a good season with these guys and developing some quality Major League pitchers. I know we have some really good arms here. I am excited to work with them. They seem very excited.
Mike Butcher,"Quality pitches in the zone on your first three pitches, and two out of your first three pitches for strikes. We'd like for a pitcher to throw 12 to 15 pitches an inning."
Mike Butcher,"Power arm. Power stuff. This guy has a plus-plus fastball, 92 to 98 (mph). This guy can really bring it."
Mike Butcher,We haven't even started throwing breaking balls yet and there's a tremendous amount of potential there. To see the aptitude out of him right away is very promising.
Mike Butcher,Stick with what works. Kenny did a tremendous job with him.
Mike Butcher,"I think I have some ideas. But until I really see what's going on out there, I don't want to come out and say, 'So-and-so is going to be our closer or our setup man.' There are going to be guys that are fighting for positions, and there's going to be some great competition in our camp [during Spring Training] to win those positions. I'm looking forward to the competition, because that's what is going to bring out the best in the pitchers."
Mike Butcher,"You can not be afraid when you get to this level to teach. I don't care what level you're at, if you don't teach, you're worthless."
Mike Butcher,We're looking for a guy that can step it up.
Mike Butcher,"You give them recommendations. You throw different angles at them where, hopefully, they can get something out of it."
Mike Butcher,"I like what he's doing, and I really like his work ethic. He has good baseball instincts and he's made a very good impression."
Mangosuthu Buthelezi,"So long as the Zulu people are here, clearly I will still have a role to play in this country."
Mangosuthu Buthelezi,I remain your servant and I will do as you ask of me.
Mangosuthu Buthelezi,"AIDS is the biggest challenge, the major disaster facing this country and we would have wished for something more specific and far-reaching."
Mangosuthu Buthelezi,I was proud to call Dr Rupert a friend. He was always a wonderful source of support and kindness.
Mangosuthu Buthelezi,"Definitely, without a doubt, the president of the IFP knew of all these things."
Mangosuthu Buthelezi,"I am horrified by Cosatu's call to the President to break his oath of office, as well breach the Constitution, by interfering in the administration of justice in respect of the (Jacob) Zuma case,"
Brett Butler,Dreams that do come true can be as unsettling as those that don't
Brett Butler,"And he just left it at that, ... I don't know if it was his choice, their (the Diamondbacks') choice, somebody else's choice, but they make their decisions accordingly and for whatever reason, they felt they had to make some changes."
Brett Butler,Dreams that do come true can be as unsettling as those that don't.
Brett Butler,"The beginning of my sin, if you will, was thinking that it was all a mistake and that I absolutely didn't deserve any of it. I'll tell you, bringing down my own creation that way was as grandiose a way of playing God as you could imagine."
Brett Butler,The most dramatic realization was that in surrender I would find more freedom and power than I'd ever known.
Brett Butler,"I have more love in me than not, I have more hope in me than not, and I have more faith than I used to. I just want to get out of the way of what I've been given, so I can do it right."
Brett Butler,"Instead my life has been like being mashed and mashed through a wine press until finally there will be nothing left but the desire to live by divine will, knowing what I'm really supposed to do and doing it."
Brett Butler,I feel really grateful to have been part of what I considered a good TV show.
Caron Butler,That has been our focus all year and now we're starting to feel comfortable playing defense. We have to keep turning it up. I think the difference is that we're trusting each other more than we did at the beginning of the season.
Caron Butler,"When things go bad, they go all the way bad. That's good. We got an opportunity to feel that early on in the playoffs."
Caron Butler,"It was big, yeah, but we felt all along that we were going to win this game -- all night long. We've been trying to get over the hump on the road. We've had some tough losses, games we thought we should have won. Tonight we weren't going to let someone beat us."
Caron Butler,I thought he still played great â€” 26 (points) and nine (rebounds). That's a bad night for him? That's unbelievable.
Caron Butler,"I'm just happy because this is such a great situation for me and my family, ... I know a good fit when I see one and from the time I arrived here in Washington, the organization has made me and my family feel so welcome. I'm excited about knowing that my future will be with this team."
Caron Butler,Beating them earlier in the season at home gave us confidence coming into the game tonight. We felt like we were only a couple of possessions away from getting a win tonight.
Caron Butler,"Coach is a player's coach, ... He gets real involved in what's going on, so I had to give him a little high-five."
Caron Butler,"We were rushing things. We were doing a lot of things that were out of character. Coach showed us films. He showed us that our offense works. Obviously, we know that. We just have to stick with it."
Caron Butler,"With the adversity I've been through in my life, he helped me through it. He's a great man. I'm just happy to be in the circle. I love you for that, coach."
Caron Butler,"When you go through adversity, either you are going to bail out or you come together. This team came together and got closer. I think that's why we're being so successful right now because we're so tight. I just think the chemistry is coming together slowly but surely. It is coming together more and more."
Caron Butler,"I think the character of this team has already been revealed in the face of adversity. Early on, when a lot of people were writing us off, I think we bounced back. Coach did a great job of getting the right guys out there, the rotation was good and we stepped up. Now this is another challenge. We've got to step up. It's a must that we go .500 or better, and I think we are prepared to do that."
Caron Butler,We're confident. We don't doubt our ability to go out and have a successful trip.
Chris Butler,"There is more than enough food, water, fuel and so on to satisfy the actual needs of everyone on the planet. But there is not enough to satisfy everyone's greed. Even if it were physically possible for you to consume all the food, water, and fuel in the world, you still would not be satisfied. â€œMaterial foodâ€ cannot satisfy spiritual craving. Since the materialist is never satisfied, he never feels that he has had enough."
Chris Butler,"Come competition time, most of the things they may be using will be out of the system."
Chris Butler,"She might not have anything now but the clothes on her back, but she does have her life."
David Butler,"If the safety inspection isn't perfect, if the weather isn't perfect, that tanker waits,"
David Butler,"Nobody can predict what nature's imagination can do, so we have to be prepared, ... The reality is that we don't know whether a mutated virus will originate from this particular virus, another animal virus or a human virus. This doesn't change the need for our advance planning and preparation in order to minimize the impact."
David Butler,People are leaving for the same reasons they always have: they want more space and freedom.
David Butler,"To me this millipede is more the kind of thing that Tom is famous for. It is a little weird, it's cute, and it's a little threatening, this giant bug that could eat you -- but it's also wearing little shoes and a bowler hat. It's whimsical and frightening at the same time."
David Butler,"While we consider AOL's announcement a step in the right direction, it is still hard to trust AOL's motives to do what's best for competition as opposed to what's in their best interest. They are not interested in a legal obligation."
David Butler,But the growth in satellite radio has shown that people will pay for it if we give them more choices and better technology.
Gerard Butler,"I used the physical deformity to a certain extent by conducting research into physical deformities, but I used a more internal thing. I think the physical deformity represented emotional deformities; things inside ourselves which don't allow us fully to be open to love or to be loved. It was more the effect of that deformity that I was focusing on, and it was more of an interior journey into my own dark spaces."
Gerard Butler,"I had never done that before-singing while trying to give a cinematic performance. The temptation is to open your mouth and belt it out and do something theatrical, which would just be ghastly because every time you open your mouth it's 30 feet wide on a big screen."
Gerard Butler,"The Phantom, as well as being backed up by that music, it just so was a role that I identified with so powerfully. From the first second that I walked on to perform."
Gerard Butler,On Phantom... I listened to the music while I was reading the script. And it had just blown me away. I really... I was so excited about it. It's been a long time since I really got so excited about something.
Gerard Butler,"I was training to be a lawyer... I was president of the law society at Glasgow University, and my bass guitarist was my secretary of my law society; the lead guitarist and writer worked at the law firm that I worked."
Gerard Butler,"Generally I don't like doing remakes, but I think that's more in the cynical world of Hollywood where normally remakes are purely for commercial reasons."
Gerard Butler,"I'm sure, at the end, you can never keep everybody happy, especially the Scots-I hate to say this-if you're dealing with one of their national heroes. No matter what way you do it, there's no way you'll keep everybody happy. So I'll expect some praise, and I'm sure I'll get a lot of abuse."
Gerard Butler,"If I think the movie's not going to turn out, I quickly try and disassociate those feelings and push myself away... ."
Gerard Butler,"I love to do films of all shapes and sizes and feelings and genres. So for me to go from Tomb Raider straight into Dear Frankie, there's nothing that excites me more than to keep mixing it up."
Gerard Butler,"I have a level of fear going into every project, and that's what keeps me going."
Gerard Butler,"The poem is much more about pure good versus pure evil. Whereas the movie, Beowulf goes to take on this troll who they all perceive as a demon and filthy and ignorant and sadistic, only to discover that that's not actually the case."
Gerard Butler,"If you just tell the story of what the story's about, then it sparks curiosity, but I think it also arouses suspicion, as you say, that it could be overly sentimental. But it so isn't. And I think it was all about doing the inner work and then underplaying everything."
Gerard Butler,"When I went to Scotland to do another movie, I would sing with a coach up there and then when I went to New York I sang with a coach over there-I mean I've now sung with coaches in LA, New York, London, Glasgow, St Louis and Rio de Janeiro!"
Gerard Butler,"Angelina had wanted a stronger male character to play opposite her, and I think one of the other advantages in that was a sense of competition."
Gerard Butler,"If you abandoned yourself to that world and that character and that period surrounded by extras in the same period clothing and costumes and listening to that music all the time, you give in and you let that music become a part of your soul. Then you can live it and breathe it, which is really what I was trying to do."
Jean Butler,"The progress has been fantastic, phenomenal."
Jean Butler,It gives the new people an opportunity to step up.
Jean Butler,We decided to go with New Horizons because it's designed to give seniors the opportunity to perform music.
John Butler,"We're not looking for a rate cut, ... The UK does not need it. House prices and retail sales are holding up well. This island is relatively strong but we do expect another rate cut in coming months."
John Butler,"In the past we used to draft and let guys have two or three years to really learn before they got thrown in there. Those days are gone. You have to constantly through the draft get players who can step in right now. That's the key to it. Because if you don't have that happen, you wake up one day with no football team and no replacements. It's really pretty simple."
John Butler,"My goal was to go down there and rescue a small family or two,"
John Butler,"This is one of the biggest problems facing the economy, bigger even, perhaps, than the consumer slowdown."
John Butler,The issue is whether discovery is relevant here.
John Butler,"It is questionable whether this level of job creation is sustainable as productivity growth remains low, at 1.1 per cent, and the number of vacancies fell sharply in March, down 3 per cent compared to February and over 7 per cent compared to March last year."
John Butler,the current level of retirement benefits is unsustainable and will eventually sink the company.
John Butler,"This provides confirmation that spending over the Christmas period was good, and sits with the evidence of stronger activity in the housing market."
Kristen Butler,"He called for him. Gauge turned around and started running towards the house and got close up to the edge of the driveway, and that's when he was shot."
Kristen Butler,"This year, we're focusing on our small goals. Our small goals are to win every at-bat, win every pitch. To win the SEC, we're not looking ahead from game to game. ... We're not looking for the next two weekends, but we're looking at [Alabama] for the next two days, and we're going to push hard and try to beat them."
Kristen Butler,The key thing is to keep the emotion level not too high and try not to get it too low. As the emotional leader you try to help the team achieve that. ... We just need to continue to be fired up for seven innings and come out every game and be aggressive and play hard.
Kristen Butler,"Oh, wonderful, loving dogs. Gauge loved kids."
Kristen Butler,He's never shown any aggression that I have ever seen towards anybody.
Scott Butler,"While our core solutions each provide distinct advantages for different types of credit unions, they all leverage a service-oriented architecture, our unified technology direction that's focused on enhancing member service through a practical blend of powerful, established processing capabilities and new innovative technologies like XML and .NET(R)."
Scott Butler,"Getting back in little routines create a great deal of safety so just getting up in the morning and packing their backpack, coming to the same place, seeing the same people."
Scott Butler,We try to be very generous with the customers when we do that. We try to provide them with trees elsewhere in their yard that will provide them with the benefits they want.
Scott Butler,"The latest raids reflect the commitment of the UAE authorities to safeguard the integrity of the IPR laws. The UAE's determined campaign against piracy has helped improve its standing in the international digital society. As a result, the country has attracted considerable investor attention, with many leading software companies setting up their development facilities and regional headquarters in the UAE. The UAE's strong anti-piracy stance has also helped support the growth of the local IT industry. These factors have combined to help diversify the country's economic activities, raise employment opportunities and accelerate economic growth."
Scott Butler,Juan Diego is the one to go after ? both girls and boys.
Brian Butterfield,"It's the best staff I've been around. Sometimes the X's and O's are overrated, but the people -- that's what counts. We have top-quality people in that coaching room, and it all starts with the manager. I think every one of the coaches wants to go right through a wall for him. He treats you fairly, he treats you great, and it rubs off on all the other coaches that are here."
Brian Butterfield,"It ain't even close, and if he doesn't, it goes to show you that other people around the league haven't had enough opportunities to see us play. I think he impacts games defensively for us more than any other player in baseball affects the game at their respective positions."
Brian Butterfield,"I don't know how often it happens. But I hate to see, at any time during the season, where we give away an out or fail to make a play that we assumed everybody knew what they were doing."
Brian Butterfield,"That was tremendous. Without a doubt [that was a turning point in the game]. He's been a key guy in the middle of some defensive plays. Right now he's doing well, but I can't get too excited because there's still a lot of work to do."
Brian Butterfield,"We didn't stretch him out too far. Every time I stretched him out a little bit further than his comfort zone, you could see there was a little bit of a limp. ... We're still a ways away, just because of the nature of the position where you stop and start so much."
Brian Butterfield,"Every time that I stretched him out a little further than his comfort zone you could see a little more of a limp. He's a little tentative right now, but so far so good."
Brian Butterfield,"I think he impacts games defensively, for us, more than any other player in baseball affects the game at their respective position."
Eric Butterworth,SIN: Self-Inflicted Nonsense
Eric Butterworth,"In studying mathematics or simply using a mathematical principle, if we get the wrong answer in sort of algebraic equation, we do not suddenly feel that there is an anti-mathematical principle that is luring us into the wrong answers."
Eric Butterworth,"There is no such thing as a lack of faith. We all have plenty of faith, it's just that we have faith in the wrong things. We have faith in what can't be done rather than what can be done. We have faith in lack rather than abundance but there is no lack of faith. Faith is a law."
Eric Butterworth,Where you are in consciousness has everything to do with what you see in experience.
Eric Butterworth,Nothing stops the man who desires to achieve. Every obstacle is simply a course to develop his achievement muscle. It's a strengthening of his powers of accomplishment.
Jenson Button,"As for beautiful women, I think there are many,..."
Jenson Button,Today's result was obviously a disappointing way to end the season. We lost out under the first safety car when we pitted and the safety car was in front of us. It should have waved us past but it didn't. Montoya and I sat behind it and it was then that I lost about three places. But my thoughts are already turning to 2006 and I think we have a lot to look forward to.
Jenson Button,"Testing went really well this week, particularly taking into account the lack of running time in the mornings. I completed a lot of laps as we are focusing mainly on tire testing and reliability work at the moment."
Jenson Button,"It's going to be tough for the drivers and engine, its never easy to race in this circuit. It will be very hot and very humid, I think we are very well prepared for tomorrow."
Jenson Button,There was no point in the race when we could have gone quicker. It's good to get on the podium. We've got a bit of work to do to catch up.
Jenson Button,"We had a very good race in Monza last year when we finished on the podium,"
Jenson Button,If it's raining like that on Sunday it would be too wet [to race].
Jenson Button,It's fantastic to be back on the podium and I have to thank the team for their incredibly hard work to get us back into the game here. The first stint of the race wasn't easy. I had such bad oversteer I barely had to turn into the corners! At the first stop we adjusted the front wing which made things better but we were a little too optimistic in switching to drys so we had to come in again and change back to wets. Double stinting the tyres really made all the difference for us though. I have to thank the entire team and Michelin for making this result possible. The pitstops were great and the Honda engine was faultless all weekend. We have some new developments for the next few races so I'm feeling really positive. Let's hope we have a few more days like today before the end of the season.
Jenson Button,"We have talked and I think that it is going in the right direction for both of us, ... We both need to get this cleared up as soon as possible. We all want to get everything sorted out before the end of the year so that we can just concentrate on next season."
Jenson Button,"He didn't design the car,"
Jenson Button,"I would like to thank Frank Williams for accommodating a compromise to what was a binding contract,"
Jenson Button,"Manic. The whole day's been manic with the weather. Rain, traffic, accidents. It was a hectic session. It was mad for us trying to get a lap time in."
Lise Buyer,These stocks are for speculators more than investors. The average individual should be very careful that the money they are putting into these stocks is money they can afford to lose. This should be play money.
Lise Buyer,"Amazon is two-and-a-half years down the learning curve. As of tomorrow, Borders will be a few hours down the learning curve. It's another option for book buyers, but we don't view [Borders] as a big competitive threat to Amazon. We see this as more of a defensive move than an offensive move."
Lise Buyer,The two together will have to be extremely careful to solve the channel conflict issues which will undoubtedly arise from this combination. The issues involved in working as a team should not be underestimated.
Lise Buyer,"The company has turned a corner. Beginning with this report, Amazon is demonstrating the importance of scale and leverage. We recommend that long-term investors strategically add to positions."
Tony Buzan,"Whatever your discipline, become a student of excellence in all things. Take every opportunity to observe people who manifest the qualities of mastery. These models of excellence will inspire you and guide you toward the fulfillment of your highest potential."
Tony Buzan,"The best results are achieved by using the right amount of effort in the right place at the right time. And this right amount is usually less than we think we need. In other words, the less unnecessary effort you put into learning, the more successful you'll be... the key to faster learning is to use appropriate effort. Greater effort can exacerbate faulty patterns of action. Doing the wrong thing with more intensity rarely improves the situation. Learning something new often requires us to unlearn something old."
Tony Buzan,"Whatever your discipline, become a student of excellence in all things. Take every opportunity to observe people who manifest the qualities of mastery."
Amanda Bynes,"That always baffles me. I think young girls look up to people who are older than they are, because you're always looking ahead."
Amanda Bynes,"I definitely want to go to college, but I can't make any major decisions right now, ... When I'm at that point, I'll just see how I'm doing. If I have a couple of movies lined up, then I'll put it off a few months. People go to college to figure out what they want to do, and it seems silly to turn down work, for me, at least."
Amanda Bynes,I don't like being compared to anyone or being in a class with someone. I'm a teen actress and therefore I'm competing against Hilary Duff. We're different people like everyone else.
James Byrd,"It was pretty rough We had to sign privacy statements, and then the night of the shoot we had camera crews out on the lot, which made the police show up asking what was going on. We just told them we were shooting a commercial."
James Byrd,I Walk With God
James Byrd,"I gave it a lot of thought, and I talked it over with my family. I got a lot of great support from people in the community, but after talking to my wife and family, we just decided it would take too much time away from my family."
James Byrd,"I'm anxious to get over there and do my part. Being away from my family, that's probably going to be the toughest part."
James Byrd,"I'm anxious to get over there and do my part, ... Being away from my family, that's probably going to be the toughest part of the deployment."

David Byrne,"We can say we're trying to reduce the risk to the minimum but there is no such thing as risk-free,"

David Byrne,"It's obvious that advertising pays, otherwise people wouldn't advertise -- so now we're getting on that bandwagon."

David Byrne,Real beauty knocks you a little bit off kilter.

We look forward to growing the Quills in the years to come."
Gerry Byrne,We are pleased that we have engaged the American reader in the voting process for a significant book award. We look forward to growing the Quills in the years to come.
Gerry Byrne,"It's an opportunity to create something over time that would potentially make a big difference to books, literacy, and reading."
Gerry Byrne,We want to use television in a way that will provide a different understanding of the value of books and authors and hopefully ignite general interest in reading more.

Lord Byron,"Nothing so fretful, so despicable as a Scribbler, see what I am, and what a parcel of Scoundrels I have brought about my ears, and what language I have been obliged to treat them with to deal with them in their own way; -- all this comes of Authorship."
Lord Byron,In general I do not draw well with literary men -- not that I dislike them but I never know what to say to them after I have praised their last publication.
Lord Byron,"If I don't write to empty my mind, I go mad. As to that regular, uninterrupted love of writing. I do not understand it. I feel it as a torture, which I must get rid of, but never as a pleasure. On the contrary, I think composition a great pain."
Lord Byron,Talk six times with the same single lady and you may get the wedding dress ready
Lord Byron,"He left a Corsair's name to other times, / Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes."

Lord Byron,This sort of adoration of the real is but a heightening of the beau ideal.
Lord Byron,"He said / Little, but to the purpose."
Lord Byron,I have met with most poetry on trunks; so that I am pat to consider the trunk-maker as the sexton of authorship
Lord Byron,I by no means rank poetry high in the scale of intelligence --this may look like affectation but it is my real opinion. It is the lava of the imagination whose eruption prevents an earthquake.
Lord Byron,"As to ''Don Juan,'' confess that it is the sublime of that there sort of writing; it may be bawdy, but is it not good English? It may be profligate, but is it not life, is it not the thing? Could any man have written it who has not lived in the world? and tooled in a post-chaise? in a hackney coach? in a Gondola? against a wall? in a court carriage? in a vis a vis? on a table? and under it?"
Lord Byron,Poetry should only occupy the idle.
Lord Byron,Whenever I meet with anything agreeable in this world it surprises me so much -- and pleases me so much (when my passions are not interested in one way or the other) that I go on wondering for a week to come.
Lord Byron,There is no sterner moralist than pleasure.
Lord Byron,"With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe"
Lord Byron,"Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates -- but pages might be filled up, as vainly as before, with the sad usage of all sorts of sages, who in his life-time, each was deemed a bore! The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages."
Lord Byron,"In her first passion, a woman loves her lover, in all the others all she loves is love."
Lord Byron,"Passion is the element in which we live; without it, we hardly vegetate."
Lord Byron,It is very iniquitous to make me pay my debts - you have no idea of the pain it gives one.
Lord Byron,"Comus all allows; / Champagne, dice, music or your neighbour's spouse."
Lord Byron,I think the worst woman that ever existed would have made a man of very passable reputation -- they are all better than us and their faults such as they are must originate with ourselves.
Lord Byron,"But as to women, who can penetrate the real sufferings of their she condition? Man's very sympathy with their estate has much of selfishness and more suspicion. Their love, their virtue, beauty, education, but form good housekeepers, to breed a nation."
Lord Byron,"It is singular how soon we lose the impression of what ceases to be constantly before us. A year impairs, a luster obliterates. There is little distinct left without an effort of memory, then indeed the lights are rekindled for a moment --but who can be sure that the Imagination is not the torch-bearer?"
Lord Byron,"Though women are angels, yet wedlock's the devil."
Lord Byron,"I am so convinced of the advantages of looking at mankind instead of reading about them, and of the bitter effects of staying at home with all the narrow prejudices of an Islander, that I think there should be a law amongst us to set our young men abroad for a term among the few allies our wars have left us."

Lord Byron,By headless Charles see heartless Henry lies.
Lord Byron,"It is not one man nor a million, but the spirit of liberty that must be preserved. The waves which dash upon the shore are, one by one, broken, but the ocean conquers nevertheless. It overwhelms the Armada, it wears out the rock. In like manner, whatever the struggle of individuals, the great cause will gather strength."
Lord Byron,With just enough of learning to misquote
Lord Byron,With just enough of learning to misquote.

Lord Byron,Nothing can confound a wise man more than laughter from a dunce.
Lord Byron,My native Land - Good Night!
Lord Byron,Such hath it been - shall be - beneath the sun the many still must labor for the one
Lord Byron,"Are we aware of our obligations to a mob? It is the mob that labor in your fields and serve in your houses -- that man your navy, and recruit your army -- that have enabled you to defy the world, and can also defy you when neglect and calamity have driven them to despair. You may call the people a mob; but do not forget that a mob too often speaks the sentiments of the people."

Lord Byron,"Sighing that Nature formed but one such man, and broke the die."
Lord Byron,O gold!  I still prefer thee unto paper which makes bank credit like a bank of vapor
Lord Byron,"I really cannot know whether I am or am not the Genius you are pleased to call me, but I am very willing to put up with the mistake, if it be one. It is a title dearly enough bought by most men, to render it endurable, even when not quite clearly made out, which it never can be till the Posterity, whose decisions are merely dreams to ourselves, has sanctioned or denied it, while it can touch us no further."
Lord Byron,"Talent may be in time forgiven, but genius never"
Lord Byron,"I have had, and may have still, a thousand friends, as they are called, in life, who are like one's partners in the waltz of this world --not much remembered when the ball is over."
Lord Byron,"Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying, streams like the thunderstorm against the wind."
Lord Byron,Even I / Regained my freedom with a sigh.
Lord Byron,"I'll publish, right or wrong: / Fools are my theme, let satire be my song."
Lord Byron,But I hate things all fiction... there should always be some foundation of fact for the most airy fabric -- and pure invention is but the talent of a liar.
Lord Byron,"The land of self-interest groans from shore to shore, / For fear that plenty should attain the poor."
Lord Byron,Tempted fate will leave the loftiest star.
Lord Byron,The drying up a single tear has more - Of honest fame than shedding seas of gore
Lord Byron,I awoke one morning and found myself famous.
Lord Byron,"I have a notion that gamblers are as happy as most people, being always excited; women, wine, fame, the table, even ambition, sate now and then, but every turn of the card and cast of the dice keeps the gambler alive -- besides one can game ten times longer than one can do any thing else."
Lord Byron,"What is fame? The advantage of being known by people of whom you yourself know nothing, and for whom you care as little."

Lord Byron,"Tis very puzzling on the brink Of what is called Eternity to stare, And know no more of what is here, than there"
Lord Byron,"Sleep hath its own world, and a wide realm of wild reality. And dreams in their development have breath, and tears, and tortures, and the touch of joy."

Lord Byron,"I have found that a friend may profess, yet deceive."
Lord Byron,"I have seen a thousand graves opened, and always perceived that whatever was gone, the teeth and hair remained of those who had died with them. Is not this odd? They go the very first things in youth and yet last the longest in the dust."

Lord Byron,Critics are already made.

Lord Byron,"What an antithetical mind! -- tenderness, roughness -- delicacy, coarseness -- sentiment, sensuality -- soaring and groveling, dirt and deity -- all mixed up in that one compound of inspired clay!"
Lord Byron,"I am never long, even in the society of her I love, without yearning for the company of my lamp and my library"
Lord Byron,"The fact is that my wife if she had common sense would have more power over me than any other whatsoever, for my heart always alights upon the nearest perch."
Lord Byron,"This place is the Devil, or at least his principal residence, they call it the University, but any other appellation would have suited it much better, for study is the last pursuit of the society; the Master eats, drinks, and sleeps, the Fellows drink, dispute and pun, the employments of the undergraduates you will probably conjecture without my description."
Lord Byron,"Tis pity wine should be so deleterious, for tea and coffee leave us much more serious"
Lord Byron,"She / Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three."
Lord Byron,A celebrity is one who is known to many persons he is glad he doesn't know.
Lord Byron,"My great comfort is, that the temporary celebrity I have wrung from the world has been in the very teeth of all opinions and prejudices. I have flattered no ruling powers; I have never concealed a single thought that tempted me."

Lord Byron,"The best way will be to avoid each other without appearing to do so -- or if we jostle, at any rate not to bite."
Lord Byron,"As falls the dew on quenchless sands, blood only serves to wash ambition's hands."
Lord Byron,"Here lies interred in the eternity of the past, from whence there is no resurrection for the days -- whatever there may be for the dust -- the thirty-third year of an ill-spent life, which, after a lingering disease of many months sank into a lethargy, and expired, January 22d, 1821, A.D. leaving a successor inconsolable for the very loss which occasioned its existence."
Lord Byron,"All are inclined to believe what they covet, from a lottery-ticket up to a passport to Paradise."
Lord Byron,"He possessed beauty without vanity, strength without insolence; courage without ferocity; and all the virtues of man without his vices"

Lord Byron,I only go out to get me a fresh appetite for being alone.
Lord Byron,Think not I am what I appear.
Lord Byron,America is a model of force and freedom and moderation - with all the coarseness and rudeness of its people.
Lord Byron,"Of all the barbarous middle ages, that which is most barbarous is the middle age of man! it is -- I really scarce know what; but when we hover between fool and sage, and don't know justly what we would be at -- a period something like a printed page, black letter upon foolscap, while our hair grows grizzled, and we are not what we were."
Lord Byron,My time has been passed viciously and agreeably; at thirty-one so few years months days hours or minutes remain that ''Carpe Diem'' is not enough. I have been obliged to crop even the seconds -- for who can trust to tomorrow?
Lord Byron,It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of my life to feel that I was no longer a boy. From that moment I began to grow old in my own esteem --and in my esteem age is not estimable.
Lord Byron,"I always looked to about thirty as the barrier of any real or fierce delight in the passions, and determined to work them out in the younger ore and better veins of the mine --and I flatter myself (perhaps) that I have pretty well done so --and now the dross is coming."
Lord Byron,"A lady of a ''certain age,'' which means certainly aged."
Lord Byron,"A lady of a `certain age', which means / Certainly aged."
Lord Byron,"What is the worst of woes that wait on age? What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow? To view each loved one blotted from life's page, And be alone on earth, as I am now"
Lord Byron,Good but rarely came from good advice
Lord Byron,"There is another old poet whose name I do not now remember who said, Adversity is the first path to truth"
Lord Byron,"And yet a little tumult, now and then, is an agreeable quickener of sensation; such as a revolution, a battle, or an adventure of any lively description."
Lord Byron,Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?  It doth; but actions are our epochs
Lord Byron,Absence - that common cure of love.
Lord Byron,I have great hopes that we shall love each other all our lives as much as if we had never married at all.

Lord Byron,Friendship is Love without his wings!
Lord Byron,All who joy would win must share it. Happiness was born a Twin.
Lord Byron,'Tis very certain the desire of life prolongs it.
