Zsa Zsa Gabor,You never really know a man until you have divorced him.
Zsa Zsa Gabor,"I'm an excellent housekeeper. Every time I get a divorce, I keep the house."
Zsa Zsa Gabor,Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do.
Zsa Zsa Gabor,A man in love is incomplete until he has married. Then he's finished.
Zsa Zsa Gabor,He taught me housekeeping; when I divorce I keep the house.

Hans-Georg Gadamer,There is no doubt that the leaders of the creative artists of the last 50 years concentrated their efforts mainly on eliminating that distance.
Hans-Georg Gadamer,The real being of language is that into which we are taken up when we hear it - what is said.
Hans-Georg Gadamer,The primordial experiences that are transmitted through art and history are not to be grasped from the points of view of these forms of consciousness.
Hans-Georg Gadamer,"The more language is a living operation, the less we are aware of it. Thus it follows from the self-forgetfulness of language that its real being consists in what is said in it."
Hans-Georg Gadamer,The focus of subjectivity is a distorting mirror.
Hans-Georg Gadamer,"Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society and state in which we live."

Christopher Gadsden,I give no more paroles to British officers.
Christopher Gadsden,"I gave my parole once, and it has been shamefully violated by the British Government; I shall not give another to people on whom no faith can be reposed."

John Gage,provides this administration with an opportunity to rethink its misguided wholesale privatization policy.
John Gage,"Augmenting human intelligence, that's the point."
John Gage,I just hope DHS takes a step back on this.
John Gage,"Each part of the community has to do some different part of it. You would not come to Sun for good taste in designing attractive programs. We can make sure the networking works. All of our partners, meaning all of the high-tech companies in the world, ought to contribute their engineering knowledge."
Simon Gagne,I haven't had much success with shootouts so I was a little nervous. Maybe next time will be a little smoother.
Simon Gagne,Practice was more relaxed. We need to be more relaxed. Last week was too intense. (Tuesday) we were relaxed and had more fun on the ice laughing and all that. Sometimes in hockey if you play too intense or too tight you don't play your best game. (Monday and Tuesday) were more relaxing days and I think that's going to show in our game (tonight).
Simon Gagne,"A lot of players have different opinions about the way we've played, so sometimes you need to maybe bring what you think and take the best of it. That's something we had to do and I think there are a lot positives from what we talked about and we should see a difference on the ice tomorrow."
Simon Gagne,"We tried to start better and score a couple of quick goals, and it was a big plus when we did that. Overall, I think we played pretty well defensively."
Simon Gagne,"It looks like every night it is tougher and tougher to score goals, and you face the best line on the road."
Simon Gagne,"A lot of the guys were going to bed early because there were guys who had slept on the plane and guys who hadn't. I talked to a lot of guys (yesterday) who were able to sleep until 9 a.m. Hopefully, the adjustment isn't going to be that difficult and we're able to get the rest we need as we go forward for the rest of the tournament."
Chan Gailey,We appreciate the contributions of David Wilson and Tommie Robinson the last four years. They have been a big part of four winning seasons and four bowl games.
Chan Gailey,"I told him not to worry about anything over here. I told him not to try to come back too quickly, to take care of himself."
Chan Gailey,"You can't worry about that kind of stuff. The bottom line is does a guy fit your program. How does he fit the profile for some recruiting group out there is irrelevant. It's whether they fit your program, and can they help you win."
Chan Gailey,I would worry more if we were playing a Division I-AA or Division II opponent. This is certainly a game of such magnitude that we won't lose focus on the game.
Chan Gailey,"I think he's probably speaking the truth,"
Chan Gailey,"I'm all for guys playing other sports as long as their grades don't fall and they're contributing. If they're not contributing, if they're just sitting there, then they need to be back over here, getting ready to play."
Chan Gailey,"It hurts me, it hurts them. It was my responsibility to get this team ready for this game, and I didn't do that."
Chan Gailey,"It hurts me, it hurts them. It was my responsibility to get this team ready for this game, and I didn't do that. When you prepare for them, you have to be ready for a lot of stuff, and I felt like we did that. It was just a matter of us not executing. We didn't play well today and didn't deserve to win this game."
Chan Gailey,My responsibility in this whole thing is to treat him just like I would any other player.
Chan Gailey,"Two areas where we felt like we needed to make some headway with quality were receiver and linebacker, and we felt like we did very well in both those areas. And you can never have enough good defensive backs."
Chan Gailey,We've talked about that game in other situations other than this week. We've stressed the need to play 60 minutes and taking advantage of opportunities when we get them.
Chan Gailey,We've talked about that game in situations other than this week. We've stressed the need to play 60 minutes and taking advantage of opportunities when we get them. We need to score touchdowns and not settle for field goals in the fourth quarter. That's the type of things we've talked about and that we've used from last year's game and applied to other situations the past 12 months.
Chan Gailey,"Time will tell that Auburn is a pretty good football team,"
Chan Gailey,"We're working with so many combinations because of all the guys missing, so there was no level of consistency on either side of the ball. We had some great individual plays, but not much consistency. But I think you expect that in spring practice. Neither side should dominate."
Chan Gailey,"You have to give him credit for what he did, ... instead of maybe complaining about what he didn't do."
Chan Gailey,I've heard it's a great college environment. It's a loud stadium. The fans are into it. It's a tough place to play. That's what I've heard.
Chan Gailey,"We won. Basically that's all I remember about it. The pageantry about the college game, running out behind the Rambling Wreck to the very first ball game, that's always been an experience that's been pretty exciting."
Chan Gailey,"His body has been through a traumatic ordeal lately, and you don't want to have a repeat of that. Let's see if he can do more (today). They tell us he'll get stronger every day, so I think we have to wait and see if he's going to be able to play a majority of the game, or any of the game."
Chan Gailey,"We hit some balls outside deep, we hit some balls inside over the middle, we hit some short passes, we hit backs out of the backfield. We did some things that we have not done in a while, and I give Reggie a great deal of credit for making those reads and getting the ball to the right guys,"
Chan Gailey,"Jamal had played some nickel, which is a little bit like safety. He's certainly got a lot of ability, but he's got a long way to go to learn that spot and be comfortable and help our defense there. There's lots of thinking that goes on there."
Bob Gainey,"We had created a small space for ourselves between seventh and ninth place. When I added things up in my mind, it wasn't instinct, it wasn't gut feeling. It just seemed like the right thing to do given our schedule."
Bob Gainey,"I think we have some good players, but we have to get closer to our potential."
Bob Gainey,Taking the point after being behind two goals is a pretty good result for us.
Bob Gainey,"The way both teams are going, that's why you saw the game that we saw. It was important game and it could have effect the outcome of the season."
Bob Gainey,"With the Expos no longer in existence and him needing a home, I think the Montreal Canadiens and Youppi! will fit nicely together."
Bob Gainey,"Mike Ribeiro demonstrated during the 2003-04 season how much of a force he can be. His creativity, his passing skills and his vision make him one of the key components of our offence."
Bob Gainey,Something that we've seen in Cristobal in his normal character is that he isn't nervous or suffer from anxiety.
Bob Gainey,Halak made a remarkable impression in his first season in North America. He has an excellent work ethic and could become an excellent goaltender in the years to come.

Charlotte Gainsbourg,"The more sincere I could be, the better it would be for the film."

Charlotte Gainsbourg,"The character is close to me, except that I haven't lived through those situations, so it's not completely me."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,Letting go of things and not being afraid of being ridiculous or over the top-I think that's the main thing for me to work on.
Charlotte Gainsbourg,It's nice that we have all these different films.
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"It's more than a job. It's very personal, so when you're hurt, you're really hurt inside."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"In France I'm very private, I don't like talking about my life, and I imagined that people would think that I'm now an open book."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"I'm desperate to work again. I've often had those periods, but two years was the longest."

Charlotte Gainsbourg,"I hope I'll consider my next part, having learnt from this one."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"I hated seeing myself on screen. I was full of complexes. I hated my face for a very, very long time."

Charlotte Gainsbourg,I don't feel I have to share everything.
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"I couldn't do anything else, I enjoy it so much. But I find it tough."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"Girls can wear jeans, cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots, 'cause it's okay to be a boy, but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"Everyone gets the feeling that they know you and they know your life, and I felt really embarrassed by that."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"At the beginning it wasn't to do with the work, it was more the experience."
Charlotte Gainsbourg,You don't even need the director's judgement. It's too much.
Charlotte Gainsbourg,"In Franc, you're with the crew, and you have lunch with them. It's more like a family."
Gary Gait,We have some nice momentum going into the playoffs.
Gary Gait,"I think he's a good young player who's still learning the indoor game. We expect him to continue to develop, and we see him as someone who will help us."
Gary Gait,"We've made a commitment to improve our teams from the past. We've made a lot of changes, we have a lot of new players and we're excited to get out there and compete."
Gary Gait,"It's just going to add a little to the stereotype that spoiled, preppy college kids play lacrosse, but it's spread so far and so many kids are playing that they know the game's evolving from that stereotype to the average kid getting a stick and going out and playing."
John Galbraith,One of the greatest pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know.

John Galbraith,It is a commonplace of modern technology that problems have solutions before there is knowledge of how they are to be solved
John Galbraith,"The real accomplishment of modern science and technology consists in taking ordinary men, informing them narrowly and deeply and then, through appropriate organization, arranging to have their knowledge combined with that of other specialized but equally ordinary men. This dispenses with the need for genius. The resulting performance, though less inspiring, is far more predictable."
John Galbraith,"There is an insistent tendency among serious social scientists to think of any institution which features rhymed and singing commercials, intense and lachrymose voices urging highly improbable enjoyment, caricatures of the human esophagus in normal and impaired operation, and which hints implausibly at opportunities for antiseptic seduction as inherently trivial. This is a great mistake. The industrial system is profoundly dependent on commercial television and could not exist in its present form without it."
John Galbraith,Of all classes the rich are the most noticed and the least studied.
John Galbraith,All successful revolutions are the kicking in of a rotten door. The violence of revolutions is the violence of men who charge into a vacuum.

John Galbraith,Talk of revolution is one of avoiding reality.
John Galbraith,"We now in the United States have more security guards for the rich than we have police services for the poor districts. If you're looking for personal security, far better to move to the suburbs than to pay taxes in New York."

John Galbraith,"All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership."
John Galbraith,"Among all the world's races, some obscure Bedouin tribes possibly apart, Americans are the most prone to misinformation. This is not the consequence of any special preference for mendacity, although at the higher levels of their public administration that tendency is impressive. It is rather that so much of what they themselves believe is wrong."
John Galbraith,"The contented and economically comfortable have a very discriminating view of government. Nobody is ever indignant about bailing out failed banks and failed savings and loans associations. But when taxes must be paid for the lower middle class and poor, the government assumes an aspect of wickedness."
John Galbraith,More die in the United States of too much food than of too little.
John Galbraith,The enemy of the conventional wisdom is not ideas but the march of events.

John Galbraith,Several times I concluded that there was too much detail; always I returned to continue and enjoy the book.
John Galbraith,"A bad book is the worse that it cannot repent. It has not been the devil's policy to keep the masses of mankind in ignorance; but finding that they will read, he is doing all in his power to poison their books."
John Galbraith,"We have escapist fiction, so why not escapist biography?"
John Galbraith,There is certainly no absolute standard of beauty. That precisely is what makes its pursuit so interesting.

John Galbraith,"If wrinkles must be written upon our brows, let them not be written upon the heart. The spirit should never grow old."
John Galbraith,"An important antidote to American democracy is American gerontocracy. The positions of eminence and authority in Congress are allotted in accordance with length of service, regardless of quality. Superficial observers have long criticized the United States for making a fetish of youth. This is unfair. Uniquely among modern organs of public and private administration, its national legislature rewards senility."
John Galbraith,"It is not necessary to advertise food to hungry people, fuel to cold people, or houses to the homeless."
John Galbraith,"One can relish the varied idiocy of human action during a panic to the full, for, while it is a time of great tragedy, nothing is being lost but money"

Ellen Galinsky,"It's probably because their [men's] roles are newer. They're less likely to have role models. When women first started working, they felt like they were pioneers and now I think you're seeing that feeling among men."
Ellen Galinsky,"The impact is, people are either wanting not to advance, or are leaving for jobs . . . that are more manageable."
Ellen Galinsky,"People who have good jobs in supportive workplaces are more committed. They're more loyal, they're more likely to stay with their own jobs, they're more likely to give their all to their jobs, to care about their company succeeding."
Ellen Galinsky,"In the real world, people are moving in and out of the labor force."
Ellen Galinsky,"It gives us more flexibility, so we can do more, but it also creates the expectation of the instant response. It can take away your sense of control over your time."
Ellen Galinsky,The reason I think it's gaining momentum is because of natural-disaster preparedness.
Ellen Galinsky,"You can have a policy, but there can be a culture against using it. The culture is where the rubber meets the road. It's actually what happens to people, regardless of what the policies are."
Al Gallagher,"There are three things in my life which I really love: God, my family, and baseball. The only problem - once baseball season starts, I change the order around a bit."
Al Gallagher,We'll have to wait and see if Eric can take on the responsibility.

Brian Gallagher,That is where people start doing things that are slightly different to just doing spots and billboards.
James Gallagher,There were increasing concerns about safety issues.
James Gallagher,"We have no knowledge whatsoever of who Ocean Fund is and what they are talking about. We own them (the Caesars properties), and they didn't submit anything to us."

Liam Gallagher,"You've seen one of the our gigs you've seen 'em all. But if you're into the music, you'll know that we played better the night before or we can play better."
Liam Gallagher,"It's about the music and that's it. I'm not an entertainer. But I do entertain people, see what I mean?"
Liam Gallagher,"Americans want grungy people, stabbing themselves in the head on stage. They get a bright bunch like us, with deodorant on, they don't get it."

Maggie Gallagher,"lifelong experience in marriage research, public education and advocacy."

Michael Gallagher,"The year 2000 is off to a good start, building on the strong momentum in sales, market share and consumer takeaway we experienced in 1999."
Michael Gallagher,"It's just reality. We wouldn't raise it if we didn't need to. If the (tax rate) had been set at the level we're looking at now, we'd be fine."
Michael Gallagher,"They lied, they lied. Instead of sharing power, they would rather stick to selfish positions, and let peace slip through their fingers. That would be the most painful and inexplicable loss of all."
Michael Gallagher,What's at risk is the bureaucratization of the Internet and innovation.
Michael Gallagher,Today's spectrum announcement is great news for American consumers and the U.S. economy. President Bush's committed focus on wireless as a catalyst for technology growth is paying dividends.
Michael Gallagher,Usually complete darkness is a visual metaphor; being crunched down is a visual of a mental state.
Michael Gallagher,"The volume of correspondence opposed to creation of a .xxx (domain) is unprecedented, ... Given the extent of the negative reaction, I request that the board (provide) adequate additional time for these concerns to be voiced and addressed before any additional action takes place."
Michael Gallagher,Corporate treasurers will no longer have to maintain a variety of in-country formats. They will have the ability to transmit data for high and low value payments across NAFTA countries with confidence and ease. And the added benefit of keeping the payment flows within one institution.
Tim Gallagher,"They hate to see it leave, but they understand, ... I'm going to miss all my customers. I had a lot of great employees."
Tim Gallagher,"You're giving up a little in sound and trunk space, and paying a little higher pricing. But it's a more emotional purchase. It gets you out of the mode of taking kids around to soccer games."

Tim Gallagher,"If we had a concept on the turntable that was cute, people would look and move on. But when you add features and layer in some innovation to make it stand out, they might stop and look."
Tim Gallagher,"In the long term, certainly anything that the federal government can do to expedite the creation and ... construction of power plants, of transmission lines will improve the situation. In the short term, any conservation measures that they can help promulgate will help the situation."

Gerard Gallant,We got into trouble with the penalties and lost a lot of momentum in the second.

Gerard Gallant,"It was the longest three hours of my life, there's no doubt about that."
Gerard Gallant,"I was excited after the first period, we came out and played very well. Then we got cute with the puck in the second and it went from 3-1 to 3-3 in a hurry. You have to play 60 minutes to win in this league."

David Gallop,"We can't have a situation where clubs can take a gamble breaking the rules, knowing that all they need to do is write a check to pay a fine at the end of the season. There has to be a stronger disincentive."

William Galston,"I'm not surprised by the finding that these young women place a high value on marriage, ... The poor do not differ from the rest of America in their aspirations.

William Galston,"There are things you don't learn in a classroom, and if your circumstances aren't rich in the sort of input you need, you may not learn them at all.

Sonia Gandhi,The lifestyle of many of our colleagues has been very pompous. They conduct weddings and birthdays in such an ostentatious manner that it pains me a lot. It appears that they are making fun of our commitment to the poor.
Sonia Gandhi,"An economy growing at 7 percent per year, can and must find the resources to improve the lives of its millions of poor."
Sonia Gandhi,Together we can face any challenges as deep as the ocean and as high as the sky.
James Gandolfini,"I think everybody better support a raise for you guys. I think everybody should think about that. You pick up the phone, you call for help, nobody answers."
James Gandolfini,They all know that world so well. I ask for their opinions all the time and trust whatever they tell me about what I'm doing.
James Gandolfini,"He got that from my mother,"
James Gandolfini,"I like the prop food so much that I eat it between takes as well as on camera,"
James Gandolfini,"I was in bed, and I got the script and I was reading it, and I said, 'Man, this is really good, there's no way I'll get hired for this!'"
James Gandolfini,I just think it's the changes that age brings. You slow down a little bit ... the writers are smart enough to write all those changes that life gives you.
James Gandolfini,Both my mother and father were very supportive of any career move any of us wanted to make.
Kim Gandy,"There is no job that women should be excluded from because of their gender. If you can do the job, you should have an opportunity to get the job. If you can't, you shouldn't be there, male or female."
Kim Gandy,I remember what it was like in the 1960's in rural Louisiana. Women did not have many options. My own best friend in high school had a baby at 16. I don't want us to go back to those days.
Kim Gandy,Betty led NOW when we were challenging every orthodoxy about what it means to be a woman.
Kim Gandy,A lot of strong women there. But sometimes it is a tough place to make progress on our issues.
Kim Gandy,"The drug and device companies own the FDA and it is the companiesâ€™ profit potential that rules the review and approval process â€“ except when the profit motive is overridden by the White House morality police, as with the morning-after pill."
Kim Gandy,No on Justice John Roberts
Kim Gandy,"If Bush chooses a nominee whose only intention is to scale back the rights we have fought decades to win, we are prepared for a battle royal. Bring it on."
Kim Gandy,"This is not just about South Dakota. Women's rights, women's health and women's lives are on the line."
Kim Gandy,"It's always an uphill battle to defeat a Supreme Court nominee, but this is a fight worth having."
Sourav Ganguly,I have not heard anything officially. I learnt it from the television.
Sourav Ganguly,The selection rules are the same for everybody. I am trying to make a comeback just like some other players who got dropped after the Pakistan tour. I hope my time will come.
Sourav Ganguly,"But yes, it's a different phase. The responsibility is less because as a captain you have to do many other things. But it is the same for all other captains."
Sourav Ganguly,I'm very happy to be back in the team.
Sourav Ganguly,I am very happy to be back in side just like any other player in a similar situation.
Sourav Ganguly,I am very happy to be back in the team like any other player would be in a similar situation. I am only hoping that we perform well in Pakistan.
Sourav Ganguly,The best way to get away from a crisis and yet hold on the reins without performance is to find a godfather who would save you at crisis and fool the entire world...This is how it has worked for me
Sourav Ganguly,"For the last five-six months, I have been making runs in both domestic and Test cricket. I also scored runs as the captain in Zimbabwe, so I don't know whether I am playing better because I am no longer the Indian captain."
Sourav Ganguly,World Cup 2007 is my goal and I believe that I have enough cricket left in me.
Sourav Ganguly,"I will keep playing domestic cricket. I feel I am good enough to get back into the Indian team, and playing domestic cricket is the only way out. So I will keep playing."
Sourav Ganguly,"We have a lot of cricket coming up against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and England. That's going to be tough, so I think it's good that he's taking a break now and he can come back completely healed."
Sourav Ganguly,I do see signs of improvement by the present Zimbabwe. They just need consistency.
Sourav Ganguly,"The captain has a big role. It is important to keep the boys' confidence high and to keep one's faith in them. I try to give my support to the youngsters because nobody comes in as a world beater. Okay, some rare cricketers score a century on debut, but that doesn't mean the rest are not good enough. We have to give them more opportunities, which was not there when I started out. Captaincy these days is more off the field than on the field."
Sourav Ganguly,He truly deserves such a feat. This is a fantastic achievement.
Bob Gansler,I am glad the guys showed class and spunk in coming back. Say a prayer that it is enough tomorrow.
Bob Gansler,"I am glad the guys showed class and spunk in coming back, ... Say a prayer that it is enough tomorrow."
Bob Gansler,"There's more smiles, there's more laughter, there's more buffoonery on his part and coming back at him, ... We got off to good start this season, which obviously helps, and we see practical jokes and some of the adolescent things maybe he hadn't done for a while."
Joe Garagiola,I went through baseball as a player to be named later.
Joe Garagiola,Nolan Ryan is pitching much better now that he has his curve ball straightened out.
Joe Garagiola,I know a baseball star who wouldn't report the theft of his wife's credit cards because the thief spends less than she does.
Joe Garagiola,"It's pitching, hitting and defense that wins. Any two can win. All three make you unbeatable."
Joe Garagiola,"Baseball is a game of race, creed, and color. The race is to first base. The creed is the rules of the game. The color? Well, the home team wears white uniforms, and the visiting team wears gray."
Joe Garagiola,"One thing you learned as a Cubs fan: when you bought you ticket, you could bank on seeing the bottom of the ninth."
Joe Garagiola,I went through baseball as a player to be named later.
Joe Garagiola,Baseball is drama with an endless run and an ever-changing cast.
John Garang,"It's difficult to find the words,"
John Garang,Did you ever see a government pray?
John Garang,"She was very strong and gave me confidence,"
John Garang,It is neither my intention to depart from the route of John Garang nor to change the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Don Garber,"Absolutely. Dallas is not a playoff contender. They had one of the worst seasons in the history of our league. They need impact immediately, and they will get that. Dallas needs to have somebody that's going to help them win some games as they get ready for moving into their new complex in 2005."
Don Garber,"In the immediate and long-term future, today's news will prove to be a historical turning point for the sport, ... These recent developments further solidify soccer's standing and value as a major television property in the United States with even greater future potential."

Don Garber,Pizza Hut Park is clearly becoming a major destination for marquee soccer events in the United States. The tremendous support by the entire soccer community in North Texas for MLS Cup 2005 makes Pizza Hut Park -- one of the premiere soccer complexes in the world -- the perfect choice.
Don Garber,"Pizza Hut Park is clearly becoming a major destination for marquee soccer events in the United States, and we're pleased to host MLS Cup 2006 at one of America's great soccer facilities. The tremendous support by the entire soccer community in North Texas for MLS Cup 2005 makes Pizza Hut Park - one of the premier soccer complexes in the world - the perfect choice."

Don Garber,"Toronto would be an excellent addition to Major League Soccer under the leadership of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, one of the preeminent sports and entertainment companies in the world. We are enthusiastic about bringing an MLS team to Toronto and are prepared to host the 2008 All-Star Game and an MLS Cup in Toronto by 2012."

Don Garber,Doug will be dearly missed as his legacy of passion and dedication to the sport will always be remembered.
Don Garber,We hope this program will further encourage the millions of soccer fans in this country to contribute to helping the victims of Hurricane Katrina.
Don Garber,We're a changing country. The people against us are older and not engaged in the game. Our focus remains expanding the dominance of soccer as the No. 1 sport among Hispanics living in the U.S.
Don Garber,"MLS reiterates its belief that the use of performance-enhancing substances compromises the integrity of professional sports,"
Don Garber,"After review of these drafts, and given the fact that the terms of the previously negotiated agreement are no longer being honored, MLS and its owners will no longer consider San Antonio as a candidate for an MLS team in 2006."
Greta Garbo,I wish I were supernaturally strong so I could put right everything that is wrong.
Greta Garbo,I don't want to be a silly temptress. I cannot see any sense in getting dressed up and doing nothing but tempting men in pictures.
Greta Garbo,This is where I have wasted the best years of my life.
Greta Garbo,My talents fall within definite limitations. I am not as versatile an actress as some think.
Greta Garbo,It is bitter to think of one's best years disappearing in this unpolished country.
Greta Garbo,I'm tired and nervous and I'm in America. Here you don't know that you live.
Greta Garbo,I want to be alone.
Greta Garbo,"There are many things in your heart you can never tell to another person. They are you, your private joys and sorrows, and you can never tell them. You cheapen yourself, the inside of yourself, when you tell them."
Greta Garbo,There is no one who would have me - I can't cook.
Greta Garbo,"If you are blessed, you are blessed, whether you are married or single."
Greta Garbo,There seems to be a law that governs all our actions so I never make plans.
Greta Garbo,"The story of my life is about back entrances, side doors, secret elevators and other ways of getting in and out of places so that people won't bother me."
Greta Garbo,"I smoke all the time, one after the other."
Greta Garbo,Life would be so wonderful if we only knew what to do with it.
Greta Garbo,"Is there anything better than to be longing for something, when you know it is within reach?"
Greta Garbo,Your joys and sorrows. You can never tell them. You cheapen the inside of yourself if you do tell them.
Greta Garbo,I want to be left alone.
Greta Garbo,"I never said, 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be left alone.' There is all the difference."
Greta Garbo,Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.
Greta Garbo,You don't have to be married to have a good friend as your partner for life.
Greta Garbo,There are some who want to get married and others who don't. I have never had an impulse to go to the altar. I am a difficult person to lead.
Greta Garbo,"Every one of us lives his life just once; if we are honest, to live once is enough"
Greta Garbo,If only those who dream about Hollywood knew how difficult it all is.
Greta Garbo,the sadness in her eyes.
Greta Garbo,"Being a movie star, and this applies to all of them, means being looked at from every possible direction. You are never left at peace, you're just fair game."
Greta Garbo,Flesh and the Devil.
Gil Garcetti,"Anytime you're bringing cases against police officers the jurors want a lot of credible evidence, ... In general, they don't like to convict policemen."
Gil Garcetti,the performance of their job duties.
Gil Garcetti,"If you cannot have faith and trust in your police officer -- either as a citizen or as a juror or as a judge, as defense lawyers, as a district attorney -- then we do not have an acceptable, a viable criminal justice system,"
Gil Garcetti,"There is no legal authority for the chief to thumb his nose at us -- and I won't accept it, ... I won't tolerate it."
Andy Garcia,"I live in a house full of women, dolls and conga drums!"
Andy Garcia,I was a banquet waiter at the Beverly Hilton hotel. You learn a lot when you're in the service industry-the jerks of the world really come to the fore. It's a valuable learning experience to be in the position where you're of service to someone who sometimes doesn't even know you're there.
Andy Garcia,"A lot of people don't know about Cuban history, and I don't expect them to."
Andy Garcia,"From then on, it was forever looking for a home. But there was never any real fire to make the movie within the system."
Andy Garcia,"I don't control the movies that are offered to me, but I make choices based on certain parameters."
Hector Garcia,"When you build relationships with the students they feel more comfortable coming to you and saying, 'Hey, Johnny brought a gun to school,' ... It helps our officers be more effective and have more of an impact."
Hector Garcia,What well be trying to do against La Villa will be perfection. We want to perfect our plays and play perfect on defense. Thats our challenge this week.
Hector Garcia,"In the first half, I believe Rio Hondo had 99 yards of total offense, and in the second half, we held them to just 23 yards rushing, so I was very pleased about that. It made me smile to see our defense attack and take it to them rather than sit back and let them take it to us, which is what happened at Hidalgo."
Hector Garcia,"Obviously, it's very difficult to justify one action against the other when evacuees and local poor people are both in need."
Jerry Garcia,"Well, you know Tom, I'm no health nut"
Jerry Garcia,Friend of the Devil.
Jerry Garcia,"says Garcia, widow of Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, ''was the whole takeover of the food industry by big corporations."
Jerry Garcia,"Yeah, I think we have to. If we want our shows to be - if we want the quality of the shows to be good, and we want the energy to be high, and if we want to be in good enough physical shape to do them, and not exhaust ourselves on the road, and not get stale, we have to pace."
Jerry Garcia,What we do is as American as lynch mobs. America has always been a complex place.
Jerry Garcia,"We're not uncomfortable with it, and we've already been through enough of the music business where I'm not really worried that commercial success is going to in some way - we're already past saving, you know what I mean? It's too late for us."
Jerry Garcia,"There is a road, no simple highway, between the dawn and the dark of night, and if you go, no one may follow, that path is for your steps alone."
Jerry Garcia,"The alternate media are becoming important and viable alternatives to playing live. Records, videos, that kind of thing. They're going to start to count for something. Because there's only a limited amount of us-time available to us."
Jerry Garcia,"Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills, One man gathers what another man spills."
Jerry Garcia,Stuff that's hidden and murky and ambiguous is scary because you don't know what it does.
Jerry Garcia,So we are pretty convinced we don't want to play huge stadiums unless we can play them well.
Jerry Garcia,So it's one of those things where we have to - our problem is pacing ourselves and still reaching a large enough number of our audience. Because we don't want to burn the audience. And we don't want to be excluding anybody.
Jerry Garcia,"Our strong suit is what we do, and our audience."
Jerry Garcia,"I'm not trying to clock scores in this lifetime, it's just that things are better now than they were like five, ten years ago. Music has gotten a lot better. There's a lot of people who are committed to - soulfully."
Jerry Garcia,"I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite well for themselves."
Jerry Garcia,"I mean, just because you're a musician doesn't mean all your ideas are about music. So every once in a while I get an idea about plumbing, I get an idea about city government, and they come the way they come."
Jerry Garcia,"I don't think that Slaughterhouse-Five was successful movie material. In fact, Vonnegut's books mostly I don't feel are movie material."
Jerry Garcia,"I don't know why, it's the same reason why you like some music and you don't like others. There's something about it that you like. Ultimately I don't find it's in my best interests to try and analyze it, since it's fundamentally emotional."
Jerry Garcia,"But hey, when you live in Watts, you need a little smack to get by, you know what I mean? You need something soft and comfortable in your life, 'cause you're not going to get it from what's around you. And society isn't going to give it to you."
Jerry Garcia,"But audio is a component of video, so there's always been that anyway, and although we've never expressed a visual side apart from the Grateful Dead movie, I don't find it that remote, you know what I mean? It's a departure of sorts, but it's like a first cousin."
Jerry Garcia,"And Warner Bros. seems to be pretty much into re-releasing all of their catalog. So there's the Warner Bros. stuff and the stuff that we have control over, we're gradually re-releasing it. Some stuff we don't have control over."
Jerry Garcia,"And there's a lot of that stuff with people bringing their kids, kids bringing their parents, people bringing their grandparents - I mean, it's gotten to be really stretched out now. It was never my intention to say, this is the demographics of our audience."
Jerry Garcia,And the live show is still our main thing.
Jerry Garcia,And for me there's still more material than 20 lifetimes that I can use up.
Jerry Garcia,"America is still mostly xenophobic and racist. That's the nature of America, I think."
Jerry Garcia,"Hunter can write a melody and stuff like that, but his forte is lyrics. He can write a serviceable melody to hang his lyrics on, and sometimes he comes up with something really nice."
Jerry Garcia,"If we had any nerve at all, if we had any real balls as a society, or whatever you need, whatever quality you need, real character, we would make an effort to really address the wrongs in this society, righteously."
Jerry Garcia,I'm shopping around for something to do that no one will like.
Jerry Garcia,Constantly choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil.
Jerry Garcia,You do not merely want to be considered just the best of the best. You want to be considered the only ones who do what you do.
Jerry Garcia,"I have all the patience in the world about Sirens. For me it's not a Grateful Dead project, it's a Me project."
Jerry Garcia,"Somebody has to do something, and it's just incredibly pathetic that it has to be us."
Jerry Garcia,"I'm goin' where the wind don't blow so strange, maybe off on some high cold mountain chain"
Luis Garcia,The truth will set you free.
Luis Garcia,It's good to be back. I had been feeling pain in my left knee for about two months but continued to play because it didn't feel like a bad injury.
Luis Garcia,It?s their money. We want to give it back to them before the clock runs out.
Luis Garcia,"CBP officers may have protected the life of a child by making sure that these toy guns did not fall into the stream of commerce and be confused with a real handgun, resulting in tragic consequences."
Luis Garcia,"Three hundred to 400 jobs were promised here. Where's the baker, (the) candlestick maker, grocery store, doctor, dentist, real estate agent? Where is all the new development?"
Luis Garcia,"In my first season I was learning about English football in a new team. I scored 13 which wasn't bad, but I think I can do better. Everyone can do more."
Luis Garcia,"The manager has always shown a lot of faith in me, and the fact that I gave up my home and family in Barcelona to come to Liverpool shows how much faith I have in Rafael Benitez."
Luis Garcia,"It was consistency that we needed to work on, trying to transpose the way we played and worked in the Champions League on to the Premiership. As new players, what we've learnt in the Premier League is starting to bear fruit. We have closed the gap a little bit [to Chelsea] and we are stronger than we were. If we work hard, I believe we can make a small piece of history with Liverpool."
Luis Garcia,I am very happy because my son from the beginning told the truth.
Mario Garcia,"You can't imagine how sad this is. After eight years of hard work, we lost it all in one second."
Mario Garcia,The girls did a good job too. They all improved their times by a minute. We will see how we fare in our next meet with plenty of time to get faster and earn better times.
Mario Garcia,"By her being a product of the community, it inspires a lot of the younger generation to reach for goals that they never thought they could attain, especially Latina women."
Mario Garcia,Everyone did an awesome job. Most of the boys set new personal records for themselves by at least a minute. They are really coming along.
Mario Garcia,The boys are improving little by little. We just need to tighten our pack.
Nomar Garciaparra,"No, I can't remember the last time I played outfield -- not even in high school."
Nomar Garciaparra,"I'm excited. I've had three days of batting practice and felt really good, so this is definitely the next step."
Nomar Garciaparra,"That comes with learning the position,"
Nomar Garciaparra,"It's a learning process. At some point, I won't be thinking five million things in my head. Maybe that will come at the end of the year. Comfort comes when you do things instinctively, you don't have to think."
Nomar Garciaparra,"Every position is important and has its differences. It takes time to reach the same instinct level at first base that I had shortstop. It is a work in progress, but I'm getting there."
Nomar Garciaparra,They'll always be in my heart. That's probably what I miss most are the people. I think they know I gave everything I could. I tried both on and off the field as best as I could because I appreciated them so much.
Nomar Garciaparra,Health is always a factor. Everyone needs to stay healthy and do their job. These guys believe in each other.
Nomar Garciaparra,I didn't know if I was going to be back this year with the injury. I'm happy to be back and doing anything I can.
Nomar Garciaparra,"God, Ted, I knew I liked you!"
Nomar Garciaparra,I never saw a problem with it being a tie. I saw one of the best games I've ever seen.
Nomar Garciaparra,"You'll have games where you're out there a long time. Being able to go through that and not get stiff was a good thing for me. As I went along, it felt better, and on that last play [a nifty move to his right and a throw across his body for the final out in the seventh] had a lot of body torque to it, and no problems."
Nomar Garciaparra,"There's a month here, ... Do we realize what our fate kind of is? You do, but at the same time, it's not respectability for ourselves but respect for the game. There's a month left in the season. If you don't get [to the playoffs], fans are still coming out there watching you, and you respect the game because they coming out to watch."
Nomar Garciaparra,It was definitely a learning experience and we'll see it they keep me out there.
Nomar Garciaparra,"It was something new every time I turned around that season. Ultimately, you don't have the energy to keep defending yourself, but at this point I don't want to rehash it. I've moved on and they've moved on."
Nomar Garciaparra,"If it was in my control, I'd still be wearing a Red Sox uniform, because it's the place I know, I love. All of those fans, I'll always remember. But I'm also going to another great place. I'm going to a phenomenal city with great tradition as well, phenomenal fans, great organization."
Nomar Garciaparra,It was the place where I saw my first major league game. It brought back a lot of childhood memories. There was feeling that I got by going there.
Nomar Garciaparra,I think that exacerbated the situation a little bit more. It was a combination of that trauma and my body kind of protecting itself from the (groin) surgery. Every day I'm doing everything I can to try and get loose.
Nomar Garciaparra,You ever played Major League Baseball?
Nomar Garciaparra,"Different things come up and you can't simulate a game, ... I've been practicing, taking ground balls, [but] different things come up in the game that you take home and learn from. You still have to adjust."
Nomar Garciaparra,"You know it as soon as you walk in Yankee Stadium. The electricity is there every time, every day."
Nomar Garciaparra,When I go home my mother still makes me take out the garbage.
Nomar Garciaparra,That's basically what I'm doing when I'm tapping them - getting my toes to the end of my shoes.
Nomar Garciaparra,"My inspiration was the game itself, not any individual player in it."
Nomar Garciaparra,I love the game of baseball.
Nomar Garciaparra,"Back then, my idol was Bugs Bunny, because I saw a cartoon of him playing ball - you know, the one where he plays every position himself with nobody else on the field but him? Now that I think of it, Bugs is still my idol. You have to love a ballplayer like that."
Greg Gard,"The biggest thing is that when he makes shots the rest feed off that and they make shots. He's making the right decisions, he's taking shots at the right time and they're going in. That's the biggest thing. He's also been better defensively. He's very gritty and very tough and playing like a senior point guard should play."
Greg Gard,They're all leaders and they all know how to win.
Greg Gard,"It's not easy to be a point guard, especially for coach Ryan because he puts so much onus on it and responsibility on it. It's not just, 'Roll the ball out and let's go.' You're held accountable for every single thing that happens on the floor."
Ron Gardenhire,"We know what Stew can do, what kind of player he is. We don't have to worry about that. ... We've got people we've got to get a look at, too. He's given us the best he can."
Ron Gardenhire,"You want to work with that swing? I don't know what to tell him. I've never seen it before. So we say just go ahead, because I don't even know what he works on. I just watch him take B.P. and let him have fun and do it."
Ron Gardenhire,We were trying to get him to come back into the clubhouse where he was the greatest leader I've ever seen. He wanted to do it.
Ron Gardenhire,"Now we are trying to get back up there and see if we can get back in the playoffs, so we're chasing them. They chased us for a few years and we're chasing them right now."
Ron Gardenhire,"Disappointing ballgame for us. I really don't know what to say about it, to tell you the truth."
Ron Gardenhire,"Disappointing ballgame for us, ... I really don't know what to say about it, to tell you the truth."
Ron Gardenhire,"I'm kind of spinning a little bit, to tell you the truth."
Ron Gardenhire,This kid has a lot of talent and brings a strong bat. It will be interesting to see how he does in Spring Training and how his knee will take to the wear and tear of playing in the outfield.
Ron Gardenhire,"His arm strength looks good, his velocity is very good, but it's a mechanical thing just getting the ball down and locating the ball a little better."
Ron Gardenhire,"He has no strength in it, ... We were hoping that he would be a little better, and he's not."
Ron Gardenhire,"We're in a pennant race here, ... We're doing everything we can to win. And five runs in two innings, we can't do that."
Ron Gardenhire,"We did everything we could, ... You're in a pennant race. ... We're trying to win. Five runs in two innings -- you can't go with that."
Ron Gardenhire,We know how much this means to the White Sox and what kind of race they're in. So we just want to compete as hard as we can and make sure we don't get accused by anybody of laying down.
Ron Gardenhire,"He's not only a powerful hitter, he's a quality person. We know what he can do, and if we need him this season we won't hesitate to call him up."
Ron Gardenhire,Don't punish the pitcher for our offensive problems that we've had this year.
Ron Gardenhire,He's healthy now. His knee got checked out at the end of the year. No problems. It looks great. Everything is fantastic. He's a stud. This young man is a real deal.
Ron Gardenhire,"Right now, pride can go out the window. It's about winning. I've had his back for three years."
Ron Gardenhire,"The story has always been with him that he's a sloppy practice guy, but a good game guy. He's gotten better at his practice now, and a lot of people talked to him about that, working on some drills. He's grown up a little bit and made his presence known this year in camp."
Ron Gardenhire,You take the good and bad when you're talking about a power hitter. We're looking for someone who's going to hit those three-run homers and get you back into a game or blow the game open. He's a guy that has that ability.
Ron Gardenhire,We all put things in perspective here. That pretty much takes away from anything you do at the ballpark. Our hearts and our prayers are all with Puck. We know it's a tough situation out there.
Ron Gardenhire,People will say we're actually alive and that's not bad.
Ron Gardenhire,"I'm sure he'll get votes. If he doesn't get votes, then the wrong people are voting."
Ron Gardenhire,"You know we have a good clubhouse. We just had some people who were frustrated. It wasn't about guys hating each other. You know, winning really heals things."
Ron Gardenhire,"He's not going to carry that with him. He learned over the past few years to just blow things off. It's over with. You're not going to do anything about it, so you move on. He's fine."
Ron Gardenhire,"We've had a bunch of young guys in that role in the past. He was looking for a job. We always respected him. He's done enough damage to us over the years, so we figured why not bring him over to our side."
Ron Gardenhire,We missed an opportunity to score runs for Santana and maybe get him a win. Which is probably the most disappointing thing for the night.
Ron Gardenhire,"It will probably happen tomorrow night on the grass, where I feel more comfortable doing that. The best-case scenario is left, because that's where he's most comfortable at. But he's been working out there in right and I told him to take fly balls out there to mix him in there with the other guys."
Ron Gardenhire,"We talked about it and moved them over a couple steps last night, but we're going to have to do better than that. You have to make adjustments based on who's pitching. If the ball goes through that hole a couple of times, then why don't we just move over so we can stop it?"
Ron Gardenhire,"It was a big situation like this, these guys coming into town, a big Friday night and he withstood everything. That was fun to see."
Ron Gardenhire,That was a bad night. We played a lousy game all around.
Ron Gardenhire,You've got to look for some kind of positive. You can't be negative and screaming every night. You'll chew yourself up.
Ron Gardenhire,"Wow, what a performance. He was just unbelievable. He went right at them the whole night. Their kid did great, too. We've been on the flip side of that a lot."
Ron Gardenhire,"We don't know where to go from here, but it was a nice night."
Ron Gardenhire,He's getting better pitches to hit. That's what happens when you start swinging well. The pitcher makes mistakes and you hit it instead of fouling it off.
Ron Gardenhire,"That's why they've got their record, because they take advantage of other teams' mistakes."
Ron Gardenhire,"If he starts ripping the cover off the ball, that always puts a thought in your mind to keep him. Playing everyday in the outfield is a better thing for him right now, so one thing I don't want is him here coming off the bench and being a pinch-hitter."
Ron Gardenhire,"He's very sure of himself. He's a very smart young man, and I'm sure that things like (White retiring) won't go by him. He'll push the issue as hard as he can. He'll get plenty of opportunities."
Ron Gardenhire,We've got quality guys competing for spots on the 25-man roster that can fill in at many different positions. These are versatile guys that know how to play the game and defensively stack up with anyone out there. I think we'll be just fine.
Ron Gardenhire,"My goal is to never stop learning and to never quit making adjustments, ... no matter where you are in this game. I'm always trying to make myself better, and I think I did that today."
Ron Gardenhire,"He's one of our leaders. We lost a lot of people this year. Our outfield has been beaten up pretty bad. And Jacque is the one guy who needs to step up, and he's been doing that."
Ron Gardenhire,"If pitchers make mistakes against those guys, they can hurt you."
Ron Gardenhire,"Rodriguez knew that if he made a mistake, he was going to get hurt. That was the presence we have been searching for. Having him there with a few other guys, there's a presence there that you have to make some pitches. It carries over and that was nice to see."
Ron Gardenhire,"We just kept banging away and fortunately enough, they made one mistake, missed a ball which hurt them. You've just got to keep playing because you never know what is going to happen in the game."
Ron Gardenhire,"All we are hoping is he doesn't hurt himself, because it's not the normal progression for him."
Ron Gardenhire,"Last year, we missed too many opportunities. What hurt us more than anything last year was situational hitting, so if we can hit a ground ball to second in some of those situations to get a run in, we're going to be better off for it. That's what we are looking for, a little better situational hitting."
Ron Gardenhire,"Before he got hurt, he was a pretty good hitter. HeÂ had great hands and a very quick bat. He seemed to know what he was doing."
Ron Gardenhire,All we're hoping is that he doesn't hurt himself.
Ron Gardenhire,"He's a good ballplayer. When he's healthy, defensively he's all over the field. All we can hope for is he's rusty."
Ron Gardenhire,That win was huge for this ballclub. We go to Cleveland and we still have hope.
Ron Gardenhire,"I hope he doesn't get a start, because if he doesn't that means we're in the race until the end. But if we fall out of it, sure we'll take a look at that."
Ron Gardenhire,Home runs are going to come. He'll learn to take a pitch and drive it out of the ballpark. We don't really need to tell him what to do.
Ron Gardenhire,"If Buck sees him throwing 84 mph on March 6, he's going to have a heart attack. It's an issue, but people have to deal with it. There are going to be pitchers who are notorious for not getting going until right at the end of spring training. Guys aren't going to be locked and loaded; that's almost a guarantee."
Ron Gardenhire,Everything checked out fine. They even said I had a heart.
Ron Gardenhire,"I think we're fine. Health-wise we're not where we need to be. We're 7-11 and played without our top two guys (Shannon Stewart and Luis Castillo) for four games now. ... Of course, we haven't played worth a flip on the road, and that's what's disturbing. You're not going to get anywhere doing that."
Ron Gardenhire,"He's going to be pumped up and throwing as hard as he can, and those are the scary issues you have. We don't get a chance to monitor him."
Ron Gardenhire,We're very happy that he's staying.
Ron Gardenhire,We're not giving him a spot by any means. He has a good edge in there. ... But he still has to come out.
Ron Gardenhire,"We are out there giving everything,"
Ron Gardenhire,I'm not going to punish a guy just because he's going to the world games. It's quite an honor. But it does make it a little bit more difficult. I'm not going to evaluate him while he's in the world games. I'll be evaluating my guys here.
Ron Gardenhire,"Being on the bench for these games won't help them get ready for season. We are thin at the infield spots, so we are very happy to have these guys stay here."
Ron Gardenhire,Baker threw the ball great. He pitched very well in some big games.
Ron Gardenhire,"The risk of a catcher getting beat up in the World games is pretty high, and I'm happy to have my young catcher here."
Ron Gardenhire,It was his game until he gave up a run. You don't get too many opportunities in the majors to pitch a 1-0 shutout.
Ron Gardenhire,He's got a great arm and a great future in this organization.
Ron Gardenhire,I'm Tony Batista from the Dominican Republic. He's a pretty funny guy. We've had a lot of laughs already.
Ron Gardenhire,"He's a pretty funny guy. He's brought about a lot of laughs already, so we're just going to let him play. He claps for himself and now he's got everybody clapping for him."
Ron Gardenhire,It's a lot of fun for everybody.
Ron Gardenhire,It's always fun to play the Yankees. They bring a certain aura to the ballpark.
Ron Gardenhire,He was ready. He stepped into a good situation. It was fun to see.
Ron Gardenhire,"Having guys pull for each other, everyone grabbing an oar, you can have a lot of fun. It's an old T.K. saying. 'If everyone grabs an oar and moves his share of water, we'll be OK.' That's what we're after."
Ron Gardenhire,I loved watching Ozzie manage in the other dugout and he manages just like he played. He had fun playing the game and he manages having fun and that's the way we should all try to do it. I think he set a pretty good tone.
Ron Gardenhire,"Having guys pull for each other, everyone grabbing an oar, you can have a lot of fun. It's an old T.K. saying, ... 'If everyone grabs an oar and moves his share of water, we'll be OK.' That's what we're after."
Ron Gardenhire,That was pretty fun to see. He even said afterward that he surprised himself.
Ron Gardenhire,"I want the whole player back. You have to guard against letting him get outÂ there and trying to force too much or letting him do too much early. It's nice to see and I'm really happy that he's back out thereÂ running around, because when it happened, there was a lot of talk that some guys never come back from this. It looks like he'sÂ beating the odds right now."
Ron Gardenhire,"It's a football Sunday, so we got down by a football score. It's hard to come back from that."
Ron Gardenhire,"We knocked the fire out of the ball. The guys swung the bats pretty good, and that's fun to see."
Ron Gardenhire,He's on fire right now. He's a great hitter in a great zone.
Ron Gardenhire,We knocked the fire out of the ball.
Ron Gardenhire,"Sometimes I wonder -- if you just take a guy and stick him in the fire -- if it's the right thing to do. Let him come up here, play here and there, get some confidence. He's not worried if he's going to play every day."
Ron Gardenhire,He's fighting everything. He's really pressing. We need to figure out how to help him get through this thing.
Ron Gardenhire,"I have no fear with those two young men,"
Ron Gardenhire,"Maybe we can put some fear in them, They have a single-digit lead (over Cleveland) now, so you know they're starting to feel the effects. And that's half the battle, to see how people handle things."
Ron Gardenhire,You could feel the electricity in the building.
Ron Gardenhire,"I'm sure he'll come along and say he can hit. I don't doubt that a bit. If we need him to go out there later in the game, he'll go out there."
Ron Gardenhire,"He gets a little wound up here, no doubt. Hopefully we can calm him down a little tonight."
Ron Gardenhire,"He's the best player I ever saw on the field, without a doubt."
Ron Gardenhire,"It's unfortunate we're not scoring enough runs for him. He's the best left-hander in this league, there's no doubt in my mind. And, he may be the best pitcher."
Ron Gardenhire,"He said he was doing better. He talked about being on a diet, working out, getting to feeling better, and talked of getting married in June. It was fun to see him again."
Ron Gardenhire,Young Scott Baker out there facing a lineup that can just eat you alive. But he had enough deception. He can add and subtract very well.
Ron Gardenhire,"He had good deception tonight. The ball was going in there pretty good, he made some pitches. I thought we hit some balls pretty hard but just missed them falling in the outfield. But he pitched good enough and mixed it up good enough to beat us."
Ron Gardenhire,"A lot of things got straightened out. It was a good conversation, ... Both parties learned a little bit about what each other is thinking and what's going on. It helped me. I'm sure it helped J.C. I learned a lot from him."
Ron Gardenhire,It wasn't the most beautiful pitching performance you've ever seen. But the one thing he did was damage control... and that gave us a chance.
Ron Gardenhire,"He's just got to learn to control everything a little better. He did a lot better last year, they told me, but heÂ had the arm injury and it's just got to keep improving. He has a chance to be a great pitcher in this organization, whether it is as aÂ starter or a 'pen guy. We haven't really decided. He will dictate that."
Ron Gardenhire,"J.D., we're looking for a little more consistency from him. People talk about him being passed by, but he has the chance to be a good pitcher in this organization. He can't wait to get the ball. We like guys like that. He doesn't come in with a chip on his shoulder."
Ron Gardenhire,"I liked the way he came back up with confidence. I think (the job) is wide open, but he goes into camp as the front-runner."
Ron Gardenhire,"That was (coach Paul) Molitor yelling at the umpire, not me. I just raised and said, 'What?' and he told me to get out of here."
Ron Gardenhire,Just another one for the books. Ohhhh God.
Ron Gardenhire,"It would be nice to have another body, yes absolutely. That's what makes it so screwy here towards the callups and when rosters expand. We had to bring [Scott Baker] up. There was no one we could send out other than a position player."
Ron Gardenhire,We made a good stand here against some very good baseball teams. We're .500 against four teams that are going to be contending for the playoffs. That's not bad from the way we started.
Ron Gardenhire,"It's true he's a little bit behind of where he would normally be. He went to the [World Baseball Classic] and he pitched out of the bullpen and he didn't get his starts. But you also have to remember that he had the knee surgery, pitched a little bit this winter, then goes right into the [World Baseball Classic]. That's not making excuses. He had good stuff tonight, but he's not exactly perfect right now with his location or as good as we've seen him."
Ron Gardenhire,"That's our Achilles' heel all year long. We've got one of the best pitching staffs in baseball and offensively, we just can't support them. That's why we're in the position we're in in our league, our division and this Wild Card race."
Ron Gardenhire,"I think you saw a pretty exciting baseball team out there. We got some huge hits, big hits, and a huge inning that everybody was a part of."
Ron Gardenhire,We'll have a little 'pump-'em-up' meeting and then go play baseball. We'll be putting in the whole defensive package. That's where it's fun for me.
Ron Gardenhire,"We won one game here. We didn't quit, we didn't lay down. We just didn't play great baseball here. The guys are trying. You're facing a team that's hungry."
Ron Gardenhire,"He still likes baseball, I'll tell you that. He likes this team, of course, and he still has a lot of fun coming to these games."
Ron Gardenhire,"We made a good stand here against some very good baseball teams. We're .500 against four teams that are all going to be contending for the playoffs. We're standing at .500 here after a tough start, and we've really battled back to get to .500. And you know what, that's not bad."
Ron Gardenhire,"They can pitch, catch the ball and swing the bat. It's a very good baseball team. They put a lot of money into it this winter and it will be a fun opening series for us against a good baseball team."
Ron Gardenhire,We're probably going to add even one more pitcher. We're just trying to protect ourselves from these World [Baseball Classic] games. You need to have 20-plus pitchers here.
Ron Gardenhire,"I don't want to talk J.C, we're talking Twins baseball. Me and J.C. are fine. We've done our business."
Ron Gardenhire,They're playing the game over there. That's a great baseball team.
Ron Gardenhire,It's been our Achilles' heel all year long. We have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball and we just can't support them offensively.
Ron Gardenhire,"That was a real bad baseball game by our baseball team. Missing cutoff men, missing plays, you can go all over the field. That was real disappointing. You can't just play baseball like that. It isn't taught around here."
Ron Gardenhire,"They came out and smoked the baseball. Every pitch we threw that was up, they whacked it."
Ron Gardenhire,"All he can do is go out and throw the baseball, ... You have to think of where Radke is at. He has been our No. 1 starter for how many years? When you're the No. 1 starter, who are you facing? You're facing the other teams' No. 1, No. 2 starter pretty much the whole year."
Ron Gardenhire,"How much baseball he has left in him, that's what we'll determine in spring training. As far as going to Plan B, that's not something I've looked at yet. But we've got people here who've played over there before."
Ron Gardenhire,"He still likes baseball. He'll always ask me, 'Who's pitching today?' He always tells me the game goes in cycles -- he's right."
Ron Gardenhire,It would be wonderful for us if Port Charlotte got a baseball team for spring training.
Ron Gardenhire,"I think he's been just missing some balls. I can show you struggling, if you want to see some highlights. He's really close to whacking it pretty good. I don't worry about him. He's a veteran. He knows how to hit."
Ron Gardenhire,We've played well defensively. We don't miss too many balls there.
Adam Gardner,"It's a family; lacrosse is not like any other sport, it's more of a way of life."
Adam Gardner,"I never really thought of community service as a movement, but it is."
Adam Gardner,It's great not only talking about community service in theory but actually doing it.
Howard Gardner,I think tolerating a certain degree of failure-not because it's good for you but because it's a necessary part of growth-is a very important part of the message the leadership can give.
Howard Gardner,"Over time and cultures, the most robust and most effective form of communication is the creation of a powerful narrative,"
Howard Gardner,Stories are the single most powerful tool in a leader's toolkit.
Howard Gardner,"A lot of knowledge in any kind of an organization is what we call task knowledge. These are things that people who have been there a long time understand are important, but they may not know how to talk about them. It's often called the culture of the organization."
Howard Gardner,"Twenty-five years ago, the notion was you could create a general problem-solver software that could solve problems in many different domains. That just turned out to be totally wrong."
Howard Gardner,I align myself with almost all researchers in assuming that anything we do is a composite of whatever genetic limitations were given to us by our parents and whatever kinds of environmental opportunities are available.
Howard Gardner,Being fast and not very spatial doesn't make you any better in spatial kinds of things; you probably just get the wrong answer more quickly.
Howard Gardner,"I believe that the brain has evolved over millions of years to be responsive to different kinds of content in the world. Language content, musical content, spatial content, numerical content, etc."

Tom Gardner,"I actually have a Sleep Number bed and its great. But from what they've done from a business standpoint, that's what's brilliant."
Charles Garfield,"The fact is, the difference between peak performers and everybody else are much smaller than everybody else thinks."
Charles Garfield,"A mission could be defined as an image of a desired state that you want to get to. Once fully seen, it will inspire you to act, fuel your imagination and determine your behavior."
Charles Garfield,"Peak performers develop powerful mental images of the behavior that will lead to the desired results. They see in their mind's eye the result they want, and the actions leading to it."
Charles Garfield,Peak performers see the ability to manage change as a necessity in fulfilling their missions

James Garner,I've always wanted to work with Gena.
James Garner,I have a tough enough time running my own house -- and my wife does that anyway.
James Garner,"I'm letting the police deal with that,"
James Garner,"I said, 'Well, I'll give myself five years to see if I can make a living at it.' And after five years I was 30 and I said, 'Yeah, I can go another five years on just the reputation I have now' and then I went another five, and another five, and another five, and finally -- at 50 years old -- I said 'You know, I think I have a career,'"
James Garner,We worked very hard to get this for the retirees.

James Garner,"Everybody wants blockbusters. I like to see a few pictures now and then that have to do with people and have relationships, and that's what I want to do films about. I don't want to see these sci-fi movies, and I don't want to do one of those. I don't understand it."
James Garner,"It will force our agreement with the county to be written a certain way,"
Phil Garner,The whole thing is OK. It's OK with the team. We don't have to worry about what he does in between starts because we know he does his work. It's evidenced by the way he pitches.
Phil Garner,"We got on the field and got some work done, a lot of ground balls and fly balls. We got those skills taken care of today. We missed our fundamentals but we'll still be able to double up (today) and get back on track."
Phil Garner,"But his value goes way beyond his contribution on the field. No. 1, he's an extremely intelligent player. He knows how the game is supposed to be played, and he imparts that knowledge to other players."
Phil Garner,"Chris got more big hits. That triple was an icebreaker. We've been trying to find some way to generate offence the past couple of weeks, done whatever we can."
Phil Garner,You just have to trust your scouts in that regard.
Phil Garner,"Wade Miller was destined to have arm trouble with that kind of delivery. Rarely do I see a guy with that kind of delivery. Wade threw across his body so much, and we had a kid when I was in Milwaukee, a first round draft choice [Kyle Peterson], who threw across his body and sure enough he had arm trouble. Chad's is not a delivery that is destined for arm trouble. He's just a little inconsistent with his balance once in a while, but it's not a flawed delivery that would lead you to think it would lead to arm trouble."
Phil Garner,"When you start pitching away from contact, that's when you get in a lot of trouble. That's when your pitch counts get way up and you can't get through four innings."
Phil Garner,"I think you have to be willing to trade a lot of players and be willing to make changes. And you have to do it quickly. If I made a mistake, I stayed with players too long. We tried to develop, but I think you need to make decisions very quickly."
Phil Garner,[Having Berkman back] is like making a big trade.
Phil Garner,"His strength is slightly down, but not enough to really be concerned. But we'll watch him and see. I don't even know if that's important, because a lot of times after you pitch your strength might be down."
Phil Garner,"Teams just don't get shut out nine times with one guy (starting), ... It just defies all senses we know in this game. It's like Catfish Hunter used to always say. 'It's not how you pitch. It's when you pitch.'"
Phil Garner,"Roy himself is not a self-promoter,"
Phil Garner,"If that happened with somebody else, it would be all over the place. But Roy is not a self-promoter. He's very laid back."
Phil Garner,"Roy himself is not a self-promoter, ... He's very laid back, as you all know, and that's not a show he puts on. That's the way he is. He's very comfortable being in the back room."
Phil Garner,"These are our best umpires, and it's not an exact science. I don't know that you can make it an exact science."
Phil Garner,"That's not a lot of innings. If he's injured or if he's at risk, I understand that. I'm sure if there was any foul play, the commissioner would be involved."
Phil Garner,"Willy, that's his game, ... He creates problems."
Phil Garner,That's Willie's game. He can create problems.
Phil Garner,"During batting practice, he just felt a little twitch in his back, so we decided to shut him down. We don't think it's serious."
Phil Garner,"He pitched a little tight and you want to be careful with [Hall] because he's got power, but you don't like to walk him and that's why we put Wheeler in those situations -- because he usually doesn't walk guys. Hall comes up with the big hit and beyond that, they put the ball in play. You have to give them credit. They didn't strike out. That's what we were looking for."
Phil Garner,He is a legitimate power threat swinging the bat.
Phil Garner,"His offensive numbers probably aren't what we'd all like to see them be, but he's shown some power, and I think he shows some hits in clutch situations. He's not afraid of anything. He has that little boy in him."
Phil Garner,You can live with some strikeouts when you're going to have a lot of power.
Phil Garner,We just need a good performance. Nine shutout innings would be nice.
Phil Garner,"If you mentioned the names of Qualls and Wheeler and Springer, it doesn't exactly make people shudder. Most people don't know who they are."
Phil Garner,"People are still going to pick the Cardinals, and that's OK. I think people are looking at the Cardinals' starting staff as their rotation might be the best, and it might very well be."
Phil Garner,"Everybody just kind of slipped past Roy. He was the only 20-game winner in the National League. It wasn't like his stuff was [bad]. He had pretty good numbers, too."
Phil Garner,"The bottom line what we're looking at is did he have pain, and he did not, ... Did he get good extension, and (team consultant) Matt Galante reports he did."
Phil Garner,He's not really in any pain but he felt it. If he's not OK then we'll look at our options.
Phil Garner,"It's a wasted opportunity, no question, ... We didn't take (the Brewers) for granted, we just didn't show up offensively."
Phil Garner,"It's a wasted opportunity, no question. We didn't take (the Brewers) for granted, we just didn't show up offensively."
Phil Garner,"ItÂ´s a wasted opportunity, no question, ... We didnÂ´t take (the Brewers) for granted, we just didnÂ´t show up offensively."
Phil Garner,We didn't make the pitches to put them away. That happened all night long. We got ahead of them and didn't put them away.
Phil Garner,"A lot of guys did a good job, ... Willy had a nice night, Lance with the big one. It looked like it was in our favor, then they turned the tide on and we went right back out and got back in the ballgame."
Phil Garner,Willy had a really nice night.
Phil Garner,"Certainly, it's nice to go on the road and play well. The first night here wasn't kind to us, but we ended up having a split in San Francisco. I'll take it."
Phil Garner,"The story so far is they're hammering on our mistakes, and we're exactly opposite. That's why we're having so much trouble."
Phil Garner,"Biggio made his mind up. He knew what he wanted to do. The kid made a good throw. You have to give him credit. Most guys will get thrown out if people make good throws. You don't see it that often. They made two good throws actually. He hit the cutoff man, and Weeks took care of the rest of it."
Phil Garner,"It's phenomenal just to watch the man, what he does, how he prepares. But he's a true star in my viewpoint. And a true star is somebody who you just sense is bigger than anything you've ever been around, and he is that."
Phil Garner,"Obviously, we'd love to have Rocket back. He's special. There's no question about that. But it's on nobody's minds, when we went out there [to play] yesterday, 'Well, May 1 is coming. What are we going to do? I hope we get Rocket.' I don't think anybody thought about that."
Phil Garner,"A lot of these kids get a free pass until you get to a certain point. Then, when you get to a certain point, that's where you find out who can play. ... There's a culture of losing that gets into the system and no matter how hard you fight it, it's there. No one wants to talk about it, but it's there."
Phil Garner,I anticipate him being very sore. By no stretch of the imagination am I counting him out now.
Phil Garner,"It was sure a good game to win after a little bit of futility along the way. I would hope it would give us some momentum, but it certainly feels good right now."
Phil Garner,"I firmly believe that this is the best situation for him if he wants to pitch again. It's home. We already have the 'Rocket freedom clause.' Plus, I think this pitching two-thirds of a season may be a great idea, just may be a great idea."
Phil Garner,We have to go home and regroup. We'll make a series out of this.
Phil Garner,"Thank goodness for Adam Everett tonight. Some of those runs you fail to pick up could come back to haunt you, but Adam was cleaning it up all night long for us, and it turned out to be the difference in the game."
Phil Garner,"I like to see players achieve personal goals, because I think it's important,"
Phil Garner,"For a young pitcher he's been very confident, but not only that, he's delivered. He's delivered in these big games for us. We're impressed by it. We feel confident when he's on the mound."
Phil Garner,"We need to win games like this, ... But that's the way we've played. I think we want to take it down to the wire."
Phil Garner,He had pitched too good of a game to have it slip away. So give it to the guy that's supposed to finish the game out. He'll have a whole bunch more opportunities to finish those kind of games out.
Phil Garner,Roy set a really good pace for the game. He was in a good rhythm.
Phil Garner,He is a fun player to watch. You just kind of get the feeling he's going to do something. He's just got that kind of a persona about him.
Phil Garner,"I'd rather see them fighting in [the clubhouse], with fists going, rather than it festering and finding out about it two weeks later with groups whispering in different sides of the clubhouse."
Phil Garner,It's amazing when he passes the likes of Joe DiMaggio last year. Those are clearly Hall of Fame numbers.
Phil Garner,It was wonderful. It's better than words. Your heart flutters. There are tears in your eyes.
Phil Garner,It's a simulated-game type environment.
Phil Garner,"Get that energy level going and put it to good use. We're not worried about him burning out now, (he has) the next month all winter to get over it."
Phil Garner,"There's obviously that emotion,"
Phil Garner,I recall seeing him [as a closer] against my clubs. He's got just fierce determination and [is] a great competitor. Now I have to add pretty good public speaker to that after listening to him on this. He's pretty impressive all-around.
Phil Garner,We make our own destiny.
Phil Garner,"Nobody pitches better in the playoffs than he does. My one criticism, and I only have one, is he pitches behind hitters too much in the regular season and he doesn't seem to do that in the playoffs."
Phil Garner,"We got back in control, and we didn't control it."
Phil Garner,"I'm sure it's a big confidence booster for him since he pitched well but wasn't able to get a win the first two times back,"
Phil Garner,"This is a show of confidence in what we did this year. It is important to have continuity in the organization, that players and staff and everybody knows that we still have someone that's going to be here this year, next year and the year after."
Phil Garner,Brandon did a good job. I'm sure it's a big confidence booster for him since he pitched well but wasn't able to get a win the first two times back.
Phil Garner,"Pettitte was good. No complaints, so that was good. That was very good."
Phil Garner,"I didn't want to see them lose, because I know they're having fun with the competition. But it could be possibly good for Carlos. Get him back in here and get him pitching."
Phil Garner,"I think it's a disregard to our fans, the comfort of our fans."
Phil Garner,"We persevere through circumstances most teams can't overcome,"
Phil Garner,"He should be high on the list of anybody's choices for Rookie of the Year,"
Phil Garner,"This team has a lot of character. And as someone who has lived in Houston a long time, I know how long our fans have been waiting for this and how much it means to them. They've earned it."
Phil Garner,"This is a test of character. It's a test of what you're made of because there are so very few positions open. You play for the enjoyment of the game, but I want guys who are determined to get to the big leagues."
Phil Garner,No more than I was in the beginning. I knew coming in there were going to be ups and downs.
Phil Garner,"All I'm trying to do, from a baseball standpoint, is get him in good baseball condition and try to get his feedback in terms of playing the game. At that point, we'll decide where he'll go from there."
Phil Garner,"He has pitched absolutely brilliant baseball. He should not have lost a game this year, basically."
Phil Garner,"I think the wild card has been exceptionally good for our game, ... Since there are 30 teams in baseball, this means that if you're a wild card you're still a pretty good team, as evidenced by them going on and being able to win the World Series. ... I'd say don't discount the Brewers at all."
Phil Garner,"I think Houston and baseball fans around the country really enjoy watching the legend pitch now, perhaps the greatest pitcher of all time. If there's anything that comes after this, that's up to Roger."
Phil Garner,Things went very well in the surgery and he's in Georgia with (wife) Jennifer and the baby and things are well. He will address the press when he gets back.
Phil Garner,"Roy is on the slight side and he's lean, but very strong, very strong, and a very good athlete."
Phil Garner,You feel like there's a little higher call that you're playing for. It takes away from the personal anxiety and makes it an inspirational thing.
Phil Garner,"We took advantage. When we started getting guys on base we had nice hitting. Of course, the three-run homer always helps out."
Phil Garner,He did a nice job. He showed tonight what he can do. He does have the ability to hit the long ball to right center.
Kevin Garnett,"I take a lot of pride in how I look,"
Kevin Garnett,"I just took what he gave me. It felt good and looked good, from my perspective, but it just came out,"
Kevin Garnett,"He's definitely into it. Sometimes, he does look a little bewildered, but I don't think passion is in the back seat, so to speak. He's playing with a lot of heart, but at the same time, he's trying to figure it out."
Kevin Garnett,"We knew that if we came in here and played around or didn't play with the right mind set, we were going to get blown out. We came in and took some of their 3-pointers away."
Kevin Garnett,Anything is Possible!!!
Kevin Garnett,"Whether you want to put faith in them or not, they do what they do and they do what they want to do, ... It's not my team. Glen Taylor, he and Kevin McHale try to put together a plan and I guess for whatever reason try to enforce it. But I don't think I'm the person to ask."
Kevin Garnett,"A.C. was unbelievable with energy. He came in and kicked it off. When A.C. came in, the tempo just picked up immediately."
Kevin Garnett,I should have had a little more control than that.
Kevin Garnett,"We know that in order for us to turn this around, it doesn't matter how many coaches they bring in here, assistants, weight trainers, whoever, we're the ones that are going to have turn it around. And I think just took that responsibility on ourselves."
Kevin Garnett,"The last couple of practices, all we've been doing is a lot of defensive things. We've been going over some drills that make all of us have to communicate."
Kevin Garnett,"The beautiful thing about when you go through a slide is that you learn from it. Not just saying that you learn from it, but applying the things that you have learned."
Kevin Garnett,"So you're dealing with a coach, and you're dealing with a guy who's actually experienced NBA basketball from a player's perspective and actually goes about it that way."
Kevin Garnett,"So we take a lot of pride in that. It's really on us to turn this thing around. I think this last month we've done just that. We've pointed ourself in the direction that we want to be, and I think we're starting to head towards that. Right now we're in a nice rhythm."
Kevin Garnett,"Kev has these old Boston drills, where you all have to talk to each other, and interact, and it's helped us."
Kevin Garnett,I would love to see Flip get back into the league. I think he can definitely still coach in this league. I think he will be in this league quicker than sooner.
Kevin Garnett,"Going from Flip to Kev, obviously you don't want to see someone ever lose their job. For me it's probably a little more difficult, because other than Bill Blair, Flip is all I knew."
Kevin Garnett,"We have to do the impossible, but it is possible."
Kevin Garnett,"I'm from the bottom, I understand what it's like to have and to not have. My perception on giving is to put yourself in those people's shoes and go from there. So that's what I did."
Richard Garnett,"It's not the usual thing, but it doesn't strike me as being troubling. It would be a mistake to read it as payback."
Richard Garnett,"Before Chief Justice Rehnquist, it really was like nine scorpions in a bottle."
Richard Garnett,"And if it comes to a point where he says, 'I can't do the job,' then I think he'll just quit. But we don't know if he's at that point yet."
Richard Garnett,"He loves the court, ... So he must have felt, 'If I can stay on the job with a reasonable expectation I can maintain my health, then why not.'"
Richard Garnett,really did dramatically reshape the conversation about federal power.
Richard Garnett,"['Changed the conversation' But that doesn't mean his contribution at the court hasn't been historically significant.] Someone can have a huge effect on shaping our constitutional jurisprudence even if on some of the 'big cases' they are on the losing side, ... Chief Justice Rehnquist changed the conversation. He brought back to the table certain ideas about limited government, federalism, and texturalism."
Richard Garnett,"Even if the president wasn't up to it in alligators and his approval rating was 90 percent, John Roberts simply is the best guy for the chief justice's job. I think the thought of having John Roberts join him on the court kept the chief going despite his cancer. I think he's probably smiling about it now."
Janeane Garofalo,I feel like the American people are being lied to and manipulated. [President Bush] is trying to force 9/11 and Saddam together.
Janeane Garofalo,"You have to have a lot more dedication to what I'll call 'the machine,' ... I have 20 percent dedication. What's needed is 110 percent. You can't have it with the level of apathy I have."
Janeane Garofalo,"How is it that this debate has been twisted on its head, that somehow those that advocate peace and diplomacy are anti-American? ... Or those that advocate peace are anti-troops or pro-Saddam?"
Janeane Garofalo,"I actually was class clown, but I don't know how that happened because I've never been considered an outwardly funny person-as the people in this room will attest."
Janeane Garofalo,"When I see the American flag, I go, 'Oh my God, you're insulting me.'"
Janeane Garofalo,Iraq is a manufactured conflict for the sake of geopolitical dominance in the area.
Janeane Garofalo,I absolutely realize that a celebrity spokesperson is not ideal.
Janeane Garofalo,I would have to say loneliness is next to uncleanliness.
Janeane Garofalo,The term 'celebrity' makes my skin crawl.
Janeane Garofalo,Is being an idiot like being high all the time?
Janeane Garofalo,"I say at this point, for different reasons, Bush and Hussein are both very threatening to world peace and to deny that is to be incredibly naive."
Janeane Garofalo,"To me, there is no greater act of courage than being the one who kisses first."
Janeane Garofalo,I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth.
Lesley Garrett,"I credit him with getting me started in television,"
Lesley Garrett,I also have to support my speaking voice by sitting in a way that engages the diaphragm in the way I would for singing.
Lesley Garrett,Just walking along Shaftesbury Avenue gave me such a buzz - it still does - and communicating with an audience through music is still the biggest thrill in the world.
Lesley Garrett,Whichever route they choose as long as they're doing it seriously and looking after their voices and training then they'll be fine.
Lesley Garrett,"Nobody inspired me more than Julie Andrews, who is a classically trained soprano herself."
Lesley Garrett,The musical heritage of Yorkshire is deep and wide.
Lesley Garrett,One of the problems that we face through the media attention that these artists receive is that there has been an awful lot of talk about opera and classical music being elite and being for an elitist group.
Lesley Garrett,I performed in Sydney some years ago for the Sydney Festival and I am just so pleased to be returning to the wonderful Sydney Opera House and also performing in Melbourne for the first time.
Lesley Garrett,"Last autumn I made a programme about the history of the Strauss family and of the waltz, which involved a trip to the beautiful city of Vienna."
Lesley Garrett,"What people really should be able to be confident in is that the standards of music- making that classically trained musicians present is elite, it is the best and all of us as artists should be committed to that."
Lesley Garrett,Music is there to access those dark emotional corners that we don't normally get too close to.
Lesley Garrett,I do a lot of vocal hygiene.
Lesley Garrett,"Opera is credible drama now, and it costs less than going to a football match. What have you got to lose?"
Lesley Garrett,You've got to very much be part of today's society and you've got to use 21st Century techniques to draw attention to what you believe in.
Lesley Garrett,I'm engaging my diaphragm as I'm speaking to you right now.
Lesley Garrett,And woven into the fabric of this harsh existence was music.
Lesley Garrett,I'm very pro presenting the best music I can to the widest audience possible.
Lesley Garrett,"As far as I was concerned the important thing was that the music was getting the attention as well as me so it was always a great way to get more of the public to connect with classical music, and opera particularly."
Lesley Garrett,I do hope that our spring will be starting shortly and we will all be able to enjoy some sunshine again.
Lesley Garrett,I would just like to say that opera is no longer about fat people in breastplates shattering wine glasses.
Lesley Garrett,Singing is an arduous business and it needs sacrifices.
Lesley Garrett,I saw The Sound of Music when I was 10 and thought that it was the most beautiful singing I had ever heard.
Lesley Garrett,I don't think I have ever met a single person who isn't moved by music of some kind.
Lesley Garrett,"To tell you the truth, I never listen to opera at home."
Lesley Garrett,Seeing that made me understand how profound the drama of opera was and how music theatre is the most powerful audiovisual form there is.
Lesley Garrett,It was really lovely to find another way to express music. I found that singing and dancing have such a lot in common.
Lesley Garrett,The community that underpinned my upbringing was born from the pits and the steelworks and the railways.
Lesley Garrett,"I don't just come from a musical family, but from a musical community."
Lesley Garrett,"What's real is your ability to sing, your ability to entertain the public, your goals to be the best artist you can."
Scott Garrett,congratulated what we are doing regarding the Gulf Coast [in the wake of hurricane Katrina] and wished us safety and security.
Scott Garrett,"I thought we ought to follow the army around for a couple months instead of a week or two, and to do an hour and a half thing instead of a 45 second clip."
Scott Garrett,I wanted to know what was happening and what army life is like in Iraq.
Augie Garrido,They're really a quality a team and it isn't that easy to break them. What you saw was a championship-type performance on their part. That (fifth) inning was a great inning for them. Sustaining that inning for as long as they did takes a lot of talent.
Augie Garrido,"They were aggressive inside the strike zone and forced us to hit routine fly balls. It was aggressive, quality pitching."
Augie Garrido,"You want to win everything along the way, because that buys you 24 hours of peace, but the national championship is the goal for this program."
Augie Garrido,We have a lot of new players that have a chance to make important contributions. We're just getting ready to take the journey.
Augie Garrido,It wasn't graceful by any stretch of the imagination. It was like a heavyweight prize fight.
Augie Garrido,"Obviously, the expectation levels are always high, and they are again. So, we'll just get ready to take the journey."
Augie Garrido,We need to stabilize the infield. We're trying to establish a system that will give us consistency.
David Garrow,"It is not surprising in the least that a president from Texas would nominate an SMU graduate to the Supreme Court, ... It would have been surprising for JFK."
David Garrow,Almost certainly on the table here is an awful lot more than the federal partial-birth ban.
David Garrow,"Much of her behavior of the past 15 years â€” all the crass or embarrassing commercial uses of his name or image â€” has its roots in the sense of privation she experienced when he was alive. Not only did they not have any money, but Doc did not believe in spending money on the family and the household. He would spend money on food, good hotels, good suits, but that was about it."
David Garrow,"The evidence in this poll suggests that race relations in America may be distinctly better than most of us think they are, ... Bearing the Cross."
David Garrow,"I don't think where someone's law degree is from is necessarily a hindrance, ... There is an advantage to going to Harvard or Yale or Chicago."
Michael Gartenberg,The technology to build these is fairly simple. It doesn't require advanced development techniques.
Michael Gartenberg,The pricing model seems to be somewhat questionable here. People will ask why they need to spend that much money for a box.
Michael Gartenberg,"When Steve Jobs says, 'One More Thing,' a catchphrase almost as familiar as the turtleneck and jeans, that's usually when the other shoe drops, when the bombshell hits. People are parsing the invitation the same way they're searching 'Lost' for new meanings and nuance."
Michael Gartenberg,"The experience isn't going to be radically different for the Apple user after this. There will be some adjustment, some tweaks here and there, but it is not going to be a dramatically different experience."
Michael Gartenberg,"No doubt, I'm sure, the senior executives at Microsoft were pretty upset (with the latest Vista delay). Steven has a track record of shipping products (and he can) potentially take the reins and get the thing out the door and fix whatever process problems there are."
Michael Gartenberg,"This blitz is a reminder of the fact that while enterprises are extremely important to the company, HP has not lost the focus on things that it excels at. The consumer market can be very lucrative as consumers move beyond using their PCs just for e-mail and word processing."
Michael Gartenberg,This indicates Microsoft's long-term commitment to this (field). Certainly they're not content with their position in the marketplace.
Michael Gartenberg,We've seen growing awareness of this notion of connectivity. And we'll continue to see this going forward in 2006.
Michael Gartner,You really won't know until you know who is hired for those jobs. Certainly they're three of the most important jobs at the university.
Michael Gartner,I hope salary isn't a bar to getting good people as candidates. I think that we will try to find the very best man or woman we can find and then try to work out the very best salary package we can work out.
Michael Gartner,"This first year was based on a promise, but the future will be based on performance."
Michael Gartner,"I had so much fun (writing it) I didn't want to stop,"
Michael Gartner,"It's a market economy, ... Apparently the demand for great coaches exceeds the supply, so of course the price of good coaches is going to be high."
Michael Gartner,"I can speak with authority on any subject in 13 paragraphs,"
Michael Gartner,"There isn't as much passion and outrage in today's newspapers. That may be because of a corporate decision, but they've lost their personality."
Michael Gartner,"It's a market economy. Apparently the demand for great coaches exceeds the supply, so of course the price of good coaches is going to be high."
Michael Gartner,"There is no reason for anyone in this country, anyone except a police officer or a military person, to buy, to own, to have, to use a handgun... and the only way to do that is to change the Constitution."
Michael Gartner,One of the nicest things about NBC is that Tom Brokaw is not Dan Rather.
Marcus Garvey,I read Up From Slavery and then my dream -- if I may so call it -- of being a race leader dawned.
Marcus Garvey,"Up, up, you mighty race!/ You can accomplish/ what you will."
Marcus Garvey,I know no national boundary where the Negro is concerned. The whole world is my province until Africa is free.
Marcus Garvey,"There is no force like success, and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it; as of the individual, so should it be of the nation."
Marcus Garvey,Liberate the minds of men and ultimately you will liberate the bodies of men.
Marcus Garvey,Progress is the attraction that moves humanity.
Marcus Garvey,"The Black skin is not a badge of shame, but rather a glorious symbol of national greatness"
Marcus Garvey,"God and Nature first made us what we are, and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be. Follow always that great law. Let the sky and God be our limit and Eternity our measurement."
Marcus Garvey,Men who are in earnest are not afraid of consequences.
Steve Garvey,I can remember when Billy wouldn't say six words. Now you can't get the microphone away from him.
Steve Garvey,"I always try to act as though there is a little boy or a little girl around, and I try never to do anything that would give them a bad example."
Steve Garvey,"You must be passionate, you must dedicate yourself, and you must be relentless in the pursuit of your goals. If you do, you will be successful."
Steve Garvey,The difference between the old ballplayer and the new ballplayer is the jersey. The old ballplayer cared about the name on the front. The new ballplayer cares about the name on the back.
Elizabeth Gaskell,A little credulity helps one on through life very smoothly.
Elizabeth Gaskell,"A wise parent humours the desire for independent action, so as to become the friend and advisor when his absolute rule shall cease."
Elizabeth Gaskell,The cloud never comes from the quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it.
Elizabeth Gaskell,How easy it is to judge rightly after one sees what evil comes from judging wrongly!
Elizabeth Gaskell,"Sometimes one likes foolish people for their folly, better than wise people for their wisdom."
Elizabeth Gaskell,To be sure a stepmother to a girl is a different thing to a second wife to a man!
Elizabeth Gaskell,"Madam your wife and I didn't hit it off the only time I ever saw her. I won't say she was silly, but I think one of us was silly, and it wasn't me."
Elizabeth Gaskell,"People may flatter themselves just as much by thinking that their faults are always present to other people's minds, as if they believe that the world is always contemplating their individual charms and virtues."
Elizabeth Gaskell,I'll not listen to reason... reason always means what someone else has got to say.
Elizabeth Gaskell,"My heart burnt within me with indignation and grief; we could think of nothing else. All night long we had only snatches of sleep, waking up perpetually to the sense of a great shock and grief. Every one is feeling the same. I never knew so universal a feeling."
Elizabeth Gaskell,"He had not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his bones, and leanness goes a great way towards gentility."
Elizabeth Gaskell,"A wise parent humors the desire for independent action, so as to become the friend and advisor when his absolute rule shall cease."
Pau Gasol,"It's better. I just needed a few days of rest. A lot of things were bothering me. My knees and my foot started hurting (April 15) in Houston. It's gone away. I haven't felt it, and that's what we were looking for."
Pau Gasol,We came out in the second and played hard. We want to be in that playoff race and this game was crucial.
Pau Gasol,"I haven't felt any (pain) today and that's what I was looking for. We were looking for release from a lot of the fatigue and all that soreness that I had, and it's worked pretty well."
Pau Gasol,It's hard to overcome mentally when you are down 3-0 and they make a run.
Pau Gasol,"[On being frustrated] A little bit (frustration) is normal, you get frustrated when you miss your shots, but weve got to do a better job on Monday. Weve got to attack them a little harder, go strong to the rim, finish hard and forget about everything else."
Pau Gasol,It doesn't matter who gets what. It's just a matter of doing what it takes to win.
Jose Ortega y Gasset,Civilization is nothing else but the attempt to reduce force to being the last resort.
Jose Ortega y Gasset,Biography is: a system in which the contradictions of a human life are unified.
Jose Ortega y Gasset,Love is that splendid triggering of human vitality the supreme activity which nature affords anyone for going out of himself toward someone else.
Jose Ortega y Gasset,"Life is a series of collisions with the future; it is not the sum of what we have been, but what we yearn to be."
Bill Gates,"I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user."
Bill Gates,"If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25 cars that got 1000 MPG."
Bill Gates,That doesn't mean I believe that reproductions are as good as the originals. There's nothing like seeing the real work.
Bill Gates,long-term vision and product strategy.
Bill Gates,"My value is still so much higher than I ever expected it to be by a factor of about 50. So the fact that at one point it was say, a factor of 60, well -- that wealth is all going back to society anyway."
Bill Gates,No one should think that shareholder value would be preserved ... Microsoft would be greatly damaged by this kind of split.
Bill Gates,We're changing the world with technology.
Bill Gates,fantastic things in the field of technology and I am excited to be here.
Bill Gates,There's still a lot of common technology and a common mission that spans all these different groups.
Bill Gates,We're trying to drive (the technology) to critical mass.
Bill Gates,"As I understand it, providing Microsoft's technology to its competitors so they can build 'functional equivalents' of our products now, and match all our future innovations for 10 years, is in fact one of the central objectives,"
Bill Gates,"Eventually, speech recognition will be the key to eliminating"
Bill Gates,"The live phenomenon is not just about Microsoft. It's partners, it's competitors...the whole space is being transformed."
Bill Gates,"This is a space that we see as critical to our vision,"
Bill Gates,"Once they get that opened, they'll essentially be running as close to normal as possible,"
Bill Gates,We are experiencing the early days of a revolution...that will be long-lived and widespread.
Bill Gates,a revolution in how we think about software.
Bill Gates,There is a certain responsibility that accrued to me when I got to this unexpected position.
Bill Gates,"Hopefully, out of the research that gets funded here, we can have a flu vaccine that works against all forms, [an] approach that would save a lot of lives. Flu kills a lot of people in the world at large every year."
Bill Gates,"Because we now have a research group, and we are out there working with lots of universities and are able to continue to hire great people, I'm very optimistic about our future. But, it is a future full of change and surprise."
Bill Gates,"If there's one cultural quality we have, it's that we always see ourselves as an underdog."
Bill Gates,Getting the video sources into the PC has been a limiting factor. We're making progress making the video content easily accessible on the PC.
Bill Gates,"With our foundation, with others ... we're getting the brightest scientists to come and work on these problems,"
Bill Gates,"The key principles are very beneficial to consumers - they deserve to have us putting new capabilities in,"
Bill Gates,"These new offerings demonstrate how software is evolving through the power of services in ways that enable more dynamic and relevant experiences for people. Our goal is to make Windows, Office and Xbox further come alive for our customers at work, home and play."
Bill Gates,"The potential for all these exciting devices, smart objects and services to enrich and enhance the way we live is truly amazing."
Bill Gates,"It is a great pleasure for me to announce that Steve Ballmer -- my long-term partner in building Microsoft and a great business leader -- is being named CEO,"
Bill Gates,"I have a very strong optimism, not just about our activities here, but about all the new developments taking place in the country."
Bill Gates,"There's more opportunity for software than there has ever been ... in a sense, you can say that you haven't seen anything yet,"
Bill Gates,"Whether it's real-time communications, the speed or the consumer scenarios like photos and music, we're creating a platform that not only has what we're calling new experiences built in, but creates overall opportunity for third parties,"
Bill Gates,"Software, by being comprehensive, can save costs by avoiding add-on pieces of software. We can save money in terms of speed of development or by being able to run on less expensive hardware."
Bill Gates,Billy gates why do you make this possible? Stop making money and fix your software!
Bill Gates,There are no significant bugs in our released software that any significant number of users want fixed
Bill Gates,You make a grown man cry.
Bill Gates,"We see ourselves having a higher share, ... We're not going to name some magic number but we're out to give the best gaming experience and hope to get a really high market share out of that."
Bill Gates,"The software is where the magic is. If you're going to have all this power be simple enough, appealing enough and cool enough, it's going to be because the software is right."
Bill Gates,"In the living room itself, Xbox 360 is our centerpiece and a product that redefines what goes on there."
Bill Gates,"The opportunity to do better software has never been stronger. We talk about this digital decade and people living a digital work style or a digital lifestyle when they go home -and that is becoming more and more commonly accepted. As you move things away from paperwork and onto the digital approach, everything is software value-added."
Bill Gates,I like my job because it involves learning. I like being around smart people who are trying to figure out new things. I like the fact that if people really try they can figure out how to invent things that actually have an impact.
Bill Gates,"We all learn best in our own ways. Some people do better studying one subject at a time, while some do better studying three things at once. Some people do best studying in structured, linear way, while others do best jumping around, ''surrounding'' a subject rather than traversing it. Some people prefer to learn by manipulating models, and others by reading."
Bill Gates,"The digital decade is not just about any particular aspect of computing, taking enterprises, knowledge workers and homes and building standards that connect all of those together. The key piece in the center is trustworthy systems, systems that do what you expect on an extremely reliable basis. So in each of these areas we have new scenarios, new ways that people will be using their computers that they never did before."
Bill Gates,"We are pleased that a number of states have joined the Department of Justice in supporting this settlement, ... The fact that so many states have joined the federal government in supporting this agreement is a very significant, positive step toward resolving these issues once and for all."
Bill Gates,"[We learn that the ill-fated Apple Lisa may -- or may not -- have been named after Jobs' daughter, born out of wedlock just months before the project's inception; that the Mac Plus' code name was] Mr. T ... ... just because you broke into Xerox's house before I did and took the TV doesn't mean I can't go in later and take the stereo."
Bill Gates,"There's a basic philosophy here that by empowering...workers you'll make their jobs far more interesting, and they'll be able to work at a higher level than they would have without all that information just a few clicks away."
Bill Gates,"Getting minorities into those jobs we're not doing everything we should be to point out the opportunities,"
Bill Gates,"Only through focus can you do world-class things, no matter how capable you are."
Bill Gates,"As we look ahead to the appeals process, innovation will continue to be the No. 1 priority at Microsoft."
Bill Gates,"We're probably half way through this [innovation] phase. There's still quite a bit that can be done, but the key foundation pieces have been put in place,"
Bill Gates,"These proposals will have a chilling effect on innovation in the high technology industry, ... Microsoft could never have developed Windows under these rules. Looking forward, this kind of regulation would make it impossible for Microsoft to develop the next generation of great software."
Bill Gates,a chilling effect on innovation in the high-tech industry.
Bill Gates,"Having great software that lets your people see digital information, lets them collaborate, lets you build a great Web site, that's going to be very, very important for all companies going forward, ... And Windows 2000 is the key platform where that starts."
Bill Gates,"That information essentially will be magically stored on the Internet itself, ... With any device, once you prove who you are with a pass card or a smart card, the things you care about, (such as) e-mail, bookmarks . . . will appear on that device, but in the way that matters to you."
Bill Gates,"There is information out in the Internet, out in the cloud, that could be working on your behalf, ... .NET as a platform for next generation Internet integrates privacy, security and puts information where you want it. The user experience will become a lot richer and put the user back in control."
Bill Gates,"We need to make it easier for people to visualize information that comes from different directions,"
Bill Gates,Citizens are interested in more information if they can easily reach out and get it.
Bill Gates,"Windows and the consumer electronics industry are changing dramatically, people live in a world with more digital content and information than ever before."
Bill Gates,"It's a concept that in the past might have been thought of as an executive information system that was just for a few top people, ... It'd take millions of dollars to set up, the system would be hard-wired, and it would provide only a subset of data. Today, in literally minutes you can add data and status reports and your personal digital dashboard will update that."
Bill Gates,In the decade ahead I can predict that we will provide over twice the productivity improvement that we provided in the 90's.
Bill Gates,"The home itself will be like a computer system,"
Bill Gates,"It is certainly a dream come true in that we set a computer on every desk in every home and have the level of sales and profitability and employees we have today,"
Bill Gates,"This is the first time in our 25-year history we've actually changed our vision statement,"
Bill Gates,"We are embarking on the richest series of product releases in our company's 30-year history. Beyond the opportunities this presents for our customers and partners, these new live offerings represent an incredibly powerful way of enabling customers to more quickly access and benefit from the innovations being developed by our product teams."
Bill Gates,the greatest unpredicted miracle in history.
Bill Gates,Never before in history has innovation offered promise of so much to so many in so short a time.
Bill Gates,There is no area where privacy is more important than health records.
Bill Gates,"Health care applications, on the other hand, are quite local, ... Most software is actually local and fairly specialized."
Bill Gates,"If you get health, then you have opportunity for literacy. Health first, then literacy."
Bill Gates,"Health care doesn't rise up very high on the agenda on a lot of poor countries, ... I think there are some countries with AIDS epidemics that haven't stepped up to get the message out on the behavioral change, or stepped up to get infrastructure for treatment ?. And where you have a lack of priority and lack of funding, it just breaks down."
Bill Gates,Now the growth in the last year in Europe was very rapid and so you can say the gap is closing a bit. But I think it's still an issue of great concern. A lot of kids graduate from college in Europe without having the in-depth exposure that most U.S. students receive. So there's work to be done.
Bill Gates,This is clearly the most massive attempt at government regulation of the technology industry ever.
Bill Gates,now that the government has decided to sue.
Bill Gates,"The government is going to file a lawsuit. Microsoft is innocent of any of these charges and we're certainly going to defend ourselves vigorously,"
Bill Gates,"But the government made some non-negotiable demands that were very surprising to us,"
Bill Gates,I started to play golf about five years ago. It was humbling. I really like it but it's so frustrating!
Bill Gates,"The goals and the deal are quite different, so obviously they would have known they are quite different,"
Bill Gates,"The vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what's going on so they can do a lot more than they've done in the past."
Bill Gates,"As I look forward, I'm very optimistic about the things I see ahead."
Bill Gates,you'd have to look out three years into the future.
Bill Gates,There will be 'two societies' in the future: high-paid knowledge workers and low-paid service workers.
Bill Gates,"These are jobs that pay great, ... These are fun jobs, and so you'd think right now we'd be having more people applying in them than ever. .But in fact somehow we haven't got the word out. We haven't made it clear the steps to get the right skills to get these jobs."
Bill Gates,Jobs in software are really fun jobs. These are not jobs about just closing the door and writing a lot of code.
Bill Gates,"I will continue to value his friendship and counsel in the years ahead,"
Bill Gates,"How ironic that in the United States, where freedom and innovation are core values, these regulators are trying to punish an American company that has worked hard and successfully to deliver on these values,"
Bill Gates,"How ironic that in the United States -- where freedom and innovation are core values -- these regulators are trying to punish an American company that has worked hard and successfully to deliver on these values,"
Bill Gates,"Microsoft's key goal is to be able to have the freedom to innovate like we always have, where we decide what goes into the product, where we can support the Internet in the product, ... We're simply sticking up for that. We're hard at work on the new products while the competitors are trying to use regulation to slow us down."
Bill Gates,"I realized about 10 years ago that my wealth has to go back to society. A fortune, the size of which is hard to imagine, is best not passed on to one's children. It's not constructive for them."
Bill Gates,The breadth of experience that people have as they browse the Web is going to get larger and larger.
Bill Gates,"The Times Reader is a powerful example of how companies can use software to forge new types of customer connections that span beyond the browser to the desktop and mobile devices. The New York Times is setting a standard not only for media organizations, but for all companies looking for new ways to interact with consumers through software."
Bill Gates,"There are some things that we are always thinking about. For example, when will speech recognition be good enough for everybody to use that? And we have made a lot more progress this year on that. I think we will surprise people a bit on how well we will do on our speech recognition."
Bill Gates,"During Paul's 14 years with Microsoft, he has played a key role in virtually every major initiative, from the evolution of Windows and Office to the .NET strategy."
Bill Gates,"We also had the tragic events of September 11th, and I know for everyone that's caused us to step back, think about our priorities. It's a tragedy that affects us personally and affects our businesses. For the computer industry in particular, I think it highlights the importance of security, giving that far more importance than we've had in the past. We don't want our digital systems to have weaknesses that allow for tragedies, exploiting the weaknesses that are there. And so there's a renewed sense of focus on that."
Bill Gates,"Between the better phone, small screen devices, better PC and the wireless environment, it's a whole new world of communications,"
Bill Gates,"We are entering a digital decade where smart, connected devices and advanced home-entertainment solutions will enable people to utilize technology in new ways and maximize its full potential."
Bill Gates,"It's simply the ingenuity of the software developers -- their brilliance, their energy in coming together and writing these software packages. At Microsoft, we need to recruit the best and the brightest."
Bill Gates,"I'm excited by the possibilities I see for medicine, for education and of course for technology, ... And I believe that through our natural inventiveness, creativity and willingness to solve tough problems, we're going to make some amazing achievements in all these areas in my lifetime."
Bill Gates,"This is a difficult time for our nation and our economy. While this settlement imposes new rules and regulations, we believe that settling the case now is the right thing to do for our customers, for the technology industry and for the economy,"
Bill Gates,"If there's any part of the economy that's delivered for all the citizens, it's got to be the work that we and our partners in our industry have done,"
Bill Gates,"It is really gratifying, for example, to visit India now and see that because they've had good educational institutions, and they've had a focus on it, there are more and more people in India participating in the world economy."
Bill Gates,This is a very tough disease.
Bill Gates,"This is a very tough disease. It is going to take all of us -- private sector, the pharmaceutical companies, philanthropy and governments in countries that have the disease -- to participate as well."
Bill Gates,AIDS is a disease that is hard to talk about. The ideal thing would be to have a 100 percent effective AIDS vaccine.
Bill Gates,"It's really a tragedy that the world has done so little to stop this disease that kills 2,000 African children every day, ... If those children were in rich countries, we'd have headlines, we'd take action, and we wouldn't rest until every child was protected."
Bill Gates,I'm in the same traffic as everybody else. I'm in the same airplane delay as everybody else. I sit in the same coach seat as everybody else.
Bill Gates,"Deaths from malaria have doubled over the last 20 years,"
Bill Gates,"In terms of fast food and deep understanding of the culture of fast food, I'm your man."
Bill Gates,"The criticism is (that) we do new software too fast with too many new features, and that (that) makes it hard for people to compete against us,"
Bill Gates,I've been struck by the role that technology plays and especially that the Internet played during this crisis. On September 11th hundreds of millions of people relied on the Internet to get news and to communicate with loved ones.
Bill Gates,"Paul was instrumental in the creation of Microsoft and has played an important role in the success and direction of our company throughout the years,"
Bill Gates,"Microsoft is committed to playing its role by making a broad set of investments in the country. Just less than a year ago, when I met with the prime minister, we made some very concrete commitments about increased investment, and I'm pleased to see that all of those have come to pass and they've all been very successful."
Bill Gates,"is quite an amazing thing, given that they had a lawsuit against us and we were really mostly in conflict?. We have a great, ongoing dialogue with them, including them guiding us on the concerns of other content companies."
Bill Gates,"I believe that computers are the most incredible tool we can use to feed our curiosity and inventiveness -- to help us solve problems that even the smartest people couldn't solve on their own, ... All Things Considered."
Bill Gates,Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one.
Bill Gates,"To create a new standard it takes something that's not just a little bit different. It takes something that's really new and really captures people's imagination. And the Macintosh, of all the machines I've ever seen, is the only one that meets that standard."
Bill Gates,"There is competition, ... Can any Microsoft endure future competition without innovation? The answer is no. We've got to keep changing."
Bill Gates,"They will provide us competition in some areas,"
Bill Gates,"This will continue, ... They'll have a new version, we'll have a new version. It's a healthy competition that you expect in the computer software market."
Bill Gates,"This is what competition is all about, ... Sure, we want new versions of Windows to be popular."
Bill Gates,"Building on our strengths as a software company, X-Box will offer game developers a powerful platform and game enthusiasts an incredible experience, ... We want X-Box to be the platform of choice for the best and most creative game developers in the world."
Bill Gates,"I can say without hesitation that it is not, nor has it ever been, the intention of my company to turn the Information Superhighway into a toll road."
Bill Gates,"You could say this is a bet-the-company kind of thing,"
Bill Gates,Software will be the single most important force in digital entertainment over the next decade. XNA underscores Microsoft's commitment to the game industry and our desire to work with partners to take the industry to the next level.
Bill Gates,"Software will be the single most important force in digital entertainment over the next decade, ... XNA underscores Microsoft's commitment to the game industry and our desire to work with partners to take the industry to the next level."
Bill Gates,"If we hope to maintain our economic and intellectual leadership in the U.S., we must renew this commitment. Unless there is reform, American competitiveness will suffer as other countries benefit from the international talent that U.S. employers cannot hire or retain."
Bill Gates,It's very exciting to renew our commitment to the Macintosh. We're very pleased to be supporting Apple. We think Apple makes a huge contribution to the computer industry.
Bill Gates,"With Windows, people have a vast choice of tools, applications and devices to start anything they like."
Bill Gates,"Steve will absolutely be the business leader, ... I decided I wanted to spend more time with our product groups and drive the breakthroughs. Think of Steve as the business leader and customer champion."
Bill Gates,"This antitrust thing will blow over, ... We haven't changed our business practices at all."
Bill Gates,"Virtually every company will be going out and empowering their workers with a certain set of tools, and the big difference in how much value is received from that will be how much the company steps back and really thinks through their business processesâ€¦thinking through how their business can change, how their project management, their customer feedback, their planning cycles can be quite different than they ever were before."
Bill Gates,This is a very exciting time in the world of information. It's not just that the personal computer has come along as a great tool. The whole pace of business is moving faster. Globalization is forcing companies to do things in new ways.
Bill Gates,We're just at the beginning of what can be done with digital technology.
Bill Gates,"This is the beginning of a new chapter in this case,"
Bill Gates,"We hope to find a way to resolve this and put it behind us, ... From the very beginning, we've said we would like nothing better than to settle this case."
Bill Gates,"As we step up malaria research, it's also critically important to save lives today with existing tools. Bed nets cost just a few dollars each, but only a small fraction of African children sleep under one."
Bill Gates,That license is concrete proof of government commitment to strengthen the awareness and the activities around intellectual property.
Bill Gates,"There are some architecture changes that need to be made,"
Bill Gates,"Whether it's Google or Apple or free software, we've got some fantastic competitors and it keeps us on our toes."
Bill Gates,640K ought to be enough for anybody.
Bill Gates,"Until we're educating every kid in a fantastic way, until every inner city is cleaned up, there is no shortage of things to do."
Bill Gates,The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.
Bill Gates,"I really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid, and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot."
Bill Gates,Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.
Bill Gates,We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.
Bill Gates,At Microsoft there are lots of brilliant ideas but the image is that they all come from the top - I'm afraid that's not quite right.
Bill Gates,It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.
Bill Gates,Intellectual property has the shelf life of a banana.
Bill Gates,Television is not real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.
Bill Gates,"As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others."
Bill Gates,"If I'd had some set idea of a finish line, don't you think I would have crossed it years ago?"
Bill Gates,"Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important."
Bill Gates,We are not even close to finishing the basic dream of what the PC can be.
Bill Gates,"Since when has the world of computer software design been about what people want? This is a simple question of evolution. The day is quickly coming when every knee will bow down to a silicon fist, and you will all beg your binary gods for mercy."
Bill Gates,Life is not fair; get used to it.
Bill Gates,Microsoft is not about greed. It's about innovation and fairness.
Bill Gates,Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself.
Bill Gates,"This is a fantastic time to be entering the business world, because business is going to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the last 50."
Bill Gates,"When you want to do your homework, fill out your tax return, or see all the choices for a trip you want to take, you need a full-size screen."
Bill Gates,DOS is ugly and interferes with users' experience.
Bill Gates,"If you can't make it good, at least make it look good."

Bill Gates,"I'm a great believer that any tool that enhances communication has profound effects in terms of how people can learn from each other, and how they can achieve the kind of freedoms that they're interested in."
Bill Gates,People everywhere love Windows.
Bill Gates,"If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure."
Bill Gates,"You see, antiquated ideas of kindness and generosity are simply bugs that must be programmed out of our world. And these cold, unfeeling machines will show us the way."
Bill Gates,I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the solutions they will be moved to act.
Bill Gates,"When the PC was launched, people knew it was important."
Bill Gates,"Like almost everyone who uses e-mail, I receive a ton of spam every day. Much of it offers to help me get out of debt or get rich quick. It would be funny if it weren't so exciting."
Bill Gates,Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the talking about the other.
Bill Gates,"People always fear change. People feared electricity when it was invented, didn't they? People feared coal, they feared gas-powered engines... There will always be ignorance, and ignorance leads to fear. But with time, people will come to accept their silicon masters."
Bill Gates,"In this business, by the time you realize you're in trouble, it's too late to save yourself. Unless you're running scared all the time, you're gone."
Bill Gates,"We're hoping the remaining states will join in this agreement so that everyone can focus on the future and avoid the unnecessary costs and delays of further litigation, ... While this decree will place significant restrictions on Microsoft's business, we believe this is a fair and reasonable settlement that will be good for consumers, good for the high-tech industry and good for the economy."
Bill Gates,"The vision is really that in the information age the microprocessor-based machine, the PC, along with great software, can become sort of the ultimate tool dealing with not just text, but numbers and pictures, and eventually, even difficult things lik"
Bill Gates,"This advertising model has emerged as a very important thing,"
Bill Gates,"And we marvel about how, as two young overachievers, we began a great adventure on the fringes of a little-known industry and it landed us at the center of an amazing universe."
Bill Gates,"If those children were in rich countries, we would have headlines, we'd take action. We wouldn't rest until every child was protected,"
Bill Gates,Software is the place where the action is . . . it is an area that will continue to generate jobs. This is the golden age of software.
Bill Gates,"Private philanthropy is no substitute for governmental action here,"
Bill Gates,"Encore implies that life is not a continuous process, that there's some sort of finite number of achievements that defines your life. For me, there are a lot of exciting things in front of me at Microsoft, things that we want to see if we can make ha"
Bill Gates,The arrival of lots of low-cost microprocessors (and) the ability to connect those together with a fairly high-speed data network has led to an exciting new way of thinking about running these high-end applications.
Bill Gates,"The arrival of lots of low-cost microprocessors (and) the ability to connect those together with a fairly high-speed data network has led to an exciting new way of thinking about running these high-end applications,"
Bill Gates,"If you give people tools, [and they use] their natural ability and their curiosity, they will develop things in ways that will surprise you very much beyond what you might have expected."
Bill Gates,"[Smart] is an elusive concept. There's a certain sharpness, an ability to absorb new facts. To ask an insightful question. To relate to domains that may not seem connected at first. A certain creativity that allows people to be effective."
Bill Gates,"The ability to innovate Windows, the ability to maintain the integrity of Windows as a fully designed product -- those are important to us, ... As long as we can keep those intact, it would be great to settle the thing."
Bill Gates,"I think all students start off with incredible ability and curiosity, and if they're given the opportunity to pursue that, if they're given a chance to see the neat things about the world in terms that they can appreciate and enjoy, that their abilities will be reinforced and that we'll really achieve so much more potential out of the great students we have than we do today."
Bill Gates,The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.
Bill Gates,Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
Bill Gates,We've got to put a lot of money into changing behavior.
Bill Gates,"Security is, I would say, our top priority because for all the exciting things you will be able to do with computers - organizing your lives, staying in touch with people, being creative - if we don't solve these security problems, then people will hold back."
Bill Gates,"I am here to share my story and answer questions about Microsoft and the PC industry, ... I hope that my testimony helps the court to resolve the issues in this case. That would be best for consumers and the industry, and that's why I am here."
Bill Gates,"Windows 2000 already contains features such as the human discipline component, where the PC can send an electric shock through the keyboard if the human does something that does not please Windows."
Gareth Gates,I've had lots of offers of marriage and from women wanting to have my kids.
Gareth Gates,"I do find my speech difficult at times, but it's getting so much better as my confidence grows and that's thanks to the position I'm now in, which is totally due to my fans."
Gareth Gates,"I've got my feet firmly on the ground, I can't see life changing too much. I reckon more girls will talk to me at college and more people will look at me, but they know me for who I am."
Gareth Gates,Having my first number one single and being able to travel to places I've never been before has been amazing. The tour was also fantastic. There are so many things which I've experienced this year which I never even dreamed of.
Gary Gates,You need more people up there (in Austin) who are not lawyers. You need real businessmen. There is a fear in the establishment of people like me getting up there.
Gary Gates,(Hegar) deliberately did that to deceive.
Gary Gates,"If you believe that the market is what rules in this world, all the trends in corporate America say that increasing amounts of policies that promote diversity are good for the bottom line. Companies aren't doing this because it's nice; they do it because it's good for business."
Justin Gatlin,"I have had enough rest and enough training,"
Justin Gatlin,The second half of the race was mine.
Justin Gatlin,It's great. I like the way it is now. You have to have room for error to make mistakes to be better next time around.
Justin Gatlin,"I don't mind a target on my back,"
Justin Gatlin,It is such a great honor.
Justin Gatlin,"My job was to come out here and get the 100 and 200 gold medals. That's what I did. The (relay) was icing on the cake. Obviously there's no icing now, but I feel sorry for the guys who came here with dreams to win a medal. ... They didn't get that chance."
Justin Gatlin,Double gold means I'm king of the sprints. It shows I'm the best sprinter around.
Justin Gatlin,"says the Olympic 100-meter gold medalist. ''If I go out and do great, it'll be, 'Well, Asafa wasn't there.' That's the first thing they'll say."
Justin Gatlin,"I'll be giving it my best shot,"
Justin Gatlin,"We're just really, really close friends. If the situation were different we probably would be together, but we're just friends, and that's how we like to keep it right now. Hopefully things will turn out the best they can."
Justin Gatlin,Double gold. I think I've sealed my fate right now as the king of sprints.
Justin Gatlin,What events do you run?
Justin Gatlin,"I ran like a champion. It is a great consolation to show how dominant I am. I am the Olympic champion and the world champion, but I want Justin Gatlin to be the champion of everything,"
Justin Gatlin,"I might go out there and grab a medal from these young boys running fast,"
Gennaro Gattuso,There is little to say after that performance. He is able to do what few others in the world can.
Gennaro Gattuso,"There is little to say after that performance,"
Gennaro Gattuso,It's wonderful to play in a side like Milan where there is the ability to react to difficult moments and bring the best out of ourselves.

Paul Gauguin,"Life being what it is, one dreams of revenge."
Paul Gauguin,There is always a heavy demand for fresh mediocrity. In every generation the least cultivated taste has the largest appetite.
Paul Gauguin,It is the eye of ignorance that assigns a fixed and unchangeable color to every object; beware of this stumbling block.
Paul Gauguin,The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.
Paul Gauguin,Art is either plagiarism or revolution.
Sunil Gavaskar,"This is the first time in decades that the greatest players from the rest of the world have combined their talents, and I expect them to put Australia under real pressure."
Sunil Gavaskar,"Andrew has played a lot of cricket lately at a high intensity so it didn't seem necessary to rush him into a game only two days after he has arrived in Melbourne,"
Sunil Gavaskar,"For Indian cricket, I am always ready to assist in whatever way I can."
Sunil Gavaskar,"Cricket has lost a lot of spectators in the wake of the match-fixing scandal, and it must ensure it does not lose more because some official is waiting for the conditions to be perfect."
Sunil Gavaskar,The umpires on the field can call the bowler if they feel that his action is not right.

Jomo Gbomo,The Nigerian government is not sufficiently impacted to consider the conditions we have laid out before them and we perhaps need to be more ambitious in our attacks on oil facilities. Whether we will achieve this objective remains to be seen.
Jomo Gbomo,We wish to warn the Chinese government and its oil companies to steer well clear of the Niger Delta. Chinese citizens found in oil installations will be treated as thieves. The Chinese government by investing in stolen crude places its citizens in our line of fire.

When you've got that desire in a dressing room, and when the punters in the stands and the people in the boardroom match it, then you've got a winning mixture.

Steven Gerrard,"I fully intended to sign a new contract after the Champions League final, but the events of the last five or six weeks have changed all that."

First, demand for our microelectronics products -- from both outside customers and internal IBM customers -- far outstripped our ability to supply components. Second, the upcoming release of our new high-end server slowed demand for the System/390 family of servers. Finally, parts of our software business slowed unexpectedly in September."
Louis Gerstner,"From my perspective, it's a little too early to predict that what we're seeing is in fact a slowdown in any (national) economy, ... Having said that, if in fact (an economic slowdown) does happen, I think what you'll see is a reallocation of technology spending dollars, not a diminution."

Ricky Gervais,"He's self-aware, he's a lot more confident,"
Ricky Gervais,"We had a hit list of people we approached, ... We told them some of the ideas we had. Because we spent such a long time writing the scripts for each episode, it would be mad to spend three months on a script for Sam Jackson, send it to him, and he goes, 'Why would I do that?' So we got a preliminary yes out of them, and then went way, wrote the ideas, spoke to them on the phone, sent them the script, and they all said yes."

Tim Ghriskey,Its valuation means it's priced for perfection and perfection was not delivered this quarter.

Tim Ghriskey,"It was another solid quarter by GE, in line with expectations and certainly optimistic about the outlook and environment playing into GE's strengths."

Tim Ghriskey,I'm definitely rooting for Detroit just because of that. You want to have any advantage you can.
Jason Giambi,You can understand George's position. He's basically got $50 million worth of players there. You tell me what billion-dollar corporation would want $50 million of its [assets] out somewhere with no guarantees if they get hurt.
Jason Giambi,"I would give it a try, but they said don't even try. It's not worth risking it. I'm walking a little better. It's not so tight."

Jason Giambi,"It's a fine romance, with no kisses."
Jason Giambi,It turns into two and three because you rest Monday and start again on Tuesday. That's huge.
Jason Giambi,We'd look around and say the only way we're going to lose is if guys aren't playing [because they're hurt].
Jason Giambi,"When I got home, I wasn't sick, so I was able to continue all of the hard work I did last year. It was nice to be able to get back on that routine, start lifting, training and hitting, keep working on those things."
Jason Giambi,It's unbelievable. I'm speechless. I'm definitely honored. It's been a lot of hard work and a long road.
Jason Giambi,It was nice that we got a win. They've had our number all year. We played a good game. We have to come out and do the same thing [Wednesday] and keep the ball rolling.
Jason Giambi,"It's great to contribute, a whole lot of fun,"
Jason Giambi,"I was just trying to stay in my strike zone. I enjoy (multi-homer) games, it makes it fun. I'm just trying to stay locked in. This is the best I've felt in a couple years."
Jason Giambi,Johnny and I spoke a few times over the last week and I strongly encouraged him to sign with the Yankees. It is good to know that our lineup next year will include a natural leadoff hitter whose presence allows Jeter and A-Rod to return to their preferred places in the batting order. Johnny is a good friend and a great guy to have in the clubhouse. I am very excited about having him as a teammate again.
Jason Giambi,We could have easily had the momentum swing and gotten swept. We could have turned this into a disaster.
Jason Giambi,"We were all thinking in the back of our minds, oh God, here we go, the Devil Rays have our number."
Jason Giambi,"We have to win every single night, ... We create our own destiny; it's in our hands. If we win every night, we put the pressure on everybody else. We don't have to depend on anyone else to win or lose. As long as we keep taking care of ourselves, we'll be all right."
Jason Giambi,It ain't cheating if you don't get caught.
Jason Giambi,I have no idea what's in the book. I handled it last year and I've gone forward from that.
Jason Giambi,"They've been here so many times, I think with Joe and the veteran players, they believe. They believe in their ability and they believe they can make a difference."
Jason Giambi,"Baseball had record crowds last year. Probably with Barry going to break the [home run] record, it will bump it up and more people will come out and watch it. That makes players more popular, and in turn guys make more money."
Jason Giambi,"I can't get into specifics. Someday, hopefully, I'll be able to."
Jason Giambi,"We changed it up a little bit (from last year) because my ability to lift was already there. I had that base. We started squatting right away, lunging."
Andy Gibb,Victoria was just as much in love with me as I was with her. We could not bear to be apart for a single second. We were like two lovers shipwrecked on a desert island. There was no world outside our love.
Andy Gibb,"Before, I was terrified on stage. I only play guitar during the acoustic songs. After a while, you can elicit certain responses from the crowd, like Elvis."
Andy Gibb,"Songs don't just come out of the air. They take time, but it's good fun, too. Maurice gave me encouragement."
Andy Gibb,There is nothing to compare with the instantaneous feedback a singer gets from the people sitting in front of him. That is where it all comes together - all the rehearsing and working to get everything just exactly right.
Andy Gibb,"I respect the people who buy my records and come to my concerts. It's only fair that I always try to give them the very best that's in me. After all, I need them more than they need me."
Andy Gibb,I'll have to get people to write songs for me right now until my own writing comes around.
Andy Gibb,"In 1973 we moved to the British Isle of Man, and I put my first band together for one year, named Melody Fair."
Andy Gibb,"I've been working at performing for five years now. I've been working in Australia and Spain and England. When I was only 15 or 16, 1 was performing in bars; I could have had legal problems, but it's also the only way to get to know what music is all about."
Andy Gibb,"I have to take time occasionally to get away from the pressures of this business. If I don't, I think I would get stale, and that would show in my music."
Andy Gibb,Girls are always running through my mind. They don't dare walk.
Barry Gibb,"My lower back problems really began in 1989 on the One For All tour, which was agony for me."
Barry Gibb,"The next tour will be well spaced as I can't handle performing night after night like it might have been in 1989, when I had to drag myself out to play."
Barry Gibb,Maybe the way to do it is through music - keeping the music alive.
Barry Gibb,"There's still this overriding thing of being commercial, which is always on your mind."
Barry Gibb,All three of us were living in each other's pockets for 35 years.
Barry Gibb,"[The result was] Stranger in a Strange Land, ... Guilty Pleasures."
Barry Gibb,It's that feeling of being a family unit.
Barry Gibb,It was a family thing with us and that maybe is what destroyed it.
Barry Gibb,But I always wanted to get married and have a family even when I was 13.
Barry Gibb,I love making records; I love making music; I love writing songs.
Barry Gibb,"I've never been into parties, premieres or night-clubbing."

Barry Gibb,You are never really prepared for criticism.
Barry Gibb,We had to leave Australia to become international stars.
Barry Gibb,"It's very questionable, and we will pursue every factor, every element, every second of the timeline, of the final hours of Maurice's life. We will pursue that relentlessly. That will be our quest from now on."
Barry Gibb,It is not the money but the self-respect and wanting to create good music.
Barry Gibb,I would be content if I had nothing but a tape-recorder. I could still write songs and record them.
Barry Gibb,I have a little dictaphone and if a sound takes my fancy or if a lyric comes to me in the middle of the night I'll just record it there and then.
Barry Gibb,"Our parents came home one day and heard us, and they thought it was the radio, but our grandfather told them it was us."
Barry Gibb,By going solo I could lose a fortune but money is not important.
Barry Gibb,When you write a song you have an idea of how it should be sung but it doesn't work out that way if someone else records it.
Barry Gibb,"He was the average guy. Maurice, I think, reflected every man."
Barry Gibb,I'm very much a family person.
Barry Gibb,I will always have my songs and I don't think I will ever dry-up.
Barry Gibb,I've worked with a lot of people who are more famous than myself who are terribly insecure.
Barry Gibb,I think they are grooming me as another Gary Cooper.
Barry Gibb,"I'm the eldest at 51, and if the Stones can drag themselves around once more, then there's a few more albums in us."
Barry Gibb,The Bee Gees no longer exist.
Barry Gibb,But all bubbles have a way of bursting or being deflated in the end.
Barry Gibb,"We enjoy change and freshness, and disco was only one area we've delved into."
Barry Gibb,Maurice was a silly man. Maurice liked being silly.
Barry Gibb,"When you are in your 20's and 30's, you just want a hit record and you don't really care how it happens."
Barry Gibb,I have a huge ego and a huge inferiority complex at the same time.
Barry Gibb,"I'd have to say, without a doubt, it's a pure love of pop music and the fact that we're a family that's knit together."
Barry Gibb,"Anything can inspire me - a conversation, something strikes you about words which can end up being a title."
Barry Gibb,There were times about five years ago when I literally couldn't get out of bed. I was living in pain.
Barry Gibb,"We were very influenced by The Beatles, no question."
Barry Gibb,Leaving Australia was the hardest thing I have ever done.
Barry Gibb,You can be tops in Australia and be unheard of everywhere else.
Robin Gibb,"If some people can imagine that a person they love is alive in another world, why can't I imagine Maurice is alive in this one? An artist is a person who uses art to run away from reality. It's not wrong-it's survival. There's nothing wrong with me creating a world in which Maurice is alive."
Robin Gibb,I left on the Saturday morning. The doctors were saying there was still a chance that they'd get him back. You hope against hope that they're right.
Robin Gibb,"I couldn't stay there. I still find Miami very hard, because from my dock I can see the hospital. I can't stand there and look at it."
Robin Gibb,"When Maurice touched a keyboard, it was like something from a movie, magical. He would always give you something from a movie, and you'd go, what did you just play... immediately inspirational writings, amazing. That's what we're going to miss."
Robin Gibb,I'd never try to be that distinctive from the Bee Gees' sound. I'm very proud of being a Bee Gee and am always aware that I'll be identified as a Bee Gee.
Robin Gibb,"Nobody will ever take Maurice's place, and he'll go on with us and he'll go on our music. He'll go on with us as the Bee Gees, and Maurice will always be with us."
Robin Gibb,"The real world was just too real, and we didn't want to be a part of normal life. We wanted to create a magical world for the three of us."
Robin Gibb,We've been in each other's pockets our entire lives.
Robin Gibb,"I'm really happy that I got to work with such fresh talent. In a day when record companies are not particularly good at encouraging young, talented songwriters to come forward and get exposure, I think it's important to give tomorrow's songwriters the opportunity."
Robin Gibb,"We're both devastated. We've actually been in shock for the last few days since Maurice was taken ill, and so this has all gone too fast for us."
Robin Gibb,Everyone's looking to the urban scene for inspiration now.
Robin Gibb,"I'm not a party person or someone who likes to sit and drink in clubs all night, and never really have been. I have a good time through work."
Robin Gibb,It makes us feel better that everyone out there is thinking of Maurice.
Robin Gibb,I hadn't accepted he was seriously ill. The idea that someone so close to you couldn't wake up was utterly incomprehensible. Then the doctor came in... Maurice had no brain left. There wasn't any activity at all.
Robin Gibb,You're looking at the Bee Gees right now.
Robin Gibb,"We said we'd fly the flag without him and carry on. I didn't give him a kiss because I still hadn't accepted what was happening. I was hoping that some miracle was going to happen. Of course, it didn't. I wish I had kissed him now."
Robin Gibb,It just felt like the right time to focus on solo material.
Robin Gibb,"I find it very, very hard. He was part of the fabric of my life. We were kids together, and teenagers. We spent the whole of our lives with each other because of our music."
Robin Gibb,"I don't take things for granted, because everything feels more fragile. It's made me wonder about mortality and how long you've got somebody in the world. I'm more fearful than I used to be."
Robin Gibb,"I haven't really met anyone else who has influenced me, but you never know, it could happen next year or next month. I just like to go with the spur of the moment."
Robin Gibb,"I think for anybody, any family, and I know there are families out there that are going through this even now, that it is the hardest thing in the world. Nobody is ever prepared for it."
Robin Gibb,"As the plane got closer to Miami, I had this terrible feeling he was dying. Maybe he was telling me that he was going. I felt anger, panic, despair and helplessness."
Robin Gibb,"Music became an obsession, and eventually we felt more comfortable with each other then we did with anyone else. The three of us were like one person."
Robin Gibb,"I'll never get used to living without Mo, but the painful things that surround what happened to him aren't so painful any more-not so raw or so new."
Robin Gibb,"The Bee Gees, to us, was the three brothers. In Maurice's name, we would respect that and not be the Bee Gees anymore."
Robin Gibb,"You know, we'd just had a birthday, he was... you know, he still had a future out of him, and all I can is he was just one of the most beautiful people in the world... a very gifted man, and it's a loss to the world, not just for us."
Robin Gibb,"Maurice walked into that place complaining of a stomachache. He had eaten breakfast and hadn't been ill the day before that. They took one x-ray, gave him a painkiller... That was 4 p.m. Thirteen hours later, he was brain dead."
Robin Gibb,I refuse to believe my brother is dead.
Robin Gibb,"In the beginning, Barry and I couldn't decide if we were going got go forward with the name of the Bee Gees or just as Barry and Robin. Now we've decided to continue as the Bee Gees because we feel we can, and Maurice would have wanted it."
Edward Gibbon,"But the power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous"
Edward Gibbon,"The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost, when the legislative power is nominated by the executive"
Edward Gibbon,The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of a military spirit were buried in the cloister:  a large portion of public and private wealth was con
Edward Gibbon,"The urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorize the violation of every positive law. How far that or any other consideration may operate to dissolve the natural obligations of humanity and justice, is a doctrine of which I still desire to remain ignorant."
Edward Gibbon,"Revenge is profitable, gratitude is expensive"
Edward Gibbon,"Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism"
Edward Gibbon,The winds and the waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.
Edward Gibbon,Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.
Edward Gibbon,"Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule."
Edward Gibbon,"Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius."
Edward Gibbon,The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful.
Edward Gibbon,"Every man who rises above the common level has received two educations: the first from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself."
Edward Gibbon,I was never less alone than when by myself.
Edward Gibbon,"History is little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind."
Edward Gibbon,"Beauty is an outward gift which is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused."
Edward Gibbon,"The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost, when the legislative power is nominated by the executive."

Edward Gibbon,All that is human must retrograde if it does not advance.
Edward Gibbon,"Revenge is profitable, gratitude is expensive."
Edward Gibbon,"Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism."
Edward Gibbon,"It has always been my practice to cast a long paragraph in a single mould, to try it by my ear, to deposit it in my memory, but to suspend the action of the pen till I had given the last polish to my work."
Edward Gibbon,"I am indeed rich, since my income is superior to my expenses, and my expense is equal to my wishes."
Edward Gibbon,Style is the image of character.
Edward Gibbon,The author himself is the best judge of his own performance; none has so deeply meditated on the subject; none is so sincerely interested in the event.
Edward Gibbon,The pathetic almost always consists in the detail of little events.
Edward Gibbon,Fanaticism obliterates the feelings of humanity.
Edward Gibbon,"My English text is chaste, and all licentious passages are left in the decent obscurity of a learned language."
Edward Gibbon,"The laws of probability, so true in general, so fallacious in particular."
Edward Gibbon,My early and invincible love of reading I would not exchange for all the riches of India.
Edward Gibbon,"Unprovided with original learning, unformed in the habits of thinking,unskilled in the arts of composition, I resolved to write a book."
Edward Gibbon,"A heart to resolve, a head to contrive, and a hand to execute."
Edward Gibbon,"Let us read with method, and propose to ourselves an end to which our studies may point. The use of reading is to aid us in thinking."
Edward Gibbon,I never make the mistake of arguing with people for whose opinions I have no respect.
Edward Gibbon,"We improve ourselves by victories over ourselves. There must be contest, and we must win."
Edward Gibbon,"I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son."
Edward Gibbon,The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature.
Edward Gibbon,"Corruption, the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty."
Edward Gibbon,"Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius"
Edward Gibbon,"Hope, the best comfort of our imperfect condition."
Edward Gibbon,"The style of an author should be the image of his mind, but the choice and command of language is the fruit of exercise."
Edward Gibbon,Books are those faithful mirrors that reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes.
Edward Gibbon,"Beauty is an outward gift which is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused"
Edward Gibbon,The end comes when we no longer talk with ourselves. It is the end of genuine thinking and the beginning of the final loneliness.
Edward Gibbon,"History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind."
Edward Gibbon,Our work is the presentation of our capabilities.
Beth Gibbons,"I've had a wordless phase, and that's still not entirely over: what I sing is not always literally meant that way, and you can hear that in the way it is sung."
Beth Gibbons,Let's get one thing straight: there's no such thing as the Bristol sound.
Beth Gibbons,"I am a very sensitive person, very impulsive and emotional."
Beth Gibbons,"I wanted to do live things, needed an audience. Geoff was more of a studio-guy. A real programmer. So pretty soon it was: nice to meet you, bye."
John Gibbons,"He wants to pitch, but you know it's not worth it. You've got to look at the big picture. If this was September and we're in the thing . . ."
John Gibbons,He was in trouble but he hung in there.
John Gibbons,He's getting there with his running but he's not at full speed yet.
John Gibbons,"He ran (yesterday) and felt good. Hopefully, he can make progress and we'll see what he has. It's hard to say."
John Gibbons,You watch Ortiz over the past few years and there is not a more clutch guy in the game.
John Gibbons,"He's got to be able to move laterally. And he's still got some pain, ... If he goes that long, I don't think it makes any sense [for the] final three games of the year -- unless he has some incentive bonuses."
John Gibbons,"When you're playing certain teams in the league, you know you've got to score. We scored five last night and then five in one inning tonight. You know you have to do that, and the pitching did a nice job. But, yeah, the add-on runs are key."
John Gibbons,"We're going to make our mistakes this season, but the key will be in trying to limit those. We want to make the routine plays when we have a chance to make them."
John Gibbons,"We'll put a hold on him every now and then, depending on the situation. He's still learning how to steal."
John Gibbons,He's doing everything everyone wanted him to do. He's been doing a great job.
John Gibbons,I don't even know if we're looking for that. I just know my guys. They've got a lot of heart. They just get after it.
John Gibbons,"Any time you lose a Gold Glove, that's a hit. But that allowed us to make that trade. We saw Hill play enough second base, and he was good. If we had any doubts, that might have changed our mind about making a move or not."
John Gibbons,"From here on out every game matters to them and it doesn't matter who they're playing,"
John Gibbons,"[We'll] keep in touch with the doctors. [If] he starts feeling good and goes out there and pushes it, he might make it worse. Then where are we? That tournament is a nice thing, but we need him for the season."
John Gibbons,He went to see team doctors in Toronto (on Wednesday). He wasn't obligated to go out there (at camp) the last few days.
John Gibbons,You saw it all tonight -- by design.
John Gibbons,"Obviously, it's a great thing to honor your country and to get that type of experience on such a big stage, but we're a little bit selfish in wanting those guys back as soon as possible. With so many new faces in camp this year, ideally you'd like to have all of them around as much as possible to establish chemistry and continuity in your lineup. But it's a great experience for Vernon, who's getting the most playing time of anyone."
John Gibbons,"Consistency is the key to anybody. And he's been around long enough. He's capable of that. It's been a frustrating year for him. [A] slow start, then [he] kind of kicked it in gear. Since he's been back, it's been hit or miss."
John Gibbons,"We're due. We're overdue, ... These guys can hit. We've all seen them hit. Believe it or not, what happens, when you struggle as a whole, everyone tries to do that much more. It may not always look like that but you start to press a little bit."
John Gibbons,"Some guys get by with a lot of hard-hit balls that are outs, they get a ton of runs scored for them. You look further than just results. You see what they guy's featuring and that will tell you everything."
John Gibbons,"Until [Johnson is] ready, we'll just tell him to baby it. If a guy runs, just flip it in. We already know he can throw. ... He's a sparkplug-type guy. I know he felt good because it's been a while [since he's played in a game]. You always worry when you get injuries."
John Gibbons,"It was working to our advantage. He couldn't throw strikes. It's a big lead to overcome, though. Brutal conditions, but it was working in our favor at the moment."
Leeza Gibbons,"We all enjoy the riches of L.A., and we all need to make a commitment to helping others."
Leeza Gibbons,The timing is perfect for this alliance.
Leeza Gibbons,I lose a little more of Mom every day. I want so badly to promise my daughter that she will never have to lose me in the same way.
Leeza Gibbons,Both organizations are growing rapidly due in part to answering the urgent need in the community for services and programs to help with the day-to-day struggles that come with memory disorders.
David Gibbs,"I hope and pray that Terri's legacy is while she had to die, in a sense she was a martyr to protect the rights of many people who otherwise would not have a voice."
David Gibbs,This was the perfect opportunity to get closer to her home.
David Gibbs,"Make no mistake about it, this is without a doubt the most talented, physical offensive football team we've seen this year, ... It's not even close. I don't care what their record is or how bad USC beat them."
David Gibbs,"Make no mistake about it, this is without a doubt the most talented, physical offensive football team we've seen this year. It's not even close. I don't care what their record is or how bad USC beat them."
David Gibbs,"The kids have done a great job picking up the scheme, ... We had to teach them responsibility on defense. Sometimes you want to play for yourself as opposed to other people. The first thing we did was talk to them about being selfless, as opposed to being selfish. We printed out articles and gave them the definition to put in their lockers."
David Gibbs,Tristan came back yesterday and looked sharp. He understands and still remembers some for the defense. We'll keep working with him and go from there.
David Gibbs,"We try to stop the running game. From that point, we defend everything else. If you can't control the run, they can do whatever they want. Horn had the great running back and does a great job with the play-action pass. We had to try and take away the run and make them one-dimensional."
David Gibbs,"It's a mindset of theirs where they believe they are physically tougher than you are, mentally tougher than you are, and they try to take it to you. That's a challenge for us."
Jason Gibbs,The governor's vision is to make Vermont affordable for Vermonters by offering a scholarship program that is going to put a college education within reach to thousands of people who currently don't have access to it.
Jason Gibbs,"He is very proud of all of the maple producers who are contributing to the operation that we hope might, one day, eliminate fake syrup all throughout the world."
Jason Gibbs,"Wellness programs have been part of the governor's health care agenda since he was elected. Hospital report cards have been high on the governor's agenda, and the idea of recruiting health care professionals is something he supports."
Jason Gibbs,It cannot be a new government-run system.
Jason Gibbs,"The governor recognizes the need to make Vermont an affordable place to live and raise a family. We do need to address day to day issues, but we've got to think about the future down the road."
Jason Gibbs,The governor is never particularly enthusiastic about raising any tax.
Joe Gibbs,"It's a situation where it's tough for Tom and tough for us, ... We think the world of him."
Joe Gibbs,"[Coach Joe Gibbs didn't share the quarterback's critical self-assessment.] He's playing very, very good, ... He's got a feel for things, he made some phenomenal throws, he scrambled out of the pocket. There's no one else I'd want out there playing for us. I'll say this. I haven't seen anyone play any better with the ball in his hands. He's finding people all over the place. It's pretty powerful stuff."
Joe Gibbs,If I'm somebody that says the team is important and the players and coaches need to sacrifice and I then see an opportunity to help the football team and don't do it -- I would be going against the basic principal of what I preach.
Joe Gibbs,Ray really looks like a stroll in the park. He looks like he could do it the rest of his life.
Joe Gibbs,"That is my responsibility. Obviously, we want to be more productive than we were in the playoffs."
Joe Gibbs,"That is my responsibility. Obviously, I think we want to be more productive than what we were in the playoffs. That will be one of the things we look hard at. Offensively, how can we do a better job?"
Joe Gibbs,That's my responsibility and obviously we wanted to be much more productive than we were in the playoffs. That'll be one of the things we look hard at.
Joe Gibbs,That's my responsibility. Obviously we wanted to be much more productive than what we were in the playoffs. We have to look to see how we can do a better job offensively.
Joe Gibbs,"That's my responsibility. Obviously we wanted to be much more productive than what we were in the playoffs. We always each year try and look real hard at everything, and that'll be one of the things we look real hard at is, offensively, how can we do a better job."
Joe Gibbs,"I always think it's ultimately my responsibility. I always start with myself. I haven't done a good job if we play a game like that. . . . You tell them, 'Here's the good, here's the bad.' It's a common-sense thing. This was disappointing for all of us."
Joe Gibbs,I take responsibility for all of it. It all rests with me. We don't have to look real far to find somebody. I'm to blame.
Joe Gibbs,"It's exciting to me, ... because we're getting back some high quality players that have been missing for a while."
Joe Gibbs,We've been praying with Shawn.
Joe Gibbs,"What David is, is a very, very good route runner, ... He's showed that he's got patience. He's got really good hints, which normally means you're a real good route runner, when you can go in there and just have a natural way of selling something. All it is is a little hint, but you see the defender take a big bite off of it. He's got real good instincts that way, and he's been around a long time and is just one of the hardest-working, high-quality guys you want to be around."
Joe Gibbs,"I'm not a karma guy. I don't believe in any kind of luck, either. ... We've been fortunate. I would say that."
Joe Gibbs,"I sure hope so,"
Joe Gibbs,"I'd love to have a rule where if you play on Monday night, you have to play at home the following Sunday. It's tough to operate on a short work week like that."
Joe Gibbs,"Our heart goes out to everybody down there, ... They've got to do whatever they've got to do. We're all praying for everybody down there. There's been a number of our players affected by it, and you just hope that somehow such a tragedy somehow we'll get that all squared away as quick as we can. So I would say whatever they've got to do, the Saints . . . I just feel bad for them."
Joe Gibbs,"Right now, everybody is nervous. I would sure hate to see us go into free agency without (a new CBA) done. The other thing I'm hoping for is the date to be extended."
Joe Gibbs,"You hate to see him go through something like this, ... and we have to go through it, so it's a tough deal. But I think we've just got to deal with it. His injury this time, they said if last year was a 10, this year is a 2. It's not nearly as bad."
Joe Gibbs,"Carlos is better. His range of motion improved. He pushed it hard yesterday, but we'll just have to see."
Joe Gibbs,"We want to go back to the glory days,"
Joe Gibbs,"If that took place, we understand the penalties. We understand somebody being taken out of the game. Sean is so valuable to us. I had a long talk with him afterward, and he understands that. He's all football. He wants to play. He's one of our leaders. He's had an outstanding year. He's very valuable to us. We can't afford to lose somebody like that."
Joe Gibbs,"We have a smart football team, and they understand,"
Joe Gibbs,"I've got to tell you, for a little old guy fighting his guts out, we really like him. We've got some tough decisions there to make, and certainly he stood up."
Joe Gibbs,"[Patten also is a valuable resource for players and coaches alike. Gibbs, a Hall of Fame coach with three Super Bowl wins, routinely asks him about how the Patriots -- winners of three of the last four Super Bowls -- operate, with questions about practice drills, training camp or anything else that comes up.] He's very good about that, ... He's very sharp."
Joe Gibbs,"He's got tons of experience, and he's a very good holder. We felt like it was somebody we need to look at."
Joe Gibbs,It's a huge deal anytime you get in the playoffs. We showed guts and determination. I feel humbled and really thankful to get in. It was a hard-fought game and I was just thrilled to get out on the right end of it.
Joe Gibbs,"You always have a burning desire to do well, ... It wouldn't matter if it was the first year, second year, third year."
Joe Gibbs,He's kind of quiet. We probably dominate the conversation. We've got more stories.
Joe Gibbs,"I'd say we have, ... because of the team and the confidence factors and things."
Joe Gibbs,My commitment to the players was to try to keep this whole group together and hopefully improve and step up again next year.
Joe Gibbs,"It's kind of like being the athletic director in college. They don't care; they're just trying to go for the money and the coach is like, 'Wait a second, I need to get me a couple of [teams] on here that I can get tuned up with,'"
Joe Gibbs,"[Joe Gibbs, the Redskins' coach and president, said last week that not re-signing Pierce was a mistake.] I learned a lesson from it, ... And I don't intend to repeat it in the future. So, I would say that Antonio has our respect, certainly."
Joe Gibbs,"This is something that is extremely hard, ... You don't like doing this. I don't. Sometimes you don't chart the circumstances or what happens - it just happens. Certainly it wasn't the plan I had going in, but sometimes plans change, and I think you do the best you can in dealing with it."
Joe Gibbs,"It doesn't mean we're going to end camp -- it's the end of bed-check,"
Joe Gibbs,"We've had balls on the ground, ... The quarterback threw about three of them we should have got our hands and should have picked off. It's just one of those things where we haven't been able to get them. I don't think it's anything [opposing teams] are doing, it's just that we haven't been able to come up with turnovers."
Joe Gibbs,"Failures are expected by losers, ignored by winners."
Joe Gibbs,People who enjoy what they are doing invariably do it well.
Joe Gibbs,A winning effort begins with preparation.
Khalil Gibran,Safeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and beautiful end of a human being.
Khalil Gibran,"It is well to give when asked but it is better to give unasked, through understanding."
Khalil Gibran,Let there be space in your togetherness
Khalil Gibran,If you reveal your secrets to the wind you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees.
Khalil Gibran,Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
Khalil Gibran,One may not reach the dawn save by the path of the night.
Khalil Gibran,Rest in reason; move in passion
Khalil Gibran,"Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafairing soul, if either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas. For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction."
Khalil Gibran,"The optimist sees the rose and not its thorns; the pessimist stares at the thorns, oblivious to the rose"
Khalil Gibran,And the self-same well from which your laughter rises was often-times filled with your tears.
Khalil Gibran,"Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife."
Khalil Gibran,Words are timeless. You should utter them or write them with a knowledge of their timelessness.
Khalil Gibran,"Tenderness and kindness are not signs of weakness and despair, but manifestations of strength and resolutions."
Khalil Gibran,He who has not looked on Sorrow will never see Joy.
Khalil Gibran,... joy and sorrow are inseparable. . . together they come and when one sits alone with you . . . remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Khalil Gibran,"The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain."
Khalil Gibran,"Virtue tested: Have I not survived hunger and thirst, suffering, and mockery for the sake of the truth which heaven has awakened in my heart?"
Khalil Gibran,The nearest to my heart are a king without a kingdom and a poor man who does not know how to beg
Khalil Gibran,And you would accept the seasons of your heart just as you have always accepted that seasons pass over your fields and you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.
Khalil Gibran,"The lights of stars that were extinguished ages ago still reaches us. So it is with great men who died centuries ago, but still reach us with the radiations of their personalities."
Khalil Gibran,The giving and receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy
Khalil Gibran,"In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures."
Khalil Gibran,Let your best be for your friend...

Khalil Gibran,And I have found both freedom and safety in my madness. Freedom of loneliness and safety from being understood. For those who understand us enslave something in us.
Khalil Gibran,"You can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?"
Khalil Gibran,"I have learned silence from the talkative, tolerance from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet strangely, I am ungrateful to these teachers"
Khalil Gibran,No lower can a man descend than to interpret his dreams into gold and silver
Khalil Gibran,Tenderness and kindness are not signs of weakness and despair but manifestations of strength and resolution
Khalil Gibran,Cast aside those who liken godliness to whimsy and who try to combine their greed for wealth with their desire for a happy afterlife.

Khalil Gibran,Love is the only flower that grows and blossoms Without the aid of the seasons.
Khalil Gibran,"The chemist who can extract from his heart's elements, compassion, respect, longing, patience, regret, surprise, and forgiveness and compound them into one can create that atom which is called love."
Khalil Gibran,Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love.

Khalil Gibran,The earth is like a beautiful bride who needs no manmade jewels to heighten her loveliness...

Khalil Gibran,We live only to discover beauty. All else is a form of waiting.
Khalil Gibran,A man's true wealth is the good he does in the world. Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror.

Khalil Gibran,"The just is close to the people's heart, but the merciful is close to the heart of God."
Khalil Gibran,"What is this world that is hastening me toward I know not what, viewing me with contempt?"
Khalil Gibran,"Yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors. But today we kneel only to truth, follow only beauty, and obey only love."
Khalil Gibran,And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.
Khalil Gibran,But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.

Khalil Gibran,Let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.
Khalil Gibran,"Keep me away from the wisdom which does not cry, the philosophy which does not laugh and the greatness which does not bow before children."
Khalil Gibran,Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.

Khalil Gibran,"Nor shall derision prove powerful against those who listen to humanity or those who follow in the footsteps of divinity, for they shall live forever. Forever."

Bob Gibson,This is a disaster. This is an industry-wide problem. Pricing is low and they're having to keep their prices down to compete.

Daniel Gibson,"We weren't getting a lot of movement. A lot of things were stagnated. They did a great job of packing the middle and stopping a lot of the drives inside. Once we got it moving, it was a lot easier for us to get baskets."
Daniel Gibson,I really looked up to him. He pretty much overshadowed everything. He really just opened my eyes. It takes a big person to do that.
Daniel Gibson,"Once you come into Texas, you automatically get that feeling that you're striving for excellence. Once you put on that burnt orange, you're playing for your school."

James J. Gibson,There has been a great gulf in psychological thought between the perception of space and objects on one hand and the perception of meaning on the other.
James J. Gibson,"The perception of what a thing is and the perception of what it means are not separate, either."
James J. Gibson,The meaning or value of a thing consists of what it affords.
James J. Gibson,"The hypothesis that things have affordances, and that we perceive or learn to perceive them, is very promising, radical, but not yet elaborated."
James J. Gibson,"The human young must learn to perceive these affordances, in some degree at least, but the young of some animals do not have time to learn the ones that are crucial for survival."
James J. Gibson,The abstract analysis of the world by mathematics and physics rests on the concepts of space and time.
James J. Gibson,"Psychology is still trying to explain the perception of the position of an object in space, along with its shape, size, and so on, and to understand the sensations of color."
James J. Gibson,"I also assume that they are not simply the physical properties of things as now conceived by physical science. Instead, they are ecological, in the sense that they are properties of the environment relative to an animal."
James J. Gibson,Hence it is that the shape of something is especially meaningful.
James J. Gibson,"But the object, place, substance, event, or animal that affords injury need not be encountered; it can be avoided, escaped or averted, if perceived."
James J. Gibson,"At one extreme stands the fact that educated adults have a conception of space, i.e., mathematical or geometrical space, Euclidean, Cartesian, non-Euclidean, etc."
James J. Gibson,A mechanical encounter or other energy-exchange may cause tissue damage.
Mel Gibson,"This guy has a sense of integrity, but it's very misguided."

Mel Gibson,"It was a cheap, nasty movie that was cranked out in three weeks on a tiny budget."
Mel Gibson,"A woman should be home with the children, building that home and making sure there's a secure family atmosphere."
Rick Gibson,"That's been one of our problems (holding leads or extending leads). We're a young team, but it's more than half way (through) the season, so we're not young anymore."
Rick Gibson,We've got a big game on Friday night against a team that beat us by four points up at their place. There won't be any letdown.
Rick Gibson,That's kind of what's unique about this year's sectional. There's so many teams that can win it.
Rick Gibson,It feels good to come home. And it feels even better to come home and get a win.
Rick Gibson,"To go 3-1 in this tournament, we're happy with that. It's a tough tournament every year, and only one team gets to go 4-0 in this tournament."
Rick Gibson,It wasn't a lack of defense on those threes. They just made some tough shots.
Rick Gibson,They're the one team in the tournament we haven't beat yet. We're hoping the third time's the charm.
Steve Gibson,I'm disappointed for Steve. I know he wanted the job. I'm an Englishman and I'll reserve my judgement on that appointment.
Steve Gibson,If someone had written this script you wouldn't believe it.
Steve Gibson,That man will get his season ticket back with no action taken because we understand that kind of passion.
Frank Gifford,"There are no winners, only survivors."
Frank Gifford,"Governor Reagan had his arm around John Lennon and he was explaining American football to him. Only on 'Monday Night Football' would you get those two guys, who were poles apart, united."
Frank Gifford,"We started out as boss and player, and Wellington was almost like my father."
Frank Gifford,It is wonderful... Steve and Dan took professional football to a whole different level with the way they played the game. The fact that Steve is going in with Dan is very special.
Frank Gifford,I was the law and order.
Frank Gifford,"I had three stages of knowing Wellington Mara. He was my boss for a long time and he was a father figure. And finally, as we got older, he was my friend."
Frank Gifford,"Rosie is a Hall of Fame player, and I wouldn't be in the Hall of Fame if it weren't for him."
Frank Gifford,Oh how sweet it is to hear one's own convictions from another's lips.
Frank Gifford,"Before the first year, nobody gave it a chance. Now, 36 years later, everybody knows Monday Night Football."
Frank Gifford,Gray skies are just clouds passing over.
Frank Gifford,"Pro football is like nuclear warfare. There are no winners, only survivors."
Ryan Giggs,"We think we've got the quality to match Chelsea and Arsenal,"
Ryan Giggs,"Some said he had too much influence, but I don't agree. He impressed me from the start."
Ryan Giggs,"But the main thing is to work on the stability of the team, not giving goals away, and scoring our goals will come."
Ryan Giggs,"John's put a lot of faith in me, making me captain and like the players he's brought in, I've responded. He's got his own style but the lads are a lot more comfortable with him now. John and Sir Alex Ferguson are both old school, like to do the coaching, and stress what they want from individuals. And, more often than not, they get it."
Ryan Giggs,"Roy Keane is Damien, the devil incarnate. He's evil. Even in training."
Ryan Giggs,The ability in this United squad is just as good as theirs. We just lacked concentration at key times last season and against teams we would normally beat.
Tom Gilbert,"At this time, Sargent & Sargent is handling the security aspect of it."
Tom Gilbert,"That was our fault. We were running around. We had no idea what we were doing. It was frustrating because it was happening every power play we were out there. We didn't know what guy we had. It's something that we're going to have to go back and work on, and teach ourselves that we've got to get better prepared for any team's power play because we just weren't ready for it."
Tom Gilbert,It's a tight race in the WCHA and we know these points are so important.
Tom Gilbert,"It's good learning for us this weekend. It's a tight race down to the end in the WCHA, and it doesn't matter who we're playing or where we're playing. We can't take any game lightly the rest of the year."
Tom Gilbert,"You could say you get frustrated at officiating, but you can't let your emotions get you down. It was frustrating for me, and I took my game to a new level. I let the refs get to me, I let the players get to me. I've got to learn, personally, to relax and go out there and keep working hard and keep doing the things I do well."
Walter Gilbert,"We know specific genes are turned on in specific cells, but we don't know to what extent this happens."
Walter Gilbert,"Everyone wants a hand in the outcome, a piece of the knowledge."
Walter Gilbert,Today we try to identify a gene and then study its properties.
Walter Gilbert,"Early on, it's good to develop the ability to write. Learning to write is a useful exercise, even if what you're writing about is not that relevant."
Walter Gilbert,"By asking a novel question that you don't know the answer to, you discover whether you can formulate a way of finding the answer, and you stretch your own mind, and very often you learn something new."
Walter Gilbert,"The human's place in the universe will be set in the scheme of evolution, the product of our biological inheritance."
Walter Gilbert,The virtues of science are skepticism and independence of thought.
Walter Gilbert,We are embedded in a biological world and related to the organisms around us.
Walter Gilbert,"Biology will relate every human gene to the genes of other animals and bacteria, to this great chain of being."
Walter Gilbert,The interaction of the variation in our genes is what's responsible for lots of our attributes and vigor.
Walter Gilbert,The best project is one that asks a novel question.
Walter Gilbert,"Scientists tend to be skeptical, but the weakness of the community of science is that it tends to move into preformed establishment modes that say this is the only way of doing science, the only valid view."
Walter Gilbert,"It's easier to change what you do than people think it is. If you don't change, your field changes around you."
Walter Gilbert,Why do we do basic research? To learn about ourselves.
Walter Gilbert,Science doesn't in the slightest depend on trust. It depends completely on the belief that you can demonstrate something for yourself.
Walter Gilbert,We haven't been able yet to determine in terms of genes what makes a human being a human and not another mammal.
Walter Gilbert,"In 15 years we'll have all the sequence, a list of the genes everyone has in common and those that differ among people. We know only something like a tenth of 1 percent of the sequence at the moment."
Adam Gilchrist,"But Test matches generally the quality wins out over time and they have great depth in quality and we feel like we have got it (as well), they will definitely put up a fight I am sure."
Adam Gilchrist,"There are strong opinions being thrown around about who should be in or out of the side at a time when they are pretty easy to throw around,"
Adam Gilchrist,"It was a seaming wicket, plenty of moisture there. We take the game plan in of playing two spinners, obviously hoping to bat first and have them bowling on day five."
Adam Gilchrist,It is just a matter of doing the work and having faith in what has been successful for me in the past. Very few series come down to one man. I don't think one player is going to control the destiny of the Ashes.
Adam Gilchrist,"There is no doubt the rest helped me immensely, as it has done in the previous four years. People are questioning a couple of guys having a rest. We have been doing this for a long time now."
Adam Gilchrist,"He just keeps coming back, so I've got no doubt he'll play as long as he wants and he's got the hunger. He just loves it."
Adam Gilchrist,We're certainly under pressure again. England have played consistent cricket for two days in this match and have certainly played more consistent cricket than us in the series. That sees us in another challenging position that we'll have to sit down and think about it.
Adam Gilchrist,"He is probably right (about the) longer format, one-day cricket or like Twenty20 cricket the shorter the game the more of a bit of a lottery it can become,"
Adam Gilchrist,It was an amazing win and testament to the character of the team. From the position we were in it must be one of the greatest comebacks.
Adam Gilchrist,"He (Vaughan) sets a field and the boys just bowl to it, bowl to the plan and execute it perfectly,"
Jim Gilchrist,He loved retirement - there just wasn't enough of it.
Jim Gilchrist,"I have struck the mother lode of patriotism,"
Jim Gilchrist,"On behalf of (the Minuteman Project supporters), we applaud you gentlemen."
Jim Gilchrist,"Illegal immigration is bankrupting states along the border, but this is about more than economics -- we're placing our national security at risk. Drug lords and violent gangs like MS-13 are streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. Terrorists are also walking in unopposed; our southwestern border is littered with Arabic papers and Islamic prayer rugs."
Jim Gilchrist,"Dear Senate of the United States of America, I'm putting you on notice that ... if we cannot change you with our rhetoric and we cannot move you with our rhetoric, ... we will remove you out from office with our vote."
Jim Gilchrist,We hope you have enjoyed your stay in America because it is not going to last. We are going to make sure that America stays America.
Brendan Gill,"It is in the nature of the New Yorker to be as topical as possible, on a level that is often small in scale and playful in intention."
Brendan Gill,"If it were better, it wouldn't be as good."
Brendan Gill,Parody is homage gone sour.
Brendan Gill,I will try to cram these paragraphs full of facts and give them a weight and shape no greater than that of a cloud of blue butterflies.
Brendan Gill,Not a shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is serious.
Vince Gill,"Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye,"
Vince Gill,"It's so hard to defeat perceptions. I feel like whenever you have the opportunity, you take it and show people what it is that you do."
Vince Gill,That's the beauty of this mandolin. It's the Holy Grail. Most musicians think it's in the New Testament. And it ought to be.
Vince Gill,"[Gill also related how, in a fit of anger against Gibson, Monroe took a pocketknife and gouged out the company's nameplate.] That's the beauty of this mandolin, ... It's the Holy Grail. Most musicians think it's in the New Testament. And it ought to be."
Vince Gill,"Your talent level, as the years go by, you know, you're going to lose a little bit of what you used to be able to do, like an athlete."
Vince Gill,You learn a whole lot more about a person if they have bad breaks and all those kind of things.
Vince Gill,"Yes, the companionship is amazing. You know, you can get that physical attraction that happens is great, but then there's an awful lot of time and the rest of the day that you have to fill."
Vince Gill,"With The Key, it was, I had gone through a divorce and losing my father, and just kinda really reminiscing about how much I loved the traditional side of country music, so I made a record that was really traditional from start to finish."
Vince Gill,Whether it is successful or not is not the exercise for me. It is not up to me. It is out of my hands now. I am not going to in two years have hindsight and say I made a big mistake.
Vince Gill,"Well, more than me saying to the rest of the country music industry there is not enough traditional country music - that is not necessarily the statement in truth. I think more so that I, me, missed it more than anything else."
Vince Gill,"Well I think in all the thirty years I've been doing this now and being gone from home and all that stuff it's really, it's not about what I've achieved and if I've become a better player, or played better ten years ago than I do today."
Vince Gill,This record for the first time - feels like a record that really represents my whole entire life and instead of just a period of my life. And it is really kind of eye opening and it makes me feel really good to hear this record and hear all the years.
Vince Gill,This is just strictly me wanting to make a record that is the real deal. It is all the stuff that I have learned and know that I remember. It's what I perceive as country music is about.
Vince Gill,The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing.
Vince Gill,"The real amazing thing about all of this is I think I've maintained the mentality of a musician throughout it all, which I'm proudest of. And I'm still playing on people's records and singing on people's records."
Vince Gill,"The funny thing is, people's perceptions of what a song is about is usually wrong a majority of the time. But they're still going to read what they want to into it."
Vince Gill,"So I didn't have anything to do with picking the songs, but I got to musically take them in places I thought might be interesting, so it was a real neat collaboration among the three of us."
Vince Gill,"My last two records that I made were both quite pointed in one direction and I think I do my best stuff when it's all over the map, when there's a couple traditional things, a couple pretty rocking things."
Vince Gill,My Dad says I've made a name for myself and now I can pull back and appreciate what I do instead of striving to get to my next gig.
Vince Gill,"It really does take a lot of time to make records, to be in the studio and do all that stuff."
Vince Gill,It is not that I don't like contemporary country music because I do. I love it. I have recorded a lot and have had great success recording records that have not been very traditional country records.
Vince Gill,"It is not fun singing about losing somebody like that, but at the same time it was easy to write because the memories were so real and vivid and so much a part of who I am."
Vince Gill,It is harder to fail than it is to succeed because most people are going to watch you do is to react to what you've accomplished.
Vince Gill,It is easy to react if everything is going great.
Vince Gill,I've always been more drawn to being normal than being famous.
Vince Gill,"I still have to play the solos and do the things that I do on my records, I still put in the work. I think that it's more lonely, and it's hard."
Vince Gill,"I mean, look at her. Any idiot, you know, would quite taken with Amy."
Vince Gill,"I made records in the past that are as traditional as any other country records that have been made, but at the same time the records have a contemporary slant on it too."
Vince Gill,"I had just lost my dad and I remembered all the songs we used to go and hear at concerts, and the records around the house and sometimes we'd play together."
Vince Gill,I formally proposed. I'm a good Southern gentleman.
Vince Gill,I do not like being famous. I like being normal.
Vince Gill,"I can sit and analyze everything and beat myself up and say you don't quite sing as good as you used to, you're writing better songs maybe than you used to, but to me it's just the journey."
Vince Gill,I am responsible for me. I can kind of take care of what I need to do and should do what I like to do.
Vince Gill,"I am not struggling. What I do, it is what I do."
Vince Gill,"But you know the thing that I thing oftentimes gets ignored and neglected is there was 10 or 12 years of life before I met Amy and before she met me, where you know, whatever happened was probably going to happen some day."
Vince Gill,"And just, once again, the connection there that was kind of rare was - it was - it felt - everything felt familiar, you know, when I met Amy."
Vince Gill,"And from my place, and from the time that I went through my divorce, I also had my father pass away in the middle of all that. And it kind of made everything else just kind of like the back burner, you know."
Vince Gill,"That's the one thing that is really timeless is the songs. The artistry, the popularity of the artistry, that's going to come and go."
Vince Gill,"Success is always temporary. When all is said and one, the only thing you'll have left is your character."
Vince Gill,When all is said and done the only thing you'll have left is your character.
Dizzy Gillespie,They're not particular about whether you're playing a flatted fifth or a ruptured 129th as long as they can dance to it.
Dizzy Gillespie,Men have died for this music. You can't get more serious than that.
Dizzy Gillespie,It's taken me all my life to learn what not to play.
Dizzy Gillespie,"I'd like to play for you one of my compositions, my only composition."
Dizzy Gillespie,I don't care too much about music. What I like is sounds.
Dizzy Gillespie,I always try to teach by example and not force my ideas on a young musician. One of the reasons we're here is to be a part of this process of exchange.
Dizzy Gillespie,"How do I know why Miles walks off the stage? Why don't you ask him? And besides, maybe we'd all like to be like Miles, and just haven't got the guts."
Dizzy Gillespie,"I think the idea is now for blacks to write about the history of our music. It's time for that, because whites have been doing it all the time. It's time for us to do it ourselves and tell it like it is."
Dizzy Gillespie,I don't care much about music. What I like is sounds.
Jim Gilmore,I never believed that surrendering the executive power should be a condition of getting the second term. The second term should stand on its own feet.
Jim Gilmore,"I'm here to tell you the coffee was hot, the orange juice was cold, New York's still there and Reagan National is back."
Jim Gilmore,The company could offer a birthday venue at its distribution center by designing a room with a glass wall looking out to the warehouse.
David Gilmour,"It's an atheistic song, you could say, about how people live on in your dreams and your memories. And that's the only place I can meet up with these people. It's a very sad thing, remembered with joy."
David Gilmour,"Usually, in the studio, on this sort of thing... you just go out and have a play over it, and see what comes, and it's usually - mostly - the first take that's the best one, and you find yourself repeating yourself thereafter."
David Gilmour,"I had a great party for my 50th birthday, and I'm having a nice little one this time. But it's sad how many people aren't going to be there, because they've died in the intervening years. There's been a lot of carnage around me, and I'm sort of looking at that list."
David Gilmour,"I had a great party for my 50th birthday, and I'm having a nice little one this time. But it's sad how many people aren't going to be there because they've died in the intervening years. There's been a lot of carnage around me."
Paul Gimigliano,"What that means, ... is when we are asked to provide intelligence on a particular topic, we do so without shading or shaping the information in any way. It is not a question of partisan support."
Paul Gimigliano,"When requests come in from Congress, of course they receive appropriate consideration."
Paul Gimigliano,The reason an officer at CIA was terminated was for having unauthorized contact with the media and the improper release of classified information. Don't think in terms of a failure of a polygraph being the reason for termination  the polygraph is one tool in an investigative process.
Hermione Gingold,"To call him a dog hardly seems to do him justice, though inasmuch as he had four legs, a tail, and barked, I admit he was, to all outward appearances. But to those of us who knew him well, he was a perfect gentleman."
Hermione Gingold,"I got all the schooling any actress needs. That is, I learned to write enough to sign a contract."
Hermione Gingold,My father dealt in stocks and shares and my mother also had a lot of time on her hands.
Hermione Gingold,Fighting is essentially a masculine idea; a woman's weapon is her tongue.
Greg Ginn,You have to keep the business side together as well as the creative side. We have constantly surprised people and stayed with bands until they have grown on people.
Greg Ginn,"You have a very creative period which generates a name for the band, followed by a long decline where the band tries to cash in on the name."
Greg Ginn,"When the Minutemen opened for Black Flag shows, people hated them. We had to develop a Minutemen audience from different people."
Greg Ginn,"We've never had any gigantic hits, or anything like that. Perhaps that has helped us because nothing has come easy. We've had to work consistently."
Greg Ginn,"We've gotten involved in cat rescue - we take them in and find homes for them. I've always loved cats. I saw how homeless cats were living out there. We take them in, put out flyers."
Greg Ginn,"We're not good at propping up old carcasses. We want to be on top of what's vital at any particular time, and not just hold onto something because it has a name."
Greg Ginn,"We were excited when we sold our first 10 records. I always felt that if we could get the music out there, and if people became accustomed to it, then a substantial number of them would enjoy it."
Greg Ginn,We had a lot of riots. We came under attack from many of the police departments. It certainly wasn't some publicity thing. I was afraid for many years. We couldn't play in LA for many years. A lot of people got very cynical.
Greg Ginn,We aren't as concerned about the live aspect as other labels. The best live bands are the easiest to record.
Greg Ginn,There's not much music I'll listen to if it doesn't have pretty heavy swing. Rhythm is so important. Punk rock would have more power and feeling if it had swing.
Greg Ginn,There aren't enough people who are scaring the kind of people who work at these record companies.
Greg Ginn,"There are several books out on punk history, but I haven't read any of them. I was there."
Greg Ginn,"The small companies who feel that the majors are a threat, or are predators, will use that as an excuse for their eventual downfall. Don't blame others for your own inadequacies."
Greg Ginn,"The public is usually slow to catch on to new things, and it's important that musicians stick to their guns and not look for that instant gratification."
Greg Ginn,"The Minutemen were seen as more of an art thing than Black Flag, although I didn't see them that way. It confused people when we put out Saccharine Trust, too."
Greg Ginn,The biggest disappointment has been seeing the number of people in this business with very shortsighted views.
Greg Ginn,Stores can be indifferent to something new.
Greg Ginn,"SST was formed to put out the first Black Flag record. Basically, there wasn't anyone else to do it. I felt that what I was doing with Black Flag was very worthwhile, and I wanted to get it out there."
Greg Ginn,"Putting out the things that I like best hasn't been the easiest way to run a label, and it still isn't because it requires finding an audience for each record."
Greg Ginn,Punk rock really came out of N.Y. as a philosophy before the groups were ever recorded. I had a kind-of intellectual interest in the idea of creating a new scene that could be a grassroots thing.
Greg Ginn,People from major labels were afraid to go to Black Flag gigs throughout most of the band's existence. They treated our gigs as something threatening. I'm sure that it probably was. They probably had reasons to be scared.
Greg Ginn,"Most good things happen with time; especially music, which needs time to breathe and to find its own way."
Greg Ginn,"It took us two years to get our first real gig. That was a big dream. We ended up booking a lot of our own gigs and putting on a lot of our own shows. We were trying to get our actual music across, trying to make a connection there."
Greg Ginn,"If people are really excited about their music, and that's their primary motivation, then that comes through in demo tapes. That's the most important ingredient."
Greg Ginn,"I listen to everything that comes in. I'm not real worried about demo sound quality. I can hear through that sort of thing. If a band can play, then they can play."
Greg Ginn,I like a lot of electronica. I like older jazz rather than newer.
Greg Ginn,"I had business experience. I had made my living designing and building electronic equipment. Basic business was not new to me, but the music business was completely new to me. I knew nothing about distribution, or any of those things."
Greg Ginn,I didn't want to wait around for some business entity to come around and give me money and tell me what to do. We just started releasing records as best we could.
Greg Ginn,Black Flag was formed in 1977. We first recorded in 1978.
Greg Ginn,"As a label, you have to treat every group and every record as a unique entity. I think that that has been our success, rather than relying upon a fan base."
Greg Ginn,The REM and Nirvana successes don't mean much to me except as a potential distraction for bands who want to cash in on the trend. Don't try to sound like someone else. REM and Nirvana don't sound like anyone else.
Greg Ginn,I still think the best metal bands have a blues feel. The first Black Sabbath album is kind of a bludgeoning of blues. Deep Purple also started out as a blues band.
Manu Ginobili,"I couldn't believe it. When I saw he actually missed, I was trying to go for the board."
Manu Ginobili,"I was trying to get it to the rim before, but I just couldn't make a shot. In the fourth quarter, I started with the dunk, and the whole game changed for me in those couple of minutes."
Manu Ginobili,"I'm trying to test my ankle and see how I feel. I am trying to see how I feel around the rim. Overall, I am feeling pretty good."
Manu Ginobili,It was a great shooting night. But it doesn't mean I'm on a roll.
Manu Ginobili,It didn't hurt me. But the league makes its own decisions.
Manu Ginobili,"Our season is starting in a couple of days. The last 10 games, you just wanted the regular season to finish and get ready for the excitement. The atmosphere changes in one second."
Manu Ginobili,"The last 10, 15 games we've had some trouble on the boards, so we're putting a lot of emphasis on that."
Manu Ginobili,"It is tough, but we can't use that as an excuse for what happened tonight. Every team in the league has to do it. Our mind-set just wasn't right tonight and we didn't come out the right way. The whole team struggled tonight, especially at the beginning of the game."
Manu Ginobili,"I struggled in the first half. I was very upset, I just tried to play with more energy."
Manu Ginobili,"I felt better, no doubt. It wasn't that hard to feel better than Game 3 and Game 4."
Manu Ginobili,"Of course they miss a great player in Ron tonight because of his defense, but we scored a lot of points, too. I made the shots that I could in the offense. We move the ball and we really don't care who scores."
Manu Ginobili,I just believe in it.
Manu Ginobili,In the beginning I was scared to step on somebody or go to the basket. That's why I was a little slow and hesitant.
David Ginola,White Hart Lane was always a place where I felt I belonged.
David Ginola,The Centre is very important to me; it's about trust - about truth.
David Ginola,"The best thing now is to be positive about it, and hopefully the French team will resurface at the next World Cup as a force to be reckoned with."
David Ginola,"Nice, the club where I started my career in 1983, want me to see out my playing days there."
David Ginola,"Nearly 30,000 fans turned out to support the tribute match and provide one of the best atmospheres at the ground for ages. I was so happy to be part of it."
David Ginola,My other interesting adventure this week was to be a wine critic for the Observer magazine. I had to nominate six of my favourites.
David Ginola,It never ceases to amaze me the lengths that some people will go to to try and speak to me or meet me.
David Ginola,It has simply been a time of reflection.
David Ginola,"It has been fantastic to spend quality time with my children and to really bond with them. We have been cooking, cleaning, and of course playing."
David Ginola,"International football took centre stage this week, and England fans must be delighted with the two victories their team gained."
David Ginola,"I've always liked the Tottenham kit, but the new one is really beautiful and in any case it was fantastic to wear the Tottenham colours again."
David Ginola,"I went see the horror thriller, Hannibal. I am a massive fan of Anthony Hopkins. He is superb in the film."
David Ginola,I started off as a guest on the Wright and Bright radio show on Five Live with my old mates Ian and Mark. The banter with those two is always good.
David Ginola,"I played at the Sainte Maxime Beach Soccer Tournament, which was brilliant fun as usual."
David Ginola,"I loved being back out on the pitch. Although I have not been in full training, I felt pretty good."
David Ginola,"I know the game wasn't a classic, but the night was about more than that-it was about bringing back the memories and raising money for former heroes who have now fallen on hard times."
David Ginola,"I kept an interested eye on the transfer window in England, which opened and closed last month, and the lack of frantic activity just goes to show the current financial state of the game right now."
David Ginola,I have shaved my head. My flowing locks are now quite a bit shorter.
David Ginola,"I have recently started acting lessons in south France, and I intend to commence acting lessons at Rada."
David Ginola,"I have no intention of hanging up my boots next season, I want to carry on playing, and I have already had one or two interesting offers to consider."
David Ginola,"I have found a flat on Merseyside and am settling down here. If I can keep playing and get back to full match fitness, I know I have a lot to offer still."
David Ginola,I have been looking after the children. My wife has taken time off.
David Ginola,I have been keeping myself fit. I am going on holiday next week in the Mediterranean so that I can really unwind after the football season and have a rest.
David Ginola,"I have been inundated with offers to move into a career in television or film, and these, too, are tempting."
David Ginola,"I am still feeling my calf strain, so I have been unable to train this week. I will again have to sit out the weekend action, but the lads are climbing ever higher to safety."
David Ginola,"I am keeping an eye on events in the Premiership, and it has been an exciting start. I am also glad to see my old club Spurs starting well."
David Ginola,I am hoping to film another ad in the summer for Carte Noire.
David Ginola,I am feeling razor-sharp. Training sessions are really good. I feel that I am in peak condition. I know that I am ready for action.
David Ginola,Football will always be my foremost passion.
David Ginola,"English football has just had a transfer window imposed for the first time, so it will be interesting to see how managers cope with the squads they have until it re-opens."
David Ginola,The prospect of going home is very appealing.
Nikki Giovanni,don't want to be near you for the thoughts we share  but the words we never have to speak.
Nikki Giovanni,A white face goes with a white mind. Occasionally a black face goes with a white mind. Very seldom a white face will have a black mind.
Nikki Giovanni,"It's not a ladder we're climbing, it's literature we're producing. . . . We cannot possibly leave it to history as a discipline nor to sociology nor science nor economics to tell the story of our people."
Nikki Giovanni,You must invent your own games and teach us old ones how to play.
Nikki Giovanni,Some say we are responsible for those we love. Others know we are responsible for those who love us.
Nikki Giovanni,We write because we believe the human spirit cannot be tamed and should not be trained.
Nikki Giovanni,If you don't understand yourself you don't understand anybody else.
Nikki Giovanni,Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to the error that counts.
Nikki Giovanni,I really don't think life is about the I-could-have-beens. Life is only about the I-tried-to-do. I don't mind the failure but I can't imagine that I'd forgive myself if I didn't try.
Nikki Giovanni,We love because it's the only true adventure.
Nikki Giovanni,"If I could come back as anything - I'd be a bird, first, but definitely the command key is my second choice."
Nikki Giovanni,"I think one of the nicest things that we created as a generation was just the fact that we could say, 'Hey, I don't like white people.'"
Nikki Giovanni,Art is not for the cultivated taste. It is to cultivate taste.
Nikki Giovanni,We eat up artists like there's going to be a famine at the end.
Nikki Giovanni,There're two people in the world that are not likeable: a master and a slave.
Nikki Giovanni,If now isn't a good time for the truth I don't see when we'll get to it.
Joe Girardi,"I'm going to be tested in a lot of different ways. Because of the youth we have, we're going to have a lot of situations that we go through as a club. We're going to be tested."
Joe Girardi,I don't make much of pitching in spring training. We don't worry about it. We want to make sure he's healthy and gets in shape and then he'll be dialed in once it's time to start.
Joe Girardi,"You worry it's a knee or an ankle, and fortunately he just got a little spike. He'll be fine."
Joe Girardi,I don't worry about him defensively. I think you'll see a lot better defensive player in six weeks. They're all going to school right now.
Joe Girardi,"They've got a lot of good young talent, and they've got a lot of good young talent in the minor leagues that is coming, ... It's an interesting scenario."
Joe Girardi,I'm very excited about the young talent in that room.
Joe Girardi,He's an amazing talent. He's a special player.
Joe Girardi,What are you when you struggle? That's what these guys have to find out.
Joe Girardi,"I believe I was born to manage, ... I believe this is truly my strength. As a catcher, I believe I was a manager every day on the field. You're an extension of the manager. Your job is to get the most out of your pitchers."
Joe Girardi,You've got to go along with what your strength is.
Joe Girardi,He has put in a lot of great service. It's hard to tell someone like Lenny you're not going to go with us to start the year.
Joe Girardi,You have a responsibility of what you look like.
Joe Girardi,"He's done a lot in three weeks, and we want him to continue to progress. I've said all along, I will make the true evaluation in the six weeks, when it's all over. But I like what I see."
Joe Girardi,"He will take batting practice today, and we'll make an evaluation. We'll see how it feels."
Joe Girardi,"I don't think I necessarily have a philosophy where you can put a term on it,"
Joe Girardi,It's not gonna wear on my patience. I expect our guys to be perfect but I understand they're not gonna be.
Joe Girardi,"It would have been a great opportunity. I just wish the timing was different. I don't think major league coaches can be part of this tournament because it could last the whole month of March, when we're in spring training."
Joe Girardi,"This is a great opportunity, and I took it."
Joe Girardi,It's going to come down to the last days and that makes it tough. That's the nature of our camp this year.
Joe Girardi,There are times when you have to learn to pitch with the lead. To me learning how to pitch with the lead is harder than learning how to pitch when you're behind. That's what we need to learn how to do.
Joe Girardi,I call it learning the hard way.
Joe Girardi,I used to think that I kept playing to keep my mom alive. There was no joy going to the park and I couldn't figure out why I was playing. You never know when something is going to hit you.
Joe Girardi,"[ Management potential: Joe Girardi , the Yankees' bench coach, recently passed up a chance to gain his first managerial experience. Girardi declined the job of leading the Italian team in the World Baseball Classic, the 16-nation tournament in March.] It would have been a great opportunity, ... I just wish the timing was different. I don't think major league coaches can be part of this tournament because it could last the whole month of March, when we're in spring training."
Joe Girardi,"He's the kind of guy you hate to look in the face and say you're going to skip him, with how hard he works and the things that he does to prepare himself. You hate to do it. We weren't able to predict the rain."
Joe Girardi,"Closers seem to be all over the place now. For a while the trend was to go with hard throwers, but if you have that one pitch that's a dominant pitch that can get people out, it's usually where you see the closers come from."
Joe Girardi,"We're thrown right into the fire, Houston and New York. Why not? Two teams that are picked to finish at the top of their divisions. Obviously, we're going to have to play them at some point. Might as well play them the first week. I think it's a great experience for our young players."
Joe Girardi,"I think it's great. Why not get thrown right in the fire with Houston and New York, two teams that are picked to finish in the top of their division? I think it's a great experience for our young players. It's a measuring stick."
Joe Girardi,He's one of those guys fighting for one of those spots. His demeanor on the mound is very good. He never seems to be out of control. Sometimes that is good for young players.
Joe Girardi,It was no accident what he did. They were fighting to win the division. He is a good-looking player.
Joe Girardi,We had some execution lapses. We had our chances and we didn't get it done.
Joe Girardi,What's enjoyable to watch is how hard they're playing. I'm proud of them.
Joe Girardi,"You go from being excited to panicking a little bit when a guy slides into him. Your emotions can get a little wavy. For me, being a baseball player, it's just exciting to watch what kids can do. When you think about it, he probably should be a junior in college."
Joe Girardi,They're making decisions really tough around here. The idea was to let them fight it out. Let's let them fight it out and go from there.
Joe Girardi,"He's put together a pretty good little stretch here. The thing we've talked about the whole way is consistency through the whole year, understanding you are going to go through some struggles. How are you able to get out of them? Are you able to get out of them quicker than other players? Those are the great players."
Joe Girardi,You get to teach. You get to manage. I love the competition and I love the idea of trying to figure out how to beat the other team.
Joe Girardi,"We counted it up. We hit 11 balls on the button. And what did we get, five hits?"
Joe Girardi,"Guys are just doing the little things, taking advantage. And our two-strike at bats the first two days have been tremendous."
Joe Girardi,He showed he has the ability to drive in runs. We need that all up and down the lineup.
Indigo Girls,Whatever happened to anyone else could happen to you and to me - And the end of my youth was the possible truth that it all happens randomly.
Indigo Girls,And even I have got to laugh at me.
Indigo Girls,"With all the blood newly dried in the desert, can we not fertilize the land with something else?"
Indigo Girls,yeah but what it takes to cross the great divideseems more than all the courage I can muster up insidealthough we get to have some answers when we reach the other sidethe prize is always worth the rocky ride

Bhagavad Gita,"Your powerful radiance is burning the entire universe, and filling it with splendor, O Krishna."

Bhagavad Gita,"He from whom all beings originate, and by whom all this universe is pervaded; worshipping Him by performing one's natural duty for Him one attains perfection."
Bhagavad Gita,This being the case; the ignorant person who considers oneself as the sole agent due to imperfect understanding does not understand.

Bhagavad Gita,"The yogi who diligently strives, perfecting [gradually] through many incarnations, becomes completely free from all sins and reaches the Self-realization."

Bhagavad Gita,"The one who rejoices in the Self only, who is satisfied with the Self, who is content in the Self alone, for such a [Self-realized] person there is no duty."
Bhagavad Gita,"All these (seekers) are indeed noble, but I regard the wise as My very Self, because the one who is steadfast becomes one with the Supreme Being."
Bhagavad Gita,"Today I have described the same ancient science to you, because you are my sincere devotee and friend. Karma-yoga is a supreme secret indeed."
Bhagavad Gita,Thus handed down in succession the royal sages knew this (Karma-yoga). After a long time the science of Karma-yoga was lost from this earth.
Bhagavad Gita,"Thus this most secret science has been explained by Me, O sinless Arjuna. Having understood this, one becomes enlightened and one's all duties are accomplished."

Bhagavad Gita,"Knowing that, O Arjuna, you shall not again get deluded like this. By this knowledge you shall behold the entire creation in your own Self/Lord, or in Brahman."
Bhagavad Gita,"Verily there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. One who becomes purified by Karma-yoga discovers this knowledge within (naturally) in course of time. (See also 4.31, and 5.06)."
Bhagavad Gita,"Those who have taken refuge in this knowledge attain unity with Me, and are neither born at the time of creation nor afflicted at the time of dissolution."
Bhagavad Gita,"Four types of virtuous ones worship or seek Me, O Arjuna. They are: the distressed, the seeker of Self-knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise one who knows the Supreme."

Bhagavad Gita,"After taking such a birth, O Arjuna, one regains the knowledge acquired in the previous life, and strives again to achieve perfection."
Bhagavad Gita,"If you think that this (body) takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this."
Bhagavad Gita,"The one who truly understands My transcendental birth and activities, is not born again after leaving this body and attains My abode."
Bhagavad Gita,Neither do I see the beginning nor the middle nor the end of Your Universal Form.

Bhagavad Gita,"Freed from attachment, fear, and anger; fully absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, and purified by the fire of Self-knowledge, many have attained Me."
Bhagavad Gita,Bound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and anger; they strive to obtain wealth by unlawful means for the fulfillment of desires.

Todd Gitlin,"I think there's a desire for results, a hard-bitten realism. The primary goal is not some sort of symbolic display, or some sort of posture or attitude, but results. If that's what it means, then I applaud the turn to practicality. Today the far right is in charge, and I don't think you can create the possibility of broad-based radicalism until you defeat the far right. Put the center in power and then you have the possibility--or the luxury--of radicalism."
Todd Gitlin,"We are in the midst of a tremendous global revolution, ... and the consequences are on a scale that are hitherto unprecedented."
Todd Gitlin,We may repeat the awful revolutionary history of the 20th century because of the vulnerability of social movements to demagoguery.
Todd Gitlin,"Today's global justice movement may be the biggest, most diverse and energetic in history."
Todd Gitlin,To win power anywhere you have to convince people that you can do something for them.
Todd Gitlin,"There is a fuzzy but real distinction that can and I believe should be made, between patriotism, which is attachment to a way of life, and nationalism, which is the insistence that your way of life deserves to rule over other ways of life."
Todd Gitlin,"The only people available to change the world are the people now living in it, with all the beliefs they bring along - however retrograde those beliefs may appear to those of us who see ourselves as enlightened."
Todd Gitlin,The moguls are driven by their respective desires for profit - period.
Todd Gitlin,"The genius of the economic machine is in its ability to convert these indulgences into profitability. It converts desire into attention, a grip on our eyeballs and eardrums, which in turn can be marketed to advertisers."
Todd Gitlin,The fancy term for what America has squandered in the past year and a half or so is legitimacy.
Todd Gitlin,"Sure, I've often been misrepresented - anyone frequently quoted has this experience."
Todd Gitlin,"Some versions of patriotism come close to the tribal, which we all want to surpass, and some don't."
Todd Gitlin,"Some fine day, Democrats may figure out how to get on the right side of the value divide - how to define America as a place of the common good and not a playground of the strong."
Todd Gitlin,"So every day I'm mindful as I watch the Bush crowd extend their sway into policies of every imaginable variety, and over almost every square foot of earth, that the control of the American state is a matter of urgency."
Todd Gitlin,So American culture is itself a hybrid and lends itself to use in other people's hybrids.
Todd Gitlin,Navigation is power of a limited sort - it enables us to manage the immensity of the media torrent.
Todd Gitlin,My business is the analytical framework.
Todd Gitlin,"My book is focused on the power of the American state, not least because the government of the United States governs so much that the case could be made that everybody around the world ought to have a vote in determining some of its policies."
Todd Gitlin,Mills insisted that a sociologist's proper subject was the intersection of biography and history.
Todd Gitlin,"Like Americans, people outside America want fun, want an emotional compensation for the utilitarianism and calculation that mark the rest of their lives."
Todd Gitlin,It's an old anarchist dream that people can take care of their own lives.
Todd Gitlin,"I have no action plan, and as a writer I don't want to get hung up on the advantages and disadvantages of particular strategies."
Todd Gitlin,I don't think anyone in the media thinks strategically about society.
Todd Gitlin,I am concerned about how to reverse the process by which a fundamentalist right and a corporate elite were able to seize power in the United States.
Todd Gitlin,"I am a realist as well as an idealist, and I think that it is incumbent upon those of us in opposition to try to work within what are always arduous circumstances to stretch the limits of the possible."
Todd Gitlin,"Collectively, we are in thrall to media - because they deliver to us many of the psychic goods we crave, and we know no other way to live."
Todd Gitlin,"As I write at the end, if we step back and face the enormity of the torrent, then we have taken the first step to imagining what we might want to do about it."
Todd Gitlin,"American movies and music deliver themes of freedom, innocence, and power that appeal to others - partly because America itself was put together out of a multiplicity of national traditions."
Todd Gitlin,All I will say is that there are particular features of the American constitutional system that renders a third party futile - at best.
Todd Gitlin,"Again, the only trends that interest the corporate boys and girls are demographic and businesslike. I doubt the think tank reports interest them much."
Todd Gitlin,A century of convulsive change leaves huge demographic gouge marks.
Todd Gitlin,The manufacture of desire isn't at the heart - if it isn't absurd to speak of a heart - of the media torrent. Chronic dissatisfaction is at the heart of the matter.
Todd Gitlin,"Human inertia makes the everyday environment, the furniture, as it were, appear to be a given."
Todd Gitlin,"Americas are, for a variety of reasons, the most adept at producing the kind of entertainment that delivers easy satisfactions."

Rudy Giuliani,"This is all about safety,"

Rudy Giuliani,"The reality is that we don't expect that we're going to be able to find anyone alive,"
Rudy Giuliani,"Just so we're absolutely clear about it, ... I'm here for one purpose and one purpose alone: to endorse Doug Forrester for governor, to urge the people of New Jersey to vote, to give themselves the chance for reform, for change. And Doug Forrester can accomplish that."
Rudy Giuliani,It obviously troubles both the police commissioner and me that 41 shots were fired.
Rudy Giuliani,"The whole notion that police officers won't cooperate, this blue wall of silence thing -- the police commissioner and I challenged the police officers to break that silence, ... And one police officer -- a police officer, not a civilian -- came forward and courageously gave the district attorney the information that really has helped to pull this case together."
Rudy Giuliani,should have been held on high bail whether he was or he wasn't a police officer. Everybody should be held to an extremely high standard when it comes to drunk driving.
Rudy Giuliani,"I don't know what I'm going to be doing in 2008, ... I wasn't planning when I was associate attorney general or U.S. attorney (in the 1980s) to run for mayor. It all came gradually much closer to the time that I did it."
Rudy Giuliani,understanding the difficulties and split-second decisions that police officers have to make during the performance of their duties.
Rudy Giuliani,"Emergencies, by their very nature, are impossible situations to handle,"
Rudy Giuliani,"This is not a clash of civilizations, ... It's a clash between murderers and humanity. It's a matter of justice leading to peace."
Rudy Giuliani,put my health first.
Rudy Giuliani,"Police officers risk their lives to protect me and my family. We can give them the benefit of the doubt,"
Rudy Giuliani,"The first thing that has to be accomplished by this design is to properly and in a beautiful and compelling way capture the significance of what happened at this place,"
Rudy Giuliani,how he is demonized. It doesn't matter what the media does to ridicule him or misinterpret him or defeat him.
Rudy Giuliani,"We're gaining jobs ahead of America,"
Rudy Giuliani,"We used to be the crime capital and now we're the safest large city in America. We used to be the welfare capital of America and now we're seen as the city that has moved more people off welfare, has moved more people to work from welfare, of any city in America,"
Rudy Giuliani,the safest large city in America.
Rudy Giuliani,"The prayers are for the people missing, the people who have died, and for America and for everyone that survived,"
Rudy Giuliani,"There is no city in America that has reduced crime as much as we have in the last three years, ... This is not the product of accident. This is the product of design."
Rudy Giuliani,"America, ... needs to be defended. We need missile defense to better police the skies over the United States."
Beth Givens,It just points out how pervasive these security breaches are.
Beth Givens,"Yes, you'll probably get that money back once they've done the investigation, but if the investigation takes two weeks or two months, here you are without money in your checking account."
Beth Givens,"We really don?t have anything to compare it to. Victims are protected by federal law from having to pay fraudulent charges, so the loss is primarily of time."
Beth Givens,"The person on the other end of the line is likely to have very sensitive information -- your account number, your Social Security number, the types of accounts you have (and) the way you use your accounts."
Beth Givens,"If they answer yes, then ask, 'How are you making sure that my information is being protected?' If you don't like the answer, take your business to another financial institution."
Beth Givens,These online information brokers are really on the hot seat. There's a lot of interest in what they are doing.
Beth Givens,"The more tracking that's done even within the family, the more we'll all be getting accustomed to tracking, and ... it will become more and more acceptable."
Beth Givens,But it's creepy for a family to be under the watchful eye of a neighbor.
Beth Givens,They are usually off the hook financially. But what they are going to have to endure is far worse than having to pay the impostor's bills.
Beth Givens,"They are usually off the hook financially, ... But what they are going to have to endure is far worse than having to pay the impostor's bills."
Beth Givens,[Congress] could very well wipe out some extremely strong and effective legislation that has been passed into law here in California.
Beth Givens,"The FTC is reporting on the complaints that they've received, and it could be that more people know to report to the FTC when something bad happens to them."
Beth Givens,It's the Social Security numbers that give fraudsters the ability to impersonate that person.
Jeff Gladstein,"I like the dollar higher. There's relatively sub-par growth out of Europe, and the U.S. is humming along."
Jeff Gladstein,"Any bets on dollar weakness will be a bet that higher energy prices will divert consumer spending, which has been the motor for the economy."
Jeff Gladstein,"These numbers tell you that the economy is humming right along through the holiday season. There will be no reason for the Fed to stop hiking interest rates, which is very supportive of the U.S. economy and the dollar."
Jeff Gladstein,There's some selling of the dollar on what appears to be a little weaker demand in the U.S. economy.
Jeff Gladstein,"Everybody's waiting for tomorrow to see if the economy really is on a aggressive roll. It would imply moving more toward 5.25 percent, which should keep the dollar relatively well bid."
William Gladstone,We look forward to the time when the Power of Love will replace the Love of Power. Then will our world know the blessings of Peace.

William Gladstone,"Be happy with what you have and are, be generous with both, and you won't have to hunt for happiness."
William Gladstone,Justice delayed is justice denied.
Malcolm Gladwell,"Instinct is the gift of experience. The first question you have to ask yourself is, 'On what basis am I making a judgment?' ... If you have no experience, then your instincts aren't any good."
Malcolm Gladwell,"A country that displays an almost ruthless commitment to efficiency and performance in every aspect of its economyÃ¢â‚¬â€a country that switched to Japanese cars the moment they were more reliable, and to Chinese T-shirts the moment they were five cents cheaperÃ¢â‚¬â€has loyally stuck with a health-care system that leaves its citizenry pulling out their teeth with pliers,"
Malcolm Gladwell,What do we tell our children? ... Haste makes waste. Look before you leap. Stop and think. Don't judge a book by its cover. We believe that we are always better off gathering as much information as possible and spending as much time as possible in deliberation.
Malcolm Gladwell,"For every romantic possiblity, no matter how robust, there exists at least one equal and opposite sentence, phrase, or word capable of extinguishing it."
Malcolm Gladwell,I hope I have encouraged people in business to expand the way they make sense of human behavior.
Malcolm Gladwell,Those with health insurance are overinsured and their behavior is distorted by moral hazard. Those without health insurance use their own money to make decisions based on an assessment of their needs. The insured are wasteful. The uninsured are prudent. So what's the solution? Make the insured a little more like the uninsured.

Malcolm Gladwell,"We don't know where our first impressions come from or precisely what they mean, so we don't always appreciate their fragility."
Malcolm Gladwell,That fundamentally undermines your ability to access the best part of your instincts. So my advice to those people would be stop thinking and introspecting so much and do a little more acting.
Stanton Glantz,What Phillip Morris is doing here is a tremendous disservice to parents and to infants because it's increasing the risk infants will die.
Stanton Glantz,This report is forcing reconsideration of this issue by health officials all over the world.
Stanton Glantz,"It's pretty simple. These laws are very bad for the cigarette companies, because they create an environment for people to quit if they want to."
Stanton Glantz,"There are more studies, the risk estimates are more consistently elevated, and they're higher than they were for lung cancer. Plus, there's all these toxicology studies and molecular biology they didn't have back then."
Stanton Glantz,"If people are serious about breast cancer, they have to deal with secondhand smoke. That's what this is all about."

Jerry Glanville,"No griping. No complaining. No one asking, 'Why me?'"
Jerry Glanville,"They're shifting to get an advantage on you. Their shift is not gingerbread for the crowd. They're not shifting so the crowd thinks they're cerebral. They shift a guy to one side, and if you don't have him covered, they'll get him the ball."
Jerry Glanville,"With his ability we're going to look at him at both spots. We haven't done anything yet, but just watching him last year I think he can help us at both places."
Jerry Glanville,"He has enough ability to be an excellent player. Unfortunately, he's been hurt the last couple of years."
Milton Glaser,"We are all born with genius. It's like our fairy godmother. But what happens in life is that we stop listening to our inner voices, and we no longer have access to this extraordinary ability to create poetry."

Milton Glaser,"The real issue is not talent as an independent element, but talent in relationship to will, desire, and persistence. Talent without these things vanishes and even modest talent with those characteristics grows."
Milton Glaser,To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master.
Ira Glass,You'd think that radio was around long enough that someone would have coined a word for staring into space.
Ira Glass,"Where radio is different than fiction is that even mediocre fiction needs purpose, a driving question."
Ira Glass,"When I say something untrue on the air, I mean for it to be transparently untrue. I assume people know when I'm just saying something for effect. Or to be funny."
Ira Glass,"One reason I do the live shows - and the monthly speeches at public radio stations - is to remind myself that people hear the show, that it has an audience, that it exists in the world. It's so easy to forget that."
Ira Glass,"It's not a terribly original thing to say, but I love Raymond Carver. For one thing, he's fun to read out loud."
Ira Glass,"In some theoretical way I know that a half-million people hear the show. But in a day-to-day way, there's not much evidence of it."
Ira Glass,"I think good radio often uses the techniques of fiction: characters, scenes, a big urgent emotional question. And as in the best fiction, tone counts for a lot."
Ira Glass,I suppose I shouldn't go around admitting I speak untruths on the radio.
Ira Glass,"But sadly, one of the problems with being on public radio is that people tend to think you're being sincere all the time."
Ira Glass,Just when did I get to the point when staying at a hotel wasn't fun?
Ira Glass,"But you can make good radio, interesting radio, great radio even, without an urgent question, a burning issue at stake."
John Glass,"Certainly if you bought it last March, it was cheap. It was a value stock. It is generally regarded as a well-run company with a big return on investment. Buffett likes beaten-up names and things you can feel, touch and literally eat. It fits his profile pretty well."
John Glass,"The second half of 2004 is extremely critical. April sales were very strong, but I don't think anyone expects a 10 percent sales increase in September, October and November."
John Glass,"They've chosen not to invest as aggressively as other companies, but also they're not seeing the same sales ramp. You know $17 million in sales this year, that's not really a huge number,"
John Glass,The company has been grooming Bell for that role and he's certainly become more of a public face of the company recently.
Philip Glass,Night Stalker.
Philip Glass,"There were audiences for the first time in living memory. People were discussing modern music. Maybe they liked it and maybe they didn't, but the question of what we were doing suddenly became an urgent one."
Philip Glass,What came to me as a revelation was the use of rhythm in developing an overall structure in music.
Philip Glass,"European musicians didn't learn popular music, whereas in America we did, ... So you played in bands, you played in orchestras, you played everything. The high-art/low-art idea, that was a very European idea and not much appreciated in America. People like Cole Porter and Gershwin were considered very important composers."
William Glass,"People were horrified. Some of the principals started crying. It must have lasted for 20 minutes just watching and listening to the commentators. We spent another 20 minutes working out what to do, and then we went to the schools."
William Glass,"She's open to new ideas and opportunities and will be a natural for creating partnerships with Western Connecticut State University and capitalizing on the rich resources the university brings. Most importantly, she puts children first in all of her educational decision making."
William Glass,I can't put my feelings into words. I don't know what's going on. My words won't flow right now.
William Glass,This is a good example of where we excel.
William Glasser,"When we label anyone bad, we will have more trouble dealing with him than if we could have settled for a lesser label."
William Glasser,"If we are to persuade all students to do quality work, we must involve them deeply in the process of evaluating their own work as they do it! This is concurrent evaluation."
William Glasser,"A friend of mine, a dedicated golfer, shot a hole in one playing by himself. Disaster."
William Glasser,Everybody needs one essential friend.
William Glasser,You can acquire a lot of knowledge without ever going to school.
William Glasser,"Without pay, no human being will work up to their ability if he or she is not cared for and respected."
William Glasser,"When we label anyone 'bad', we will have more trouble dealing with him than if we could have settled for a lesser label."
William Glasser,What students lack in school is an intellectual relationship or conversation with the teacher.
William Glasser,"What happened in the past that was painful has a great deal to do with what we are today, but revisiting this painful past can contribute little or nothing to what we need to do now."
William Glasser,"We don't focus as much in schools on educational knowledge which requires thinking and application, as we do on acquiring facts."
William Glasser,"We can teach a lot of things, but if the teacher can't relate by talking to a group of friendly students, he'll never be a competent teacher."
William Glasser,"We can pay teachers a hundred thousand dollars a year, and we'll do nothing to improve our schools as long as we keep the A, B, C, D, F grading system."
William Glasser,"Told that the passing grade is a B or competence and that we will help you to get there, students do competent work. The lowest passing grade in the real world is competence. Why do schools accept so much less?"
William Glasser,"This is at the heart of all good education, where the teacher asks students to think and engages them in encouraging dialogues, constantly checking for understanding and growth."
William Glasser,There is plenty of competition in a Glasser Quality School in that there is winning but no losing.
William Glasser,"Running a school where the students all succeed, even if some students have to help others to make the grade, is good preparation for democracy."
William Glasser,"Prior to being allowed to enter the profession, prospective teachers should be asked to talk with a group of friendly students for at least half an hour and be able to engage them in an interesting conversation about any subject the prospective teacher wants to talk about."
William Glasser,No human being will work hard at anything unless they believe that they are working for competence.
William Glasser,In a Glasser Quality School there is no such thing as a closed book test. Students are told to get out their notes and open their books. There is no such thing as being forbidden to ask the teacher or another student for help.
William Glasser,I think education is both using and improving knowledge and that changes the whole picture.
William Glasser,"If everyone could learn that what is right for me does not make it right for anyone else, the world would be a much happier place."
William Glasser,"Good or bad, everything we do is our best choice at that moment."
William Glasser,"Too many of us fail to fulfill our needs because we say no rather than yes, or perhaps later in life, yes when we should say no."
William Glasser,Effective teaching may be the hardest job there is.
William Glasser,"We may be up against a stone wall, but we don't have to bloody our heads against it unless we choose to."
William Glasser,Caring for but never trying to own may be a further way to define friendship.
William Glasser,"We almost always have choices, and the better the choice, the more we will be in control of our lives."
William Glasser,"If you want to change attitudes, start with a change in behavior."
William Glasser,"If you improve education by teaching for competence, eliminating schooling, and connecting with students, the test scores will improve."
William Glasser,"If we had in this room a hundred teachers, good teachers from good schools, and asked them to define the word education, there would be very little general agreement."
William Glasser,I think it is totally wrong and terribly harmful if education is defined as acquiring knowledge.
William Glasser,"Every single major push in education has made it worse and right now it's really bad because everything we've done is de-humanizing education. It's destroying the possibility of the teacher and the student having a warm, friendly, intellectual relationship."
William Glasser,"As long as acquiring knowledge is the educational goal of schools, educational opportunities will be limited, as they are now, to affluent families."
William Glasser,"To counter the avoidance of intellectual challenge and responsibility, we must reduce the domination of certainty in education."
William Glasser,"The faster you go, the more students you leave behind. It doesn't matter how much or how fast you teach. The true measure is how much students have learned."
William Glasser,"We are driven by five genetic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun."
William Glasser,"It is almost impossible for anyone, even the most ineffective among us, to continue to choose misery after becoming aware that it is a choice."
William Glasser,Education is the process in which we discover that learning adds quality to our lives. Learning must be experienced.
Tom Glavine,"It gives me a sense of tunnel vision,"
Tom Glavine,Having Billy makes us a better team. He will give us a sense of security in the late innings.
Tom Glavine,"You don't always expect them to get excited about anything to do with school, but they do,"
Tom Glavine,"You don't always expect them to get excited about anything to do with school, but they do. It's kind of their thing. They have concern for it and they're proud of how it looks. It's kind of an extension of their personality. They want it to be cool like they are."
Tom Glavine,We were running out of outs. You don't get a lot of opportunities.
Tom Glavine,"We can. I've said all along, our talent is equal to that of any team in this race. We just have to do it."
Tom Glavine,"I'm not going to say it's good for the game. I'm not going to say there are no economic problems,"
Tom Glavine,"It's a complete reversal. It's certainly something we want to continue to do, but we have had some problems last year winning on the road, and that's something we have to do something about."
Tom Glavine,"You're looking at a game of more and more power pitchers, and quite honestly, you got to figure those guys are more susceptible to getting hurt. It'll be interesting to see how many of those guys are able to pitch long enough to even come close to having a chance to do it."
Tom Glavine,"Unless my arm falls off, I'm not planning on getting this close to 300 wins and shutting it down."
Tom Glavine,"He carried himself with a lot of passion, and he had an infectious personality, so he's going to be missed. You hate seeing something like that, obviously, at such a young age and seemingly in the prime of his life ."
Tom Glavine,"If there was ever any ... question about what kind of player he was going to be, it was on the offensive side of the ball. There was always a feeling that offensively, he was capable of putting up monster numbers."
Tom Glavine,It stinks that we lost and it stinks that one of our buddies got hurt.
Tom Glavine,I was tired (in the fifth). Striking a lot of guys out is hard work. I realized in the fifth I didn't have a lot of ground outs.
Tom Glavine,"We gave him grief about everything. We always got on him about his physique, which is less than intimidating. How he'd dress sometimes. All that stuff. He was fair game. He played the game, and he gave it back. That was part of the great thing there, for the three of us to be able to be teammates as long as we were, to form a great friendship. Nowadays in baseball, that's hard to do."
Tom Glavine,"All I can do is keep trying to pitch and keep giving us chances to win, ... Sure it is frustrating when you try and go out there and win games and do not."
Tom Glavine,"It's just the environment that we're in right now. There's a lot of people who still don't want to believe that the program we have in place is a good program, and that it's going to work. They're just trying to find a way to shoot holes in it."
Tom Glavine,"We need to wipe away as much doubt about this as we possibly can. Anything we can do to take away people's suspicions, we need to do that."
Tom Glavine,"Without having read it, being told what was in the newspaper, I'm not going to deny that that conversation took place. But that's it. That's a business situation that should remain between the people that were involved. As far as my reaction to it, I really don't have one. I think the only reaction is that I don't really think it's something that needs to be public knowledge."
Tom Glavine,It might have been their birthdays. I gave them each a gift.
Tom Glavine,"I didn't get the benefit of any calls in the first. Having been through this so many times in this park, you don't worry about it."
Tom Glavine,"I like to be in a position of helping people. I find it very humbling that, simply by playing baseball, I'm in position to help so many people. I never take that for granted."
Tom Glavine,"With three balls, Willie told me to put him on. That took care of it for me. I was intent on trying to make pitches and get back. ... Regardless of what his numbers say, he's still capable of doing a lot of things. He's the guy you don't want beating you."
Tom Glavine,"I don't feel the anxiety I felt in my first start for the Mets. Obviously, that game wasn't as important in the standings as [tonight's] game."
Tom Glavine,"I don't feel the anxiety I felt in my first start for the Mets, ... Obviously, that game wasn't as important in the standings as [tonight's] game."
Tom Glavine,"In 1994 there was virtually no chance we were going to reach an agreement without a work stoppage, ... They were talking about a salary cap and we weren't. In this negotiating we've been talking about virtually the same thing. It's sometimes a difference in philosophy on how to reach certain goals."
Tom Glavine,"I think it's just getting to be an increasingly difficult thing to do in the day and age we're in now, ... More than anything else now, I think it's just the offensive explosion. It's so hard to stay in there and win games."
Tom Glavine,"I don't like going to young players and forcing myself on them with advice because they get it all the time. But, if someone asked I'd help them anyway I could. When they approach you, you know they want to learn."
Tom Glavine,"If I have to make the team on my vertical jump, my long jump or my running ability, I don't like my chances. I don't plan, unless my arm falls off, on getting this close to 300 wins and then shutting it down."
Ron Glaz,"Sony hasn't been in the SLR business, so they'll leverage the brand name to try to penetrate the [SLR] market. That's the one piece of the pie they've been missing."
Ron Glaz,"If, for $30, you can get 50 images in a book that is bound for you â€“ where you don't have to buy an album â€“ I think there's a lot of opportunity there. The market is starting to evolve and look beyond the 4-by-6 print."
Ron Glaz,Their true advantage is their using inkjet print solutions.

John Glenn,"For all the advances in medicine, there is still no cure for the common birthday."
John Glenn,I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.
John Glenn,"The most important thing we can do is inspire young minds and to advance the kind of science, math and technology education that will help youngsters take us to the next phase of space travel."
John Glenn,This is a day we have managed to avoid for a quarter of a century.
John Glenn,"This is basic, fundamental research. We have some 35 million Americans over the age of 65, ... The basic purpose of why I'm going is not just to go sightseeing."
John Glenn,"It's an advantage up here for older folks because in Zero-G you can move around much more easily, ... I've been bumping my head a lot on things as I float around here, but that's all right."
John Glenn,There is still no cure for the common birthday.
Dan Glickman,"You will see regional negative effects in local economies, ... And you will see income loss among local farmers."
Dan Glickman,"[And yet talk to Hollywood and the establishment that should be crushing him seems in awe instead:] He's obviously a very brilliant guy, ... have some revolutionary ideas and interesting concepts and we have been talking with them."
Dan Glickman,"They are still there pouring over records and interviewing people, looking into both the plants food safety procedures and the degree to which Hudson's has been forthcoming in providing timely and accurate information to the USDA,"
Dan Glickman,"All the way from major national restaurants and food retailers to hospitals and hotels, we now see organizations all over America involved,"
Dan Glickman,"I have received an official request from the government of the Russian Federation for additional food assistance, ... The United States is now in the process of reviewing this request."
Dan Glickman,"We're spending today, depending upon which agency of government, significantly more money on fire preparedness and treatment than we were spending in 1993, ... I think the real issue is that we have a situation that has been unparalleled in the last 50 years right now, and that has to do with what I call 'the perfect storm' phenomenon of weather and fuel loads."
Dan Glickman,"Our ultimate goal is a global market for films and filmed entertainment unimpeded by the artificialities of government policies, instead governed only by the tastes and demands of the audiences and our ability to meet those demands."
Dan Glickman,"We hope the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling and an aggressive education effort will dissuade companies and individuals from engaging in these types of unlawful activities in the future. But when necessary, we will pursue all avenues ? including legal means ? to protect our product from theft."
Dan Glickman,"It appears to be more about trade than the promotion of cultural diversity. The World Trade Organization is the place for (trade),"
Dan Glickman,"We screened that movie before members of Congress. Hopefully, the screening of the movie had some kind of an effect on the process."
Dan Glickman,"Despite increasing competition for consumers' time and entertainment dollars, theater-going remains a satisfying constant in people's lives."
Dan Glickman,"Despite increasing competition for consumers' time and entertainment dollars, theatergoing remains a satisfying constant in people's lives. That said, we can't bury our heads in the sand. We do have to attract customers and keep regulars coming back."
Dan Glickman,"Digital File Check is easy to use and can help people prevent their employees, children and others from illegally downloading and swapping movies."
Dan Glickman,We live in interesting times. It's important how we respond in 2006 to these challenges. We are in state of ongoing change. The power of stories remain the key to our success. The play is the thing.
Dan Glickman,"Giving farmers more flexibility to pay back their loans will help many of them stay in business during this difficult period of low prices, ... USDA is committed to providing needy family farmers as much help handling loan repayments as we possibly can, in addition to making credit more accessible."
Jim Goad,My hatred is diamond-hard.
Jim Goad,My hatred is a thousand times more powerful than all your good intentions.
Jim Goad,You can't wear it out. It'll never die. It watches you while you sleep. It confronts you around every corner. It chases you down like a running dog.
George Gobel,"If you build a better mousetrap, you will catch better mice."
George Gobel,My uncle was the town drunk - and we lived in Chicago.
George Gobel,Did you ever get the feeling that the world was a tuxedo and you were a pair of brown shoes?

Jean-Luc Godard,The children of Marx & Coca-Cola.
Jean-Luc Godard,"Not only did I get to play with these great international musicians, but I also had the opportunity to jam with the local celebrities in Toronto, people like the Walsh Brothers, David Wilcox, Kim Mitchell and the like. It was a great learning experience."
Jean-Luc Godard,"To me style is just the outside of content, and content the inside of style, like the outside and the inside of the human body. Both go together, they can't be separated."
Jean-Luc Godard,"Beauty is composed of an eternal, invariable element whose quantity is extremely difficult to determine, and a relative element which might be, either by turns or all at once, period, fashion, moral, passion."
Jean-Luc Godard,"I don't think you should feel about a film. You should feel about a woman, not a movie. You can't kiss a movie."

Gabriella Goddard,Everyday in every way I create my own reality.So what is that I choose to create today?
Laurence Godfrey,People who use music have to understand that the music belongs to someone else and they have to pay for the use of the property. The creator deserves fair compensation.
Laurence Godfrey,"There is a temptation to take advantage. Just like any other aspect of society, there are the good (music users) and the bad. There are those who comply and those who resist."
Laurence Godfrey,We look for them (music-users) and they come to us. Clients like doctors' offices and retail chains know there is a fee to be paid and contact us.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,The philosopher must station themselves in the middle.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,To make converts is the natural ambition of everyone.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,Oral delivery aims at persuasion and making the listener believe they are converted. Few persons are capable of being convinced; the majority allow themselves to be persuaded.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"People have a peculiar pleasure in making converts, that is, in causing others to enjoy what they enjoy, thus finding their own likeness represented and reflected back to them."

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"As our inclinations, so our opinions"
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"No two men see the world exactly alike, and different temperaments will apply in different ways a principle that they both acknowledge. The same man will, indeed, often see and judge the same things differently on different occasions: early convictions must give way to more mature ones. Nevertheless, may not the opinions that a man holds and expresses withstand all trials, if he only remains true to himself and others?"

Vincent Van Gogh,"I believe that it may happen that one will succeed, and one must not begin to despair, even though defeated here and there; and even though one sometimes feels a kind of decay, though things go differently from the expected, it is necessary to take heart again and new courage. For the great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. And great things are not something accidental, but must certainly be willed. What is drawing?

Vincent Van Gogh,"It always strikes me, and it is very peculiar, that when we see the image of indescribable and unutterable desolation - of loneliness, of poverty and misery, the end of all things, or their extreme - then rises in our mind the thought of God."
Vincent Van Gogh,"Perhaps it will seem to you that the sunshine is brighter and that everything has a new charm. At least, I believe this is always the result of a deep love, and it is a beautiful thing. And I believe people who think love prevents one from thinking clearly are wrong; for then one thinks very clearly and is more active than before. And love is something eternal--the aspect may change, but not the essence. There is the same difference in a person before and after he is in love as there is in an unlighted lamp and one that is burning. The lamp was there and it was a good lamp, but now it is shedding light too, and that is its real function. And love makes one calmer about many things, and in that way, one is more fit for one's work."
Vincent Van Gogh,"For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream."
Vincent Van Gogh,"Thank God, I have my work, but instead of earning money by it, I need money to be able to work; that is the difficulty. I think there are no signs in my work that indicate that I shall fail. And I am not a person who works slowly or tamely. Drawing becomes a passion with me, and I throw myself into it more and more. I do not have great plans for the future; if for a moment I feel rising within me the desire for a life without care, for prosperity, each time I go fondly back to the trouble and the cares, to a life full of hardship, and think: It is better so; I learn more from it, and make progress. This is not the road on which one perishes. I only hope the trouble and the cares will not become unbearable, and I have confidence I shall succeed in earning enough to keep myself, not in luxury, but as one who eats his bread in the sweat of his brow."
Vincent Van Gogh,"To believe in God for me is to feel that there is a God, not a dead one, or a stuffed one, but a living one, who with irresistible force urges us towards more loving"
Vincent Van Gogh,The best way to know God is to love many things.
Vincent Van Gogh,"If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makes one feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it. I think that I see something deeper, more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression of the eyes of a little baby when it wakes in the morning and coos or laughs because it sees the sun shining on its cradle."
Vincent Van Gogh,"It is a pity that, as one gradually gains experience, one loses one's youth."

Adam Goldberg,"Well, my shrink's been trying to talk me out of that for many years. We used to have this discussion: 'Well, you know, I can't let go of [eccentricities] or I won't be creative anymore.' And then I decided ... it's good to let a certain amount go, so you can be a functioning person."

Adam Goldberg,"I think that's what [O'Donn-ell's] character grapples with and what [my character] represents to him. So I think, if anything, we might be making fun of normalcy. So we might get a lot of letters and phone calls from the normal society."
Adam Goldberg,The only thing that could stop it now is action in Congress.
Bill Goldberg,"Yeah, but it's an opportunity for public service. Here there is a variety of experience. And if I end up being a trial lawyer for 30 years rather than 35, well, that's OK. I've regularly been involved in public affairs, but never before on a full-time basis. And I do not, repeat, do not plan to run for public office."
Bill Goldberg,"No, if there is an aspect of the executive branch of the government that needs looking at, I'm liable to be called in to look at it. But I'm not the only one."

Michael Goldberg,"Since 2004, Y.E.P.C. has invested millions of dollars at the direction of the Yemeni government. Up until Nov. 15, we fully expected that they would honor the contract. The government of Yemen had no right to take over this operation, and although we did not want to file an arbitration, they gave us no choice."
Michael Goldberg,"B.C. differs from the rest of Canada in that the trend is still downward in the rest of Canada as a whole, but in B.C. it's been upwards for the last three years."

William Golding,"It was at a particular moment in the history of my own rages that I saw the Western world conditioned by the images of Marx, Darwin and Freud; and Marx, Darwin and Freud are the three most crashing bores of the Western world.

William Golding,"What a man does defiles him, not what is done by others."
William Golding,"Among the virtues and vices that make up the British character, we have one vice, at least, that Americans ought to view with sympathy. For they appear to be the only people who share it with us. I mean our worship of the antique. I do not refer to beauty or even historical association. I refer to age, to a quantity of years."

Ken Goldstein,We've seen the trade deficit widen each of the last four years at relatively the same pace. What's going to happen because of Asian flu is it will widen twice as fast this year as it did each of the last four years.
Ken Goldstein,"Some of the department store sales don't make sense to me,"
Ken Goldstein,"Given that we're at least a couple of months away from turnaround in the labor market, the fact that consumer confidence is not doing much worse than treading water is actually a good-news story."
Ken Goldstein,"Part of the real story here is that, through July, producers were still getting more output, with fewer labor hours put in. Productivity in the third quarter is probably going to be stronger than in the second quarter, confirming the idea that, while the stock market's not in good shape, the overall economy's not that bad."
Ken Goldstein,The labor market remains on a high plateau that has prevailed in the last year and a half.
Ken Goldstein,"The labor market picture remains a bit cloudy. There are some bright spots where the job market may be picking up, but it's by no means a clear picture."
Ken Goldstein,The labor market picture remains cloudy.
Ken Goldstein,"The labor market indicators reflect a loss of economic momentum, even eliminating the impact of the storms and flooding."
Ken Goldstein,"There are a lot of factors here, but more than anything else, we haven't had a full jobs recovery, and the consumer is waiting for that. These numbers reflect they're kind of running out of patience."
Ken Goldstein,"Add this to the negative impact of the hurricanes and flooding, resulting in lost jobs and incomes, and lost output, and we could be in for slower growth through the end of the year."
Ken Goldstein,"Today's conditions are similar to those prevailing in the late 1980s, when there were also widespread reports of jobs available and no one to fill them."
Ken Goldstein,"Consumer income remains very strong and now there are bargain prices for a lot of new products that are just coming out to the market, big new computers, new DVD audio equipment,"
Ken Goldstein,"The indicators may be signaling a spurt of growth ahead, perhaps in the spring, which could be followed by a slower pace of activity later in 2006."
Ken Goldstein,The leading economic indicators suggest moderate growth into the fall.
Ken Goldstein,Essentially the story is we have got moderate growth through the first quarter. We may tick up in the second quarter and we may tick down in the third quarter. Growth is going to be a little slower second half of the year.
Ken Goldstein,The Leading Economic Index suggests that this period of slower growth will probably continue for the next few months.
Ken Goldstein,"With slower hiring, and indications that hiring might remain soft in the months ahead, the economy could struggle, setting up a self-fulfilling prophecy."
Ken Goldstein,"The coincident economic indicators have been rising moderately but steadily in recent months, suggesting the economy is sustaining a relatively moderate pace."
Ken Goldstein,"The economy is growing now, but not as fast as it did last year before the hurricanes."
Ken Goldstein,This could be a signal that the economy will continue to expand this spring before slowing later in the year.
Ken Goldstein,"The economy has been on a little bit of a seesaw, where we have had a softer fourth quarter, perhaps (a) still somewhat soft first quarter, with some improvements certainly for the second quarter."
Ken Goldstein,"The recovery in the leading index could indicate that the economy is poised for growth by late summer. There appears to be enough economic demand to end the slide in industrial production, though no strong rebound appears in sight."
Ken Goldstein,"The healthcare area is in need of a wide range of workers. There are new ads for doctors, nurses, and technicians as well as the full range of support personnel from top executives and management jobs to records clerks, secretaries, food service and general administrative support."
Ken Goldstein,Both investment and hiring intentions reflect a level of caution over both pricing and profit strategies.
Ken Goldstein,"The leading economic indicators began to lose a little momentum before the hurricanes and flooding. Domestically, business investment appeared to be headed toward a moderate pace in the third quarter."
Ken Goldstein,Iowa is the center of the advertising storm. This is where it's going on.
Ken Goldstein,"The labor market may finally be hitting bottom. While layoffs remain large, they are no longer intensifying. Job advertising volume has stopped declining, although it remains at very low levels."
Ken Goldstein,"Historically, job advertising drops off in the months of November and December. This online series does not have a long enough history to seasonally adjust the data. However, we know from The Conference Board's long running Help-Wanted Index for print ads, as well as the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics' job vacancy index (JOLTS) that businesses typically decrease their recruitment in the last two months of the year. This seasonal November decline typically reflects the Thanksgiving holiday and a slowdown in recruitments after a seasonal upturn in the late summer/early fall. Year-end budget constraints may also play a role if funds are short for paid advertisements. Nationally, the downturn in new online ad volume the week before and the week of Thanksgiving more than offset the modest increases in the other weeks in November."
Daniel Goleman,"When it comes to exploring the mind in the framework of cognitive neuroscience, the maximal yield of data comes from integrating what a person experiences - the first person - with what the measurements show - the third person."
Daniel Goleman,"When I went on to write my next book, Working With Emotional Intelligence, I wanted to make a business case that the best performers were those people strong in these skills."
Daniel Goleman,"When I say manage emotions, I only mean the really distressing, incapacitating emotions. Feeling emotions is what makes life rich. You need your passions."
Daniel Goleman,"Well, any effort to maximize your potential and ability is a good thing."
Daniel Goleman,"The other thing is that if you rely solely on medication to manage depression or anxiety, for example, you have done nothing to train the mind, so that when you come off the medication, you are just as vulnerable to a relapse as though you had never taken the medication."
Daniel Goleman,The emotional brain responds to an event more quickly than the thinking brain.
Daniel Goleman,The book is a dialogue between The Dalai Lama and a group of scientists about how we can better handle our destructive emotions and how to overcome them.
Daniel Goleman,The amygdala in the emotional center sees and hears everything that occurs to us instantaneously and is the trigger point for the fight or flight response.
Daniel Goleman,People tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they age and mature.
Daniel Goleman,"My hope was that organizations would start including this range of skills in their training programs - in other words, offer an adult education in social and emotional intelligence."
Daniel Goleman,"Motivation aside, if people get better at these life skills, everyone benefits: The brain doesn't distinguish between being a more empathic manager and a more empathic father."
Daniel Goleman,Mindful meditation has been discovered to foster the ability to inhibit those very quick emotional impulses.
Daniel Goleman,"If your emotional abilities aren't in hand, if you don't have self-awareness, if you are not able to manage your distressing emotions, if you can't have empathy and have effective relationships, then no matter how smart you are, you are not going to get very far."
Daniel Goleman,"If you do a practice and train your attention to hover in the present, then you will build the internal capacity to do that as needed - at will and voluntarily."
Daniel Goleman,"If you are doing mindfulness meditation, you are doing it with your ability to attend to the moment."
Daniel Goleman,"I think the smartest thing for people to do to manage very distressing emotions is to take a medication if it helps, but don't do only that. You also need to train your mind."
Daniel Goleman,I think that it's an extraordinary opportunity for science for the first time to learn about the positive potential of these traditions.
Daniel Goleman,"However, I began meditating at about that time and have continued on and off over the years."
Daniel Goleman,But there has also been a notable increase in recent years of these applications by a much wider slice of psychotherapists - far greater interest than ever before.
Daniel Goleman,"But once you are in that field, emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful, because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job."
Daniel Goleman,Societies can be sunk by the weight of buried ugliness.
Daniel Goleman,"I would say that IQ is the strongest predictor of which field you can get into and hold a job in, whether you can be an accountant, lawyer or nurse, for example."
Jonny Gomes,I'm just going to eat this up. This is why I work out when I work out. This is why I hit when I hit. This is why I eat what I eat. It's all for this day.
Jonny Gomes,He's a player's manager. Certain kind of eye contact from Bill can mean a thousand different words from him.
Jonny Gomes,"I thought I was going to be down for the rest of the year, ... I really did. And maybe come up for September. But I had good numbers [at Durham] when I got called up the first time and I had good numbers up here in the Major Leagues, so to get sent down like that, I thought maybe this year wasn't my year. They had plans and other things going on. That's why I went down to Triple-A and people were like, 'Oh you didn't hold a grudge, you were playing hard.' And I just thought that's where my season was going to end."

Scott Gomez,"I don't think guys know what the records are because all we know is [Stanley] Cups here. But knowing Brian and being someone who loves to pass the puck, that's always my goal, to see one of my wingers get 50 goals. That would be an awesome achievement."
Scott Gomez,"I wasn't taking advantage of the new rules. I wasn't taking the puck to the net, using my speed."
Scott Gomez,"The team's gone through a lot, but one thing about it, we knew the potential of this club and we stuck with it. The main goal is just every game we just want to improve, we want to get better. We got some guys that know what it takes to win the ultimate."
Scott Gomez,"I think the team's gone through a lot. One thing, we knew the potential of this club. We stuck with it. That's been the main goal."

Scott Gomez,"It just shows what kind of team they are. They didn't give up, they played to the end and it was great for the fans tonight. They got a great hockey game."
Scott Gomez,It was an honor to be there and I'm not going to get into that. I was just proud to be picked.
Scott Gomez,I think everyone is kind of counting us out right off the bat. They're not giving us much of a chance. Hopefully we'll go over there and shock a lot of people.
Scott Gomez,"My buddies are now complaining about my assists. It's nice to score, but we've got to win."
Scott Gomez,"You don't want to be home for Christmas, let's put it that way."
Scott Gomez,"Our line has to score. We'll take some of the blame, in fact most of it. As a line, we're getting opportunities. We need to score."
Samuel Gompers,"What does labor want? We want more schoolhouses and less jails; more books and less arsenals; more learning and less vice; more leisure and less greed; more justice and less revenge; in fact, more of the opportunities to cultivate our better natures,"
Samuel Gompers,The worst crime against working people is a company which fails to operate at a profit

Samuel Gompers,No race of barbarians ever existed yet offered up children for money.
Samuel Gompers,The man who has his millions will want everything he can lay his hands on and then raise his voice against the poor devil who wants ten cents more a day.

Samuel Gompers,"Time is the most valuable thing on earth: time to think, time to act, time to extend our fraternal relations, time to become better men, time to become better women, time to become better and more independent citizens."
Samuel Gompers,"Do I believe in arbitration? I do. But not in arbitration between the lion and the lamb, in which the lamb is in the morning found inside the lion."
Butch Goncharoff,"Liberty was the best team we've seen since Long Beach Poly. We caught them a few times, but we still have to eliminate the mental mistakes."
Butch Goncharoff,"We're a school with 1000 kids. We aren't a private school, we aren't a huge school with open enrollment. And then I see these rankings...I'm not sure how we can even be ranked."
Butch Goncharoff,It's fun. It gives our kids another sense of motivation.
Butch Goncharoff,We let the kids enjoy it for a day but then put it to bed. We'll have time to reflect on it after the season.
Butch Goncharoff,His ability to catch the ball and run after the catch will help him at the next level.
Michel Gondry,He doesn't believe he loves his relationship until he dreams it.
Michel Gondry,"I always had disturbing dreams from when I was a child. Seeing that they disturb me, I might as well make money from it."
Michel Gondry,"Childhood occupies the biggest part of your brain, so a lot of my memories subconsciously (and consciously) enter the videos I do."
Michel Gondry,"I think my imagination dictates the technologies I use. But at the same time, my imagination can be technologic. Sometimes I see a tool and I know immediately how to use it, but most of the time I use the tool for an idea I already have."
Michel Gondry,"When people are very original, sometimes they are original as a way to resist the mainstream."
Gideon Gono,"It is difficult to express the feeling of joy and relief, but also, there is a feeling of the weight of the decision, of the responsibility that lies ahead."
Gideon Gono,"If you invade a coffee, tea, cocoa, wheat or a fruit farm what you are doing is to undermine the productive capacity of this economy, therefore causing inflation,"
Gideon Gono,"We are a guilty party from a technical point of view, ... All we can do is to plead mitigatory circumstances to our arrears situation and pray that the jury will see for itself how genuine our efforts at self correction are."
Gideon Gono,"We have just one request, ... Our creditors and the international community should not take precipitous action whose effect is to negate the turnaround efforts currently under way."
Gideon Gono,This is the darkest hour before dawn and we should never underestimate monetary authorities' ability to deal with the adversity.
Adam Gontier,"We just did what we do. People think that we've changed and become somebody else, but really it seems that they've actually changed."
Adam Gontier,I think the music has evolved from what it was on the first record. The first one was sort of about things going on around us growing up in a small town. This one is sort of personal to me.
Adam Gontier,"We actually wrote the record in and out of Canada, where we live, in sort of cottage country. ... We were at a lake, around campfires, writing music."
Alberto Gonzales,"The Department of Justice is committed to using every available resource to ensure that our streets and neighborhoods are safe and that the methamphetamine problem is brought to an end,"
Alberto Gonzales,[Asked in an interview on FOX News Channel's] Fox & Friends ... I don't think you should be disqualified from being considered for an important position simply because you have a relationship with the person making the decision on who to nominate. You have to look first at a person's qualifications.
Alberto Gonzales,"As you might imagine, he's got many friends that he'll see as he travels . . . and they'll suggest that this person be nominated to the federal bench."
Alberto Gonzales,"These included violent offenders, drug dealers and gang members. This is an important step in ensuring a culture where the law is respected, where the judicial process is observed. Sentences are meaningful, and hard time is served."
Alberto Gonzales,I'm looking forward to some strong competition at the state tournament.
Alberto Gonzales,the president's critical authority to detain enemy combatants who take up arms on behalf of al Qaeda.
Alberto Gonzales,"As the court noted today, the authority to detain enemy combatants like Jose Padilla plays an important role in protecting American citizens from the very kind of savage attack that took place almost four years ago to the day,"
Alberto Gonzales,I will be the first to admit I am not perfect and I make mistakes.
Manuel Gonzales,"There was no power, it was dark, so we treated it like a night search, with flashlights,"
Manuel Gonzales,My heart is still pounding. I need a drink of water.
Manuel Gonzales,(A resident) was throwing the trash and noticed the dogs were loose. I got here and they were on the front porch. The one attacked me and the (deputy) had to put him down.
Manuel Gonzales,They're part of the community.
Adrian Gonzalez,"You don't have to worry that you're going to be taken out after you go 0-for-4, like I did Tuesday. It gives you confidence and lets your ability show a little more."
Adrian Gonzalez,"Many companies, however, do not have a clear and accurate understanding of their transportation costs, ... They're often bundled together with other costs and reported at an aggregated level, thus preventing companies from allocating transportation costs to specific products, customers, or business units."
Adrian Gonzalez,I'm not scared of it. I'm good in science. I think I'm going to do OK in it.
Adrian Gonzalez,"Chief financial officers are becoming better educated about the role and impact of logistics on financial performance, driven in part by the need to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOA). Many companies, however, do not have a clear and accurate understanding of their transportation costs. They're often bundled together with other costs and reported at an aggregated level, thus preventing companies from allocating transportation costs to specific products, customers, or business units."
Adrian Gonzalez,I went home and got a tennis ball and started tossing it against a wall in my back yard to catch the rebounds. I'd go out there every day and throw that ball against a wall until I was catching every ball that bounced back. That's how I learned.
Adrian Gonzalez,I had to put a lot of heart into it. Seeing (Kelly) also being a 'six' seed go in there and win made me think I could go in there and win. It made me give my all.
Adrian Gonzalez,I just have to get used to it. The outfield grass is different than the infield grass. I learned that. I did well for my first time. I had fun out there.
Adrian Gonzalez,We played a great game. We were all hoping for a game like this.
Adrian Gonzalez,"Friends and family have already bought 40 season tickets, and there's probably a lot more that I haven't of that are going to be there, so it'll be fun."
Adrian Gonzalez,"Order-to-delivery times are shrinking and companies are heavily outsourced, which means reliability and consistency of performance are more critical than ever. Companies are striving to meet service levels at the lowest possible cost and are turning to carrier- and vendor-performance metrics to do that."
Adrian Gonzalez,"Generally speaking, logistics services is a low-margin business and driving profitable growth is becoming increasingly difficult."
Adrian Gonzalez,The game is so quick that you can't blame things. We didn't score a run in the ninth. It's not a big deal.
Adrian Gonzalez,I played in Double-A and it was the same level of baseball. There were players who were 30 and 35 years old. They knew the game and I learned a lot.
Adrian Gonzalez,Vision and architecture are now better aligned.
Adrian Gonzalez,"If there's to be a call-to-action by Congress, from a technology standpoint, it should be focused on making sure detection technology being used overseas is up to the task. This would make global trade much more secure than blocking a business transaction here in the U.S."
Elian Gonzalez,Defend your smile and that of your loved ones
Elian Gonzalez,traitors to the revolution.
Elian Gonzalez,"We reiterate that Lazaro will not disobey the law,"
Elian Gonzalez,"It's an honor just to do this in New York, to give a voice to the Latinos who died in that tragedy that no one knows about because they were illegal aliens and, thus, undocumented. There was a story on Univision on the Spanish network about them, and that how Rick was inspired to write this piece. That I'm bringing that story to a Broadway stage is something I take real pride in."
Elian Gonzalez,We're still going to be fighting for the freedom of Cuba.

Juan Gonzalez,"The purpose of these conferences is basically economic development, and to attract new businesses while expanding old businesses,"
Juan Gonzalez,"I was just looking for a little pop pass over the middle. The quarterback was pressured, so he kind of threw behind the receiver. The ball was all wobbly, so I knew it wasn't a good pass."
Juan Gonzalez,God comes first -- we know that -- and everything else is secondary.
Juan Gonzalez,I felt like I let the team down by getting into trouble. I had to let the boys know I was still here.
Juan Gonzalez,"We think his policies are totally contrary to what we want for Latin America and are promoting genocide, domination of workers and their communities and the plundering of natural resources,"
Maria Gonzalez,"The program here is doing great. Our first dual immersion students are going into junior high school next year. When they're younger, they seem to be able to retain information faster and learn both languages simultaneously. My own daughter is in the program and she was speaking fluent Spanish by third grade."
Maria Gonzalez,"I had a very uncomfortable conversation with Turner. When I pointed out we were his constituents, he claimed we did not represent the general constituent support for this."
Maria Gonzalez,"I want to give her comfort and pay my respects -- for the pain she's going through, for the pain I went through and for the pain I am still going through."
Maria Gonzalez,"I have six children, and we live in a riverbed. If it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect of the world has in store for us."
Raul Gonzalez,"A lot of people around here don't have money to keep rolling. I mean I'm not an advocate of it, but I understand how it could happen."
Raul Gonzalez,"In truth, they are compounding the problem. A person who breaks the law will answer to duly-constituted authorities for their criminal acts, and so-called vigilantes are no exception,"
Raul Gonzalez,I hope that finishes because it has done a lot of damage to the club. I hope the word gets put aside for the benefit of all. I hope people see us from now on as sportsmen and as professionals.
Raul Gonzalez,"Tomorrow we will see a great game between two teams going all out for victory and I hope Spain will rule,"
Raul Gonzalez,"It's still subject to dialogue between (Department of Foreign Affairs) and US government. Under VFA, we basically waived custody to US except in cases of importance to our country. In which case, we must justify importance within 20 days,"
Raul Gonzalez,"A second miracle is happening in the case of Elian, ... It seems that God is guiding us."
Raul Gonzalez,A second miracle is happening in the case of Elian. It seems that God is guiding us.
Raul Gonzalez,"The House will look funny and ridiculous, to say the least, ... The people are against it."
Raul Gonzalez,None of those justices now serving (on the U.S. Supreme Court) have the breadth of trial experience that Harriet has.
Raul Gonzalez,current destabilization moves in the country.
Raul Gonzalez,"You cannot declare martial law without the support of Congress. It will be crazy for the President to declare martial law when we know that Congress does not approve of it, what with the present climate in the Senate,"
Raul Gonzalez,It's hard to cross. But it's harder to see your children have little to eat.
Raul Gonzalez,We don't have the resources to separate children from adults or build facilities. The jails get overcrowded.
Raul Gonzalez,a summary of the documents downloaded... so that the government can take the necessary action.
Tony Gonzalez,That's a picture of the girl he hooked up with the first night we went out during training camp. I'm not kidding. That's her -- almost exactly.
Tony Gonzalez,"I think (offensive coordinator) Al Saunders did a great job figuring out what didn't work,"
Tony Gonzalez,That's why he's one of the best in the league. That's why we go out there and play hard for ourselves and for him. For him to come out in those circumstances . . . That's why I love playing with him.
Tony Gonzalez,"If he ever had the chance, he'd catch 70 to 80 balls a year  easy, ... The guy catches everything. You can't cover him."
Tony Gonzalez,Adversity in life teaches you.
Ralph Goodale,the most vulnerable in society.
Ralph Goodale,"It was a meeting that reflected very well, with a lot of pride, on the accomplishments of a successful administration. What we inherited in 1993, to what we turn over now in 2006 ... we can take a lot of pride."
Ralph Goodale,"In this Year of the Veteran we are recognizing the contributions made by the women and men who have served Canada in uniform, ... It is also fitting that we recognize the contributions made on the Canadian home front, one of which was the Victory Loan Program and the purchase of Victory Bonds."
Ralph Goodale,"It was agreed among the House leaders that without putting the House through the complication of a vote, and the bells and the time and all of that ... we would just unanimously accept the deeming motion."
Ralph Goodale,"It became quite obvious that the opposition's intention was to prevent the publication of a budget in February, and therefore I felt I had an obligation to Canadians not just to provide the bare bones of statistics, but in fact to give a greater indication of how the flexibility would be used,"
Ralph Goodale,affected hundreds of thousands of ordinary Canadians who have invested in mutual funds that invest in income trusts.
Ralph Goodale,"Tomorrow, I hope we will be able to provide further and better detail,"
Ralph Goodale,"The opposition will do whatever the opposition does but this government is standing not only on its record, but its agenda on its future, and I am more than happy to take that agenda to Canadians if necessary,"
Ralph Goodale,"This is an issue that the caucus asked the government to consider,"
Ralph Goodale,"This is an issue that the caucus asked the government to consider, so we're examining that as something we may want to consider during the course of the fall."

Dwight Gooden,"if police had picked you up, we wouldn't be talking right now."
Dwight Gooden,"I figured that pitchers had a better chance of getting drafted than fielders, so I decided I should be a pitcher. But I never expected to be picked in the first round. I wasn't even sure I'd get picked at all."
Dwight Gooden,"If you can get an out on one pitch, take it. Let the strikeouts come on the outstanding pitches. Winning is the big thing. If you throw a lot of pitches, before you know it, your arm is gone."
Terry Goodkind,It allows you to say things that sound very dramatic and get away with it. If you had characters in modern fiction say the same things as they're driving down the street in an Oldsmobile they'd sound ludicrous!
Terry Goodkind,I've always said fantasy is sort of 'stealth philosophy'.
Terry Goodkind,I hate telling that story to people who've been struggling for years.
Terry Goodkind,"I had to live this long, have the experiences I've had, to create what I do. I knew I wanted to write for years, but I had to be ready so I wouldn't blow it. The move to Maine was the final step."
Terry Goodkind,I felt like I'd been misplaced in the cosmos and I belonged in Maine.
Terry Goodkind,I don't think I could have written what I did any earlier.
Terry Goodkind,"After the book took off, I bought a whole new wardrobe."
Terry Goodkind,"After that, I came back every year. Everyone said, 'Well, when you retire you can move there.' But I said, 'Why should I live my whole life where I don't want to be.'"
Andrew Goodman,Whoever moves into a community has a vested interest in it.
Andrew Goodman,A people must have dignity and identity.
Andrew Goodman,"The road to freedom must be uphill, even if it is arduous and frustrating."
Ellen Goodman,"I regard this novel as a work without redeeming social value, unless it can be recycled as a cardboard box"
Ellen Goodman,Once upon a time we were just plain people. But that was before we began having relationships with mechanical systems. Get involved with a machine and sooner or later you are reduced to a factor.
Ellen Goodman,"How did we end the summer ... stuck between a Roberts and a hard place? We've spent months poring over 60,000 pages from the National Archives and reams of personal profiles for clues about how John Roberts would rule on the highest court in land. ... The bottom line is that barring some last minute photo of John Roberts popping out of a cake at a KKK rally smoking crack, he's going to be confirmed. And if he were magically derailed, who would be next? ... John Roberts may turn out to be as far right as People for the American Way says. But he may also be as good as it gets under this administration."
Ellen Goodman,some people hate the president so much that it's impossible to have a conversation with them.
Ellen Goodman,We owned what we learned back there; the experience and the growth are grafted into our lives.
Ellen Goodman,"Traditions are the guideposts driven deep in our subconscious minds. The most powerful ones are those we can't even describe, aren't even aware of."
Ellen Goodman,"There's a trick to the Graceful Exit. It begins with the vision to recognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over - and to let go. It means leaving what's over without denying its value."
Ellen Goodman,"In journalism, there has always been a tension between getting it first and getting it right."
Ellen Goodman,"I regard this novel as a work without redeeming social value, unless it can be recycled as a cardboard box."
Ellen Goodman,"When we describe what the other person is really like, I suppose we often picture what we want. We look through the prism of our need."
Ellen Goodman,The things we hate about ourselves aren't more real than things we like about ourselves.
Ellen Goodman,"You can fire your secretary, divorce your spouse, abandon your children. But they remain your co-authors forever."
Ellen Goodman,Most people do not consider dawn to be an attractive experience - unless they are still up.
Ellen Goodman,Values are not trendy items that are casually traded in.
Ellen Goodman,"Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work, driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for, in order to get to a job that you need so you can pay for the clothes, car and the house that you leave empty all day in order to afford to live in it."
Ellen Goodman,We criticize mothers for closeness. We criticize fathers for distance. How many of us have expected less from our fathers and appreciated what they gave us more? How many of us always let them off the hook?
Mark Goodman,Stay off the roads. Stay away from water. (There) could be live power lines.
Mark Goodman,"It would be projected to be at a certain place at a certain time, and then Mother Nature would stop it. It messed up our timing."
Mark Goodman,We're not looking at any hurricane force winds (winds above 75 mph) in Onslow County.
Mark Goodman,"If any compromise occurred, it appears to be limited to the Sam's Club fuel station point-of-sale system."
Mark Goodman,"With all due respect, community college instructors teach the book. We write the book."
Mark Goodman,"The appeals court decision last year turned on its head the traditional belief that a university is a 'marketplace of ideas' where speech from all sides is not only tolerated, but encouraged. We hoped that the Supreme Court would step in to reaffirm that important principle."
Mark Goodman,Our buildings have not had regular maintenance since about 2000. Some of the needs are beginning to really pile up.
Mark Goodman,"I've known Karen for 20 years, and if she believes this action was taken in an effort to limit her defense of a free student press, I'm inclined to believe her."
James Goodwin,"Although booking patterns remained strong through early August despite poor operating performance, booking levels have since fallen on the adverse publicity surrounding the cancellations that occurred in early August. While our operating performance has improved somewhat, the reduced booking levels continue, and as a result, revenues are not as strong as we had previously anticipated."
James Goodwin,"Although booking patterns remained strong through early August despite poor operating performance, booking levels have since fallen on the adverse publicity surrounding the cancellations that occurred in early August,"
James Goodwin,"While our cost performance remains in line with the projections we announced in April; our significantly higher fuel and labor costs this year, combined with the worsening revenue environment, lead us to expect an even greater year-over-year earnings decline for the second quarter, which was a strong period for us financially last year,"
James Goodwin,We believe domestic competition will be enhanced and consumer choice and convenience will be improved.
James Goodwin,"The softening of the U.S. economy has had an industry-wide effect on business travel demand, ... While our 2001 business plan assumed a challenging financial environment, the economic situation has deteriorated more than expected."
James Goodwin,"While we are pleased that we were able to reach a tentative pilot contract, the financial implications of the agreement, coupled with the higher price of jet fuel, will further impact our results. Therefore, we expect to post a loss in the third quarter and probably in the fourth quarter as well."
James Goodwin,The addition of US Airways will greatly improve United's ability to serve customers in the East and to open its worldwide network to them.
John Goodwin,What that tells me is that Sonoma County was much less affected than the rest of the Bay Area by the decline in the high-tech industry.

Mikhail Gorbachev,"Reagan was a statesman who, despite all disagreements that existed between our countries at the time, displayed foresight and determination to meet our proposals halfway and change our relations for the better, stop the nuclear race, start scrapping nuclear weapons, and arrange normal relations between our countries."
Mikhail Gorbachev,"Taking into consideration Lenin's will and wishes of his family, we must bury his body according to all principles of human morality, although we should find an appropriate time for it."

Mikhail Gorbachev,Democracy is the wholesome and pure air without which a socialist public organization cannot live a full-blooded life.
Mikhail Gorbachev,"America must be the teacher of democracy, not the advertiser of the consumer society. It is unrealistic for the rest of the world to reach the American living standard."
Mikhail Gorbachev,"America has a right to be a leader, ... this leadership should be realized through partnership, not domination."
Jeff Gordon,"At Talladega, you worry about the big one that takes out 17 cars. Here, you worry about the 17 little ones that take out several cars. You're always racing with people around you so you don't have anywhere to go when things go wrong. And believe me, a lot of things go wrong."
Jeff Gordon,I think there's plenty of young talent out there. It's just whether or not somebody wants to give them the chance. That's the bottom line.
Jeff Gordon,"It was a very rewarding race and gratifying. I could get up to third or fourth but couldn't make those passes to get the rest of the way. Once we did get up front, the car was flying. To be able to drive from 15th all the way to third or fourth, I knew we had a good one. Once we got out front, we were awesome. I knew we were in great shape."
Jeff Gordon,"We know that after Richmond (the 26th race) comes, we've got to be in the top-10 and when we are, we'd better be set on 'kill' to go out there and lead laps and win races."
Jeff Gordon,It's not that we should win a championship every year. But we certainly should be contending for race wins -- and on a fairly consistent basis -- and we should be up and battling in that championship in some way throughout the year.
Jeff Gordon,"I thought there was no way Jimmie could win the race, or I wouldn't have left. All of a sudden I hear he wins, and I go, 'You've got to be kidding me?' That was just a phenomenal win."
Jeff Gordon,"[NASCAR, 7:30 p.m. Saturday on TNT: The final race to determine Nextel Cup's Chase for the Championship participants should be one of the biggest of the season, with Jeff Gordon's status the main story line. Will he or won't he? Analyst Bill Weber says watch out if he does:] He's played mediocre ball at best all season, but he's still got a chance to make the playoffs. And if he gets in the question is: ... No, I do not.'"
Jeff Gordon,"He just continues to impress me. I feel like he won us the race last week. This week we had a car that got better all day long, and that's as impressive to me as our win at Martinsville."
Jeff Gordon,"We're probably turning as much rpm out there as anybody -- more power than most and as much as a couple teams out there -- and so we're going to eat up more fuel mileage. The thing that definitely raises an eyebrow to me is that the No. 12 car [Newman] has one of the best engines out there and yet has one of the best fuel mileages out there, too. I don't know how that happens."
Jeff Gordon,"We're probably turning as much rpm out there as anybody -- more power than most and as much as a couple teams out there -- and so we're going to eat up more fuel mileage, ... The thing that definitely raises an eyebrow to me is that the No. 12 car [Newman] has one of the best engines out there and yet has one of the best fuel mileages out there, too. I don't know how that happens."
Jeff Gordon,"It's not there yet, but it has the potential."
Jeff Gordon,"While it's still early to tell, 2005 could very well be the vintage of the decade for Washington state. Mother Nature was definitely on our side this year, delivering one of the warmest summers we've had in recent years, cool and constant fall weather and a frost-free harvest. This allowed the fruit to hang on the vine longer and enhance flavor development."
Jeff Gordon,"I'm hoping we can put something together. We've got to get some course management. We've got three weeks until district. If we going to have any chance at state, we've got to beat Newport."
Jeff Gordon,"We're still not where we need to be on these types of tracks, but it's a learning process. We're learning from everything we're trying with the cars -- whether it works or not. Not every adjustment we make will work, but it gives us more data to make better decisions."
Jeff Gordon,"I don't know how many hundredths of a second we are missing it by, but I'm just really happy now."
Jeff Gordon,It's amazing how EA continues to innovate and make the game more fun for gamers and the drivers year after year.
Jeff Gordon,It's still a game of Russian Roulette. There are so many cars fighting for the same piece of real estate that it's easy to get caught up in someone else's accident.
Jeff Gordon,"I think it's an evil. There are ways to pass without it. It just takes a little bit longer. I've never been for it, but I've got to be a part of it. I don't have a choice. I want to win."
Jeff Gordon,"Years like that make you hungrier, make you humble. The criticism has come a little bit stronger, come more often. I understand why. We've won four championships, a lot of races. We've prided ourselves on being competitive every year. When we're not, we recognize as well as everybody we're having an off year."
Jeff Gordon,"I could just tell that the car had that feel, it had that comfort to me. I had a car underneath me where I felt I could get aggressive with it."
Jeff Gordon,"As far as Katrina goes, I haven't seen the impact (on coffee prices yet),"
Jeff Gordon,We didn't need the last caution. It jumped sideways on me. I was doing everything I could at that point not to wreck.
Jeff Gordon,We needed a long run. We didn't need that last caution. That last caution hurt us a bit.
Jeff Gordon,"We made a lot of changes and then changed some cars, changed some different things. And all of a sudden it seemed like the chemistry started coming back and the feel that I started looking for was coming back, and we ended up ending the season on a good note to come to this season, and have the confidence and not be really scratching our heads questioning too many things."
Jeff Gordon,"I don't know how you can just pick one guy, there's strong cars out here. I felt like (Sadler) was really strong in that first race. I know that Tony and Junior and Jimmie and those guys who weren't in our race are going to be strong."
Jeff Gordon,"I am going to take part blame for that, (and) I think Tony should take part of it, as well. We went into turns one and two and had been real tight. We slid up the race track, left the middle wide open. I thought that I could clear him and just about the time he got to my right rear, my car just took off pushing. It was an unfortunate incident that hurt us both a lot."
Jeff Gordon,I am going to take part blame for that. I think Tony should take part of it as well. ... I think it could have been avoided by both of us. It was an unfortunate incident that hurt us both a lot.
Jeff Gordon,"That is what happened to us, I think. At the beginning of the year we went more toward them. ... But I've been telling them all year that I can't drive it like that. You put the same thing underneath me (that Johnson had), and I don't like it."
Jeff Gordon,You've got to be the best person you can be in your life.
Jeff Gordon,"You may be leading, then you might be at the back of the pack trying to work your way up. It's just a constant reminder not to give up, and to know that God, in my mind, is really in control."
Jeff Gordon,"When you're in a race car, you're going through so many different emotions throughout that race."
Jeff Gordon,I'll do a little prayer here and there if I feel the need to.
Jeff Gordon,I still think we have a great shot at this championship.
Jeff Gordon,I want to force the other drivers to find a way past me.
Jeff Gordon,I don't feel I'm a step above anyone on this team. I'm just another link in the chain.
Jeff Gordon,Starting up front here is definitely an advantage. It allows you to be patient in dealing with the traffic. And traffic is something you can't get away from here. It always seems like there are 42 cars right behind you and another 42 cars right in front of you.
Jeff Gordon,"You're still going to see accidents, you always will. Especially towards the closing laps of a race."
Jeff Gordon,So much of my life is spent just focused on driving race cars.
Ken Gordon,"The best [option] is to go with Lara, whose experience and knowledge is unquestioned."
Ken Gordon,We held separate discussions with Brian and we believe it is in the best interest of West Indies cricket for him to return to the job.
Ken Gordon,"Every day, they will be under the control of the coach. He may want them to play in a territorial match. He may want them in a classroom. Everyone on a retainer will be under year-long development program, the same as with all international teams."

Michael Gordon,But it gives the law a little more bite.
Michael Gordon,"This was meant to be kind of a signal to the international community that 'It's OK, come on in,' but the problem was, it was premature. It wasn't OK, and they didn't come in."
Michael Gordon,We have to bus children out of the downtown because of the burgeoning numbers of school-age children. It's happening more quickly than we expected.
Michael Gordon,"The charge that the department has divulged information to foreign governments or encouraged foreign governments to take legal action is completely false,"
Rich Gordon,He was doing dry-land exercises. He was doing the medicine ball hiking and he wrenched his back.
Rich Gordon,"With this rapid rise in jobs and not enough housing, housing prices are skyrocketing, folks are commuting long distances to get to these jobs ... those are the challenges that we face in the midst of this economy."
Rich Gordon,It's been nail-biters on the girls' side. It's going to be another nail-biter.
Rich Gordon,"If anything, he's making better decisions and is not so focused on who hits it the farthest."
Ruth Gordon,"To get it right, be born with luck or else make it. Never give up. Get the knack of getting people to help you and also pitch in yourself. A little money helps, but what really gets it right is to never -- I repeat -- never under any conditions face the facts."
Ruth Gordon,In our family we don't divorce men - we bury them
Ruth Gordon,Courage is like a muscle strenghthened by its use.
Ruth Gordon,Discussing how old you are is the temple of boredom.
Tipper Gore,This is a national tragedy and a public health problem demanding national leadership.
Tipper Gore,"She became a feminist at 11. When I say feminist, I'm talking about equality and awareness of perceptions of roles."
Tipper Gore,"We use tools such as email, not just as a way to keep in daily touch with family members who live in other cities, but also as a way to keep in touch with staff and members of the public."
Tipper Gore,"These are all voluntary resources which help parents sort out the choices without infringing on the artists' rights to free speech, which is something that we respect."

Tipper Gore,"Past conference topics have included strengthening the role of fathers in children's lives, the impact of the media culture on children, the delicate balance between work and family, and family involvement in education."
Tipper Gore,Our families today come in many shapes and sizes and we need to look more often at ways to create networks of support in a variety of areas.
Tipper Gore,"Just this week, my husband proposed a plan for schools and libraries to develop their own plans to keep children from finding indecent material on the Internet as an alternative to a Congressional proposal that would require a federally mandated solution."
Tipper Gore,It was an idea we had when Al was in the Senate - to organize and moderate an annual conference that would look at government policy through the lens of the family to help identify ways that the family can be supported and strengthened.
Tipper Gore,I've always been an advocate of giving parents the right tools to help them be a part of their child's decisions with regard to entertainment.
Tipper Gore,I have long recognized a link between fitness and mental health and I think we need to encourage young people to take part in sports and team activities because we know it has such positive results.
Tipper Gore,Explicit material is available in a variety of forums - from popular music to television to the Internet.
Tipper Gore,"As an avid photographer, I also took advantage of the latest technology in photography - digital photography - to post photos on my website on a daily basis."

Tipper Gore,You're talking to someone who really understands rock music.

John Gorman,"We want everybody to be satisfied, ... We are more than willing to participate in resolving any problems that need to be resolved."
John Gorman,"All we had was the delayed outcry of an 8-year-old boy. We told the police to continue investigating. If police thought this was such a great case, they could have pressed charges on their own."
John Gorman,"We never pinned our hopes on the legislative process. It's a difficult process. It's fraught with many land mines as you go through. We've hit a couple, but it doesn't mean we won't see a good bill."
John Gorman,John Edwards has been an ASA since 1998 and most recently has been working in the Juvenile Justice Bureau. This is considered a very serious charge. He has been suspended and the case turned over to the Illinois attorney general's office.
John Gorman,"We've played good football but it just amazes me that other teams don't really come to win but they get results,"
John Gorman,This case was brought in good faith based on the evidence we had of a young girl being assaulted. We have no second thoughts about bringing this case.

Michael Gorman,"It's a perpetual problem, and it attacks fundamental American liberties -- the attempt to impose one's own positions on society as a whole."
Michael Gorman,"What displaced people desperately need it is knowledge and information, and that's what public libraries do."
Michael Gorman,That kind of local information is unique. So putting it online and making it available to the public -- it's invaluable.
Michael Gorman,"The history of electronic technology has been that once a new capability emerges, someone finds ways to go around ... protections - in this case potentially avoiding payment to authors. I can't believe that, if [Google] were to go ahead with this, that someone, somewhere wouldn't find a way to illegally exploit it."
Michael Gorman,We are troubled by what seems to be an accelerating trend in increased restrictions on access to government information.
Michael Gorman,"[ALA officials said they are battling these efforts as contrary to the nation's tradition of intellectual freedom.] It all comes down to the imposition of your views on other people, ... To be honest, it seems to me to be downright un-American."
Michael Gorman,"If you're a freedom-to-read person, pulling a book like that one is not that different from any book that might have fake scholarship. No matter how wrong a book might be, people should have access to it. It's a slippery slope once you start removing books like that."
Michael Gorman,"I feel that this is a potential disaster on several levels. They are reducing scholarly texts to paragraphs. The point of a scholarly text is they are written to be read sequentially from beginning to end, making an argument and engaging you in dialogue."
Michael Gorman,There is a failure in the core values of education. They're told to go to college in order to get a better job -- and that's okay. But the real task is to produce educated people.
Michael Gorman,It's appalling -- it's really astounding. Only 31 percent of college graduates can read a complex book and extrapolate from it. That's not saying much for the remainder.
Michael Gorman,"We believe in parental responsibility, and that you should take care of what your children are reading. But it's not your responsibility to tell a whole class of kids what they should read."

James Gosling,"All of us who attended the meeting -- including Microsoft -- unanimously agreed that unilaterally extending the Java programming language would hurt compatibility among Java tools and programs, would injure other tools vendors, and would damage customers' ability to run a Java-based software product on whatever platform they wished,"
James Gosling,"People think of security as a noun, something you go buy. In reality, it's an abstract concept like happiness. Openness is unbelievably helpful to security."
Mark Gottfried,Richard Hendrix was terrific today. He was a real presence. We did a good job of getting the ball inside and rebounding the ball. Richard especially.
Mark Gottfried,"I wasn't trying to get a foul. I don't know that I was worried that I did or not. I felt like if I got one, it might not always be a negative thing at that point. I was just a little frustrated at some calls."
Mark Gottfried,"They made every shot they needed to even if the shot clock was running down, hitting tough ones. They really played about a flawless game from my perspective."
Mark Gottfried,You're not allowed to be tired. That's against the rules. That's not an option. They know what happened at Arkansas. They know what happened against Kentucky. They just didn't want that to happen anymore.
Mark Gottfried,"We thought with his (Felix's) size, he might be a little tougher to shoot over. He took some pride in that today, and he should. He's a really good defender."
Mark Gottfried,"Mississippi State played about a flawless game, from my perspective."
Mark Gottfried,We're not good enough to look past anybody or have letdowns. Every team we play can absolutely put it on us when we're not playing well or at a high level.
Mark Gottfried,"As a graduate assistant just starting, I get the opportunity to know John Wooden. I mean, are you kidding me? How great an opportunity that was."
Mark Gottfried,"We wanted to take advantage of an opportunity if it was there. We didn't want to just make the game an absolute helter-skelter, run-up-and- down. But we didn't want to turn opportunities down either. And we had a bunch of them."
Mark Gottfried,"As soon as I heard about it, I thought, 'I'm going no matter when it is,' ... It's a tremendous opportunity for us to show our troops how much we appreciate what they're doing."
Mark Gottfried,"He was very successful at the smaller level, and when he had the opportunity to coach at this level I knew he would do well."
Mark Gottfried,I wanted to play Felix but didn't have an opportunity. I didn't feel the time was right.
Mark Gottfried,"Sometimes the game comes out to one shot, and I know he'll be thinking about that shot all night long. It's just part of the game."
Mark Gottfried,"The fact we don't play on the first night of the tournament is big. That was important for us for a number of reasons. No. 1, it gives you another day or rest. No. 2, it's one more feather in your cap as far as how you're perceived by the (NCAA) selection committee."
Mark Gottfried,"When they went to the man, our guys really lit up."
Mark Gottfried,"He's the man of steel, no question. He's our version of Lou Gehrig. He's the iron man; he never comes out."
Mark Gottfried,"There's no magic wand you can wave over your team. I know the one response you cannot have is to get down and get disappointed. I don't think our team will do that. Injuries are part of the game. When I was in Kuwait coaching, there was a sign that said 'Adapt and overcome.' That's what we are going to have to do."
Mark Gottfried,You'd like to put some magic potion on your team and have them play like that every game.
Mark Gottfried,He's obviously had to carry more of the load when (senior forward) Chuck Davis got hurt. He knows he has to play at a high level for us to have a chance.
Mark Gottfried,"(He) has come out of nowhere. I mean my goodness, I don't think there's a whole lot of freshmen in America doing what he's doing. He has been terrific."
Mark Gottfried,"We're going to win, 100 percent. We've got a lot of work left to do to reach our goals. We're not going to take our foot off the gas pedal at all."
Mark Gottfried,"His last two games he was 2-for-15 from the field. He really concentrated on his shooting. For us to be good you can't take the shots away from him. He got loose against the zone and made a couple of shots, he got off to a real good start and I thought that was the key."
Mark Gottfried,"The last four games, Darrel Mitchell has averaged about 26 or 27 points a game (actually 24.5), and we felt like against a zone he would find too many holes and get loose. We went to the zone once in the first half and he buried a 3 on us. I just felt like with Darrel Mitchell, right now, at the level he's been playing, we just needed to be body to body with him for 40 minutes."
Mark Gottfried,"I think the carryover is that the pickup games, when we're not present, are better. They're talking about principles defensively."
Mark Gottfried,"Whether we play Winthrop or Louisiana Tech or (future opponents) Temple or (North Carolina) State, the players realize we schedule very, very good basketball teams and we've got to play at a high level every night."
Mark Gottfried,The fun thing about our team right now is I think each guy is making key contributions at key times. You can go through everybody on our roster. They're all making key plays. That's all you can ask of them.
Mark Gottfried,I thought the game was over. I'm a complete idiot. I was jumping up and down like a fool out there. I thought Gee's basket won the game for us.
Mark Gottfried,"Alonzo gave us great energy, a great lift off the bench and hit some big shots. Sometimes on senior nights, it's somebody else who emerges, and tonight it was Alonzo."
Mark Gottfried,"In the time outs, there was a ton of determination in those guys. That comes from being burned once or twice."
Mark Gottfried,"The difference tonight, I thought, was the defense in the first 15 minutes of the second half."
Mark Gottfried,The difference tonight was the defense in the first 15 minutes of the second half. I thought Auburn kept us off balance in the first half with the 1-3-1 zone. We weren't taking good shots. We didn't do a good job getting the ball around the basket. We didn't do a lot of things well.
Mark Gottfried,"Really in the last two, three or four years we've been as aggressive as anybody in the country with our non-conference schedule. I hope that doesn't hurt us. I hope that all of a sudden that's not used against you, because we could have played three easier teams in December and we'd be 20-9 and everyone will be celebrating."
Mark Gottfried,LSU is one of the better teams in the country. Their front line is tremendous.
Mark Gottfried,I would not do anything different at the end. I have all the confidence in the world in Ron Steele.
Mark Gottfried,"I think it gave him some confidence and he got to see where he stacked up. He had a great year this year, and he's improved every year he's been here."
Mark Gottfried,I wouldn't do anything different at the end of the game. Absolutely. I've got as much confidence in Ron Steele as anybody in the nation.
Mark Gottfried,"As a coach, sometimes that's a difficult thing to do."
Mark Gottfried,"We're disappointed, but I couldn't be more prouder of a basketball team than I am right now."
Mark Gottfried,We're a team that needs to avoid foul trouble. It hurt our ability to score. That was a big factor.
John Gotti,"I think the brand mark would be sincerity,"

John Gotti,"If you look it up on the Internet, it is cancer, ... They refer to it as noninvasive cancer."
John Gotti,Always be nice to bankers. Always be nice to pension fund managers. Always be nice to the media. In that order.
Scott Gottlieb,"We must do more than ever to monitor the performance of (device) products after they are approved, and make sure that we are quickly discovering and sharing information about problems that do arise."
Scott Gottlieb,We are going to initiate a public process for trying to gather information for what additional guidelines we could issue to make sure that these ads are providing truthful and non-misleading information.
Scott Gottlieb,"When you are speaking to consumers, [15-second spots] don't provide any opportunity to give information on disease awareness."
Scott Gottlieb,This approval is another example of our agency's endeavor to counter rising healthcare costs by approving safe and effective generic alternatives as soon as the law permits.
John Gould,Our observations over the past decade indicate that lower market volatility tends to be associated with a lower number of filings.
John Gould,That's going to be hopefully a big money producer.
John Gould,"I don't read anything anymore. I don't have the eyesight. I read my own copy, that's all. I think I've read everything that's worth reading."
John Gould,Our great American writers were all newspaper people.
John Gould,At the time the world was all upside down. The American people were beginning to move around a lot. The old hometown ties had been pretty much broken. The theme of Farmer Takes a Wife appealed to people. Everybody was homesick. And it sold and sold and sold.
John Gould,"If you don't fix latent failures in your system, you're asking for trouble."
John Gould,A lecture is an occasion when you numb one end to benefit the other
Michael Gould,"If Endnotes was adopted university-wide, CSU could turn out the most competent secondary research students in the world. It will increase student and faculty research capacity and productivity because it is flexible and saves time by integrating programs."
Michael Gould,"We have been a district that looks to technology as a tool to facilitate learning and teaching. In this case, DIBELS may save our teachers time with regards to scoring and record-keeping, thereby allowing them to spend more time focusing on instruction."

Mark Grace,"I can see with a 2-0 game, they were trying to win and keep first place, just like we are, ... In that respect, it was a good play. But I can tell you this much: I don't have the guts to do it."
Mark Grace,"I was impressed with the overall level of talent. But look, the bottom line is we've got a great bunch of guys at the camp that want to have fun and learn. We're going to make sure they have lots of fun, I can guarantee you that."
Mark Grace,"He's a power pitcher, ... with finesse."
Mark Grace,It's gonna happen. And I'd love to see it.
Mark Grace,"I was having a private conversation with (engineers in) the truck, like we do everyday, and evidently some words that aren't air-able came out and through a technical difficulty, I may have offended some people. If that's the case, I apologize and I will face any consequences."

Robert Grant,"For us to get Independence up and running again, we need to inject the community with an infusion of cash. We're trying to raise $250,000 and 100% of it will go to helping families in the area and rebuilding the community. We're asking the people of Connecticut, especially from Waterbury where we've made our home since 1812, to help Independence become independent again."

In the same way that there were plenty saying last summer that they did not want to be in the side that loses the Ashes, there'll be more wanting to be in the team that regains them. We are under no illusion about how determined Australia will be."
Adam Graves,I think guys gained strength from his will.
Adam Graves,How long do you have from the warm-up to the end of the game? Three hours? That's probably not enough time to pay tribute to what he's meant to the organization. That's why there will be a day he will join Mike and Mark and Rod and Ed.
Adam Graves,He came here and made us believe winning the Cup was our destiny.
Adam Graves,He made us believe that the Stanley Cup was our destiny.

Wavy Gravy,I am in total ecstasy with where my life is now.
Wavy Gravy,"I always say, dare to struggle, dare to grin."
Aaron Gray,This is a typical Big East game. Even this game came right down to the last shot. The guys did a good job fighting back. It's going to be like this day-in and day-out. There's no gimme wins in this conference.
Aaron Gray,It's been a pleasure playing against you.
Aaron Gray,The mental mindset is great because of our strong performance in the Big East tournament. A lot of positive things came out of it.
Aaron Gray,"All the great people learn from the people before them. Chris took one approach and did things the way he wanted to do it. Carl took a completely different approach and did the things the way he wanted to do it. I'm not saying either way is right or wrong, just a different approach."
Aaron Gray,"Other teams are keying in on him, setting whole defensive strategies around him. That's presenting opportunities for other people to step up. It's amazing. It seems like every game, it's someone different."
Aaron Gray,We got a lot of people out on their shooters and didn't give them many open looks. We think we're a good man-to-man team and we can be physical.
Aaron Gray,"Carl does so many things that people don't realize. He only scored eight points, and he was probably the happiest guy in the locker room. Obviously, he doesn't have a problem with it."
Aaron Gray,"He does a great job of getting people to play their best. One of the reasons we are such a good team is that every day in practice is like a game to us. Everything we do is competitive, and everything we do we want to win, no matter what the drill is. He knows you have to coach everyone differently."
Aaron Gray,"There are so many emotional highs and lows. You play really well one night, and the next night, you don't play well at all."
Aaron Gray,That was a tough game. We played real hard. The shots just weren't falling tonight. It just wasn't our night.
Aaron Gray,"No matter how much money the NBA offers, that amount won't be able to buy back my senior year at Pitt."
Aaron Gray,"The coaches just told me to be patient. I get real anxious when I see teams are playing me man-to-man. Early on, I had a lot of bad turnovers. I think that goes to the fact that we hadn't played in eight days."
Aaron Gray,"This team, we're winners. We hate to lose. We don't know how to lose. We have 13 guys who are willing to do whatever it takes to win."
Aaron Gray,We didn't do anything special to prepare for the game or do anything differently. We put in hard work and prepared for this game just like any other.
Aaron Gray,One of our goals is to get a bye in the first round of the Big East Tournament.
Aaron Gray,Lacrosse is fast paced and I like fast paced games. It's demanding physically and has the hardest conditioning of any sport. You are always running if you are not sprinting. It's constant movement.
Aaron Gray,"They got me tired, but I had to push through it. There are points in the game where my teammates feed off me. I have to make sure I get back on defense, and just get in position where I can make plays."
Aaron Gray,"Everyone got their feelings out. We accomplished a lot just by being able to talk to each other. Now, we're getting ready to go in not only physically prepared, but mentally prepared."
Aaron Gray,"In discussing my options the last couple of weeks with my family and Coach Dixon, I feel that it is in my best interest to declare for the NBA Draft. I will not hire an agent, leaving me the option to return to the University of Pittsburgh for my senior season. The draft process will provide me a great learning experience and will help me become a better player."
Aaron Gray,"The draft process will provide me a great learning experience and will help me become a better player. Academically, I am well on my way to graduating and earning a degree and that is a priority for me."
Aaron Gray,"Maybe it was a lack of our defense. They got a lot of wide-open looks and they missed a lot of wide-open looks, too."
Aaron Gray,"From the tape, I knew I would have to play good defense and avoid foul trouble. That allowed me to make some plays, and I was just able to come out and have a really good performance."
Aaron Gray,They definitely wanted to control it a little more. It was a little weird that our three top players had two fouls in the first half and they didn't have any of their top players in foul trouble.
Aaron Gray,"We definitely feel like we control our own destiny, but at the same time, we don't feel there are any easy games that we have left. We still have a lot of good teams left to play, but we definitely feel like we're good enough to get through it."
Aaron Gray,We're steps ahead of last year. We're playing more like a team. We have confidence in each other.
Aaron Gray,"That's when I play my best, against the best competition. Sometimes my problem is playing against guys who don't have much of a post presence. It will be a great challenge. I'm looking forward to it."
Aaron Gray,"They've got some big boys that are very good. They were sending two or three guys at me, which was getting frustrating, so I knew I had to get offensive rebounds. The few times I was open for a split second, my teammates did a great job of getting me the ball."
Aaron Gray,"I couldn't believe when he hit that last 3-pointer from about 15 feet beyond the line, but what can you do? He was unbelievable."
Aaron Gray,"We joke with him about his age a lot, but it's no joke that he's our No. 1 leader on and off the court with his experience and wisdom. I don't believe we'd be in the position we are without him."
Aaron Gray,It's a great achievement. It's a great compliment to my team. I couldn't have done it without them. The support the coaches and my teammates gave me is probably the biggest reason this happened.
Bill Gray,A lot of what appears to be progress is just so much technological rococo.
Bill Gray,"That's going to hurt us, ... He was a quality individual with an excellent work ethic. We're thin at running back, but hopefully this is a chance for someone to step up."
Bill Gray,"All three phases, except punting, hurt us on Thursday, ... If you go and get a field goal blocked and miss and extra point, that takes points off the board. Plus we gave up a lot of yards on kick returns and we weren't really consistent on kickoffs. So really we need to improve in all three phases."
Bill Gray,"The last three years we've played a I-A game, we've come back improved and stayed healthy and played a good game."
Bill Gray,"We have a defined clientele. The kids come to us. We have to take them and make them into football players. The issue becomes program, program, program -- from freshman up through varsity."
Bill Gray,"I know they (Baylor) are expecting a good crowd, ... They have a lot of enthusiasm on their team right now. They finished strong last year, and won their opener on the road, so I am sure we will have a great atmosphere on Saturday to play in."
Bill Gray,"Any large project is built because everything just happens to line up _ the need, the economics. If this became a priority with the state, with the federal government, with the local folks, it certainly could be built."
Bill Gray,"Why did we sign up? Because it's a business, and if you expect to go anywhere in this life, you've got to take a chance now and then."
David Gray,Life in Slow Motion
David Gray,"I don't want to be saying we nearly won again, because the margin of defeat does not matter,"
David Gray,"It's not my song any more. It's very much the audience's song, so if I'm feeling generous I'll wheel it out one night."
Jim Gray,"There is the question of safety in doing some of those other things. We have done a few things like that in the past. There have been some team challenges to do things. There's the famous guy running across Lake George, this is like 20 below, running across Lake George with nothing but a jockstrap. That's been done, but as far as the competition it's question based."
Jim Gray,We need to enforce the laws that are existing. But I am acknowledging the big influence workers have on our economy.
Jim Gray,"I don't want to lose the property rights I have in the county. We have horses and we shoot out here. We didn't necessarily buy the land because it is in the county, but it does have more benefits."
Jim Gray,"is a man of very high integrity, high conscience, a strong work ethic and a pragmatic guy."
Jim Gray,"In December 2004, the Osage Nation of Oklahoma won its battle in Congress to determine our own laws and citizenship, ... It was the end of a long road to independence for our tribe, but the beginning of what we feel is most precious: our sovereignty. I am often asked if gaming has taken over the national debate on Indians in America. But gaming is an extension of our sovereignty, not the other way around and we cannot allow others to frame our issues for us. As Indian people, sovereignty comes first."

Macy Gray,"I definitely wanted to have a good time listening to this album. If you listen to Bob Marley records, you just sit back and party to them. I wanted this record to be like (that): You chill out, no matter what."
Macy Gray,"All kids are goofy. But I was extra goofy. Really tall, big feet, big ears. And I had a funny voice. When you're growing up, it's all about fitting in. I just wanted to have friends, so I didn't talk much."
Macy Gray,"This album is about freedom and working hard and having an open mind,"
Macy Gray,"It's great that they're being evacuated out of the disaster, but now they need places to go and live. Definitely can't stay out here much longer like this."
Macy Gray,"You don't have to be a rock star - if you don't like the situation you're in, you don't have to settle for it."
Macy Gray,"Whatever your image is, it's probably not you, but it affords you the freedom to live up to it."
Macy Gray,"The main part of the house is a deep red and I have butterscotch carpet. And I have a bathroom with leopard skin floor, wallpaper and toilet."
Macy Gray,I've never met anyone that is their image.

Macy Gray,I write in the studio.
Macy Gray,Being God would be the ultimate.
Macy Gray,Becoming famous and selling a lot of records doesn't change a thing.
Spalding Gray,"[NEW YORK (CNN) -- In his monologue] Swimming to Cambodia, ... Thailand, the Pure Land."
Spalding Gray,"The fact that New York continues in the face of all of the chaos, of the crime, of the madness, you just think that it would just pop and vanish, just explode."
Spalding Gray,"everything is contingent, and there is also chaos"
Spalding Gray,I knew I couldn't live in America and I wasn't ready to move to Europe so I moved to an island off the coast of America - New York City .
Spalding Gray,"I fantasize about going back to high school with the knowledge I have now. I would shine. I would have a good time, I would have a girlfriend. I think that's where a lot of my pain comes from. I think I never had any teenage years to go back to."
Brian Grazer,"I don't think he wants that level of intimacy or sees the value in it, ... He's just the worker. He's always been the worker. Now he's the worker and the CEO."
Brian Grazer,We're coming out of the valley we were in this summer. People love Jodie Foster and showed they'll come out for the right thing. It's about the movies you make.
Brian Grazer,She has a protective eye. She's experienced a lot in her life and that intense protection is always in full operation.
Brian Grazer,She went because it had been talked about so much by Johnny Carson and Bob Hope.
Brian Grazer,"There's always a year when the pundits say the movie business is over,"

Al Green,"Some times in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow.But, if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.Lean on me, when your not strong, and I'll be your friend,I'll help you carry on.

Al Green,GM is operating in an intensely competitive global environment and reaching this tentative agreement allows us to continue to build momentum in the market with the award-winning vehicles and components produced in Canada.

Dennis Green,Last year each team had $85 million in television revenue and the cap was close to $85 million. That's why we all can compete.
Dennis Green,"A blockbuster deal in my opinion is one that eats up most of your cap space. It means you get one player and one and done. And we're not going to do that. If you ask me if we're going to go after one of the incredible backs that might be available in a blockbuster deal, that probably will not happen."
Dennis Green,"Al and I have a little bit different philosophy about going about the game. I was a head coach for 18 years and never had anybody hire or fire an assistant coach except me. And when you go into the Raiders, you have to keep the staff that's there. ... Therefore I stand by what I said before, there's not a job out there right now that I feel is the right one for me."

Dennis Green,I haven't done as good a job.
Dennis Green,"Things I felt real strongly would work for us, right now they are not working for us. The job I felt I could do, I have not been able to do right now. I am not happy about it."
Dennis Green,I'm hopeful. Everybody is working hard. (James) knows a lot of players here.
Dennis Green,I'm as excited and enthusiastic about our opportunities here as I have ever been.
Dennis Green,"We could go play eight or nine more weeks. The guys have not lost their enthusiasm for playing. Some of those games we let get away, they wish we could get them back."
Dennis Green,"Signing Kurt Warner is a great step in that direction. He is clearly one of the top quarterbacks in the National Football League. His story, as I said last year, I think will continue to grow, and we think we will be a successful team. There couldn't be a better guy to lead us to that success than Kurt Warner."
Dennis Green,"We feel good about our last game here at Sun Devil Stadium. It was a game that kind of went the way we like them to go. We've been in a lot of close games where, defensively we had a lot of effect."

Dennis Green,"As they say, a lot of accidents happen around the house so you have to be careful. I'm not sure all the details.

Kevin Green,We didn't really talk about him leaving. We just talked about what kind of season we had.
Kevin Green,"It [winning] is great; one the main reasons I came to college is to get better at tennis. This year was more of a challenge, just because me and the other guy hadn't played that much together. It was nice to have another undefeated season."
Michael Green,"She's been running in front. She's been out there when Perkins, at the time, and Gibson have been getting it together."
Michael Green,"He believes that one of the best ways to make sure you have a lasting peace on the peninsula is for the North to open up and see that they're not threatened by the South, they're not threatened by the U.S., that the people of South Korea want the people of North Korea to have better lives."
Michael Green,"Our clients look out their window and their neighbors are on the ground with guns to their heads. The next thing they know, their door gets broken open."
Michael Green,"The previous Indian prime minister was a man of very few words. When I was a note-taker for meetings with him, I would rarely go beyond one page. The current prime minister is a very modest man, very humble man, very sincere, very charming. And there's a nice chemistry."

Michael Green,"The Indians are not about to contain China. The Indians want to grow rich off China's growth, just like, frankly, the United States does."
Michael Green,"I can't blame them for anything they feel. They lost a wonderful man. I have a family that lost their son for a year, but he's coming home, so if they want to blame the police I can't fault them."

Richard Green,We continue to execute the final stages of our repositioning strategies aimed at regaining financial strength.
Richard Green,It was a nice Saturday's round of golf to put yourself in position for Sunday and I was quite pleased with the way I played.
Richard Green,"Players like Monty don't retreat, they are solid under pressure and don't try too hard to force things and wait for the birdies to come along,"
Richard Green,Our knowledge of system design is what allows us to build this goal-seeking engine.
Richard Green,"There's always a danger the gas could find a source of ignition, that's why we were on the scene."
Richard Green,We are delighted with today's announcement by Nordstrom. It's a strong commitment to the Palm Desert community - one we share.
Richard Green,"We are delighted with today's announcement by Nordstrom. It's a strong commitment to the Palm Desert community -- one we share. Nordstrom will serve as a catalyst for the complete revitalization of the center including the addition of new specialty shops, lifestyle tenants and signature restaurants. We look forward to welcoming Nordstrom in the spring of 2009."
Tom Green,Their pressure got to us. They didn't do anything we didn't expect ... really there was just too much talent for us tonight.
Tom Green,The General Assembly has indicated support for Teen REACH programs. The budget isn't complete yet. The governor is working closely with legislative leaders.
Tom Green,"His progress has been incredible, from when we saw him in high school [at Long Island Lutheran] in the spring of his senior year, when we knew he was going to be a project. And he's been a project that's definitely worked out really well for us."
Tom Green,I think this is to placate but also she is of two minds to continue to wield this power.
Tom Green,"It will be rockin' in here Monday night, I know that."
Tom Green,"Within the last year or two, there have been some quality big men. There's been a little more emphasis placed on that center position, [but] recruiting quality big men in this league is very, very difficult."
Tom Green,I don't mind checking the constitutionality of the law. But to stop planning? I have a difficult time with that.
Tom Green,"I think we were just worn out from all the travel. It was an honor for us to be in it, no question about it. There were 100 mid-major programs in the game, and we were the first NEC school to be in it. I was hoping we would play someone a little closer to us."
Tom Green,Teams that shoot as quick and as well as they do make them hard to stop.
Tom Green,"It will be very challenging, to say the least, ... We have strong non-conference competition in road games against Maryland, projected to be a top-20 team, and Louisville, a 2004-05 final four participant. Playing against in-state rival Seton Hall at the Meadowlands is another highlight, and we'll be competing against St. Peter's and Drexel, both of which had good seasons last year."
Tom Green,"This market is just trying to get to Christmas because it really doesn't know what it's doing, ... It's just hopefully going to have some good earnings eventually."
Tom Green,"I think sometimes what happens is, I get desensitized to things and I don't realize how shocking some things can be to some people."
Tom Green,You earn it through positive behavior.
Tom Green,"He's an undersized four man (power forward) is what it boils down to. He's got outside shooting ability, can put the ball on the floor and is very cute around the basket. He's very difficult to guard. And he's stronger than most everybody he plays against."
Daniel Greenberg,"You can't make someone learn something - you really can't teach someone something - they have to want to learn it. And if they want to learn, they will."
Daniel Greenberg,"Whenever culture has gone through a radical change, as ours has - from industrial age to information age - there are people who will deny that things have changed; they resist it and refuse to change."
Daniel Greenberg,"When kids play, they are working on imagining the kind of world we live in."
Daniel Greenberg,Technology will eventually destroy the way schools are run now.
Daniel Greenberg,"So, I see technology as a Trojan Horse: It looks like a wonderful thing, but they are going to regret introducing it into the schools because it simply can't be controlled."
Daniel Greenberg,"Quite a few, actually, are involved in education. They have had the same experience Hanna and I had: when they started having their own kids, they didn't want them to have a poor educational experience; they wanted them to enjoy school."
Daniel Greenberg,"Our students get a good education here, and those who are highly motivated to go to college get accepted without the letters of recommendation."
Daniel Greenberg,"Kids are finding out about the potential for discovery online from other sources; many of them have computers at home, for instance, or their friends have them."
Daniel Greenberg,"Just the concept of personal freedom within a democracy, for instance, is a relatively young idea - only about 300 years old in this country."
Daniel Greenberg,"In traditional schools, you're penalized for making a mistake. But that won't work in the new information culture, in the digital world we live in today."
Daniel Greenberg,"In terms of how much actual use is made of the networked resources, our school's use of the Internet is comparable to that of a university."
Daniel Greenberg,"If you watch young children play, you will notice that they create games, characters, situations, whole worlds in which they immerse themselves with intense concentration."
Daniel Greenberg,I'm not too worried about that. I am a big believer in modeling.
Daniel Greenberg,"I'll tell you what the real problem is: These people are working under the assumption that they know better about what is good for kids, what kids need to learn to get ahead in this world."
Daniel Greenberg,"I would deliver lectures that got standing ovations, but later, in the tests and essays, it was clear to me that the students just didn't get it."
Daniel Greenberg,"I think people with open minds will observe the way we do things and realize that our goal is to have successful, happy, productive adults, and they will take our ideas and implement them elsewhere for their own children."
Daniel Greenberg,"I followed the rules, and I was a high achiever."
Daniel Greenberg,"Educators are still spending way too much time trying to control what kids learn, bending the content to their own purposes, hoping beyond hope to change - by using technology - but not change too much."
Daniel Greenberg,"But, neither of these educational scenarios worked for us, so when we started a family, we wanted a different school for our children. And the other founders felt the same way."
Daniel Greenberg,"But, if you observe children learning in their first few years of life, you can see that they can and do learn on their own - we leave them alone to crawl, walk, talk, and gain control over their bodies. It happens without much help from parents."
Daniel Greenberg,"And they understand that to be an effective member of a democracy, you have to accept responsibility."
Daniel Greenberg,"Some go on to trade schools or get further training for jobs they are interested in. Some go into the arts, some are craftsmen, some take a little time out to travel, and some start their own businesses. But our graduates find and work at what they want to do."
Jack Greenberg,We want staff functions to support line decisions and maximize their impact.
Jack Greenberg,"The U.S. delivered an extremely strong performance,"
Jack Greenberg,"While eliminating jobs is a painful process -- both personally and culturally -- it is necessary to make these changes to refocus and realign with our restaurants and, where appropriate, bring home office resources closer to them,"
Jack Greenberg,... Innovation is an integral part of our vision for McDonald's in the 21 st century
Jack Greenberg,"We extended our considerable lead internationally and achieved a remarkable turnaround in our U.S. business,"
Seth Greenberg,"You really can't prepare for it. We support Allen 100 percent. There are some things he can and can't do, and he'll let us know."
Seth Greenberg,This has been a very tough three weeks. We haven't had a whole lot to smile about. This will give them a chance to feel good about themselves and put behind them everything that's going on in their lives.
Seth Greenberg,We haven't seen Coleman Collins for 10 weeks. We might not see him again the rest of the season. I can't tell you that. And I wouldn't blame him.
Seth Greenberg,Shawn was magnificent tonight and there?s no denying it. He?s had a great week of practice and we wanted to go with some toughness. He played well.
Seth Greenberg,He had a great four days of practice.
Seth Greenberg,"My wife, my children's initials and my parents' initials."
Seth Greenberg,We?re just going to continue to practice. There?s no magic formula; there?s no Michael Jordan?s magic potion.
Seth Greenberg,This was kind of like a microcosm of our season.
Seth Greenberg,"It was kind of like a ... microcosm of our season. When we had to get a rebound, when we had to get a 50-50 ball, when we had to make a free throw, we just weren't able to do it."
Seth Greenberg,"People that are probably hurt the worst are people that are coming from low-income areas that lost everything. As coaches, we're always rebuilding. Maybe we can come together and help some people rebuild their lives."
Seth Greenberg,"Those things happen. It's like the roll of the green in golf. It can't be 'Oh, pity me.' Life's not fair. Our team, better than any other team in the country, understands life's not fair. We have an 18-year-old dealing with his dad [battling cancer]. You can't find anything more unfair than that."
Seth Greenberg,"Let him get through tomorrow, and we'll figure it out from there. I wanted to give him some freedom to figure out how much he can deal with and give him some time to grieve without having to put him on a schedule."
Seth Greenberg,"We probably should've taken our chances, maybe, force them to make a jump shot. Until we start getting a stop at the end of the game or coming up with a 50-50 ball, you'll have a hard time winning close games."
Seth Greenberg,"When you're not getting a ton of minutes, I think it's easy to have self-doubt. I probably didn't empower him as much as I probably should have -- just getting him to believe in himself."
Seth Greenberg,That's an NCAA tournament team without a doubt. They've played that way down the stretch.
Seth Greenberg,I'll take that as a compliment.
Seth Greenberg,"Smith, Williams and Dudley are just physically imposing. Smith, two years ago was a big body with great hands. Now he?s a skilled, athletic body with great hands."
Seth Greenberg,"We've got to get him some help. He's a little kid in a man's body. He's a brilliant young man who'll graduate in three years, but he's still just 19 years old and he's lost his father ..."
Seth Greenberg,"He's got a burden that's sapping him from his energy. He's going through it ... in the biggest conference in America, the most-publicized conference in America, and it's a very public pain he's going through."
Seth Greenberg,Life's not fair. My team knows that more than any team in America right now.
Seth Greenberg,"Our ability to bounce back is kind of a trait that we've had the last few years. That was good to see, because now, it's for real. It's no joke now."
Seth Greenberg,We just don't have the ability to impose our will in the key moments of the game to win a game of this magnitude against a nationally ranked team.
Stephen Greenblatt,What we know is that Shakespeare wrote perhaps the most remarkable body of passionate love poetry in the English language to a young man.
Stephen Greenblatt,"What matters here are the works - finally without them his life would be uninteresting. What matters, that is, are the astonishing things that he left behind. If we can get the life in relation to the works, then it can take off."
Stephen Greenblatt,What I wanted to do was to get that sense of being in touch with this lost world while holding onto what draws readers and audiences there in the first place.
Stephen Greenblatt,"Well it is certainly the case that the poems - which were in fact published during Shakespeare's lifetime - are weird if they began or originated in this form, as I think they did, because the poems get out of control."
Stephen Greenblatt,The Shakespeare that Shakespeare became is the name that's attached to these astonishing objects that he left behind.
Stephen Greenblatt,"My father who in this case was an obsessive life-long storyteller, and by a very peculiar trick of my father's. My father would tell a very, very long story, and the punch line would be in Yiddish."
Stephen Greenblatt,"I've been at this for 40 years. And, as an academic, I've been content with relatively small audiences, with the thought that the audience I long for will find its way eventually to what I have written, provided that what I have written is good enough."
Stephen Greenblatt,"I'm not spitting in my own soup, I love having spent my life thinking about these things-but you don't have to know anything about his life, even though I've just written a biography!"
Stephen Greenblatt,"I wanted to hold onto and exploit the power of narrative. This is not only a book about a great storyteller, but there have to be stories about the storyteller."
Stephen Greenblatt,I think the writing of literature should give pleasure. What else should it be about? It is not nuclear physics. It actually has to give pleasure or it is worth nothing.
Stephen Greenblatt,"I believe that nothing comes of nothing, even in Shakespeare. I wanted to know where he got the matter he was working with and what he did with that matter."
Stephen Greenblatt,"I believe that it is a whole lifetime of work on Shakespeare's part that enabled him to do what he did. But the question is how you can explain this whole lifetime in such a way to make it accessible and available to us, to me."
Stephen Greenblatt,"First of all, there was a volcano of words, an eruption of words that Shakespeare had never used before that had never been used in the English language before. It's astonishing. It pours out of him."
Stephen Greenblatt,"First of all, Shakespeare is about pleasure and interest. He was from the first moment he actually wrote something for the stage, and he remains so."
Stephen Greenblatt,"But if Shakespeare himself is maybe about meaning and truth, I don't know, then he is certainly about pleasure and interest, we start with pleasure and interest, but maybe eventually it gets to meaning and truth."
Stephen Greenblatt,"But if it doesn't have pleasure and interest, then it does not have life. And the same must be true about writing about literature."
Stephen Greenblatt,But I wanted to make a claim: the claim here is that life is actually compelling and that Shakespeare's life is what he principally had to work with.
Stephen Greenblatt,But I never listen to music while I'm writing.
Stephen Greenblatt,"It is not that Shakespeare's art is in technicolor and fancy, and that real life is black and white and tedious. The life that Shakespeare was living was the only life he had, and he had to use it to create what he was doing."
Stephen Greenblatt,No special writing rituals. And my desk is usually cluttered.
Stephen Greenblatt,"I believe in broken, fractured, complicated narratives, but I believe in narratives as a vehicle for truth, not simply as a form of entertainment, though I love entertainment, but also a way of conveying what needs to be conveyed about the works that I care about."
Stephen Greenblatt,But the trick of holding off and having all the pieces come together at the moment of the revelation was something I must have learned quite early.
Brian Greene,"As the astounding vastness of the universe becomes obscured, there is a throwback to a vision of a universe that essentially amounts to earth, or one's country, or state or city. Perspective becomes myopic."
Brian Greene,Jake finished close behind Ben White of eventual team champion Liverpool. Jake has been looking forward to this race against one of the top runners in New York and came away disappointed. I think this set back will fuel Jake to beat White next time.
Brian Greene,We had guys in the past who wanted to win; now we have guys who expect to win. It's an attitude shift in the way we think about ourselves.
Brian Greene,"The actual fabric of space and time curving? My God, what an idea! It takes a certain type of person who will bang his head against the wall because you believe you'll find the solution."
Brian Greene,"I love playing away games; it's one of my favorite things to do. You go to a packed stadium with crazy fans, and they're all yelling and screaming at you. The best thing, in my opinion, is to hear quiet in a full opposing stadium."
Brian Greene,"If you watch the games, it's really close,"
Brian Greene,"His father was a great guy and was always a good fan. He loved Duke football, and he loved his son, which is why Jim is struggling with this so much. He loved his dad. We're all feeling for him right now, and we hope he gets through this tough time."
Brian Greene,"If you're just playing football for winning or losing, you're playing for the wrong reasons,"
Brian Greene,We opened the second half again with a lot of energy and hustle.
Brian Greene,The market rates are so out of control right now that to go into bid at this time of year is really difficult.
Brian Greene,"The returning girls are really starting to assert themselves and control the game, while the younger girls understand their roles more and continue to improve. This team is improving game by game and is ready for league play to begin."
Brian Greene,How can a speck of a universe be physically identical to the great expanse we view in the heavens above?
Brian Greene,I have long thought that anyone who does not regularly - or ever - gaze up and see the wonder and glory of a dark night sky filled with countless stars loses a sense of their fundamental connectedness to the universe.
Brian Greene,"Right now we are facing adversity, but we just have to stick together. We have a chance to play in the tournament now and win. We have the team to do it."
Larry Greene,He was more humble than a lot of players I have met with half the talent.
Larry Greene,"Every year, before we pick captains, we talk about the kids who exhibit leadership. Even when Rocco was a junior, he spoke, and spoke very well. Some kids don't know how to speak, and some speak too much. We got a great sense of what Rocco knew about leadership."
Larry Greene,"It's hard to say,"
Larry Greene,"Usually, if we expect hurricane force winds, the port will be closed and will remain closed until the storm has passed and we've had the chance to survey the channel and make sure there's no debris or anything floating or sunk that will impede vessel traffic,"
Larry Greene,I don't think it's a sad commentary on society. We're just inundated with tragedies. I guess it's a defense mechanism to compartmentalize these things and set them aside.
Larry Greene,"Initially, the Army needs people who can follow, too."
Maurice Greene,I'm very disappointed as I felt very good coming into the race.
Maurice Greene,His confidence is through the roof.
Maurice Greene,I've had bad jobs. Now I have a good one. I'm thankful.
Maurice Greene,"Everyone is coming after me now. Fine, let them keep on coming. I'm the fastest man in the world, no doubt."
Maurice Greene,Among the world elite there are a handful of athletes who are physically capable of winning it.
Maurice Greene,"To be number one, you must train like you are number two."
Robert Greene,"Stop shallow water from running, it will rage; tread on a worm and it will turn."
Robert Greene,"Once you purchase it, you're building equity. You're not just handing money to a rental guy."
Robert Greene,"A noble mind disdains to hide his head, And let his foes triumph in his overthrow."
Robert Greene,The United States government is hated universally. But the average American person is not. This distinction is being made not because these countries are interested in cooperation but because of the needs of people.
Robert Greene,"I know My God commands, whose power no power resists."
Robert Greene,"For as one star another far exceeds, So souls in heaven are placed by their deeds."
Robert Greene,"Waste brings woe, and sorrow hates despair."
Robert Greene,"If country loves such sweet desires gain, / What lady would not love a shepherd swain?"
Steve Greene,Knowing Travis I don't think he has any regret. I think that he wouldn't have it any other way.
Steve Greene,Doctors still haven't closed up his left leg yet but they're hoping to by Saturday and he is still running a high fever.
Steve Greene,What concerns me about Salinas is their ability to turn it on. Volleyball is a game of momentum. We can't let them get too much of that.
Alan Greenspan,"It is risky, ... It's risky doing nothing. It's risky doing any other solution. ... I know no way to resolve this without risk."
Alan Greenspan,"Such an increase in market value is too often viewed by market participants as structural and permanent, ... To some extent, those higher values may be reflecting the increased flexibility and resilience of our economy."
Alan Greenspan,"Developing protectionism regarding trade and our reluctance to place fiscal policy on a more sustainable path are threatening what may well be our most valued policy asset: the increased flexibility of our economy, which has fostered our extraordinary resilience to shocks."
Alan Greenspan,What is not clear is whether the market values that are being placed on particular assets involved in this technology revolution are appropriately priced.
Alan Greenspan,"Technology is also damping upward price pressures through its effect on international trade,"
Alan Greenspan,"these borrowers, and the institutions that service them, could be exposed to significant losses."
Alan Greenspan,"[Calling developments this year] quite favorable, ... the expansion is self-sustaining."
Alan Greenspan,investing Social Security trust fund assets in equities compromises the efficient allocation of our capital -- which?is so essential to raising our standards of living.
Alan Greenspan,"Investing a portion of the Social Security trust fund assets in equities as the administration and others have proposed would arguably put at risk the efficiency of our capital markets and, thus, our economy,"
Alan Greenspan,our current pay-as-you-go Social Security system unsustainable.
Alan Greenspan,The ratio of the number of workers contributing to social security to the number of beneficiaries has declined to the point where maintaining the annuity value of benefits on retirement at a level well in excess of accumulated contributions has become extremely unlikely.
Alan Greenspan,"The recent evidence increasingly suggests that an economic expansion is already well under way, although an array of influences unique to this business cycle seems likely to moderate its speed,"
Alan Greenspan,"We're going to be running into very severe pressures in later years, and the better we are prepared in moving into that period, the more likely it is that we will address it in a rational, sensible rational way,"
Alan Greenspan,Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy.
Alan Greenspan,"The physical assets of such a firm comprise a small proportion of its asset base, ... Trust and reputation can vanish overnight. A factory cannot."
Alan Greenspan,"Further development of China's trading relationships with the United States and other industrial countries will work to strengthen the rule of law within China and to firm its commitment to economic reform,"
Alan Greenspan,"I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support for free trade, ... Should we endeavor to freeze competitive progress in place, we will almost certainly slow economic growth overall."
Alan Greenspan,"While (Japan) has made some important efforts, it has yet to make significant progress in diversifying the financial system,"
Alan Greenspan,"China's progress towards prosperity and accession into the WTO will create new opportunities for American businesses and farmers,"
Alan Greenspan,"Because there was little retrenchment during the cyclical downturn, the potential for a significant acceleration in activity in the household sector is likely to be more limited than in past business cycles,"
Alan Greenspan,"Although household spending should continue to trend up, the potential for significant acceleration in activity in this sector is likely to be more limited than in past cycles,"
Alan Greenspan,"Indications that the extent of the application of existing technology is still far from complete, plus potential benefits derived from continuing synergies, support a distinct possibility that total productivity growth rates will remain high or even increase further,"
Alan Greenspan,"rare occasion, warranted because of the potential for serious disruptions to markets."
Alan Greenspan,"Demand may be moving closer into line with the rate of advance in the economy's potential, given our continued impressive productivity growth, ... Should this favorable outcome prevail, the immediate threat to our prosperity from growing imbalances in our economy would abate."
Alan Greenspan,"I find it utterly inconceivable, frankly, that we can have the type of potential fiscal outlook, which now confronts us over the next 15 to 20 years which, unless addressed, will not have a significant impact on long-term interest rates,"
Alan Greenspan,"As we prepare for the rollover, it is most important to keep in perspective just how far we have come in our Y2K preparations,"
Alan Greenspan,We at the Federal Reserve have greatly benefited from his perspective and keen insights.
Alan Greenspan,"[He declined to divulge his views on the performance of the International Monetary Fund, saying that is a topic of ongoing discussion with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.] I don't think it's appropriate for me to discuss what we're discussing, ... When we are ready to pronounce something, you will hear an announcement."
Alan Greenspan,"The changes in the budget outlook over the past several years are truly remarkable, ... We need to resist those policies that could readily resurrect the deficits of the past and the fiscal imbalances that followed in their wake."
Alan Greenspan,"As I have said previously to this committee, because of the nature of the type of acceleration in productivity and dynamic change that is occurring in the American economy, my first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public,"
Alan Greenspan,Keeping out competitively priced goods would materially lower our standard of living.
Alan Greenspan,"Although layoffs seem to be diminishing, surveys indicate that households continue to be worried about the condition of labor markets,"
Alan Greenspan,"Despite the tightest labor markets in a generation, more workers report in a prominent survey that they are fearful of losing their jobs than similar surveys found in 1991 at the bottom of the last recession, ... The marked move of capital from failing to technologies to those at the cutting edge has quickened the pace at which job skills become obsolete."
Alan Greenspan,"At some point, labor market conditions can become so tight that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity, and prices inevitably will then eventually begin to accelerate,"
Alan Greenspan,"The fact of the matter is, we do not have an unlimited amount of labor, ... the wealth effect cannot persist indefinitely."
Alan Greenspan,"But, given our current state of knowledge, I find it difficult to envision central banks successfully targeting asset prices any time soon,"
Alan Greenspan,"There is a palpable unease that businesses and jobs are being drained from the United States, with potentially adverse long-run implications for unemployment and the standard of living of the average American,"
Alan Greenspan,There's an awful lot of information
Alan Greenspan,"As the value of assets and liabilities have risen relative to income, we have been confronted with the potential for our economies to exhibit larger and perhaps more abrupt responses to changes in factors affecting the balance sheets of households and businesses,"
Alan Greenspan,"With production running well below sales, the lift to income and spending from the inevitable cessation of inventory liquidation could be significant,"
Alan Greenspan,"Today, economic value is best symbolized by exceedingly complex, miniaturized integrated circuits and the ideas -- the software -- that utilize them, ... Most of what we currently perceive as value and wealth is intellectual and impalpable."
Alan Greenspan,"Emperors and armies come and go, ... but unless they leave new ideas in their wake, they are of passing historic consequence. The short list of intellectuals who have materially advanced the betterment of civilization unquestionably includes Adam Smith."
Alan Greenspan,"Although we cannot rule out home-price declines,"
Alan Greenspan,"[On whether recent gains in housing prices have produce a] bubble, ... we certainly cannot rule out home price declines, especially in some local markets, these declines, were they to occur, likely would not have substantial macroeconomic implications."
Alan Greenspan,signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels.
Alan Greenspan,"He has been one of the most effective secretaries of the Treasury in this nation's history,"
Alan Greenspan,History has not dealt kindly
Alan Greenspan,"...most of the gains in the level and the growth rate of productivity in the United States since 1995 appear to be structural, largely driven by advances in technology and its application -- irreversible in the sense that knowledge once gained is almost never lost,"
Alan Greenspan,there are mechanisms in place that should help to slow the growth of spending to a pace more consistent with that of potential output growth.
Alan Greenspan,"could certainly meet the fundamental criteria of being simple, fair, and pro-growth."
Alan Greenspan,"Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve, affect the necessary alignment of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply, the full benefits of innovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being undermined by financial and economic instability,"
Alan Greenspan,"The current economic performance, with its combination of strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the American economy,"
Alan Greenspan,a process that has undoubtedly improved national productivity growth and standards of living.
Alan Greenspan,"The rapid growth and increasing importance of derivative instruments in the risk profile of many large banks has been a particular concern,"
Alan Greenspan,"The level of equity prices would appear to envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been experienced of late,"
Alan Greenspan,"Indeed only such highly liquid portfolios would be consistent with (government-sponsored enterprises') mission of providing primary mortgage market liquidity during a crisis, particularly a financial crisis,"
Alan Greenspan,"We owe it to those who will retire over the next couple of decades to promise only what the government can deliver,"
Alan Greenspan,one of the most successful government agencies in history.
Alan Greenspan,"At present, the Social Security trustees estimate that the unfunded liability over the indefinite future to be $10.4 trillion, ... The shortfall in Medicare is calculated at several multiples of the one in Social Security."
Alan Greenspan,"Through most of last year's slowdown, in contrast to the usual pattern, the household sector was a major stabilizing force, ... As a consequence, although household spending should continue to trend up, the potential for significant acceleration in activity in this sector is more limited."
Alan Greenspan,"The fear of job obsolescence,"
Alan Greenspan,"I fear that the failure to expense stock option grants has introduced a significant distortion in reported earnings,"
Alan Greenspan,"Had the failure of LTCM triggered the seizing up of markets, substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market participants, including some not directly involved with the firm, and could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations, including our own,"
Alan Greenspan,"As China's citizens experience economic gains, so will the American firms that trade in their expanding markets,"
Alan Greenspan,"Until we experience an economic slowdown, we will not know for sure how much of the extraordinary rise in output per hour in the past five years is attributable to the irreversible way value is created and how much reflects endeavors on the part of the business community to stretch existing capital and labor resources in ways that are not sustainable over the long run,"
Alan Greenspan,"Looking ahead, the consensus expectation for a pickup in economic activity is not unreasonable, though the timing and extent of that improvement continue to be uncertain,"
Alan Greenspan,"I find it difficult to believe, for example, that the crises that arose in Thailand and Korea would have been nearly so virulent had their central banks published data prior to the crises on net reserves instead of the not very informative gross reserve positions only,"
Alan Greenspan,"In an environment of weak financial systems, lax supervisory regimes, and vague assurances about depositor or creditor protections, the state of confidence so necessary to the functioning of any banking system was torn asunder."
Alan Greenspan,difficult to suppress growing market exuberance when the economic environment is perceived as more stable.
Alan Greenspan,"Greenspan will note the economy's robust growth pace in a low inflation environment, ... the downside risks of the international weakness . . . most recently Brazil."
Alan Greenspan,"Because it is difficult to suppress growing market exuberance when the economic environment is perceived as more stable, a highly flexible system needs to be in place to rebalance an economy in which psychology and asset prices could change rapidly,"
Alan Greenspan,"With real energy prices on the rise, more rapid decreases in the intensity of energy use in the years ahead seem virtually inevitable,"
Alan Greenspan,"through education and training, not by restraining the competitive forces that are so essential to overall rising standards of living of the great majority of our population."
Alan Greenspan,"If we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, ... America's system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in meeting the challenge to educate workers."
Alan Greenspan,"We are seeing an evolving new international economy. We are in the process of learning how it works as we are doing it, ... Fortunately, the trauma that came out of the Russian default created so much risk aversion ... we probably have time to be deliberative in determining how the (international monetary) structure ought to be structured."
Alan Greenspan,"The recent period has been marked by a transformation to an economy that is more productive as competitive forces become increasingly intense and new technologies raise the efficiency of our businesses, ... With the rapid adoption of information technology, the share of output that is conceptual rather than physical continues to grow."
Alan Greenspan,"The economic fundamentals remain firm, and the U.S. economy appears to retain important forward momentum,"
Alan Greenspan,a distinguished appointment. Ben comes with superb academic credentials and important insights into the ways our economy functions.
Alan Greenspan,"The economy suffered significant shocks in late summer and early autumn,"
Alan Greenspan,profound implications for the free world's trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American economy.
Alan Greenspan,"in modest quantities does enhance the rate of growth of the economy and does create higher standards of living, but in excess, creates very serious problems."
Alan Greenspan,"The economy is turning, and credit comes in with a lag, ... To the extent that a number of small firms are finding it difficult to get the credit they need at a price they can afford, that's likely to change for the better."
Alan Greenspan,"Thus our baseline outlook for the U.S. economy is one of sustained economic growth and contained inflation pressures. In our view, realizing this outcome will require the Federal Reserve to continue to remove monetary accommodation."
Alan Greenspan,Technology and the Economy.
Alan Greenspan,"The type of economy that we are dealing with at this particular stage is, I suspect, one that none of us has seen before, and indeed it may be unprecedented in our history, ... Our basic purpose is to keep that process going."
Alan Greenspan,"is larger than that of Japan, and may be approaching half the size of the American economy."
Alan Greenspan,"The addition of the Chinese economy to the global marketplace will result in a more efficient worldwide allocation of resources and will raise standards of living in China and its trading partners,"
Alan Greenspan,"Despite some of the risks that I have highlighted, the U.S. economy seems to be on a reasonably firm footing, and underlying inflation remains contained,"
Alan Greenspan,the amount of rate cuts required to revive the economy will not be deep.
Alan Greenspan,The growing stability of the world economy over the past decade may have encouraged investors to accept increasingly lower levels of compensation for risk.
Alan Greenspan,no doubt that the current stance of policy ? will need to be changed at some point.
Alan Greenspan,"I have little doubt that my successors, and theirs, will continue to sustain the leadership of the American financial system in an ever-widening global economy,"
Alan Greenspan,"There should be little disagreement about the need to re-establish budget discipline,"
Alan Greenspan,"There's potential for individual disaster there,"
Alan Greenspan,"The determination of global economic activity in recent years has been influenced importantly by capital gains on various types of assets, and the liabilities that finance them. Our forecasts and hence policy are becoming increasingly driven by asset price changes."
Alan Greenspan,"If we delay, the adjustments could be abrupt and painful,"
Alan Greenspan,helped to lower risk premiums on debt and have contributed importantly to the favorable investment environment.
Alan Greenspan,"Large deficits will result in rising interest rates and an ever-growing ratio of debt service to GDP (gross domestic product),"
Alan Greenspan,I haven't stipulated increased rates of return are a significant issue in this debate.
Alan Greenspan,"Before the crisis broke, there was little reason to question the three decades of phenomenally solid East Asian economic growth, largely financed through the banking system, so long as the rapidly expanding economies and bank credit kept the ratio of non-performing loans to total bank assets low,"
Alan Greenspan,only the peripheral winds of the Asian crisis.
Alan Greenspan,"The demand for new computer applications will no doubt continue to spur demand for those with the creativity and the higher-level conceptual skills that will enable us to increasingly harness technology to produce greater economic value,"
Alan Greenspan,"The odds ... increasingly favor a revival in job creation,"
Alan Greenspan,"We are very firm in the notion that this country should not visit the 1970s again in the way of inflation,"
Alan Greenspan,"It has been an extraordinary privilege to be able to serve my country at the Federal Reserve, and I would be honored if the Senate saw fit to enable me to continue this association for another four years,"
Alan Greenspan,we may be governors of the Federal Reserve but we are also citizens of this country.
Alan Greenspan,"The major element of the control of leverage and capital is the structure of the counterparty relationship,"
Alan Greenspan,US has lost control of the deficit
Alan Greenspan,"But as we struggle to make sense of our profound loss and its immediate consequences for the economy, ... we must not lose sight of our longer-run prospects, which have not been significantly diminished by these terrible events."
Alan Greenspan,"The bottom line, however, is that, while immigration and imports can significantly cushion the consequences of the wealth effect and its draining pool of unemployed workers for awhile, there are limits,"
Alan Greenspan,"There appears to be enough evidence, at least tentatively, to conclude that our strategy of addressing the bubble's consequences rather than the bubble itself has been successful,"
Alan Greenspan,"Changes in consumer confidence will require close scrutiny in the period ahead, especially after the steep falloff of recent months,"
Alan Greenspan,"In the face of energy price spike and the erosion of optimism in financial markets, consumer confidence, or sentiment, appears to be holding up reasonably well to date, though there have been some mixed signals of late."
Alan Greenspan,"As a consequence of our current dependence on computers, some Y2K-related failures could have noticeable effects on the economy,"
Alan Greenspan,"Competition is the necessary driving force toward delivering a superior product or service, ... We should not shy away from it."
Alan Greenspan,reductions in demand for our exports and intensified competition from imports. All of this suggests that the growth of economic activity in this country will moderate from the recent brisk pace.
Alan Greenspan,"The hey day when a high school or college education would serve a graduate for a lifetime is gone, ... Today's recipients of diplomas expect to have many jobs and to use a wide range of skills over their working lives."
Alan Greenspan,"In these circumstances, monetary policy is able to be more patient,"
Alan Greenspan,"There are no easy choices. Easy choices are long gone,"
Alan Greenspan,hesitancy to face up to the difficult choices that will be required to resolve our looming fiscal problems.
Alan Greenspan,[Bush said his choice as the nation's new central banker] commands deep respect in the financial community. ... has shepherded our economy through its highs and its lows.
Alan Greenspan,The one certainty is that the resolution of the nation's demographic challenge will require hard choices and that the future performance of the economy will depend on those choices.
Alan Greenspan,"...In an economy that already has lost some momentum, one must remain alert to the possibility that greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could signal or precipitate an excessive softening in household and business spending,"
Alan Greenspan,"We cannot rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening becomes necessary, ... Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability."
Alan Greenspan,"Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and, as a consequence, lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher asset prices, ... This is the reason that history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums."
Alan Greenspan,"new innovations have begun to alter the manner in which we do business and create value, often in ways not readily foreseeable even five years ago."
Alan Greenspan,"The very few times which we have intervened have occurred, ... when we believe the markets are unstable and that intervention might have an impact."
Alan Greenspan,"The influence of capital gains on economic behavior ... is likely to be of substantial consequence for the prospective performance of the economy,"
Alan Greenspan,"Over most of the past several years, the behavior of unit labor costs has been quite subdued, ... But those costs have turned up of late, and whether the favorable trends of the past few years will be maintained is unclear."
Alan Greenspan,"It is decidedly not true that nice guys finish last, as that highly original American baseball philosopher, Leo Durocher, was alleged to have said."
Alan Greenspan,"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the U.S. current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,"
Alan Greenspan,"[Work to eliminate] math anxiety, ... so many students who clearly demonstrate impressive verbal or other conceptual skills find mathematical procedures intimidating."
Alan Greenspan,"We need, in effect, to make the phantom 'lock-boxes' around the trust fund real."
Alan Greenspan,An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions. They seem to sense... that gold and economic freedom are inseparable.
Alan Greenspan,"To succeed, you will soon learn, as I did, the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of education - literacy, both verbal and numerical, and communication skills."
Alan Greenspan,"The scale and scope of higher education in America was being shaped by the recognition that research -- the creation of knowledge --complemented teaching and training -- the diffusion of knowledge,"
Alan Greenspan,"If we can maintain an adequate degree of flexibility, some of America 's economic imbalances, most notably the large current account deficit and the housing boom, can be rectified by adjustments in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates rather than through more-wrenching changes in output, incomes, and employment."
Alan Greenspan,"While, three months ago, it was clearly a desirable action ... we didn't [pass a stimulus bill], ... Fortunately it turned out we didn't need that particular [action]."
Alan Greenspan,"Human beings make mistakes, ... I know of no supervisory action we can take that will prevent that. I know of no legislation to help us prevent them from making dumb mistakes."
Alan Greenspan,"If no action is taken at all ... we're going to be confronted within a few years with a marked upward ratcheting of long-term interest rates, which is very debilitating to long-term economic growth,"
Alan Greenspan,"Without the needed restrictions on the size of the GSE balance sheets, we put at risk our ability to preserve safe and sound financial markets in the United States, a key ingredient of support for housing,"
Alan Greenspan,"The more flexible an economy, the greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable, often unanticipated, disturbances and thus to contain the size and consequences of cyclical imbalances."
Alan Greenspan,the need to expand our nation's ability to import natural gas.
Alan Greenspan,"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value."
Edward Greenspan,"It may come as a surprise, and there's no question it's had a tremendous impact on the criminal law, but I have never had a case that involves DNA. You may conclude from that that I must have retired from law, but I can assure you I have a very active practice."
Edward Greenspan,"Mr Black asserts his innocence without qualification... (and) has, at all times, acted in good faith."
Edward Greenspan,"This is a blatant example of overreaching by the prosecutor. These latest allegations add nothing new to the indictment and, when we are given the opportunity, they will be demonstrated to be unfounded as well."
Edward Greenspan,This is a blatant example of overreaching by the prosecutor.
Edward Greenspan,"On Friday, I filed a notice of leave to appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada, and this morning, Mr. Schreiber was released on bail pending the decision of the Supreme Court on the leave to appeal."
Edward Greenspan,A U.S. court has no jurisdiction over this alleged conduct in Canada.
Edward Greenspan,There is nothing contentious about obtaining court approval for a trip outside of North America. Court approval for international travel is normal and is not bothersome or any burden to Mr. Black or his counsel.
Robert Greenstein,You can see the political clout of the moneyed interests.
Robert Greenstein,"It certainly sounds to me that they made a calculation to get Coleman's support. With Coleman, they no longer needed Smith. And if they no longer needed Smith, they could cut Medicaid recipients instead of the pharmaceutical companies and managed-care providers."
Robert Greenstein,"It's certainly better that people falling into poverty can get Medicaid, but I'd prefer fewer poor people and employers not dropping medical coverage."
Robert Greenstein,So there's actually big differences for low- and moderate-income families -- better under Gore. Big differences for very high-income families -- they get a lot more under Bush.
Robert Greenstein,Congressional leaders have been more interested in using the needed increase in [energy] funds as a sweetener for controversial measures ... than in actually passing legislation to help low-income households cope with higher home heating costs.
Robert Greenstein,"If you're young and healthy, this can work well. If you're not young and healthy, it can be a disaster, and you can end up much worse off than you currently are."
Robert Greenstein,The real danger is that the employers market erodes fast.
Robert Greenstein,It's effectively cheating low-income families.
Robert Greenstein,"Although it contains the same themes as earlier administration budgets, it is somewhat harsher."
Robert Greenstein,"In a nutshell, this budget clearly digs the hole deeper."
Robert Greenstein,"My worry is that in the absence of discipline, what we will see a month from now after the initial relief bills are passed, are efforts by policy-makers of both parties and a variety of interest groups to take advantage of the disaster by arguing that all sorts of expansions in tax cuts and certain spending ... are needed,"
Chad Greenway,"When he does say something to you, you've got to take it to heart. It's not very often that he comes around and barks orders. When he does that, you'd better take notice and change something quick."
Chad Greenway,"The first time I ever played 11-man football was when I came to college. It was the first I'd ever seen 11 men on a football field. I never played in an all-star game. My only Division I offer was Iowa. You basically didn't have any choices. You were going there or you didn't, and when I got there, it's not really any different. It's still about tackling and catching and running."
Chad Greenway,"I didn't get a lot of opportunity to do that in college. We're not a real blitz team. I think I have that ability and when I did get that opportunity in college I was pretty successful. I think I'd be a great fit, especially as an outside rusher but I also have the physical ability of being an inside rusher too. I definitely could help a team strengthen their blitz package."
Chad Greenway,"I couldn't believe it. You go back to the Northwestern game, and those who know what happened in that game, it was the complete opposite. Typically on a kickoff, you're going to have a guy who's maybe a foot over the line. It's just hard to imagine that that's the way it went down after we really executed well on the onside and got the ball back."
Chad Greenway,They recruited me as an athlete. Whatever that means.
Chad Greenway,It's just completely two different worlds. But that's the beauty of America; you can come from different places and you can end up in the same place.
Germaine Greer,"Older women can afford to agree that femininity is a charade, a matter of colored hair, ecru lace and whalebones, the kind of slap and tat that transvestites are in love with, and no more."
Germaine Greer,"A woman might claim to retain some of the child's faculties, although very limited and defused, simply because she has not been encouraged to learn methods of thought and develop a disciplined mind. As long as education remains largely induction ignorance will retain these advantages over learning and it is time that women impudently put them to work."
Germaine Greer,There is no such thing as security. There never has been.
Germaine Greer,The house wife is an unpaid employee in her husband's house in return for the security of being a permanent employee
Germaine Greer,Revolution is the festival of the oppressed
Germaine Greer,"You're only young once, but you can be immature forever."
Germaine Greer,What we ought to see in the agonies of puberty is the result of the conditioning that maims the female personality in creating the feminine.
Germaine Greer,Loneliness is never more cruel than when it is felt in close propinquity with someone who has ceased to communicate.
Germaine Greer,I didn't fight to get women out from behind vacuum cleaners to get them onto the board of Hoover.
Germaine Greer,"It is in our interests to let the police and their employers go on believing that the Underground is a conspiracy, because it increases their paranoia and their inability to deal with what is really happening. As long as they look for ringleaders and documents they will miss their mark, which is that proportion of every personality which belongs in the Underground."
Germaine Greer,The essence of pleasure is spontaneity
Germaine Greer,"All that remains to the mother in modern consumer society is the role of scapegoat; psychoanalysis uses huge amounts of money and time to persuade analysis and to foist their problems on to the absent mother, who has no opportunity to utter a word in her own defense. Hostility to the mother in our societies is an index of mental health."
Germaine Greer,Freud is the father of psychoanalysis. It has no mother.
Germaine Greer,"In our society, the pre-adolescent girl, the nubile virgin, the sexually active woman, the mother and the grandmother are all expected to look and behave in the same way. The correct body outline for them all is girlish; their voices should remain sweet and low, their manner accommodating. ... Kicking off leg-lengthening high-heeled shoes, wiping the colored grease off your lips, raising your voice, letting the grey come through your hair, ceasing the simper that lifts your cheeks and letting your jowls settle into disapproving shapes is seen as letting yourself go."
Germaine Greer,"If a person loves only one other person, and is indifferent to his fellow men, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism"
Germaine Greer,Perhaps women have always been in closer contact with reality than men: it would seem to be the just recompense for being deprived of idealism.
Germaine Greer,The surest guide to the correctness of the path that women take is joy in the struggle. Revolution is the festival of the oppressed.
Germaine Greer,Every time a woman makes herself laugh at her husband's often-told jokes she betrays him. The man who looks at his woman and says ''What would I do without you?'' is already destroyed.
Germaine Greer,"Freedom is fragile and must be protected. To sacrifice it, even as a temporary measure, is to betray it."
Germaine Greer,"Perhaps catastrophe is the natural human environment, and even though we spend a good deal of energy trying to get away from it, we are programmed for survival amid catastrophe."
Germaine Greer,"Love, love, love -- all the wretched cant of it, masking egotism, lust, masochism, fantasy under a mythology of sentimental postures, a welter of self-induced miseries and joys, blinding and masking the essential personalities in the frozen gestures of courtship, in the kissing and the dating and the desire, the compliments and the quarrels which vivify its barrenness."
Germaine Greer,Security is when everything is settled. When nothing can happen to you. Security is the denial of life.
Germaine Greer,Evolution is what it is. The upper classes have always died out; it's one of the most charming things about them.
Germaine Greer,Is it too much to ask that women be spared the daily struggle for superhuman beauty in order to offer it to the caresses of a subhumanly ugly mate?
Germaine Greer,"Only one thing is certain: if pot is legalized, it won't be for our benefit but for the authorities . To have it legalized will also be to lose control of it."
Germaine Greer,Woman cannot be content with health and agility: she must make exorbitant efforts to appear something that never could exist without a diligent perversion of nature. Is it too much to ask that women be spared the daily struggle for superhuman beauty in order to offer it to the caresses of a subhumanly ugly mate?
Germaine Greer,"There has come into existence, chiefly in America, a breed of men who claim to be feminists. They imagine that they have understood ''what women want'' and that they are capable of giving it to them. They help with the dishes at home and make their own coffee in the office, basking the while in the refulgent consciousness of virtue. Such men are apt to think of the true male feminists as utterly chauvinistic."
Germaine Greer,"Women over fifty already form one of the largest groups in the population structure of the western world. As long as they like themselves, they will not be an oppressed minority. In order to like themselves they must reject trivialization by others of who and what they are. A grown woman should not have to masquerade as a girl in order to remain in the land of the living."
Germaine Greer,"The misery of the middle-aged woman is a gray and hopeless thing, born of having nothing to live for, of disappointment and resentment at having been gypped by consumer society, and surviving merely to be the butt of its unthinking scorn."
Germaine Greer,"The older woman's love is not love of herself, nor of herself mirrored in a lover's eyes, nor is it corrupted by need. It is a feeling of tenderness so still and deep and warm that it gilds every grass blade and blesses every fly. It includes the ones who have a claim on it, and a great deal else besides. I wouldn't have missed it for the world."
Germaine Greer,The sight of women talking together has always made men uneasy; nowadays it means rank subversion.
Christine Gregoire,"It's our responsibility to pass on what we inherited, not to squander it, but to build on it."
Christine Gregoire,"I'm a person of faith, [but] I don't carry it on my sleeve."
Christine Gregoire,"The scale of this disaster is simply overwhelming, ... The people of Washington state have a generous spirit, and we will do all that we can, individually and collectively, to support the victims of the hurricane."
Christine Gregoire,"When nearly a third of our high school students do not graduate on time with their peers, we have work to do. We must design our middle and high schools so that no student gets lost in the crowd and disconnected from his or her own potential."
Vartan Gregorian,"Our aim has also been to find a design that will begin to repair both the wounded cityscape and our wounded souls, to provide a place for the contemplation of both loss and new life,"
Vartan Gregorian,"Over the next several days, the design will be updated to reflect several changes, and new presentation materials will be created."
Vartan Gregorian,"The Partnership for Higher Education in Africa represents our commitment to Africa's next generation of leaders, who deserve an exemplary education to prepare them to help set the course for their nations' futures. We expect the universities in which we invest to become the foundation of a higher education network that will serve all of Africa for decades to come."
Vartan Gregorian,"It meant that New York philanthropists, New York society, would now rediscover the library. that learning, books, education have glamour, that self-improvement has glamour, that hope has glamour."
Vartan Gregorian,There she was in her bed. Dead. But nobody explained it to me. They told me later that she had gone to America.
Vartan Gregorian,"Everybody is somebody, so you don't have to introduce anybody."
Vartan Gregorian,"Libraries keep the records on behalf of all humanity. the unique and the absurd, the wise and the fragments of stupidity."
Vartan Gregorian,Dignity is not negotiable. Dignity is the honor of the family.
Dick Gregory,I wouldn't mind paying taxes - if I knew they were going to a friendly country.
Dick Gregory,"I am really enjoying the new Martin Luther King Jr stamp - just think about all those white bigots, licking the backside of a black man."
Dick Gregory,"Riches do not delight us so much with their possession, as torment us with their loss."
Dick Gregory,"In America, with all of its evils and faults, you can still reach through the forest and see the sun. But we don't know yet whether that sun is rising or setting for our country."
Dick Gregory,"We thought I was going to be a great athlete, and we were wrong, and I thought I was going to be a great entertainer, and that wasn't it either. I'm going to be an American Citizen. First class."
Dick Gregory,You know why Madison Avenue advertising has never done well in Harlem? We're the only ones who know what it means to be Brand X.
Dick Gregory,"When I lost my rifle, the Army charged me 85 dollars. That is why in the Navy the Captain goes down with the ship."
Dick Gregory,Just being a Negro doesn't qualify you to understand the race situation any more than being sick makes you an expert on medicine.
Dick Gregory,I'm not a comic. I'm a humorist.
Dick Gregory,"I never learned hate at home, or shame. I had to go to school for that."
Dick Gregory,"If it wasn't for Abe Lincoln, I'd still be on the open market."
Dick Gregory,I never believed in Santa Claus because I knew no white dude would come into my neighborhood after dark.
Dick Gregory,America will tolerate the taking of a human life without giving it a second thought. But don't misuse a household pet.
Dick Gregory,"When you have a good mother and no father, God kind of sits in. It's not enough, but it helps."
Dick Gregory,"We used to root for the Indians against the cavalry, because we didn't think it was fair in the history books that when the cavalry won it was a great victory, and when the Indians won it was a massacre."
Peter Gregory,He has been advised to rest the injury pending a further re-assessment in the UK.
Peter Gregory,Ashley hasn't made the progress that we'd want him to make and he's got some concerns that we share. Before we start to push him too hard we thought it sensible to seek a further opinion from the specialist.
Peter Gregory,"He has a history of cartilage damage, and it would be very likely this is too,"
Peter Gregory,"[Jones failed a fitness test on Tuesday and Peter Gregory, the chief medical officer of the ECB, said he would now have to face surgery.] We have tried a number of measures to help Simon's ankle injury to settle, but these have been unsuccessful and we are left with no alternative but to operate, ... There should be sufficient time for Simon to regain fitness and hence become available for selection for the tour to India beginning in late February."
Peter Gregory,He's got to be a doubt for the first Test.
Wayne Gretzky,"[But the most convincing determinant was the] fun ... I found a passion for coaching and liking it, so here I am today."
Wayne Gretzky,"I will say it one more time, I said it the other night, I didn't bet, it didn't happen, it's not going to happen, it hasn't happened, it's not something that I've done."
Wayne Gretzky,"When Mess came in to the league from the WHA at 17 he was kind of raw,"
Wayne Gretzky,In a lot of ways he reminds me of ( Mark ) Messier . He's solid. He's hard. He just wants to win.
Wayne Gretzky,"There is so much parity in the game, there are so many teams that are stronger, and it is much tougher to get 400 wins now. There is such a fine line between winning and losing, so to accomplish something like that in this era is pretty special."
Wayne Gretzky,"Hopefully, they can come up with a compromise that everyone's happy with because it would be great to see us keep playing hockey."
Wayne Gretzky,"I'll be honest with you, when I was 22, 23, 24, I never thought I'd be a coach in the NHL. But I'm excited about the challenge . . . . The last couple of weeks I've been following my son's baseball team around and I kind of got the itch to coach, as silly as that sounds."
Wayne Gretzky,"There's no perfect coach in the world. Coaches are human, too. Mistakes are made. But, fundamentally, if you're sound, you eliminate as many mistakes as possible."
Wayne Gretzky,"The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I work hard every day, that I never dog it."
Wayne Gretzky,The only way a kid is going to practice is if it's total fun for him... and it was for me.
Wayne Gretzky,"If I bet on sports ? I would never embarrass Team Canada or the country or hockey ? I would phone (NHL commissioner) Gary Bettman and Bob Nicholson right now and say you know what, I resign, it's over, even if I made a $1 bet."
Wayne Gretzky,"The success of Team Canada got me interested in teaching again which is something I really enjoy doing,"
Wayne Gretzky,We know that this country wants gold and nothing else is good enough. That's the expectation for Canada when it comes to hockey and we know that. We aren't kidding ourselves. We know we have to win the gold. We don't have anything else on our minds.
Wayne Gretzky,"It's a big game, it's on Hockey Night in Canada and he's been outstanding all year."
Wayne Gretzky,"Listen, first of all, my wife is my best friend. My love for her is deeper than anything. The reality is, I'm not involved, I wasn't involved and I'm not going to be involved. Am I concerned for both of them? Sure there's concern from me. I'm more worried about them than me. I'm like you guys, I'm trying to figure it all out."
Wayne Gretzky,He works harder than any athlete I've ever been around as far as off-season conditioning goes. He's a maniac . . . I see him playing another three years no question. He could be our ( Julio ) Franco .
Wayne Gretzky,A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.

Joel Grey,"I was born on April 11, 1932. That makes 72. But I really don't deal with my self or my life by the numbers. I feel great - I love my life!"

Joel Grey,"I love being in a show. I love the community aspect of it. I like the discipline of it, too."

Zane Grey,Work is my salvation. It changes my moods.
Zane Grey,What is writing but an expression of my own life?

Zane Grey,This motion-picture muddle had distracted me from my writing.

Zane Grey,"The difficulty, the ordeal, is to start."
Zane Grey,"No one connected intimately with a writer has any appreciation of his temperament, except to think him overdoing everything."

Zane Grey,"Love grows more tremendously full, swift, poignant, as the years multiply."
Zane Grey,"It was a decent New Year's, but it took a million officers to make it so."
Zane Grey,"I wrote for nearly six hours. When I stopped, the dark mood, as if by magic, had folded its cloak and gone away."
Zane Grey,I will see this game of life out to its bitter end.
Zane Grey,I see so much more than I used to see. The effect has been to depress and sadden and hurt me terribly.
Zane Grey,"I need this wild life, this freedom."
Zane Grey,"I must go deeper and even stronger into my treasure mine and stint nothing of time, toil, or torture."

Zane Grey,"I arise full of eagerness and energy, knowing well what achievement lies ahead of me."
Zane Grey,I am tired. My arm aches. My head boils. My feet are cold. But I am not aware of any weakness.
Zane Grey,I am full of fire and passion. I am not ready yet for great concentration and passion.
Zane Grey,Every once in a while I feel the tremendous force of the novel. But it does not stay with me.
Zane Grey,These critics who crucify me do not guess the littlest part of my sincerity. They must be burned in a blaze. I cannot learn from them.
Zane Grey,I hate birthdays.
Brian Griffin,"For the public, we wanted to make it easier and more convenient to access health information."
Brian Griffin,"(Nauta) actually played very well in all the games. It's really tough to fault the goalie. He played well enough for us to win, we just didn't always put the puck in the net."
Brian Griffin,"In fiscal year 2006, we expect to spend in excess of $29 million on community benefits, which include financial assistance for patients and services for community members in need. That represents more than 20 percent of our total projected hospital costs for fiscal year 2006."
Eddie Griffin,"[Comedian Eddie Griffin plans to donate his fee from two Friday performances at the Delta Downs Race Track Casino & Hotel in Vinton, Louisiana, to relief efforts.] Performing so close to New Orleans (230 miles away), my first thought was, 'How could I not help these unfortunate people?'  ... I ask everyone to reach into their pockets and do the same to help these people."
Eddie Griffin,"I think some teams shied away because of it, ... But Minnesota stuck with me and I was happy about that."
Eddie Griffin,"In Europe, kids learn at least four languages before they're out of high school. But our education system is so underfunded, they go to school to buy heroin and an AK [-47 assault rifle]."
Merv Griffin,"Unless it's an emergency, don't bother me after 6:00 p.m. and on weekends."

Merv Griffin,"Roger King is, without a doubt, the greatest salesman in the history of anything. And I don't ever limit him just to television. He could sell you anything."
Angelina Grimke,"Women ought to feel a peculiar sympathy in the colored man's wrong, for, like him, she has been accused of mental inferiority, and denied the privileges of a liberal education."
Angelina Grimke,"Can you not see that women could do and would do a hundred times more for the slave, if she were not fettered?"
Angelina Grimke,We Abolition Women are turning the world upside down.
Angelina Grimke,"What man or woman of common sense now doubts the intellectual capacity of colored people? Who does not know, that with all our efforts as a nation to crush and annihilate the mind of this portion of our race, we have never yet been able to do it."
Angelina Grimke,I am a mystery to myself.
Angelina Grimke,"We are commanded to love God with all our minds, as well as with all our hearts, and we commit a great sin if we forbid or prevent that cultivation of the mind in others which would enable them to perform this duty."
Angelina Grimke,"I trust the time is coming, when the occupation of an instructor to children will be deemed the most honorable of human employment."
Angelina Grimke,"If a law commands me to sin I will break it; if it calls me to suffer, I will let it take its course unresistingly."
Angelina Grimke,"I have not placed reading before praying because I regard it more important, but because, in order to pray aright, we must understand what we are praying for."
Lewis Grizzard,Instead of getting married again. I'm going to find a woman I don't like and give her a house.
Lewis Grizzard,"If Love Were Oil, I'd Be About a Quart Low."
Lewis Grizzard,"Life is like a dogsled team. If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes."
Lewis Grizzard,"I finally figured it out, I finally figured out how to find some peace and happiness. I sure would hate for the man upstairs to take me now. But at least I did figure it out."
Lewis Grizzard,"When My Love Comes Back from the Ladies' Room, Will I Be Too Old To Care?"
Lewis Grizzard,"She [mama] an appreciation of the language. She taught me a love of words, of how they should be used and how they can fill a creative soul with a passion and lead to a life's work."
Lewis Grizzard,"You call to a dog and a dog will break its neck to get to you. Dogs just want to please. Call to a cat and its attitude is, 'What's in it for me?'"
Lewis Grizzard,"If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes."
Lewis Grizzard,"The public, more often than not, will forgive mistakes, but it will not forgive trying to wriggle and weasel out of one."
Lewis Grizzard,I grew up in a very large family in a very small house. I never slept alone until after I was married.
Lewis Grizzard,"The game of life is a lot like football. You have to tackle your problems, block your fears, and score your points when you get the opportunity."
Lewis Grizzard,I don't think I'll get married again. I'll just find a woman I don't like and give her a house.
Lewis Grizzard,It's difficult to think anything but pleasant thoughts while eating a homegrown tomato.
Lewis Grizzard,"Instead of getting married again, I'm going to find a woman I don't like and give her a house."
Jim Grobe,"It's hard to lose, no question, and that hurts everyone's morale. Not just the players, but the coaches and the fans. Everybody wants to win. ... I think we've had enough talent to win. We're just not doing the things that good teams do to win football games."
Jim Grobe,"(Randolph) has made our quarterback position a horse race, and he didn't have to do that. He could have sulked about it and he has made it a great competition. If we had either quarterback out there for us, I wouldn't worry about it one bit."
Jim Grobe,A big part of spring practice was to get a look at those guys.
Jim Grobe,"Still too many mistakes. I'm glad we didn't have to play (this week). It wouldn't have been pretty, but that's why we practice and that's why they pay us to coach these guys. We've got to get these guys coached up in the next week."
Jim Grobe,It's a tough environment. I think our guys will enjoy it.
Jim Grobe,He has a great desire to be good and help the team. And he has a short memory. I'm kind of surprised he's handled it as well as he has. He's got the chance to be something special.
Jim Grobe,"We've got a bunch of kids that like to play. One thing we're lacking is consistency. But we've got so many guys getting reps right now, you don't expect to see a lot of consistency this early in the spring. We're giving a lot of kids a chance to play and compete."
Dave Grohl,Going out and playing music - that's what I do. I don't do much else.
Dave Grohl,All I really had was a suitcase and my drums. So I took them up to Seattle and hoped it would work.
Dave Grohl,Through Kurt I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down.
Marcus Gronholm,"It was a good fight until yesterday night, Loeb was very good here. We have won this rally many times and I'm happy for that. Today we had to be cautious not to hit any stones or holes which could do damage to the car, it was not fun to drive the last stages."
Marcus Gronholm,The car seems to be good and I am happy with that but the driver's mistakes are not good.
Marcus Gronholm,"There's no doubt, the best way to celebrate my birthday would be with champagne on the winner's podium, but we have a lot of work to do before I can think about that. I had a good feeling with the Focus WRC in the [pre-season] test and I hope to regain that during the shakedown ahead of the start on Friday."
Walter Gropius,Specialists are people who always repeat the same mistakes.
Walter Gropius,Architecture begins where engineering ends.
Walter Gropius,"Architects, painters, and sculptors must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of a building both as an entity and in its separate parts. Only then will their work be imbued with the architectonic spirit which it has lost as ''salon art.'' Together let us desire, conceive, and create the new structure of the future, which will embrace architecture and sculpture and painting in one unity and which will one day rise toward heaven from the hands of a million workers like the crystal symbol of a new faith."
Walter Gropius,"A modern, harmonic and lively architecture is the visible sign of an authentic democracy."
Bill Gross,"Too much debt, geopolitical risk and several bubbles have created a very unstable environment which can turn any minute, ... More than any point in the past 20 or 30 years, there's potential for a reversal."
Bill Gross,"As long as the stock market does what it does, and keeps going up, the wealth effect is going to transmit into a fairly strong U.S. economy and preclude the Fed from easing rates,"
Bill Gross,"Value is returning to the Treasury market,"
Bill Gross,"Central banks don't rest at one rate for long. If only to impart a bid to the U.S. housing market, they (the Federal Reserve) may have to start cutting again as early as the end of the year."
Bill Gross,"Stocks historically return more than almost all other alternative investments but only when priced right when the race begins, ... If you start from day one with P/Es too high or, importantly, dividends too low, you will not obtain equity returns in excess of bonds."
Bill Gross,"Companies have been diluting your equity via stock options claiming that management needs incentives of millions of dollars just to get up in the morning and come in to work, ... Then they pick you off by trading on insider information, selling shares before the bad news hits and you have a chance to get out."
Bill Gross,"The current, rather mild U.S. recovery has been driven by asset appreciation/consumption and not employment or capex [capital expenditure] growth. Future growth is dependent on additional asset appreciation in real estate and stocks if Asia continues to absorb much of our investment and many of our jobs."
Bill Gross,for the foreseeable future.
Bill Gross,"The days of eating salad may be over, but 5 [percent return] is ample sustenance in a low inflationary environment."
Bill Gross,Higher energy costs plus higher interest rates increase the risk of recession.
Bill Gross,"By the time 10-year and 2-year Treasuries reach parity, as is almost the case now, the economy is typically slowing and the Fed is at or near the end of its tightening cycle, ... We are due for what appears to be a 2 percent or less Gross Domestic Product growth rate in 2006, a rate sure to stop the Fed and to induce eventual ease at some point later in the year."
Bill Gross,"If the economy slows down, if housing moves back down, then at some point late in 2006 the Fed starts to lower rates. That's why a 10-year note yield at 4.55 percent is a decent value as opposed to overvalued."
Bill Gross,It is telling us that we have a slower economy ahead.
Bill Gross,"I think ... that the economy is declining,"
Bill Gross,"The Fed knows that the economy is in terrible shape and that they must bring down short-term rates to the level of inflation. If inflation keeps coming down, the Fed, to a certain extent, has to chase inflation."
Bill Gross,"What it suggests this time is a 2 percent economy in 2006, as opposed to a recession."
Bill Gross,"thoughtful, secular approach to the chairmanship, focused on the long-term evolution of the U.S. and the global economy."
Bill Gross,"There's nothing really wrong with [some of the things GE has done], ... It's to the advantage of a company to borrow cheaply and sell stock at a high P/E ratio. That's what companies can do to assist in growing earnings."
Bill Gross,"With all this consumer debt, business debt, government debt, smaller movements in interest rates have a magnified effect... a small movement can tip the boat."
Bill Gross,"If we had to forecast (and we do), we believe a range of 3 to 4Â½ percent for 10-year nominal Treasuries will prevail during most of our secular timeframe,"
Bill Gross,I firmly believe this is going to catch on.
Bill Gross,"If we had to forecast (and we do), we believe a range of 3 to 4Â½ percent for 10-year nominal Treasuries will prevail during most of our secular timeframe."
David Gross,Science is truly a wonderful way of life. Most of the questions that need to be answered have not been answered. There are marvelous questions waiting for answers that need marvelous young minds to attack them.
David Gross,"I looked at his previous work and I was extremely impressed with his creativity, his eye for talent and his eye for lighting. He is totally in touch with what needs to be done to make great product and he won't sacrifice anything.Â He's a real perfectionist. It's exciting to have someone like him on our team."
David Gross,"When the Medicare drug benefit was passed, AARP issued a challenge to the drug industry to keep increases at least to the rate of inflation until people had better coverage. By and large, that's not happening, ... Prices are going up more than twice the rate of inflation."
David Gross,"When the Medicare drug benefit was passed, AARP issued a challenge to the drug industry to keep increases at least to the rate of inflation until people had better coverage. By and large, that's not happening. Prices are going up more than twice the rate of inflation."
David Gross,"Those countries that use firewalls or otherwise restrict the ability of their citizens to obtain access to information are hurting themselves, especially when it comes to their ability to compete economically,"
Michael Gross,We're trying the best that we can. Our trucks are quiet for garbage trucks but first thing in the morning it doesn't take much to make a lot of noise.
Michael Gross,"While it is a school district responsibility, the special-ed teachers get no support. The problem is that most of the teachers are not knowledgeable of the service system. And the teachers are not given time to learn the service system."
Michael Gross,The city made up its mind that the store had to go and they weren't going to spare any expense.
Michael Gross,"Relational databases just could not meet the [data volume] requirements, so we turned to in-memory databases."
Michael Gross,It's purely up to the federal government to regulate standards for automotive safety.
Michael Gross,"I feed him interesting food, like chutneys and sardines and jalapenos, because I'm training him to be an adventuresome eater."
Michael Gross,"They say in this, for example, ... that they will get back to any consumer within 60 days. Can you imagine being stranded in a foreign country, or even in Chicago without your bags and calling up and they're going to tell you they'll get back to you in 60 days?"
Michael Gross,"We've had inquires about adult education and prep courses,"
Michael Gross,"It's a small operation, compared to anybody like Waste Management. We're not a Wall Street company. The nice thing about that is, if we want to do something, we do it. We don't have to run it up the corporate flagpole."
Michael Gross,"People who commit crimes against children serve their time, however those children are scarred by this for life. We want to do everything we can to protect them against that."
Michael Gross,It was then I decided I wanted to be in the travel business.
Michael Gross,The hardest thing in doing this book was finding out who lived there.
Michael Gross,"[Gross also made a memorable appearance as a psychologist on Michael J. Fox's last episode of] Spin City ... (Michael) just sort of hit me with his hand after we finished and said, 'It feels just like the old days, doesn't it?' And I said, 'Yeah, it really does!'"
Michael Gross,"Investors looked to KPMG for tax advice. They looked to us as an investment adviser to execute a variety of stock and option transactions, We got out of the business of working with large accounting firms more than five years ago."
Michael Gross,"ACORN has the proven ability to organize and mobilize its membership for community outreach, and we are pleased to support them in this all-out effort to reach hurricane victims and put them in contact with their lender."
Rex Grossman,That was our game plan going in. We saw on tape their safeties come down low for run support and we just used Bernard's speed with our (pass) protection to get a couple plays down the field.
Rex Grossman,"I'm OK with it, and I got all the reps in practice this week and had a good week of practice and prepared like I was starting. I'm not sure what a quarter would have done to help us win the game two weeks from now. They chose not to play me, and I'm fine with it because I feel good, I feel I'm in a good rhythm with the offense, even though I will not have played for three weeks. I didn't play for a year and a half."
Rex Grossman,"Because I've been hurt and I was unbalanced on one leg, hurt the other leg, everything's been out of whack. He's just so good about knowing the human body and everything to get everything working together and flexible. That's been my routine."
Rex Grossman,"Obviously, we're extremely mad and hurt and (ticked) off."
Rex Grossman,"Grossman didn't hurt himself at all. He was solid. Nothing eye-popping, but he's got a quick release and good instincts. His footwork needs a little work, but he looked good."
Rex Grossman,"It was tough, but when I got hurt, I knew it was going to be a long process. It took about four or five months to start running. Once I started running I didn't feel like I was rehabbing as much as just working out."
Rex Grossman,"I think that's just human nature to make you want to work harder to improve yourself, and I think that'll be a positive for me."
Rex Grossman,"I've worked really hard to get back healthy, to get to this point. Just to get to this point has been a struggle. I feel like I'm almost healthy and ready to go."
Rex Grossman,"It'll be fun just to get my start again and once again playing against a legend I grew up admiring. It's just going to be a great time. I'm really looking forward to getting back out there and having had a victory there, it might help psychologically."
Rex Grossman,"It's going to be fun to go back and play there. Obviously, I'm going to remember what happened. Everything will come full circle. I'll think about it a little bit. Mostly, I'll be thinking about what I'm supposed to do."
Rex Grossman,"I'm going to naturally make plays. I'm not going to force anything. There's a fine line between just being a gunslinger and running the offense. I'd like to be 90% running offense, with that other 10% being my own personality."
Rex Grossman,The lack of experience is not what I would wish (for) going into this game - especially in the third year of my career. I don't feel like a rookie going into it - somewhere in between there.
Rex Grossman,We're extremely mad and hurt. But the only way to look at it is as a learning experience.
Rex Grossman,"Justin has definitely gotten a lot better in my eyes. I feel like he's playing with more confidence and making big catches out there. I trust him to come down with those plays and he's extremely smart, he's gotten a better understanding of defenses and how to run his routes and what coach Turner is asking him to do."
Rex Grossman,"I'm just glad I could contribute at the end [of the season]. This is the crazy set of circumstances I'm in. It feels good, and I'm going with it. It feels good to be 2-0 at Lambeau."
Andrew Grove,Demand for the Pentium processor with MMX technology and the Pentium II processor is strong and we are ramping production at a record rate.
Andrew Grove,"This industry is the fundamental industry of our times -- not just chips, not just Intel, but the high-technology industry, ... For those of you that have a stake in there, I'd like to share my confidence and enthusiasm for this industry long-term. So keep the faith."
Andrew Grove,"Just as you would not permit a fellow employee to steal a piece of office equipment, you shouldn't let anyone walk away with the time of his fellow managers."
Andrew Grove,"Our biggest competition in achieving our ambitions, ... is a television set."
Andrew Grove,"We are delighted with the excellent acceptance of Pentium and Pentium Pro processor-based PCs and servers, which has produced a stronger third quarter than we had originally expected."
Jon Gruden,"We haven't had great continuity, but we're playing a lot of young guys. That injection of youth is something that we're excited about."
Jon Gruden,It's good to have a young quarterback with that kind of talent.
Jon Gruden,"It's been a while since we've had an injection of young talent on this team, whether we all want to admit it or not. The fact is, we have some young guys who we need to play this year, and we need them to play well. And there's a lot of them."
Jon Gruden,"I am sure he is going to struggle throughout the season. He certainly delivered in his first game, having been out for two months."
Jon Gruden,"Obviously I'm very disappointed. It's a serious matter. Very serious matter. Serious matters get dealt with very seriously by society and obviously by us. I love my brother. I haven't talked to him, but I will. All I can say from the Gruden family is I'm very apologetic."
Jon Gruden,"I don't know, I'd have to really look hard into the situation there. It's always a risk when you draft anybody. Some guys more than others."
Jon Gruden,"If you understand our salary cap, you have to be logical. If Barry Sanders , for instance, came out of retirement, if we were interested we probably couldn't get real interested. So you've got to temper your enthusiasm with the reality of our situation."
Jon Gruden,"He thought it would be best for him to sit the rest of the game and try to get right for next week, ... We don't really know the severity of this hamstring. It might just be a contusion of some kind. ... We're meeting with him at this time and I can't speculate publicly any more until Carnell and the doctors have had a chance to look at this further."
Jon Gruden,"I'm sure he is. He's got a lot of pride, he's been through a lot with the rehab to get well, with the knee, with the back. I think, in his own mind, he's probably a little bit frustrated. But he's a team guy and he knows it's a long battle back."
Jon Gruden,"I can't say enough about him. He got into camp on time, didn't miss a practice and will be a real asset for us."
Jon Gruden,"You can't worry about instinct. You have to do what you feel is right at the time, do your homework and make the calls. You have to live with the calls you make and if your heart is in it, at least you feel good at the end of the night, no matter what happens."
Jon Gruden,"We noticed dramatic improvement during training camp. We had a number of backs go through the entire 1,800 to 2,000 plays with no fumbles. We've had two in the preseason games, but we don't want any. We have made dramatic strides in ball security."
Jon Gruden,"They know this is an area that we've got to make dramatic improvement in. If this guy can come through or if it's Matt Bryant, so be it. So far, we like what we've seen out here in the last four or five days from both of them. But Todd France definitely stood out."
Jon Gruden,"A guy who has that criteria and history of bringing his team from behind, the fourth-down play that he made on the touchdown, made us concerned with him. But our defense played very well."
Jon Gruden,I think we have beaten some pretty darn good football teams and have been fairly consistent throughout the year. We've got a talented defense. We have a good running game and we are looking forward to seeing what we can do. Every year there are dark horses that jump onto the scene.
Jon Gruden,"I'm more concerned with Shelton's injury than I am concerned with Nate. Nate's a fine football player. He played a lot snaps for us last year -- not a lot of people know that,"
Jon Gruden,"I'm pleased with where we are running the football and that's a start, ... There are some good signs, some physical signs that we could be a good running team."
Jon Gruden,"Everybody is an option. It's going to come down to good, solid execution. You've got to knock somebody off the ball when they pretty much know you're running it. That's what makes the game great."
Jon Gruden,"It's not good. It has not been good at all, ... The penalties have hurt us and our lack of execution hasn't been nearly what it was a year ago. We have to get that thing going."
Jon Gruden,"He had to have his hand stitched together. I mean, jeez, calm down. Before the game, doctors were coming in there like something happened and he had to have his hand stitched up. I've heard it all, now."
Jon Gruden,"If he's ready to go, he'll play, ... All I can say is the doctors will let us know. Carnell's going to let us know."
Jon Gruden,"We're not going to let one defeat or two defeats or a negative road trip set us back from our goals. We realize this is a work in progress, this football team. We have a long way to get where we want to be,"
Jon Gruden,We've got a guy named Alstott that's been known to do some damage (in short yardage). We have some deception there too now with a couple of tight ends that can not only block but get down the field and do some things.
Jon Gruden,He's got to make some strides in terms of consistency. He's in a competitive situation. That's about as well as I can put it right now.
Jon Gruden,"He's a natural catcher. He has a great background returning punts in college, so obviously he has potential."
Jon Gruden,"I would just like to say it is a great feeling, a great accomplishment by our team. I am very proud of them. A credit to the New Orleans Saints, they came in here under adverse circumstances, obviously, missing some key players and they competed greatly today. We hung in there and we earned our 11th victory. We look forward to continuing the season at home next week. I am really proud of our football team."
Jon Gruden,I'm really excited with our ability to make field goals. Hopefully that's a winning edge for us this season.
Bill Guerin,It was the mind-set of the whole team to get to the front of the net. We hadn't done it much the first three games. They do a good job of blocking shots. It took hard work and determination from us.
Bill Guerin,"He was easily my biggest influence â€” no one is even close. He was a Canadian guy who played at St. Mike's, and for Canada's national team and he played pro. He knows the game. He knew how to develop young players. When college scouts and pro scouts came into the picture, he knew what to do. I wouldn't have had a clue if it wasn't for him."
Bill Guerin,You're not going to miss that many games and then just get your spot back. I have to work and prove myself.
Bill Guerin,I like where my game is headed.
Bill Guerin,"I understand it's not the most popular opinion, but I like fighting. We're trying to sell our game, right? And we have something that no other sport has, and yet we seem almost embarrassed to have it. I don't get it."
Bill Guerin,"Penalties had been an issue and we were much better tonight. But our discipline in the last five minutes, we really have to clean that up."
Bill Guerin,"We didn't have much of a choice. We are not going to be in the clear for a while. Sometimes you just gain a lot by stepping back a little. We have to focus on the positive things. We all here believe in good, hard work ethic."
Bill Guerin,It's no surprise to play against the U.S. or Canada. It's not as much of a culture shock.
Bill Guerin,I think our group is closer. We have a lot better chemistry. I think we believe in each other.
Bill Guerin,"Hopefully, it's the beginning of a new era. You know, we aren't the only guys to ever put this jersey on. ... We've made a lot of steps, and hopefully the next generation will continue."
Bill Guerin,"It's definitely an advantage. We've got guys that have played together the last three or four years. A lot of teams really juggled their rosters. The core of our team is back, most of the team is back. We're sitting good right now."
Bill Guerin,"ItÂ´s definitely an advantage. WeÂ´ve got guys that have played together the last three or four years. A lot of teams really juggled their rosters, ... The core of our team is back, most of the team is back. WeÂ´re sitting good right now."
Edgar Guest,"You ought to be true for the sake of the folks who think you are true. You never should stoop to a deed that your folks think you would not do. If you are false to yourself, be the blemish but small, you have injured your folks; you have been false to them all."
Edgar Guest,But here in the struggle for fame and pelf / I want to be able to like myself. / I don't want to look at myself and know / That I'm bluster and buff and empty show.
Edgar Guest,There is an education of the mind / Which all require and parents only start. / But there is training of a nobler kind / And that's the education of the heart. /  Lessons that are most difficult to give / Are Faith and Courage and the way to live.
Edgar Guest,You are the person who has to decide. Whether you'll do it or toss it aside; You are the person who makes up your mind. Whether you'll lead or will linger behind. Whether you'll try for the goal that's afar. Or just be contented to stay where you are.
Edgar Guest,I take the family shopping round. The markets of the world.
Edgar Guest,"The best of all the preachers are the men who live their creeds,/ For to see good put in action is what everybody needs."
Ernesto Guevara,Silence is argument carried out by other means.
Ernesto Guevara,"I don't know if the Cuban revolution will survive or not. It's difficult to say. But [if it doesn't] . . . don't come looking for me among the refugees in the embassies. I've had that experience, and I'm not ever going to repeat it. I will go out with a machine gun in my hand, to the barricades. . . I'll keep fighting to the end."
Ernesto Guevara,The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall.
Ernesto Guevara,Until victory always
Ernesto Guevara,"Many will call me an adventurer - and that I am, only one of a different sort: one of those who risks his skin to prove his platitudes."
Michael Guido,We are seeing decent physical demand on pullbacks. Lower central banks sales are also boosting prices.
Michael Guido,You're bringing in a new segment into the market that was never there. A lot of investor money is pouring into gold and commodities. It's become a valid asset class.
Michael Guido,The euro has broken out against the dollar with a couple of rate hikes ahead. That's lifting gold.
Michael Guido,"With crude oil strong above $60, it's going to help the inflationary aspect of gold."
Michael Guido,"We want to make sure the school system gives the best education possible, ... (But) I'm not going to tell Dr. Artis how to run the school system ? that's his and the school board's decision."
Ron Guidry,That's the one pitch he needs to master better than he's thrown it here.
Ron Guidry,He usually says either 'yes' or 'no' and people think that's because of the language barrier. I think that's all he has to say. He's as calm as anybody I've ever met.
Ron Guidry,"I hope I can get in the door with that, being left-handed and pitching here, being pretty successful. I've talked to him two or three times the last two or three days. He's been fun to talk to."
Ron Guidry,"I hope I can get in the door with that. He's been fun to talk to. I get an enjoyment out of talking to him, just getting to know his routines and what I'm going to need to do to make him as good as he can be."
Ron Guidry,"I spoke to my family about it, and they said 'Maybe you should give it a shot before you get too old,' ... I'd been thinking about it, and if you're going to do something, as far as I was concerned you should do it while you're still kind of young."
Ron Guidry,"I took this job because I was confident in my own ability and knowledge of pitching to do it. I would never have left home to take a minor-league job, but I also didn't want to get too old and one day say I never tried it."
Ozzie Guillen,I never worry about this kid. He is throwing the ball well and he has thrown the ball where it is supposed to be.
Ozzie Guillen,"I told him not to worry about it. I told him not to put too much pressure on himself. The way he hits, his timing has to be perfect. But there are still a lot of games left down here and he's going to have plenty of at-bats to get his stuff together."
Ozzie Guillen,"We don't need superstars. We need guys who worry about the name on the chest more than the name on the back of the uniform. The only bad thing about this was, we won a lot of games by one run or two runs, and that drives me crazy."
Ozzie Guillen,"We have to get there. We feel better coming here getting a little lead. We have to worry about ourselves. The way we're playing right now, I feel pretty good about this team."
Ozzie Guillen,I don't worry about the ballpark. I worry about the guy who's pitching tomorrow.
Ozzie Guillen,You want to know the truth? Because I'm the manager.
Ozzie Guillen,"I was concerned to see how he did, ... But . . . I trust this kid."
Ozzie Guillen,I always trust my players.
Ozzie Guillen,"We trust him and believe in him. He was so insecure. The thing about Jose was, he don't want to let people down. When he signed a big contract, people talked about how much money he made, he should win every game."
Ozzie Guillen,"Duque is going to be in the bullpen, ... If Duque has trouble coming out of the bullpen, we've got to make a decision on what to do with him."
Ozzie Guillen,We are going to try and supply more run support for our pitchers. Thome is going to be successful because he's not going to play first base every day. He'll be healthy.
Ozzie Guillen,"That happened in spring training that he didn't make the team because we didn't have space for him, ... The way (Jose) Contreras has thrown and (Orlando Hernandez) has thrown, it's not easy to put him in the rotation. We will do what is best for the team."
Ozzie Guillen,"If you're not ready to come here and go by my rules, you're not going to come in. My team already told me, 'This is your rule and we're behind you 100 percent.' I had to call a couple of my players to see if I let them down. Maybe in their mind they say, 'We need Marte and Ozzie's doing this stuff.' No. Everybody has to be on the same page and that's why I did it."
Ozzie Guillen,"That's my rules. If you don't like it, get it out of here. If he's got a personal problem, let me or one of my coaches know."
Ozzie Guillen,"Hey, I've got to rest my players, ... They're really drained out the last two weeks."
Ozzie Guillen,"You have those guys in the lineup, you pray for the best. He was throwing strikes. He throws a quality pitch, and you have to do that with that team because they will score in a heartbeat."
Ozzie Guillen,"I'm not going to say they hit him on purpose. But (Ramirez) never hit anybody. When you see how big a game Dye had, I don't like the way it happened."
Ozzie Guillen,"I won't say he hit him on purpose, but this kid never hit anyone. When you throw 70-mph [stuff] over there and hit the guy with no reason, I don't know if it's intentional or not. But [I've been] in the big leagues for a lot of years, and when you do that, you second guess yourself about it."
Ozzie Guillen,"This is for all of Venezuela, ... I'm filled with pride, that a Venezuelan can hold this trophy in his hands."
Ozzie Guillen,"It's something I wear with pride because it's the first one I ever had. I still wear it. I might wear both my rings now and look like a pimp, a pimp daddy."
Ozzie Guillen,"He has potential to be the closer. As long as he stays healthy, then he'll be good."
Ozzie Guillen,"The guy that did it should be brought to Biggio and he can get him back, ... I told the police, 'Don't put him in jail. Bring him to me in the dugout.'Â"
Ozzie Guillen,"I told the police, 'Don't put him in jail, bring him to me in the dugout. Hopefully, that won't happen again."
Ozzie Guillen,My philosophy is give me the best pitching staff you can give me and everything else we can figure out.
Ozzie Guillen,"Hopefully, my philosophy works and helps him."
Ozzie Guillen,"I think the pitching sets the tone. When you have a pitcher go out and have a performance like that, everything is going to go right."
Ozzie Guillen,We just had a lot of patience with him. He'd take a lot of heat and we'd take a lot of heat. Thank God we stayed with him.
Ozzie Guillen,It seems like he's afraid to [make mistakes]. He feels like he's getting to the point where he's embarrassed or letting people down. Just play; play the game.
Ozzie Guillen,"He made two mistakes, but I think he was outstanding. He threw the ball better and hopefully he continues to progress."
Ozzie Guillen,"When you have the lead, it's easier to (afford) mistakes."
Ozzie Guillen,"He hugged me [Tuesday]. He talked to me before the game and wished me good luck. He told me that he was proud of me and the job I did. He's not the type of manager that thinks because he won [a World Series] that he's bigger than the game. This man, I have a lot of respect for him."
Ozzie Guillen,They trade everyone. I don't know what's the reason to trade all those kids.
Ozzie Guillen,We just had horses--- pitching. We didn't pitch good.
Ozzie Guillen,We've just had horses -- teams.
Ozzie Guillen,"Luis is not the type of person to say 'Hi' to everyone, ... To me it's an honor just for Luis to say, 'Yes,' and come here and be with us."
Ozzie Guillen,You have to understand A.J.. You hate him when he's on the other side.
Ozzie Guillen,"One, it's a hard thing to throw a no-hitter. Two, I just want to win."
Ozzie Guillen,This isn't golf. It's supposed to be loud.
Ozzie Guillen,should be a Gold Glove winner.
Ozzie Guillen,I think he's a Gold Glove third baseman and we expect a lot from him.
Ozzie Guillen,a taco stand and getting some funny looks.
Ozzie Guillen,Seattle fouled off a lot of pitches; they were fighting. They were making Vazquez throw strikes and fight for every at-bat. That's why his pitch count was so high.
Ozzie Guillen,"I don't disrespect anybody. I was on vacation with my family. I got a notice that my family could not go, because they had only so many people that can go there. I asked permission (to the White Sox), and said if my kids can't go to the White House, then I am not going to the White House. My kids are the most important thing to me."
Ozzie Guillen,"I apologize to Alex Rodriguez, his family, his fans, the New York Yankee organization, to the White Sox organization. That's the first time I feel like I did something wrong. I've been in a lot of controversial things before, but I think I started this one and I'm going to finish it. ... What I did to Alex was wrong. He can do whatever he wants. If he wants to play for Japan, fine for him."
Ozzie Guillen,"I apologize to Alex Rodriguez, his family, his fans, the New York Yankee organization, to the White Sox organization."
Ozzie Guillen,"It's great for the White Sox organization. It's something we need. We hardly have anything in the Hall of Fame. Hopefully, he can hit another one and then we could have two."
Ozzie Guillen,"I have faith in him,"
Ozzie Guillen,"[The White Sox are 9-1 in the postseason and 14-1 dating to the last week of the regular season, but it won't go to their heads.] Today I was in the clubhouse and we were watching the highlights, ... You do get goose bumps. But in the meanwhile, you've got to be careful. No matter what you do today, just prepare yourself for tomorrow. Don't get too cocky."
Ozzie Guillen,"Obviously, Carl has helped the team a lot and Carl has been good, but I wish I had more consistency from those guys. Especially now in the stretch when we have Paulie [Konerko] carrying this team for real ? Paulie and [Juan] Uribe. Hopefully one of those guys comes out the next couple of weeks and helps them."
Ozzie Guillen,I talked to [Garcia] about it this morning. [Pitching coach Don] Cooper is going to talk to him. Is something bothering him? Is he tired? We could move him back or have him skip a start.
Ozzie Guillen,"He doesn't like batting sixth? He's got two choices: Not playing or batting sixth,"
Ozzie Guillen,I like it when people don't expect us to do anything and expect the big boys to do something. Maybe we sneak up and bite them. We are like Cinderella.
Ozzie Guillen,"I said before the game, I don't believe they're going to be tired. They showed it."
Ozzie Guillen,"I think it will be great for baseball. I think he's the greatest hitter ever.... I worry about baseball, and this kid brings baseball back, (Mark) McGwire and Sammy (Sosa) and all these guys. People hated baseball then, after the strike. A lot of people will be mad when he breaks the record, but I hope he does."
Ozzie Guillen,He was the only player in the history of baseball that everybody loved.
Ozzie Guillen,"You just saw, ... a Chicago baseball game."
Ozzie Guillen,He's been great for the game of baseball. Everything that man touches is magic.
Ozzie Guillen,His velocity is fine. The location of the pitches is not good. ... He (hung) a couple breaking balls to the wrong guys.
Ozzie Guillen,"Everybody thinks the players who come from Latin America were shining shoes, ... I lived good."
Ozzie Guillen,"He's got a chance to be a pretty good ball player. He's got all the ability. He's going to get a shot, hopefully he can take advantage."
Pat Guinan,"The mother of all droughts in southwest Missouri occurred from 1952 to 1956 when precipitation in Joplin fell more than 81 inches below normal in a five-year period. Fortunately, we're no where near that right now."
Pat Guinan,This was like manna from heaven for the entire state. And we need a lot more.
Pat Guinan,"This is a welcome step in the right direction, but we have a long way to go to make up the deficits."
Pat Guinan,"The consequences will be dire if we don't receive decent replenishment of water supplies, above and below ground, before summer arrives."
Kenny Guinn,"What she is planning to do, I'm quite sure, is leave that to the staff,"
Kenny Guinn,"is important to all of us in terms of water, and open land and growth."
Kenny Guinn,"The citizens of Nevada have already begun volunteering to assist in the relief efforts, ... We applaud them for their dedication and compassion, and urge them to work with officials from Nevada's Department of Public Safety's Division of Emergency Management to begin the process to volunteer for deployment."
Kenny Guinn,"On the average, being a member of Congress is an 80- to 100-hour (a week) job,"
Kenny Guinn,We must rely less on spreadsheets and funding formulas and more on common sense.
Kenny Guinn,"There is something permanent, and something extremely profound, in owning a home."
Jeff Guiot,It was an awesome environment and a back-and-forth game. Our kids did a good job of handling some adversity and getting the win.
Jeff Guiot,"Deon has been our unsung hero all year long. He plays great defense, and he's very unselfish. We wouldn't be conference and tournament champs without him."
Jeff Guiot,We haven't got caught up in the whole 'no respect' thing. We don't worry about what we can't control. ... The 10 guys in the locker room are the only ones that matter to us.
Jeff Guiot,"Sheldon is a special player who can win a basketball game in several different ways. With his defense, his passing and his scoring. Not too many players come along who can do that."
Jeff Guiot,"A great pep band can be a valuable asset to any basketball team. But their hearts have to be into what they are doing. They have to be excited. And the music has to be an upbeat, modern song. If that is the case the pep band is a big boost."
Sacha Guitry,The best way to turn a woman's head is to tell her she has a beautiful profile
Sacha Guitry,We admire virtue in a woman as long as it doesnt get in our way.
Sacha Guitry,The little I know I owe to my ignorance.
Sacha Guitry,I would gladly admit women are superior to men if only they would stop trying to be the same as us.
Sacha Guitry,"When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her."
Sacha Guitry,An ideal wife is one who remains faithful to you but tries to be just as charming as if she weren't.
Abdullah Gul,The words attributed to me are not correct.
Abdullah Gul,"Our friendly relationship of mutual understanding with the United States will go on, ... One should not limit it to a motion."
Abdullah Gul,"It was only in December (2004) that European Union leaders agreed to open membership talks with Turkey on Oct. 3 (2005). Yet as the date looms, doubts over whether the talks will start keep recurring. This is not because of any fault of my government, but rather because of certain countries within the EU,"
Abdullah Gul,Powell was simply expressing hope. There is no deadline for Turkey to respond.
Abdullah Gul,"[And that's what she did. En route home, Hughes singled out to reporters] a really interesting meeting ... a common man in Turkey."
Abdullah Gul,The EU can make a contribution to the economy.
Abdullah Gul,"There is no other country which harms its own interests this much,"
Abdullah Gul,"Turkey is a sufficiently strong and secure country. Such incidents happen everywhere, in London, in Paris, everywhere,"
Abdullah Gul,"We reached agreement; I am going to Luxembourg,"
Jeff Gundy,"Everybody's got an opinion and usually misguided. They don't know him. What his basketball character has revealed is that his will to win is in the upper top five in the league, combined with a talent level in the top five of the league. That is a very rare, rare combination."
Jeff Gundy,I'd be very surprised if they didn't win a game.
Jeff Gundy,"Our guys competed really hard for the most part. It's wasn't like we overwhelmed them with talent, that's for sure."
Jeff Gundy,"It's hard against a quality team like Jersey. They're very, very good defensively."
Jeff Gundy,"This is not a year that we should take a mulligan on from blame, from the coaching perspective, from the team-building perspective. This is not a year of injuries. It's a year where we could have, despite the injuries, still been in the playoff hunt."
Jeff Gundy,"(Yao) did all right, but it's not about individual performance in this league. It's team play and playing collectively. He's still trying to get back in game mode, and we know it will take a while before he's back at full strength. I thought overall, though, he did some good things, but he's still not at 100 percent."
Jeff Gundy,"Well, it's been my history with him when he goes out of the game, he's sat out in the past. I don't think he takes himself out lightly."
Jeff Gundy,"Every team relies on greatness down the stretch. However, I do believe that good teams can function efficiently with or without one player. Our chore to function without the one player is going to be tested."
Jeff Gundy,"The positive is they found something they can fix. It's been a string of bad fortune for him injury-wise, but we're happy the doctor has been able to locate something we can do something about."
Jeff Gundy,"I tried to talk to him, ... to tell him this was fate, that it didn't go through; should we think about moving on?"
Jeff Gundy,"It starts always with the two best guys (Yao and McGrady) and their energy level. Tracy McGrady obviously was very efficient tonight and when he is efficient, we as a team have a better chance of being efficient."
Jeff Gundy,It starts always with our two best guys and their energy level. McGrady obviously was very efficient tonight. Yao is a long way away from being in the type of shape he was in prior to his injury. But that he is in as good of shape as he is in is a direct result of his incredible dedication.
Jeff Gundy,"There is no question that he will be competitive and high energy. But how effective he would be, really, I don't have any idea. We'll have to see."
Jeff Gundy,"When he feels like he's capable of playing and the trainers and doctors concur and I concur, then he'll go back out there and play."
Jeff Gundy,"Hard playing, very few mistakes, no tricks coming at you ? they're just going to compete harder on defense than you're going to play on offense and (be) ultra prepared. No one talks about it, but I think without question, when all is said and done, he is a Hall of Fame coach. I really believe that with all my heart."
Jeff Gundy,Poor defense on the last play.
Jeff Gundy,"It's a testament to his dedication that he was able to, after six weeks off, play 32 minutes. Very few people with his injury and his natural conditioning problem, being 7-6, would be able to do that. But he's got an unusual amount of dedication to his team. He should be really commended for that."
Jeff Gundy,He's got a level of dedication to his profession that very few have.
Jeff Gundy,The league itself should not put any coach or any organization in position that you're better served to lose than win. That's why the change in the lottery was great. They took that conflict of interest away. They need to take the conflict away from the Clippers gaining financially and with home-court advantage by losing.
Jeff Gundy,"We have enough players, and we've developed a game. Most of it goes to the belief. It's been that way since the practice after the Sacramento game (the Nov. 2 season opener) that he's been in and out so much."
Jeff Gundy,"I thought our basketball IQ at the end of the game, up 11, could have been a lot better."
Mike Gundy,"They gave up 10 points. I did not know how it was going to work with all the jumping around we did. As an offensive coach, if a team did that to me, I would just run it. However, that is not their team."
Mike Gundy,Recruiting is not a perfect science but our staff worked hard because we know how important it is.
Mike Gundy,"We look at the problems from the last game and try to get them fixed, but ... none of that really matters any more. What can we do to score enough points to beat Colorado? That's all that matters."
Mike Gundy,We pride ourselves here on special teams.
Mike Gundy,"Donovan has had more practice reps, but in the last 10-12 days, Bobby has gotten considerably better. We thought if he could take the majority of practice reps, it would give him the opportunity to excel."
Mike Gundy,He's got some potential to make some big plays.
Mike Gundy,We knew they were going to make mistakes. We knew they were going to make big plays. We didn't want them to think if they did something wrong they weren't going to get back in forever.
Mike Gundy,"We discussed it in a mature manner, and he handled it with integrity,"
Mike Gundy,Donovan started all the games in 2004 and took most of the reps with the first team in spring practice. It will benefit our team and the offense to have an up-and-coming youngster like Bobby Reid at quarterback.
Mike Gundy,I thought Al did a good job for just being thrown into the fire. He understands structure. He understands blitzes. He understands coverage and it has paid off for him.
Mike Gundy,Our coaching staff is very pleased with the signing class for today. We've addressed some needs that will really help us early in the season.
Mike Gundy,"We had to pull a guy in that has an unbelievable amount of integrity and character and say that we think that this guy has the potential to be better than you are at this position,"
Mike Gundy,I let my aggressiveness take me over there. A smart coach would have kicked a field goal.
Mike Gundy,We were dealt some adversity in the fourth quarter and we handled it very effectively in this game. We were able to drive the ball at the end. I wanted to go down there and score and not leave them any time on the clock.
James Gunn,"Scientists do their best work when they are in their early years. Writers' skills don't necessarily decay; if they can keep their interests and hopes alive (like Jack Williamson), their experience allows them greater depths to explore."
James Gunn,He put up with a lot of pain. ... I don't think many people would put up with what he had to put up with.
James Gunn,Return of the Living Dead.
James Gunn,Sean says he always had a feeling he should remain friends with Jenna and he never knew why. He believes it's because he knew we were meant to be together.
James Gunn,I can't think of any other genre that would have allowed me to have that much tonal and emotional freedom.
James Gunn,"The zombie is in a lot of ways the perfect horror movie bad guy. It plays on so many fears all at once. The fear of predators, the fear of disease and the fear of loved ones betraying us -- the ones we care about are turning around and trying to eat us."
James Gunn,"The compassion is instigated by the situation, and Godwin, a bit ham-handedly, belabors the situation so that there can be no doubt in the reader's mind, makes Marilyn sweet, young, and innocent (rather than a cold-blooded murderer or serial killer) so that reader will want to save her - and then the realization of the cold equations will be more effective."
James Gunn,"In hard-core science fiction in which characters are responding to a change in environment, caused by nature or the universe or technology, what readers want to see is how people cope, and so the character are present to cope, or fail to cope."
James Gunn,I hope I'm still alive to see an expedition set off for Mars.
James Gunn,"I don't know if there is any one secret to successful writing, but one important step is to move beyond imitation and discover what you can write that no one else can - that is, find out who you are and write that in an appropriate narrative and style."
James Gunn,"One should be willing to throw away a dozen ideas to come up with a good one, just as one should throw away a dozen words to come up with the right one."
James Gunn,That certainly is one approach to take. My own is to acknowledge the inner child and try to work with my first fascination with science fiction. I have tried to build on its idea content and narrative drive rather than to discard them.
James Gunn,It also is true that some ideas naturally work themselves out over a longer period of time than a single human life can encompass.
James Gunn,What you call the Golden Age tradition of stringing stories together into novels was not so much a tradition as a consequence of the fact that almost no genre SF novels were published between 1926 and 1946.
Nitin Gupta,Sony has tremendous brand strength in portable-audio players. And the digital-audio market is going to expand dramatically in the next few years.
Nitin Gupta,"Dell is going after Apple's low-hanging fruit with a price and memory capacity that are about the same as the Shuffle. It might be a more compelling device, with the screen and FM tuner, but Apple has its popular iTunes library and offers a better user experience."
Nitin Gupta,Transformational ideas like the Walkman are hard to come by these days.
Nitin Gupta,"Transformational ideas like the Walkman are hard to come by these days,"
Sanjay Gupta,"It's not the operation itself that is the concern, it's the anesthesia. That's a bigger risk than the operation."
Sanjay Gupta,You are actually seeing some motivations and movement in Iowa in the right direction. That needs to be a national priority.
Sanjay Gupta,We'll likely debunk quite a few misperceptions about the fitness and athleticism required to be a NASCAR racer.
George Gurdjieff,Every ceremony or rite has a value if it is performed without alteration. A ceremony is a book in which a great deal is written. Anyone who understands can read it. One rite often contains more than a hundred books.
George Gurdjieff,"We must strive for freedom if we strive for self-knowledge. The task of self-knowledge and of further self-development is of such importance and seriousness, it demands such intensity of effort, that to attempt it any old way and amongst other things is impossible. The person who undertakes this task must put it first in his life, which is not so long that he can afford to squander it on trifles."
George Gurdjieff,"Laughter relieves us of superfluous energy, which, if it remained unused, might become negative, that is, poison. Laughter is the antidote."
Xanana Gusmao,"The two governments will do everything to go to a solution with mutual benefit and respecting each other's sovereignty,"
Xanana Gusmao,"If we continue to roam, with no strength to enforce the law right at the beginning of our independence, by the time corruption develops deep roots it will be most difficult to combat it,"
Xanana Gusmao,"This agreement we made is to create a peaceful atmosphere. Depending on the situation, we can go (from) this meeting as a beginning of a possible cease-fire."
Tim Guter,"When it came to crunch time, he was there for us. He was a very calming influence for us. We knew if one of our defenders got beat, Shep was back there."
Tim Guter,"We had some really nice chances, some from way out. I knew if we got up two goals we wouldn't let the lead go. But as long as it was one goal, sometime West Carteret would go on the attack with confidence."
Tim Guter,"He is the ultimate team player. He sacrificed the glory for the betterment of the team. Wherever we needed him, he played."
David Guterson,"To persevere is always a reflection of the state of one's inner life, one's philosophy and one's perspective"
David Guterson,Writing became an obsessive compulsive habit but I had almost no money so I thought about being an urban firefighter and having lots of free time in which to write or becoming an English teacher and thinking about books and writers on a daily basis. That swayed me.
David Guterson,"When it comes time to sit down and write the next book, you're deathly afraid that you're not up to the task. That was certainly the case with me after Snow Falling on Cedars."
David Guterson,When I went to college I took a creative writing class and decided in a week to be a writer.
David Guterson,What sustains me is to be with my family and to write.
David Guterson,What some people interpret as brooding melancholy is serenity. I don't feel required to grasp all the time.
David Guterson,"People were going to wonder about me, about who I am and what makes me tick, and with time I decided that it didn't really bother me to share that."
David Guterson,My father is a practicing criminal law attorney in the Seattle area.
David Guterson,My book is traditional. It runs counter to the post-modern spirit.
David Guterson,It's a brooding melancholy that haunts me.
David Guterson,"It doesn't matter who you are, how many awards you've won, how popular you are, or how much critical acclaim you've had."
David Guterson,I'm not an urban person.
David Guterson,I'm interested in themes that endure from generation to generation.
David Guterson,I write because something inner and unconscious forces me to. That is the first compulsion. The second is one of ethical and moral duty. I feel responsible to tell stories that inspire readers to consider more deeply who they are.
David Guterson,I was born in Washington State and have lived here for 42 plus years.
David Guterson,"I was aware that there is an expectation that writers inevitably falter at this stage, that they fail to live up to the promise of their first successful book, that the next book never pleases the way the prior one did. It simply increased my sense of being challenged."
David Guterson,I think you have an obligation to share what you know as a writer.
David Guterson,I think of myself as a really happy person.
David Guterson,I often heard about his cases and I often sat in on his trials. In the late 1960s when I was growing up I wanted to be a crusader like him but I didn't want to wear a suit and commute.
David Guterson,"I have traveled the entire state and spent a lot of time out of doors. So I have known the landscape of the Columbia Basin for quite a while, and I have had this strong feeling about it for many years."
David Guterson,"At one level you're condemned to the voice you have. But within those confines, you have a certain amount of freedom to range among your possible voices."
David Guterson,"Time made me change. I gradually woke up to the realization that this is who I am, an author, a public figure, and I couldn't just hide in my study, tapping away at the keyboard and pretend that I didn't have a role to play beyond stringing words together."
David Guterson,"The sense that this world is an illusion, that desire is the root of suffering, the awareness of cause and effect-I have a great respect for all that."
David Guterson,Post-modernism is dead because it didn't address human needs.
David Guterson,Hemingway said the only way to write about a place is to leave it.
David Guterson,There's a certain nostalgia and romance in a place you left.
David Guterson,"The real question is: How do you react? What do you do next? Evade responsibilities? Bury yourself in work? What do you do? All three of my novels take up that question, although none gives an answer."
David Guterson,"I have relaxed into my persona as an author, although I used to fight that."
David Guterson,"I grew up in Seattle, but I always knew I wanted to leave."
David Guterson,I became paralyzed as an artist with writer's block.
David Guterson,Fiction is socially meaningful.
David Guterson,"Everybody has a world, and that world is completely hidden until we begin to inquire. As soon as we do, that entire world opens to us and yields itself. And you see how full and complex it is."
David Guterson,"Even though I may not intend it when I set out to write the book, these places just emerge as major players in what I'm doing, almost as if they are insisting on it."
David Guterson,"Don Quixote is one that comes to mind in comparison to mine, in that they both involve journeys undertaken by older men. That is unusual, because generally the hero of a journey story is very young."
David Guterson,Cities produce in me melancholy or a tension I don't need.
Arlo Guthrie,"With all of the history that he'd had with the Weavers, he really was a connection between my dad's era and the world of the late 60's."
Arlo Guthrie,Only the words of love kept alive are worthy of not being wasted
Arlo Guthrie,We would turn everything into songs in those days.
Arlo Guthrie,We live in an increasingly sophisticated world that makes it difficult to make simple comments on stuff. There are too many people on both sides of the border who are taking advantage of circumstances and the situation.
Arlo Guthrie,There's only one God. Call him whatever you want.
Arlo Guthrie,"I don't want a pickle, just want to ride on my motorsickle."
Arlo Guthrie,Greed and globalization aren't just America's fault.
Arlo Guthrie,There are people all over the world who are willing to exploit others. You can't just point the finger at America.
Arlo Guthrie,You can't have a light without a dark to stick it in.
Arlo Guthrie,"Everyone has a responsibility to not only tolerate another person's point of view, but also to accept it eagerly as a challenge to your own understanding. And express those challenges in terms of serving other people."
Arlo Guthrie,I'd rather have friends who care than friends who agree with me.
Arlo Guthrie,"But think of the last guy. For one minute, think of the last guy. Nobody's got it worse than that guy. Nobody in the whole world."
Arlo Guthrie,"You get people talking about being worried about their art, and dances... their culture being wiped out or taken over, and yet these same people are taking advantage of their people to use them as cheap labour."
Woody Guthrie,This Land Is Your Land
Woody Guthrie,"This land is your land, this land is my land, From California to the New York island, From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters, This land was made for you and me"
Woody Guthrie,I hate a song that makes you think that you are not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim or too ugly or too this or too that.
Woody Guthrie,"Yes, as through this world I've wandered I've seen lots of funny men; Some will rob you with a six-gun, And some with a fountain pen"

Woody Guthrie,"If you play more than two chords, you're showing off."
Woody Guthrie,"Life has got a habit of not standing hitched. You got to ride it like you find it. You got to change with it. If a day goes by that don't change some of your old notions for new ones, that is just about like trying to milk a dead cow."
Woody Guthrie,"Left wing, chicken wing, it don't make no difference to me."
Woody Guthrie,"This land is your land, this land is my land, From California to the New York Island. From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me."
Carlos Gutierrez,Imagine going to the grocery store and watching 17 out of 20 customers shoplifting items from the shelves and walking out of the store without paying.
Carlos Gutierrez,"What we need now is encouragement, support, motivation, vision, foresight, and courage, ... We aren't spending a lot of time looking back. We are looking at what we can do for people today and tomorrow. That's our focus. We're just not going to spend time right now looking backwards."

Buddy Guy,"If you don't think you've got the blues, just keep living, and if you don't think you're drunk, just keep drinking what you're drinking."
Buddy Guy,I've Got Dreams to Remember.
Buddy Guy,"Why did they keep changing guitars and amplifiers when they were perfect? They did the same things with cars, if you ask me. They forgot how to make them right, because they focused on style and bells and whistles."
