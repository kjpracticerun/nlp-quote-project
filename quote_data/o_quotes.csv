Michelle Obama,"The realities are that, you know, as a black man, you know, Barack can get shot going to the gas station, you know."
Michelle Obama,We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity. And we can help create a culture - imagine this - where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them.
Michelle Obama,And let's be clear: It's not enough just to limit ads for foods that aren't healthy. It's also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy.

Conor Oberst,"No lies, just love."
Conor Oberst,Love's an excuse to get hurt.
Conor Oberst,They say it's better to bury your sadness in a graveyard or garden that waits for the spring to wake from its sleep and burst into green.
Conor Oberst,"I've cried, and you'd think I'd be better for it, but the sadness just sleeps, and it stays in my spine the rest of my life."
Conor Oberst,"Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid entwined together on a bed of clover and left there to sleep, left there to dream of their happiness."
Conor Oberst,I really just want to be warm yellow light that pours over everyone I love.
Conor Oberst,"If the world could remain within a frame like a painting on the wall, I think we'd see the beauty then and stand staring in awe."
Conor Oberst,Why are you scared to dream of god when it's salvation that you want?
Conor Oberst,"There's all body types, but there's just one size."
Conor Oberst,"Screaming is bad for the voice, but it's good for the heart."

James Oberstar,"FAA has to shoulder the responsibility,"

James Oberstar,"Without direct financial intervention by the federal government we could soon see the financial liquidation of the airline industry, ...

James Oberstar,"The carriers seem unable to muster the discipline to reasonably price their product,"
James Oberstar,"If you make a comment like that, those words have consequences. People take note of someone saying something like that, and you have to substantiate those remarks. She didn't."

Sean O'Casey,"Disease an never be conquered, can never be quelled by emotion's willful screaming or faith's symbolic prayer. It can only be conquered by the energy of humanity and the cunning in the mind of man. In the patience of a Curie, in the enlightenment of a Faraday, a Rutherford, a Pasteur, a Nightingale, and all other apostles of light and cleanliness, rather than of a woebegone godliness, we shall find final deliverance from plague, pestilence, and famine."
Sean O'Casey,The military mind is indeed a menace. Old-fashioned futurity that sees only men fighting and dying in smoke and fire; hears nothing more civilized than a cannonade; scents nothing but the stink of battle-wounds and blood.

Sean O'Casey,Every action of our lives touches on some chord that will vibrate in eternity.
Jack O'Connell,I'd fight tooth and nail to protect our high academic standards and to ensure sound science is protected in our classrooms.
Jack O'Connell,Our students can't afford to miss school. Our schools can't afford missing students. And our state can't afford to rest for one day until we close the gap in achievement that threatens the futures of many immigrant children.
Jack O'Connell,It's important to keep one core principle front and center: awarding a student a diploma without the skills and knowledge to back it up does the student a disservice.
Jack O'Connell,Awarding a student a diploma without the necessary skills and knowledge does a great disservice to that student.
Jack O'Connell,I hope 100 percent of students on the diploma track pass.
Jack O'Connell,"The [state's] growth model is a much more accurate indicator,"
Jack O'Connell,"The growth targets by the federal government have doubled,"
Jack O'Connell,"At a time when our nation should be investing in the future of our students as never before, this budget cuts education funding for the first time in a decade."
Jack O'Connell,"We accepted a higher proportion of English-learner students than any other state in the country, ... Our exclusion rate of English learners was 12%, while Texas' exclusion rate was 37.5% and New York's was 29%."
Jack O'Connell,"I hope this program to turn around the Oakland Unified School District will provide a model for innovation and commitment to our students and their families,"
Jack O'Connell,"This is class warfare, in essence."
Jack O'Connell,"We have accountability, we have world-class content standards. Now we have to provide nourishment."
Jack O'Connell,"To me, this is blatant class warfare. It's a blatant class attack, especially in light of the continuing tax cuts, and you are going to pay for the taxes by reducing health care for the poor and elderly."
Jack O'Connell,"Revenues did go up, and according to our agreement with the governor public education should have been one of the beneficiaries."
Jack O'Connell,"We must seek extraordinary achievement levels for those students to close the achievement gap,"
Jack O'Connell,"With data showing six years of improved student achievement, we know that California schools are headed in the right direction, ... We now need to maintain the focus on high standards to keep up the momentum for improved student achievement at all schools."
Jack O'Connell,It is clear that California must do more to improve student achievement. The scores released today are not surprising and are another indication of the challenges we face.
Jack O'Connell,"With data showing six years of improved student achievement, we know that California schools are headed in the right direction,"
Jack O'Connell,I'm particularly concerned about African-American students and English language learners. The answer is not to ignore the achievement gap by giving diplomas to unprepared students.
John O'Connell,Enrique turned some real heads up here. It was his best performance of the year defensively.
John O'Connell,"We're not a one-man team. We've got some good players. And they can say the same thing. A lot of attention goes to our best players, but there is definitely some talent on both teams."
John O'Connell,That's putting five great games together. There's no soft games anymore at all.
John O'Connell,The thing about him is he's so unselfish. He's only averaging about nine or 10 shots a game.
John O'Connell,Defense is our No. 1 asset.
Mike O'Connell,"You could see in the fourth quarter, we were just in scramble mode. We were just trying to run around, trying to get steals, and it's extremely tiring. It's not fun to play catch-up like that."
Mike O'Connell,Our offense will be our strength. We have a team that's going to have the puck. We have some speed. I believe that most of our team will benefit from that.
Mike O'Connell,"It's never easy, but you have to go by performance. Hannu played very well. Hannu has played at the minor league level and he's won big games there. He needs to get used to the NHL shooters. Even at practice, he's facing [players like] Murray and Samsonov. If we need to make a change going forward, we will."
Mike O'Connell,He wants a better opportunity. I think he looks at our team and sees he's not going to be able to make our team. I don't know what it is. I think he just wants a change of scenery.
Mike O'Connell,Many of the free agents could have gone somewhere else for the money. But I think they liked what we had.
Mike O'Connell,He's got some good offensive skill. He's still learning the game. It's a little different level up here at this time of year. But he definitely has a chance.
Mike O'Connell,"A tryout never hurt anything. I talked to his agent and told him if Byron was interested in doing it, we'd be interested. I don't know what will come of it. We're just keeping options open."
Mike O'Connell,The whole family gets involved. When I was a kid we all participated. Now my kids are taking part.
Mike O'Connell,"Ian is healthy, he has been cleared to play by the doctors and we look forward to having him back on our team."
Mike O'Connell,"Our defense was great in the first half. We were just mixing things up with them. Obviously, it worked. ... It was fun to see this group come together tonight and play with a lot of heart."
Mike O'Connell,"We felt we needed to shake up the team and, sometimes, you have to make some difficult decisions to better the team."
Mike O'Connell,"[Girard and Sigalet] remain top prospects and have shown tremendous character in overcoming their physical setbacks, ... We look forward to seeing both players at training camp."
Mike O'Connell,What it turned into was hockey's version of fast-break basketball.
Mike O'Connell,there's no low balls here.
Mike O'Connell,"We're pleased that we were able to come to this agreement in advance of the arbitration process, ... We recognize that Hal is an important part of our defense and is one of our steadiest and most reliable players."
Mike O'Connell,We're pleased that we were able to come to this agreement in advance of the arbitration process. We recognize that Hal is an important part of our defense and is one of our steadiest and most reliable players.
Mike O'Connell,"I think we have the ability to get something done with both of them to get them in. I think we're a little closer to getting something done with Boynton, but I don't know when it might happen with either one of them."
Brian O'Connor,Those guys in the bullpen have been worked hard. I was trying to sneak through one more inning with Jacob.
Brian O'Connor,Sean is a talented player at the plate and on the mound. You can't hold that talent down. You can go out there on the mound and change the game in a hurry and [also] going out there and hacking like he did.
Brian O'Connor,"We just need to continue to progress. The season is still young, we're only 20 percent through the season, but we just need to keep working on our skills so that we are improving up to the start of the ACC season against Georgia Tech."
Brian O'Connor,"We take pride in being able to execute that small game. We did not do that [yesterday] at times. Sometimes you don't get the job done, but the guys didn't give up, that is what was important."
Brian O'Connor,"He really had a good performance today. But I was hard on Pat today. I am still not completely satisfied with the way he threw. Believe it or not, even though he shut them out. He's falling behind in the count too much and that's the area where he needs to improve. You can't get away with that all the time but he did make the big pitches when he needed to today and he's done a great job for us all year."
Brian O'Connor,"Sean Doolittle absolutely set the tone for that game with his performance on the mound on just four days rest. He set the tone for the weekend and fortunately, Casey came in there in the ninth and we found a way to win at the end."
Brian O'Connor,"It's a terrible burden on the poorest, most vulnerable citizens of the state, especially those on fixed income,"
Brian O'Connor,"It is so comfortable when you play at home. You have your own locker room and your own routine. It's tough to play on the road. You win on the road with good pitching, a good starting pitching performance. That is what we did not get last weekend in two out of three games. That's the difference. It allows our young kids to relax a little bit and just play."
Brian O'Connor,I'm just so happy for Mike Ballard. It's so rare that you can be part of [a no-hitter] as a coach and as a player. For him to go out there and accomplish what he did is really amazing and is a testament to him.
Brian O'Connor,The key to game for me was how Doolittle managed his innings on the mound. He only gave up single runs when BC scored. A couple of those could have very easily gotten out of hand and he didn't let them. That gave us a chance to stay within reach.
Brian O'Connor,There are a lot of people in the family who don't see each other too often. They're still catching up. A somber mood is going on.
Brian O'Connor,"We didn't necessarily have a strategy. We all had our strengths and weaknesses, but we also had enough faith in one another to let whoever had a gut feeling about the answer go ahead and buzz in."
Brian O'Connor,"Our offensive execution was really good, and I think that was the story of the game."
Brian O'Connor,The cheapest energy you can buy is energy you don't use.
Brian O'Connor,It was important to get him back out there and give him a little confidence heading into a key weekend for us.
Brian O'Connor,"He wants the competition, he wants the best. He wants to play big-time football. He's maybe just a little too small, a little too slow. But I think he'll contribute, maybe on special teams as a freshman. If he makes it, he'll make it by out-working everybody."
Brian O'Connor,I think that shows the character of this team that we keep fighting back. That's something that you develop over time.
Brian O'Connor,"Coach Anderson's experience as a college coach and a player in collegiate and professional baseball will make him a great addition to our coaching staff, ... On the field, he will be working with our catchers while assisting with the hitters in our program. I am looking forward to his contributions to Cavalier Baseball."
Brian O'Connor,"Coach Anderson's experience as a college coach and a player in collegiate and professional baseball will make him a great addition to our coaching staff. On the field, he will be working with our catchers while assisting with the hitters in our program. I am looking forward to his contributions to Cavalier Baseball."
Brian O'Connor,"Any time in college baseball you can get 30 wins before you have 10 losses, you put yourself in really great position. We need to take advantage of every opportunity we have at home."
Brian O'Connor,"Richmond is playing very good baseball as of late. There has always been a rivalry between Richmond and Virginia in baseball, and they've had a great baseball program in the last ten years."
Brian O'Connor,Those big-run innings are important to open up leads. We took advantage of our opportunities toward the end of the game and a couple of guys got clutch hits and we were able to have a four-run inning.
Eileen O'Connor,"Today's plea is the result of determined efforts by United States investigators and attorneys working to vindicate the trust the American people deserve to have in the institutions of their government, including the tax system that supports it. People who enrich themselves by engaging in illegal activities compound their crimes by failing to pay taxes on their ill-gotten gains."
Eileen O'Connor,"The Justice Department is working vigorously to stop the preparation and filing of the false or fraudulent returns that unfairly shift the tax burden to honest American taxpayers. People who hire others to prepare their returns should review their returns carefully to make sure that they are true, correct, and complete."
Eileen O'Connor,The Tax Division of the Department of Justice has made it a high priority to put an end to the business of providing false tax advice.
Eileen O'Connor,People who prepare false or fraudulent tax returns unfairly shift the tax burden to honest taxpayers. The Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service are working vigorously to stop systematic abuses of the tax system.
Eileen O'Connor,"The Department of Justice is committed to using all available law enforcement tools to recover tax revenue, punish tax offenders, and to prevent future misconduct. People who promote, facilitate, or engage in plans or schemes to avoid reporting their income or another person's income are risking penalties and, where appropriate, criminal prosecution."
Eileen O'Connor,The Department of Justice is firmly committed to shutting down fraudulent trust schemes that cost the treasury and law-abiding taxpayers millions of dollars each year.
Eileen O'Connor,The law is clear that income from the casino gaming activities of Native American tribes is taxable.
Eileen O'Connor,"Anyone receiving tax advice should verify the motives and qualifications of those giving it, even those claiming to be charitable organizations."
Flannery O'Connor,It is better to be young in your failures than old in your successes.
Flannery O'Connor,"There was a time when the average reader read a novel simply for the moral he could get out of it, and however nanve that may have been, it was a good deal less nanve than some of the limited objectives he has now. Today novels are considered to be entirely concerned with the social or economic or psychological forces that they will by necessity exhibit, or with those details of daily life that are for the good novelist only means to some deeper end."
Flannery O'Connor,"Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay."
Flannery O'Connor,"When in Rome, do as you done in Milledgeville."
Flannery O'Connor,To expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness.
Flannery O'Connor,The writer operates at a peculiar crossroads where time and place and eternity somehow meet. His problem is to find that location.
Flannery O'Connor,The writer can choose what he writes about but he cannot choose what he is able to make live.
Flannery O'Connor,"I preach there are all kinds of truth, your truth and somebody else's. But behind all of them there is only one truth and that is that there's no truth."
Flannery O'Connor,"Everywhere I go, I'm asked if I think the universities stifle writers. My opinion is that they don't stifle enough of them. There's many a best seller that could have been prevented by a good teacher."
Flannery O'Connor,"At its best our age is an age of searchers and discoverers, and at its worst, an age that has domesticated despair and learned to live with it happily."
Flannery O'Connor,The Southerner is usually tolerant of those weaknesses that proceed from innocence.
Flannery O'Connor,"The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode."
Flannery O'Connor,"Manners are of such great consequence to the novelist that any kind will do. Bad manners are better than no manners at all, and because we are losing our customary manners, we are probably overly conscious of them; this seems to be a condition that produces writers."
Flannery O'Connor,"Faith is what someone knows to be true, whether they believe it or not."
Flannery O'Connor,I am a writer because writing is the thing I do best.
Flannery O'Connor,The writer should never be ashamed of staring. There is nothing that does not require his attention.
Flannery O'Connor,"It seems that the fiction writer has a revolting attachment to the poor, for even when he writes about the rich, he is more concerned with what they lack than with what they have."
Flannery O'Connor,There's many a bestseller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.
Flannery O'Connor,"I am not afraid that the book will be controversial, I'm afraid it will not be controversial."
Flannery O'Connor,I find that most people know what a story is until they sit down to write one.
Flannery O'Connor,"When a book leaves your hands, it belongs to God. He may use it to save a few souls or to try a few others, but I think that for the writer to worry is to take over God's business."
Flannery O'Connor,"All my stories are about the action of grace on a character who is not very willing to support it, but most people think of these stories as hard, hopeless and brutal."
Flannery O'Connor,I don't deserve any credit for turning the other cheek as my tongue is always in it.
Flannery O'Connor,The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it.
Flannery O'Connor,Conviction without experience makes for harshness.
Jack O'Connor,"When a team gets to a final, victory is more important than performance, ... But we want to extend the Kerry tradition of playing quality football and winning with style."
Jack O'Connor,"I think it???s clear that there is an obvious difference between colleges football and inter-county football, and Cork will certainly be a far tougher test than what we have met so far, even a good deal tougher than Waterford."
Jack O'Connor,"It does appear that progress is being made, that the possibility of pay talks is beginning to feature on the horizon again."
Patrick O'Connor,"Before, we were dealing with guys who knew the service end of a department and knew how to get things done for communities. If you were out there fixing a street, and somebody said, 'Can we extend it around this corner because there's a need here,' they'd figure out a way to do it. New people are reluctant to work with anybody unless it's scripted. There's not a lot of innovative stuff going on."
Patrick O'Connor,"In the next 5-10 years, property owners will increasingly adopt cost segregation to minimize federal income taxes."
Patrick O'Connor,"The early retirement and now this [corruption] stuff has taken away years and years of experience where you could call and try and resolve problems without making them acts of Congress,"
Sandra Day O'Connor,Young women today often have very little appreciation for the real battles that took place to get women where they are today in this country. I don't know how much history young women today know about those battles.
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Yes, I will bring the understanding of a woman to the Court, but I doubt that alone will affect my decisions."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"When I went to law school, which after all was back in the dark ages, we never looked beyond our borders for precedents. As a state court judge, it never would have occurred to me to do so, and when I got to the Supreme Court, it was very much the same. We just didn't do it."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"What was a problem was the excessive amount of media attention to the appointment of the first woman and everything she did. Everywhere that Sandra went, the press was sure to go. And that got tiresome; it was stressful."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"We pay a price when we deprive children of the exposure to the values, principles, and education they need to make them good citizens."
Sandra Day O'Connor,We don't accomplish anything in this world alone... and whatever happens is the result of the whole tapestry of one's life and all the weavings of individual threads form one to another that creates something.
Sandra Day O'Connor,There was no hostility at the court when I arrived.
Sandra Day O'Connor,"The power I exert on the court depends on the power of my arguments, not on my gender."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"The more education a woman has, the wider the gap between men's and women's earnings for the same work."
Sandra Day O'Connor,The members of the court were just delighted to have a ninth member - male or female. They were all kind and welcoming.
Sandra Day O'Connor,The framers of the Constitution were so clear in the federalist papers and elsewhere that they felt an independent judiciary was critical to the success of the nation.
Sandra Day O'Connor,"The fact is, we are a nine-member court that sits on cases."
Sandra Day O'Connor,The courts of this country should not be the places where resolution of disputes begins. They should be the places where the disputes end after alternative methods of resolving disputes have been considered and tried.
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Society as a whole benefits immeasurably from a climate in which all persons, regardless of race or gender, may have the opportunity to earn respect, responsibility, advancement and remuneration based on ability."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Occasionally we have to interpret an international treaty - one, perhaps, affecting airlines and liability for injury to passengers or damage to goods. Then, of course, we have to look to the precedents of other member nations in resolving issues."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"My sense is that jurists from other nations around the world understand that our court occupies a very special place in the American system, and that the court is rather well regarded in comparison, perhaps, to their own."
Sandra Day O'Connor,My concern was whether I could do the job of a justice well enough to convince the nation that my appointment was the right move.
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Most high courts in other nations do not have discretion, such as we enjoy, in selecting the cases that the high court reviews. Our court is virtually alone in the amount of discretion it has."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Justice Ginsburg is a very competent justice, and it is a joy to have her on the court, but particularly for me it is a pleasure to have a second woman on the court."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"If I stumbled badly in doing the job, I think it would have made life more difficult for women, and that was a great concern of mine and still is."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"I'm a judge. It seemed to me that it was critical to try to take action to stem the criticism and help people understand that in the constitutional framework, it's terribly important not to have a system of retaliation against decisions people don't like."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"I wanted to be a cattle rancher when I was young, because it was what I knew and I loved it."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"I think the important thing about my appointment is not that I will decide cases as a woman, but that I am a woman who will get to decide cases."
Sandra Day O'Connor,I need to retire from retirement.
Sandra Day O'Connor,I don't know that there are any short cuts to doing a good job.
Sandra Day O'Connor,Historically courts in this country have been insulated. We do not look beyond our borders for precedents.
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Each of us brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Do the best you can in every task, no matter how unimportant it may seem at the time. No one learns more about a problem than the person at the bottom."
Sandra Day O'Connor,"Despite the encouraging and wonderful gains and the changes for women which have occurred in my lifetime, there is still room to advance and to promote correction of the remaining deficiencies and imbalances."
Sandra Day O'Connor,Having family responsibilities and concerns just has to make you a more understanding person.
Sandra Day O'Connor,Statutes authorizing unreasonable searches were the core concern of the framers of the 4th Amendment.
Steve O'Connor,"It's good to not have to worry about making the tournament, but we don't want to go into the tournament playing like we did (last night). We were out of sync in the second half."
Steve O'Connor,"Clearly, you have to have the discipline to invest the money and not spend it. That's the most compelling factor."
Steve O'Connor,Some people say you should pay down as much debt as possible. But you might make more by investing the money.
Tim O'Connor,We're still in the process of getting this out to everybody. It's a work in progress.
Tim O'Connor,There really is none. They always put our name on it. There is no real written law. There isn't a legislator in the world who would touch that one.
Tim O'Connor,Fire raged near the doorway and overhead as they exited the living room of the home.
Tim O'Connor,"If you're in an outdoor event, for example let's say a soccer game, and the person next to you is smoking on a normal bleacher and if the wind is blowing in your direction, it's like someone sitting next to you in a restaurant. Now, if the distance is farther, obviously the secondhand smoke would diminish or the side effects would diminish."
Tim O'Connor,"This outage was an outstanding example of Nine Mile Point's ability to successfully execute a key component of our overall business plan. Our team executed our plan superbly, meeting or exceeding our goals in the areas of safety, duration and budget. The credit for this success goes to our employees, vendors and contractors. It was their ability to work as a cohesive team that generated such a strongly aligned critical mass that delivered upon what they said they could do. It was inspiring to see such creativity from so many people. This is a significant achievement for Nine Mile Point and Constellation Energy. In short, a well-executed outage matched by top performance amongst industry peers."
Tom O'Connor,"We all want to go to the game, have a good time. You smile when you have success at the end of the game, but you should want what's best for these kids. What's happening sometimes in this business is too often adults using kids. And I just think that's wrong."
Tom O'Connor,"They are images of firing neurons, quite beautiful, with a forest-like quality to them. They are literally pictures of the mind at work."
Tom O'Connor,A man fighting for his life.
Tom O'Connor,"Her current version of events is inconsistent with the physical evidence,"
Tom O'Connor,"Grades are more important, so they needed to be there. We talked during the week about self-discipline, that these boys are all smart enough to get good grades and play ball. It just takes work."
Tom O'Connor,"He just has a unique ability to motivate people. When the kids see what he tells them come to fruition, it's easy for them to embrace him and his style."
Brian O'Driscoll,It was a performance that had been coming for a while and it does not shock me all that much. When the pressure came on we produced the goods and we can take great satisfaction from that.
Brian O'Driscoll,This is a stepping stone to bigger things hopefully. We'll celebrate it tonight. We needed the performance we've been talking about this week for the whole of the Six Nations and to put it in to win the Triple Crown feels good.
Brian O'Driscoll,"It's gone, OK? I've got a little bit better and sharper with each game back. I hope with the Italy game I will step up to another level."
Brian O'Driscoll,"Was I speared? I think so. Slam-dunked is probably the expression which sums it up best,"
Brian O'Driscoll,"Clive was the man who had won a World Cup, he had the experience and I was there to back him up and get across what he wanted to do."
Abdullah Ocalan,"If we were to show our real armed power, the results would be much worse."
Abdullah Ocalan,"Our movement is the liberation movement of the Turkish people,"
Abdullah Ocalan,"If permission is granted, I say I can bring down all the men from the mountains within three months,"
Abdullah Ocalan,"If the truth needs to be told, I love Turkey and the Turkish nation and I want to serve it."
Abdullah Ocalan,superior values of European civilization.
Abdullah Ocalan,"You must believe before everything else that the revolution must come, that there is no other choice."
Ric Ocasek,worried and looking for work.
Ric Ocasek,"Once they're on paper, they're gone. I like to do as much with the words, as far as image goes."
Ric Ocasek,"The most important thing to a lot of people, is to belong to something that's hip or whatever. To be a part of something that's not society, just a clique."
Ric Ocasek,The best thing you can do for a song is to hear it on the radio and to imagine what it could mean to you and then kinda forget the words.
Ric Ocasek,"Your high points and your low points. High points don't last that long, it's a high and it happens. It's great at the moment but you really can't live on it."
Ric Ocasek,They're caught where there's no way out or where you can't see out. What are you going to do about it? I don't have the answer. If I did there would be no insane asylums.
Ric Ocasek,"Sometimes you want to run away, sometimes you think you do, but you never had a dream like this before and you don't want to ask for more, sometimes you leave a mark before you know the score."
Ric Ocasek,There's more to light than the opposite of dark.
Ric Ocasek,I love walking down the street and seeing faces and drama and happiness and sadness and dirt and cleanliness.
Ric Ocasek,Never mind a world that can't see past brutality.
Ric Ocasek,"Secrecy is the enemy of efficiency, but don't let anyone know it."
Ric Ocasek,"I could never be a country person, sitting around trees trying to write a song. I would rather be in the middle of society, whether it's growing or crumbling."
Ric Ocasek,"I'm elated about becoming part of Elektra again. In 1970, Elektra was the first record company I ever visited. I was just a kid from Cleveland, but I idolized Elektra bands like the Doors, Love, Joni Mitchell and all the others. ... The Cars signed with Elektra in 1978, so I feel like I'm coming full circle."
Ellen Ochoa,"This was the last astronaut job that was not (yet) done by a woman. Now with this milestone we can focus on the fact that what is important to succeed in life, it does not matter whether you are a man or a woman."
Ellen Ochoa,It was just very peaceful.
Ellen Ochoa,I tell students that the opportunities I had were a result of having a good educational background. Education is what allows you to stand out.
Ellen Ochoa,"What everyone in the astronaut corps shares in common is not gender or ethnic background, but motivation, perseverance, and desire - the desire to participate in a voyage of discovery."
Tom Ochsenschlager,"When the $500,000 exclusion rule came into the law, a lot of people figured they'd never have that much gain, so they stopped keeping records of the improvements they made to the house. That could mean they'll wind up paying more tax than they should have."
Tom Ochsenschlager,It makes a lot of sense particularly if you're younger and not at your peak earning years. A high-income individual might want to think twice about enrolling in a Roth 401(k).
Tom Ochsenschlager,"The debate surrounding Social Security reform brings to the forefront philosophical differences, varying opinions, and the age old trade-offs between fairness, simplicity, economic growth and social policy. We strongly urge policymakers and the public to thoroughly understand the issues surrounding Social Security reform before taking a position."
Ron Oden,"None of this has anything to do with me running. So, what's the real issue? What is the issue? I can't get into the minds of people."
Ron Oden,"Who knows what crises situations there might be when people are placed in that position and they're not developed? ... I'm not saying that I won't run again, but I'd have to feel something really, really special in order to stay."
Ron Oden,I know where I shop and I know almost everyone over there on a first-name basis. These people are my supporters and they let me know that on a daily basis.
Ron Oden,I think it's extremely important that we get these property owners to the table because I'd hate to see somebody build something that nullifies the whole plan just because they don't like something about it.
Raila Odinga,The contents of the statement are most ridiculous and a phantom of great imagination.
Raila Odinga,We are demonstrating in order to protect press freedom in Kenya. Press freedom in Kenya is under siege.
Raila Odinga,This is basically a public relations exercise because you cannot investigate ministers who are still in office.
Raila Odinga,The president admits that there should be a meeting between us to discuss pertinent issues on the constitution and the way forward.
Raila Odinga,"We do not want this conflict to continue. We have said that 2006 will be a year of reconciliation, tolerance and dialogue. For that matter I am happy that the president has read the mood of the year and is positive like other Kenyans."
Lamar Odom,"That's just my coach telling me to go, and don't worry about it."
Lamar Odom,"[Like teammate Caron Butler a year ago, he seems destined to finish third in Rookie of the Year voting despite impressive stats. Through Monday, he ranked third among rookies in scoring (16.2 points), third in field-goal percentage (45.3), third in steals (1.28) and fourth in assists (4.4). More impressive, he's done it while learning to play point guard. With a lighting-quick first step, Wade can get in the lane against anybody, and his jump shot has been solid so far.] He's the best rookie I've every played with, ... He just makes plays. He's not getting a lot of hype right now, but people are going to find out about Mr. Wade."
Lamar Odom,"I like Odom as a player, but I don't know if I'd trust him."
Lamar Odom,"I think that's the strength to my game. I'm not one-dimensional at all. I'm comfortable wherever he wants me to play on the court. I kind of pride myself being able to play any position. Anything to help us create mismatches, I'm willing to do. I always have guard in my game."
Lamar Odom,"I think that's the strength to my game, ... I'm not one-dimensional at all. I'm comfortable wherever he wants me to play on the court. I kind of pride myself being able to play any position. Anything to help us create mismatches, I'm willing to do. I always have guard in my game."
Lamar Odom,I can't sleep and I can't bathe properly.
Lamar Odom,We had the opportunity to beat this team by 25-30 points. We didn't because they are well coached and they played hard. We kept doing the little things and got stops when we needed them.
Lamar Odom,He was saying that I'm learning the role he was five or six years ago. So he understands. The triangle is different. You need four or five guys to understand what's really going on to be effective.
Lamar Odom,"If we play the right way, if we follow our leaders, our coach and Kobe, then we should be a playoff team."
Lamar Odom,I hope I can keep it going and take it into the playoffs. I'm staying focused throughout the game. I'm trying to do the little things I need to do to win games.
Lamar Odom,"It was fun. We gave them a show. I was glad a lot of the NBA greats came, too."
Lamar Odom,They're focusing on defense. You can tell.
Lamar Odom,It is just game-by-game now. You have to win. My concentration level was high tonight. I've just got an aggressive mind-set right now. I didn't really do anything differently tonight - still rebounded and drove to the hole.
Lamar Odom,Don't have a choice right now.
Lamar Odom,"Inside presence, being physical, that's what we need from him. The guy's got the best body in the NBA _ he's got to throw it around a little bit."
Lamar Odom,"I take the blame for that (game). I should have ran the clock down more (with 30 seconds left). First time in a long time, my aggressiveness beat me. I was thinking get to the basket. A flop call on a team that is dead, I kind of gave them new life. It's a tough call but I guess it was the right call."
Lamar Odom,"I'll take the blame for that. I should have let the clock run down more. It was a flop call on a team that was dead. I gave them life. He drew the charge, that's what Mr. Crawford saw. It gave them momentum."
Lamar Odom,"I'll take the blame for that one. I got a little overzealous, I tried to get to the rack, and they got momentum from the charge."
Lamar Odom,"He raises the I.Q. of your basketball team ? he helps us tremendously,"
Lamar Odom,"He raises the I.Q. of your basketball team -- he helps us tremendously,"
Lamar Odom,"He raises the I.Q. of your basketball team - he helps us tremendously,"
Madalyn O'Hair,"I want three words: Woman, Atheist, Anarchist. That's me."
Madalyn O'Hair,"I feel that everyone who wants to say anything, do anything, should be able to say anything or do anything, within the limits of not hurting another person."
Madalyn O'Hair,"The relationships that people have - that are sexual, psychological, emotional - these relationships are not open to supervision by parents, schools, churches, or government. Nobody has any right to intervene at all in any kind of relationship like that."
Frank O'Hara,All things are tragic when a mother watches!
Frank O'Hara,It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so.
Frank O'Hara,The artificial is always innocent.
David Ogilvy,There is one category of advertising which is totally uncontrolled and flagrantly dishonest: the television commercials for candidates in Presidential elections.
David Ogilvy,"It has taken more than a hundred scientists two years to find out how to make the product in question; I have been given thirty days to create its personality and plan its launching. If I do my job well, I shall contribute as much as the hundred scientists to the success of this product."
David Ogilvy,The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife. You insult her intelligence if you assume that a mere slogan and a few vapid adjectives will persuade her to buy anything. She wants all the information you can give her.
David Ogilvy,"First, make yourself a reputation for being a creative genius. Second, surround yourself with partners who are better than you are. Third, leave them go get on with it."
David Ogilvy,"Shakespeare wrote his sonnets within a strict discipline, fourteen lines of iambic pentameter, rhyming in three quatrains and a couplet. Were his sonnets dull? Mozart wrote his sonatas within an equally rigid discipline - exposition, development, and recapitulation. Were they dull?"
David Ogilvy,A well-run restaurant is like a winning baseball team. It makes the most of every crew member's talent and takes advantage of every split-second opportunity to speed up service.
David Ogilvy,"Good copy can't be written with tongue in cheek, written just for a living. You've got to believe in the product."
David Ogilvy,"The secret of long life is double careers. One to about age sixty, then another for the next thirty years."
David Ogilvy,"It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product. Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night. I doubt if more than one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea."
David Ogilvy,"On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."
David Ogilvy,"Hire people who are better than you are, then leave them to get on with it. Look for people who will aim for the remarkable, who will not settle for the routine."
David Ogilvy,"If each of us hires people smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs."
David Ogilvy,"You now have to decide what 'image' you want for your brand. Image means personality. Products, like people, have personalities, and they can make or break them in the market place."
David Ogilvy,"Develop your eccentricities while you are young. That way, when you get old, people won't think you're going gaga."
David Ogilvy,It strikes me as bad manners for a magazine to accept one of my advertisements and then attack it editorially - like inviting a man to dinner then spitting in his eye.
David Ogilvy,Some manufacturers illustrate their advertisements with abstract paintings. I would only do this if I wished to conceal from the reader what I was advertising.
David Ogilvy,The headline is the 'ticket on the meat.' Use it to flag down readers who are prospects for the kind of product you are advertising.
David Ogilvy,"The more informative your advertising, the more persuasive it will be."
David Ogilvy,"I don't know the rules of grammar... If you're trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language, the language they use every day, the language in which they think. We try to write in the vernacular."
David Ogilvy,"I notice increasing reluctance on the part of marketing executives to use judgment; they are coming to rely too much on research, and they use it as a drunkard uses a lamp post for support, rather than for illumination."
David Ogilvy,I did not feel 'evil' when I wrote advertisements for Puerto Rico. They helped attract industry and tourists to a country which had been living on the edge of starvation for 400 years.
David Ogilvy,"Can advertising foist an inferior product on the consumer? Bitter experience has taught me that it cannot. On those rare occasions when I have advertised products which consumer tests have found inferior to other products in the same field, the results have been disastrous."
David Ogilvy,"Many people - and I think I am one of them - are more productive when they've had a little to drink. I find if I drink two or three brandies, I'm far better able to write."
David Ogilvy,"I have a theory that the best ads come from personal experience. Some of the good ones I have done have really come out of the real experience of my life, and somehow this has come over as true and valid and persuasive."
David Ogilvy,"In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create."
David Ogilvy,Don't bunt. Aim out of the ball park. Aim for the company of immortals.
David Ogilvy,"The pursuit of excellence is less profitable than the pursuit of bigness, but it can be more satisfying."
David Ogilvy,The best ideas come as jokes. Make your thinking as funny as possible.
David Ogilvy,"First, make yourself a reputation for being a creative genius. Second, surround yourself with partners who are better than you are. Third, leave them to go get on with it."
David Ogilvy,"If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."
David Ogilvy,"If each of us hires people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. But if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants."
David Ogilvy,To advertisers: Do not compete with your agency in the creative area. Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
David Ogilvy,The relationship between a manufacturer and his advertising agency is almost as intimate as the relationship between a patient and his doctor. Make sure that you can life happily with your prospective client before you accept his account.
David Ogilvy,A good advertisement is one which sells the product without drawing attention to itself.
David Ogilvy,"Advertising reflects the mores of society, but it does not influence them."
David Ogilvy,"Remove advertising, disable a person or firm from proclaiming its wares and their merits, and the whole of society and of the economy is transformed. The enemies of advertising are the enemies of freedom."
David Ogilvy,It is flagrantly dishonest for an advertising agent to urge consumers to buy a product which he would not allow his own wife to buy.
David Ogilvy,What you say in advertising is more important than how you say it.
David Ogilvy,"Advertising is a business of words, but advertising agencies are infested with men and women who cannot write. They cannot write advertisements, and they cannot write plans. They are helpless as deaf mutes on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera."
David Ogilvy,"The most important word in the vocabulary of advertising is test. If you pretest your product with consumers, and pretest your advertising, you will do well in the marketplace."
David Ogilvy,"What really decides consumers to buy or not to buy is the content of your advertising, not its form."
David Ogilvy,Ninety-nine percent of advertising doesn't sell much of anything.
David Ogilvy,Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things.
David Ogilvy,Never write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your family to read. You wouldn't tell lies to your own wife. Don't tell them to mine.
David Ogilvy,"If you ever have the good fortune to create a great advertising campaign, you will soon see another agency steal it. This is irritating, but don't let it worry you; nobody has ever built a brand by imitating somebody else's advertising."
David Ogilvy,Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals.
David Ogilvy,"There is no need for advertisements to look like advertisements. If you make them look like editorial pages, you will attract about 50 per cent more readers."
David Ogilvy,Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the complex symbol which is the brand image.
David Ogilvy,There are very few men of genius in advertising agencies. But we need all we can find. Almost without exception they are disagreeable. Don't destroy them. They lay golden eggs.
David Ogilvy,"I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information."
David Ogilvy,"Many manufacturers secretly question whether advertising really sells their product, but are vaguely afraid that their competitors might steal a march on them if they stopped."
David Ogilvy,I avoid clients for whom advertising is only a marginal factor in their marketing mix. They have an awkward tendency to raid their advertising appropriations whenever they need cash for other purposes.
David Ogilvy,"Managing an advertising agency isn't all beer and skittles. After fourteen years of it, I have come to the conclusion that the top man has one principle responsibility: to provide an atmosphere in which creative mavericks can do useful work."
David Ogilvy,"Like a midwife, I make my living bringing new babies into the world, except that mine are new advertising campaigns."
David Ogilvy,The manufacturer who finds himself up the creek is the short-sighted opportunist who siphons off all his advertising dollars for short-term promotions.
David Ogilvy,I know of a brewer who sells more of his beer to the people who never see his advertising than to the people who see it every week. Bad advertising can unsell a product.
David Ogilvy,"Much of the messy advertising you see on television today is the product of committees. Committees can criticize advertisements, but they should never be allowed to create them."
David Ogilvy,"Most agencies run scared, most of the time... Frightened people are powerless to produce good advertising...If I were a client, I would do everything in my power to emancipate my agencies from fear, even to the extent of giving them long-term contracts."
David Ogilvy,"Never stop testing, and your advertising will never stop improving."
David Ogilvy,The advertisers who believe in the selling power of jingles have never had to sell anything.
David Ogilvy,Leaders grasp nettles.
David Ogilvy,The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife.
David Ogilvy,Our business is infested with idiots who try to impress by using pretentious jargon.
Geoff Ogilvy,"I don't have anything good to say. World Golf Championships, I mean that suggests they're going to be played everywhere, and they tend to not be played in very many places."
Geoff Ogilvy,"Purely from a golf standpoint, I've probably played better. But I got it done. I hit shots when I needed to hit them this week."
Geoff Ogilvy,I've never been one of four people on a golf course and was waiting.
Geoff Ogilvy,"It plays long all the time. Even though the ball goes a long way here, it's still a long golf course."
Geoff Ogilvy,"I'm looking forward to the whole thing: Magnolia Lane, the golf course, the clubhouse, the Par 3 Contest, playing the 12th, playing the 16th . . . everything."
Geoff Ogilvy,"It's so funny that you're so affected by the previous shot so many times in match play. You wouldn't think we would be, but I know I am. That really turned it for me."
Geoff Ogilvy,"You almost get yourself ready for defeat. I've been lucky to have a reprieve every time. There's someone on my side this week. I've played nicely, but I've dodged a few bullets."
Sadaharu Oh,We have a saying in Japan - third time comes truth.
Sadaharu Oh,The opponents and I are really one. My strength and skills only half of the equation. The other half is theirs. An opponent is someone whose strength joined to yours creates a certain result.
Sadaharu Oh,We didn't score when we had chances to which hurt. We will want to take revenge next time.
Sadaharu Oh,I believe this team is probably the strongest team Japan ever had against Cuba. We can show a great performance against Cuba on Monday. Win or lose we'll play with a lot of heart and a lot of pride.
Sadaharu Oh,"Ichiro had been perceived in the media to be selfish but through his participation and commitment in this tournament, I think his popularity will only increase with the fans."
Sadaharu Oh,"In the past when the Cuban team was using the metal bats, we surely had a different style of baseball. But nowadays, the style of baseball between Cuba and Japan are very similar. So when we meet them, the game will be played in a very similar way, with a lot of speed and a lot of schemes in the game."
Sadaharu Oh,"The style of baseball between Cuba and Japan is very similar. The way they played the game (against the Dominican Republic) was more like the Japanese style than the American style. When we meet them, the game will be played in a very similar way, with a lot of speed and a lot of schemes."
Sadaharu Oh,I will take up the post for not only Japan but also the development of baseball in the world. I would like to create the best possible team.
Don Ohlmeyer,Veronica's Closet' will do a 27 share on a Thursday night and it's dismissed. And (Comedy Central's) 'South Park' does a two share and it's on the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine.
Don Ohlmeyer,"Somebody goes to a store and there's only, you know, three brands of hot dogs, they only have three choices to make. They go to a store and there's 100 brands of hot dogs ... now they start getting into the color of the packaging."
Don Ohlmeyer,I think we're looking at the next major superstar in golf. Tiger has a flair for the dramatic and one of those smiles that lights up the screen.
Don Ohlmeyer,The Olympics provides an emotional experience for millions of people. It's an important thing. So much of it is about people triumphing over adversity. Confronting tragedy and bouncing back. To provide some lessons on life.
Mandy Ohman,"The nature of the store, it's very small. We want a one-on-one relationship with our customers."
Mandy Ohman,"In Utah, modest fashion is what sells best."
Mandy Ohman,"The clothes are very expensive, so it's geared toward people really into fashion and name brands."
David O'Leary,Mark will be out for the rest of the season. That's what the surgeon has told us.
David O'Leary,Performance has definitely turned around.
David O'Leary,"I don't think any player's happy at being taken off. But he wasn't playing very well, simple as that."
David O'Leary,"We gave poor goals away and there were a few reminders at half time, a few things to be said,"
David O'Leary,"Kevin is out on Tuesday and is a doubt for Chelsea,"
David O'Leary,I am an attack-minded coach and like to take people on but circumstances dictated my plans because we had a few players injured. Within the budget we are trying to bring players in but we have to get on with it. That's life. The only worry I have is we will lose players through injury.
George O'Leary,It took 11 hours to get here and every minute was worth it.
George O'Leary,There are good running backs and there are special running backs. He is special.
George O'Leary,"No one is more disappointed than me in the performance we had on Saturday. As a head coach, the buck stops with me, and you are always searching for answers. Offensively we didn't block and we didn't sustain, and defensively we didn't tackle. Every time we did do something well, we took two steps back."
George O'Leary,"I don't get worried about kids being two-star, three-star, five-star or eight-star. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I think our coaches do a good job of watching tapes of the kids and not watching the lists and what people have told them."
Michael O'Leary,It is being done in honor of St. Patrick. It's not as though I'm having something I would normally have. It's a special thing.
Michael O'Leary,Our continued expansion out of the U.K. is probably going to force BA to get off more and more routes.
Michael O'Leary,"Our continued expansion out of the U.K. is probably going to force BA to get off more and more routes,"
Michael O'Leary,"We are aware that some commentators fear that we are biting off more than we can chew,"
Marvin Olasky,"Today, unless women gain jobs and athletic scholarships commensurate with their percentage of the population, feminists scream discrimination."
Marvin Olasky,Those who give of themselves rarely regret it.
Marvin Olasky,"Those who believe in the importance of serving others should lead the way by fighting against the temptation we all have, and maybe especially as we age, to close in upon ourselves."
Marvin Olasky,"The holy land was supposed to be spotless, a serious equivalent of Disneyland in which not a single candy wrapper is to stay on the ground for more than a few minutes."
Marvin Olasky,That should be our test regarding immigrants. Those who come to America to tear it down or live off of others should not be welcomed.
Marvin Olasky,"Since governmental quotas expand bureaucratic power, provoke a backlash and are unfair to individuals, we need to find a better way to increase minority opportunities."
Marvin Olasky,"President Bush has been careful in his statements specifically about Iraq to emphasize that we are on a long, winding and sometimes deadly road."
Marvin Olasky,"Philanthropic humility is necessary if a giver is to do more good than harm, but it is not sufficient - philanthropic prudence is also needed."
Marvin Olasky,"On sensitive issues, talk isn't cheap - it takes real courage to pry open topics nailed shut."
Marvin Olasky,"Most organizations should be pro-active, but philanthropists concerned with poverty should deliberately be reactive, learning from the efforts of ordinary folks who tired of looking the other way as their communities fell apart."
Marvin Olasky,More people need to understand the games secular liberals play. Here's one rule-of-thumb: No matter how bad a story sounds - particularly if it sounds bad - recognize the pattern of defamation.
Marvin Olasky,"Materialist philosophies that treat human beings as machines or animals possess the high ground in our culture - academia, the most powerful media and many of our courts."
Marvin Olasky,It starts this way: The worth of a job is not defined by what it allows you to do when you're not working.
Marvin Olasky,I still favor alternatives to governmental race-based preferences.
Marvin Olasky,I don't know the right number of immigrants to let in.
Marvin Olasky,"Fifteen years ago, while I was temporarily chairing meetings of pro-life leaders, I pleaded with the angry males to say no to interviews, and instead let beautiful pro-life women become the face for the movement."
Marvin Olasky,"But we shouldn't be surprised when bad things happen, and we shouldn't think of the United States as a holy land suddenly blemished."
Marvin Olasky,"Baseball needs to put the steroids era behind it by having and enforcing tough rules against all kinds of artificial advantages, so that spring can return."
Marvin Olasky,"And yet, those who speak loudly and call anyone who disagrees with them a wimp often do a disservice to the cause they are promoting."
Marvin Olasky,A job should employ God-given talents in a way that glorifies Him.
Merle Olberding,We made some not-so-wise decisions in the first half.
Merle Olberding,We lost some aggressiveness and we didn't respond like we had all year in those circumstances.
Merle Olberding,She's got a very bright future. She's a very talented young lady who understands the game of basketball and the team concept. She understands her strengths and the strengths of the people around her. You want somebody like her out on the floor playing for you.
Eddie Olczyk,"To be quite honest, since he got hurt, he looks more confident. I don't want to say he looks fresher, but it seems those couple of days off did him good."
Eddie Olczyk,"It's game we should have won. But the other night, the Kings led by four goals and lost. You're going to see games like this now."
Eddie Olczyk,We weren't scoring a lot of goals [earlier in the season] and Dickie was playing a lot and plus-minus kind of goes hand in hand. The only way that you'd ever be able to really get an honest assessment is to have the National Hockey League hire someone on a nightly basis just like they do in Major League Baseball and give players errors instead of plus-minus.
Eddie Olczyk,The execution wasn't there. This is the last thing we saw coming. ... This is the toughest game of the season.
Eddie Olczyk,We're really happy with the way that he's played. I don't think there's any doubt he'll be heading back to Pittsburgh with us. He's earned that right.
Eddie Olczyk,"I'm extremely happy for the guys. They showed a lot of moxie and a lot of courage and I couldn't be more proud of them. There have been games we've been down before, and that's a credit to them (to come back). I couldn't be any happier for them."
Eddie Olczyk,He was in playoff form the first game of the season. I don't know a higher compliment you can pay.
Eddie Olczyk,"He's starting to feel more comfortable. Guys of his stature, they just kind of let their ability and their hockey sense and anticipation take over."
Mary Oliver,"I have a notebook with me all the time, and I begin scribbling a few words. When things are going well, the walk does not get anywhere; I finally just stop and write."
Mary Oliver,So this is how you swim inward. So this is how you flow outwards. So this is how you pray.
Mary Oliver,"When it's over, I want to say: all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms."
Jorma Ollila,Europe has come a long way but is threatening to stop now that the need to work together is bigger than ever.
Jorma Ollila,"We felt very strongly that this digital technology would really take the industry,"
Jorma Ollila,Nokia is working closely with telecommunication service providers to reduce the cost of ownership and make more affordable and attractive handsets.
Jorma Ollila,"In mobile devices, we have been making excellent progress in expanding and upgrading our product offering, which is the broadest in the market and caters to all relevant consumers and trade customers globally,"
Jorma Ollila,"Profitability was driven by an excellent performance from our device businesses,"
Jorma Ollila,"Based on our strong performance and preliminary market data for the first nine months in 1998, we now feel confident in declaring that we have significantly increased our market share in mobile phones to become the largest manufacturer of mobile phones worldwide,"
Jorma Ollila,"Despite the more difficult market conditions ... we expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole, with better-than-anticipated margins,"
Jorma Ollila,"The handset market is entering a new growth period spurred by the arrival of an increasing number of mass volume products with colour and multimedia messaging capability, all enriching the customer experience,"
Jorma Ollila,"We have a very good picture about the fourth quarter, as we said EPS and revenue growth is expected to be higher, but we can't put an exact number on it in this uncertain environment."
Jorma Ollila,A robust market coupled with our strong product portfolio and excellent execution produced outstanding results in a seasonally challenging first quarter.
Jorma Ollila,Responsible policy makers do not make irresponsible decisions.
Jorma Ollila,"In addition to continuous growth in voice communication, other industries like music and digital imaging are quickly becoming more integral to mobility."
Jorma Ollila,"We expect to have market share of 40 percent in the handset business, from our current position of 35 percent,"
Ashley Olsen,"Lizzie plays club volleyball and Trent is an amazing writer. We're lucky our parents didn't stereotype us, so we could figure out who we are for ourselves."
Ashley Olsen,"It's interesting to see it all unravel. Gossip magazines, just by catching people walking down the streets, can actually be more effective and fashion-oriented than fashion magazines."
Ashley Olsen,The clothes are so cute. On little kids ... it's so cute with accessories and little details.
Greg Olsen,I'm looking forward to connecting with the students to be able to share my experiences in space. I think it's very important to encourage the youth of today to dream big and let them know that anything is possible through hard work and dedication.
Greg Olsen,Space is not for wimps. It's certainly not just writing a check.
Greg Olsen,they both said to me that whatever I feel now about space I will feel better when I'm up there.
Greg Olsen,"I grew up in space times. In seventh grade, my teacher said we had to do math and science because the Russians were beating us in the space race. It was a real catalyst. I wish we had something like that today."
Greg Olsen,I don't view it as a risk at all.
Greg Olsen,"I don't view it as a risk at all, ... Soyuz has an excellent reputation for safety and reliability."
Greg Olsen,I'll be most relaxed and happy after the rocket takes off.
Greg Olsen,This is going to have devastating consequences.
Greg Olsen,The partnership makes a commitment. You do your part and we'll do ours and not impoverish you.
Ken Olsen,"We make the solutions up out of modules, so they're all standard, ... They're built for security, reliability, ease of expansion and ease of changing. They're the ideas we had many years ago that tend to get lost today."
Ken Olsen,"When I was a teenager in the late 30's and early 40's, electronics wasn't a word. You were interested in radio if you were interested in electronics."
Ken Olsen,"On almost anything someone does in the computer business, you can go back in the literature and prove someone had done it earlier."
Ken Olsen,We really need it because Microsoft keeps releasing sloppier and sloppier software that needs a faster and faster machine. The speed is crazy.
Ken Olsen,Teamwork was more accepted 40 years ago.
Ken Olsen,The nicest thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from.
Ken Olsen,There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.
Ken Olsen,Software comes from heaven when you have good hardware.
James Olson,Tandberg Television because we were excited about being part of its customer-driven expansion and it was clear that we share a strong business and cultural identity and a common vision for the future of video entertainment.
James Olson,I don't oppose the boat ramp; I actually personally support a boat ramp if it's properly sized and designed.
James Olson,These findings are new to science. The contribution we have made is showing that neuroD2 is related to the development of the amygdala. This is the first time that a specific neurodevelopmental gene has been related to these emotional activities in the brain.
James Olson,"A big factor is the traditions here at Texas A&M. There's a strong history of military officers, the honor code, and there's a lot of patriotism on this campus. All of this leads to a lot of students motivated for positions in this field."
James Olson,"We had heavy-duty equipment on the site, and I'm accustomed to working around the water. We thought it was a thing we could do."
James Olson,"Now we're seeing that the neuroD2-deficient mice, when compared to normal littermates, show a profound difference in unconditioned anxiety levels as well as their ability to form emotional memories. All of this matches very well with previous observations that the amygdala is responsible for fear, anxiety, and aggression."

Now we're seeing that the neuroD2-deficient mice, when compared to normal littermates, show a profound difference in unconditioned anxiety levels as well as their ability to form emotional memories."
Jeff Olson,"It?s been a physical week of practice,"
Jeff Olson,"Students may not recognize that where they choose to take their test can affect their test performance - or that they have test site options. Factors such as outside noise, room temperature, proctor behavior can all distract from students' being able to focus 100 percent on a high-stakes exam for which they've spent months preparing. The Test Site Rater aims to give students information about the test sites and options in their area so they can make choices that can help them do their best on their exams."
Jeff Olson,Crater is going to hit you in the mouth. They certainly have the horses to do it.
John Olson,"Even in Lansing, there were gigs happening almost every night."
John Olson,"Rather, at the time, it seemed that all Merchant Energy companies were sucked down by the Enron undertow."
John Olson,"The thing I like is there?s as much bad criticism as there is good,"
Lute Olson,"It should be a really competitive game. Their strength is still perimeter, so there are some similarities between our teams."
Lute Olson,The race is a very tight one and this weekend will be critical for us.
Lute Olson,"No, I think you wait for the right opportunity to get that point across. That's the perception the Pac-10 always deals with. We want to make sure we don't fit that description."
Lute Olson,"No, I think you wait for the right opportunity to get that point across. That's the perception the Pac-10 always deals with. We want to make sure that we don't fit that description."
Lute Olson,"It would be a tragedy if these kids were left out. I definitely see us involved, regardless of the Pac-10 Tournament."
Lute Olson,Connecticut's quickness really hurt us right off. They were beating us down the court. We started off with lousy shots and that's our biggest problem right now.
Lute Olson,"We had the right guys at the line. That's what you have to do to win games. Against Washington, we didn't hit those, and it cost us the game."
Lute Olson,"We played as well offensively as we've played all year long. The key was we let the game come to us. We were working to get the open shot, and when we did we did a good job of knocking it down."
Lute Olson,He reminds me a lot of Sean Elliott at this stage. He has the same kind of competitive desire and will continue to get better.
Lute Olson,Marcus is a very good competitor but might not show that competitiveness as much as Sean did. Sean stepped in that freshman year and was a go-to guy and a leader.
Lute Olson,"I think there are a lot of similarities with the 1997 team. This is part of why you coach, the excitement of being in the NCAA tournament."
Lute Olson,"That was a great college basketball game. I thought both teams played well and played very hard. When it is that kind of game, it just comes down to one play here or there."
Mark Olson,"We are only now starting to hear indications of increased pricing power, but they're still anecdotal and we don't see it across the board."
Mark Olson,Big Love. It's really an odd way to look at marriage.
Mark Olson,"The farms are getting so huge. You know, they can farm so much. The guy that's got the land, he tries to get some more."
Mark Olson,underlying gains in employment and income were well maintained outside the Gulf region.
Mark Olson,This is the most secure note the U.S. government has ever produced.
Mark Olson,"These (energy) price increases will put upward pressure on the cost of the producers of other items, thereby posing the risk of some impetus to core inflation,"
Mark Olson,"It's the continuing lack of addressing the fundamental fiscal policy issues now that the economy has returned to a more-normal condition that we need to address,"
Mark Olson,"We don't believe that parents have rights over their children as if they were objects. What's important is that the child's relationships be sustained and maintained, so long as those relationships are in the best interests of the child."
Scott Oltmann,We didn't know if we could handle (Fischer). We've had problems with the best player on other teams in other games. We zoned them a little bit and I thought we did a good job.
Scott Oltmann,"We wanted to go 3-2 and I thought our kids played hard today. Salem is a good team, and this is a good tournament this year from top to bottom."
Scott Oltmann,"He's had some really outstanding games, both offensively and defensively. A key for him is consistency. He's starting to get better every game."
Austin O'Malley,Some that will hold a creed unto martyrdom will not hold the truth against a sneering laugh
Austin O'Malley,Some folks never handle the truth without scratching it
Austin O'Malley,"Exclusiveness is a characteristic of recent riches, high society, and the skunk."
Austin O'Malley,A habit of debt is very injurious to the memory
Austin O'Malley,The best blood will sometimes get into a fool or a mosquito
Austin O'Malley,You are not obliged to put on evening clothes to meet God
Austin O'Malley,Boards of public charity were invented by the devil to prevent real individual charity
Austin O'Malley,We should thank God that He did not give us the power of hearing through walls; otherwise there would be no such thing as friendship
Austin O'Malley,Happiness is the harvest of a quiet eye.
Austin O'Malley,Revenge is often like biting a dog because the dog bit you.
Jermaine O'Neal,"I'm looking forward to playing against those guys. To tell you the truth, I'm looking forward to playing against anybody. I've been out so long."
Jermaine O'Neal,"[All the credit for this unexpected surge goes to Carlisle, who's as quick to deflect praise as he is to accept criticism. His players though, are not so unassuming.] Rick Carlisle has to be Coach of the Year, ... If you have great players, it's easy to win. If you take away those players, it has to be the coach. Take away the top two or three players from any other team and ask me if they'd be in position to compete."
Jermaine O'Neal,I don't care about any distractions about any potential trades or anything else. Anybody who says it's distracting them has to be a better professional. This is the hand we have been dealt and we have to deal with it.
Jermaine O'Neal,He's more at peace. He's a really happy guy right now. He really likes to be around the locker room and the guys now.
Jermaine O'Neal,"My mother always told me, who are you if you're not effective, if you don't take what you have and use it to affect someone else's life. It's an honor and a pleasure to be around these people."
Jermaine O'Neal,"We sure have had enough bad luck for a year. I'm really, really concerned. I heard it pop. Hopefully, I won't need surgery."
Jermaine O'Neal,"Defensively, he's still learning. You've got to be a little bit patient because it is a transition for him. The preseason isn't a real NBA game. ... We're going to do our best to help him excel in the system."
Jermaine O'Neal,"Defensively, he's still learning, ... You've got to be a little bit patient because it is a transition for him. The preseason isn't a real NBA game. ... We're going to do our best to help him excel in the system."
Jermaine O'Neal,"To me, he's probably the best scorer in the league. Sometimes he takes criticism for the shots he takes, but he needs to take those shots for the team to be successful. He needs a low-post player. We joke all the time that we could play together. He's a guy who's going to make a low-post player better, and vice versa."
Jermaine O'Neal,"People base my dominance on scoring. I want to help the team control the paint, rebound and help the defense. We don't need me to score 20 points every night."
Jermaine O'Neal,"Rick Carlisle has to be Coach of the Year. If you have great players, it's easy to win. If you take away those players, it has to be the coach. Take away the top two or three players from any other team and ask me if they'd be in position to compete."
Jermaine O'Neal,I'll take the blame. I always do. I'll just have to live with that and rebuild and try to get it done next year.
Jermaine O'Neal,"I'm still very raw. It hurts my ability to make plays. I've got to find my rhythm. To get to our ultimate goal, I've got to pick up my play."
Jermaine O'Neal,"I feel pretty good about his ability to make plays and shoot the ball,"
Shaquille O'Neal,I had to apologize to the coach and the team. It was a terrible performance by me.
Shaquille O'Neal,"The key for me is to stay aggressive and not really worry about how they call the game. If they are going to foul me out, then they are going to have to foul me out."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I got into foul trouble early and never got into the flow of the game. The foul trouble is very frustrating, and I knew when I saw (referee) Bob Delaney I was going to be in trouble anyway. We did still have chances to win the game; we just made mistakes you can't make in this building."
Shaquille O'Neal,"It was very frustrating. However, I knew when I saw (official) Bob Delaney out there it would be trouble. You just can't make the mistakes that we did and win in this building."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I just have to be a little more careful and stay out of foul trouble. I'm in great shape, so I can play as many amount of minutes as I want to."
Shaquille O'Neal,"Obviously, do all the math and ... everybody knows what that [trade] is really about."
Shaquille O'Neal,"It's good that the proceeds go to where they go, but we have great fan support here, so we just want to give them a good show. Of course, it's not the Finals, so we're not going to go one million percent, but we might go 850,000 percent."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I was running the court very well, getting the ball and making the aggressive move. I'm still missing two or three jump hooks that I don't usually miss. I'll get it back."
Shaquille O'Neal,"They have rules that they write down. I just want them to enforce them consistently . Like I know, I got tackled under the basket. If I had done that, they would have given me a flagrant foul."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I'm going to practice Tuesday and see how hard I can go, and the true test is always the next day after that. We'll just wait until Tuesday and then we'll just see what happens."
Shaquille O'Neal,We wanted to power the ball inside. We did that and the whole team played good tonight. We played good defense. The team is playing pretty well right now.
Shaquille O'Neal,"For this incident, I don't want to be credited as an individual who does police work. I want to be credited as a Miami Beach police officer."
Shaquille O'Neal,We know when we have a performance like that most of the time we're going to hear it.
Shaquille O'Neal,"I'm just doing what I've been taught by my parents to do, ... This is the right thing to do, and I'm trying to urge other people to do it."
Shaquille O'Neal,"It's very, very frustrating. But we still had our opportunities to win the game. We just made too many mistakes, mistakes you can't make in this building."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I feel we made too many mistakes, especially down the stretch. We gave too many of their shooters open looks."
Shaquille O'Neal,It was a weird game. There was ugly shooting and a lot of turnovers and mistakes and we were just fortunate to get the win. I should have done better but it was just a very ugly and weird game.
Shaquille O'Neal,It's the same story against teams like this. We can't afford to make silly mistakes like that.
Shaquille O'Neal,We're having too many fundamental mistakes. We need to learn how to overcome those.
Shaquille O'Neal,I was kind of weak.
Shaquille O'Neal,"We have a new leader, and we just have to go out and get the job done."
Shaquille O'Neal,"That's the first time in history somebody has four offensive fouls before he has a defensive foul. They just need to be consistent in how they call the game. And it all starts at the top, when you got a guy like Stu Jackson running stuff, it's obvious why the referees are the way they are."
Shaquille O'Neal,"Hopefully it's the highest-watched game in NBA history. So when I get old, I can tell my kids I played in the game where 700 million people watched."
Shaquille O'Neal,Hopefully it's the highest-watched game in NBA history.
Shaquille O'Neal,I didn't say anything about Los Angeles. I said something about certain people. How can you hate a whole city. It doesn't make sense.
Shaquille O'Neal,Bring home the gold. We love you.
Shaquille O'Neal,"Iâ€™ve won at every level, except college and pro"
Shaquille O'Neal,"When we keep fighting, we're a hard team to beat. Now we just have to take that and bottle it up."
Shaquille O'Neal,It is just a little old fashion Texas beat down. They were three steps ahead of us. They had more energy.
Shaquille O'Neal,the environment there is poison.
Shaquille O'Neal,"They're a very young, energetic team. They play with a lot of poise, a lot of enthusiasm. And it's something we have to be prepared for. And we will be. It'll be a good test for us. We respect our opponent very much, but we'll be fine."
Shaquille O'Neal,I felt pretty good. I just wanted to get my guys going -- bring some energy and spirit to the lineup.
Shaquille O'Neal,"Right now sometimes we're doing it, sometimes we're not. We just have to develop some consistency."
Shaquille O'Neal,We just need to develop some type of consistency.
Shaquille O'Neal,"I want to congratulate Phil on returning to coach the Lakers, ... He is one of the premier coaches. I wish him the very best."
Shaquille O'Neal,I want to congratulate Phil on returning to coach the Lakers. He is one of the premier coaches. I wish him the very best.
Shaquille O'Neal,"I was a medium-level juvenile delinquent, class clown. And she would just say, 'Shaquille, that's not nice.' She was great to me."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I've been playing on Christmas for the last 10, 11, 12 years. So just got to get up early with the babies, and give them their toys and try to get a nap in and just come to play."
Shaquille O'Neal,"Everybody knows what that is really about. He had to make a choice, the young guy [Bryant] or the old guy. He made his choice, and good luck with his choice."
Shaquille O'Neal,"My comments were made out of frustration in the heat of the moment. But I realize that my choice of words was inappropriate and again, I would like to apologize."
Shaquille O'Neal,"We're just going to come out and play. We know that we're supposed to win all the games, but if we don't, we just have to take the next game and focus on what we did wrong in the game before and just try to do better at the next game."
Shaquille O'Neal,That is why one day I said my game will be like the Pythagorean Theorem - hard to figure out. A lot of people really don't know the Pythagorean Theory. They don't make them like me anymore. They don't want to make them like that anymore.
Shaquille O'Neal,Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else.
Shaquille O'Neal,Me shooting 40% at the foul line is just God's way to say nobody's perfect.
Shaquille O'Neal,"I want to be strong, dominant. Like Wilt Chamberlain."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I started out as a football player. I liked to inflict pain. In basketball, it was the same thing."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I put a lot into it, and when I am done playing, I plan on going undercover and then being the sheriff or chief of police somewhere, either Miami or Orlando, I don't know yet."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I play against a front and a back every night, Ming does not have to do that, Duncan does not have to do that, Garnett doesn't do that. I am the only one that has to do that."
Shaquille O'Neal,I have never been a shooter.
Shaquille O'Neal,"I had an awful first quarter but I picked it up. To all you single guys out there, it's not how you start the date, it's how you finish it sir. A lot of people can, you know, start the date with flowers and candy, but if you don't finish the date - you know what I mean?"
Shaquille O'Neal,I guess people think the taller you are the more dominant you have to be.
Shaquille O'Neal,I average 25 with three guys on me and they are just looking at stats I guess.
Shaquille O'Neal,I am the number one Ninja and I have killed all the Shoguns in front of me.
Shaquille O'Neal,"Everything happens for a reason. I'm used to it, I prepare for it. Like I say, at the end of the day, those in charge of their own destiny are going to do what's rights for them and their family."
Shaquille O'Neal,"But, hey I did everything the right way and earned my spot in this game, nothing was given to me."
Shaquille O'Neal,"But that is the only thing that slows me down is the system. No one, two or three was big enough to slow me down, only the system. It was the system that slowed me down to make my numbers fall. Not because I am older."
Shaquille O'Neal,I don't believe that I personally have been changed by the money. The bad thing is people assume you've changed because now you have money.
Shaquille O'Neal,"David Stern should get with the mothers of the NBA and let the moms decide what the dress code should be. I asked my mother if I could wear a chain, and she told me yeah. So I do stuff that my parents allow me to do."
Shaquille O'Neal,I don't get nervous in any situation. There's no such thing as nerves when you're playing games.
Shaquille O'Neal,We want to win. We want to win big. We want to win the whole thing.
Shaquille O'Neal,Our offense is like the pythagorean theorem: There is no answer!
Shaquille O'Neal,"This is a tough game. There are times when you've got to play hurt, when you've got to block out the pain."
Shaquille O'Neal,I would like to be refered to as 'The Big Aristotle'.
Shaquille O'Neal,Why don't you bring your face up here and let me punch it? Then you can tell me (if I'm stronger).
Shaquille O'Neal,"They shot the ball well early. What comes out of the microwave hot doesn't always stay hot. I know, because I eat bagels in the morning."
Shaquille O'Neal,One lucky shot deserves another.
Shaquille O'Neal,"And I want to do it the right way, like everybody else, not just a famous figurehead that gets a job because he is a famous basketball player. I want to really learn the business."
Shaquille O'Neal,I started out as a young Ninja and killed all of the Shoguns. I am a Shogun now and I'm holding my spot. There probably won't be another Shogun after this.
Shaquille O'Neal,I'm very excited about my new agreement with the Heat. This contract allows me to address all of my family's long-term financial goals while allowing the Heat the ability to acquire those players that we need to win a championship.
Shaquille O'Neal,"[O'Neal didn't let the rebuke go unnoticed.] He doesn't need advice on how to play his position, but he needs advice on how to play team ball, ... If it's going to be my team, I'll voice my opinion. If he don't like it, he can opt out."
Shaquille O'Neal,"If you got the game, you got the game. That's why Tiger Woods is out there playing golf with Greg Norman."
Shaquille O'Neal,"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok."
Buck O'Neil,"I've had some success, I really have. But I tell you what, you got to get that education."
Buck O'Neil,"A lot about the game has changed, and thankfully, much of it is for the better. There is still work to do, but today we have a Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, we have black owners, managers and executives of teams...and look what Nike has done! The Untold Truth Collection represents more than a jersey or a pair of sneakers. It represents our lives, our story, our legacy."
Buck O'Neil,"You know, people that think that about you, you know, it means everything in the world. (They're) showing their love for me because they know I love them."
Buck O'Neil,"Don't be so hard on him, ... Maybe he's got a young boy of his own at home."
Buck O'Neil,"He was wonderful and kind, always insisting on gentlemanly behavior and a good suit."
Buck O'Neil,The general manager of a baseball team can have lunch with the governor or he might have dinner with the United States president.
Tom O'Neil,It's the ultimate reality TV.
Tom O'Neil,The nominations are both the start and the stop of this year's Oscars race.
Tom O'Neil,"The guild nominations shook up the entire race with 'Crash' coming through on all the lists. Now, it looks like it will be a strong best picture contender."
Tom O'Neil,"In some ways, your Oscar speech is as important as the movie performance that got you the award. It's your chance to live forever in showbiz history. Or bore them to tears and come off as selfish and pampered."
Tom O'Neil,"The faulty premise here among the disciples of 'Passion' is that the movie was worthy,"
Tom O'Neil,"It's one thing to thank your mother, or someone who helped get your first job so you didn't have to sleep in your car. Hilary Swank gave one of the best speeches (for 1999's Boys Don't Cry) by staying personal. But who wants to hear a list of attorneys?"
Tom O'Neil,"When they snub 'E.T.' in favor of 'Gandhi,' it's a salute to the noble ideas and high-mindedness and values of Gandhi. It's not a sincere belief that that was the best film of the year."
Tom O'Neil,"It's out front early ... and sometimes it can hurt to be too far out front, too early."
Tom O'Neil,He wins no matter what because he really gets on the Hollywood radar this year.
Tom O'Neil,"They're hugged and slapped at the same time for what makes them so marketable. Hollywood is a sick, hypocritical place."
Tom O'Neil,"We see beauty punished in show business all the time. These people who have everything else  beauty, fame, paycheck gold  are being denied the trophy from their peers because something has to be withheld."
Tom O'Neil,"A smile is the most important expression a star can make. If the smile is a 200-watt smile, it's extraordinary. It's become a cosmetic necessity for the fancy folk. It's now more noticeable when you meet a star up close who doesn't have it."
Tom O'Neil,"It looks ridiculously unnatural up close, but Hollywood is the place where fakeness is celebrated. It's another example of extreme mouth makeovers. â€¦ Now you have a completely fake smile: pillow lips, bleached teeth and veneers."
Tom O'Neil,"There should be a compromise between having good, clean teeth for television and not looking freakish. But they take it to an extreme."
Tom O'Neil,"It's better that they fake it at the podium and show some class than let old feuds fume. It's important to forget those petty squabbles, look at the big picture and thank the people they disagreed with."
Tom O'Neil,"Stewart was helplessly miscast, to put it in Hollywood terms. He presided with some dignity and class and coolness, but he will not be invited back."
Tom O'Neil,"We see beauty punished in show business all the time. These people who have everything else â€” beauty, fame, paycheck gold â€” are being denied the trophy from their peers because something has to be withheld."
Tom O'Neil,"What's not here are those shows on the WB, like 'The Gilmore Girls,' which the TV Critics Association of America tells us is the best show on television, ... Why didn't it get any Emmy nominations? And what about 'Scrubs'? ... It's holding its own, critics love it, viewers love it, but Emmy voters aren't watching it, because it's too young skewing, and the geezer Emmy voters have a demographic a little north of what 'Scrubs' viewers are."
Tom O'Neil,Their acceptance speeches are often proof of what lousy actors they are. They're often thanking people we know they sparred with all over the place.
Eugene O'Neill,Happiness hates the timid! So does science!
Eugene O'Neill,"Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back"
Eugene O'Neill,Man's loneliness is but his fear of life.
Eugene O'Neill,"The old -- like children -- talk to themselves, for they have reached that hopeless wisdom of experience which knows that though one were to cry it in the streets to multitudes, or whisper it in the kiss to one's beloved, the only ears that can ever hear one's secrets are one's own!"
Jim O'Neill,The idea that currencies are less important to trade accounts now doesn't stand up to serious analysis.
Jim O'Neill,"We are basically waiting for the electronic security system to be 100 percent certified, and we are not there yet."
Jim O'Neill,"We expect from utilities what our customers expect from us, which is to supply a quality product. Our customers demand we focus on products that are reliable and make going about their day more convenient and easier. We expect from our utilities that they provide reliable power service so we can concentrate on our customer needs without having to set aside resources that do not focus on our customers' needs."
Jim O'Neill,I've been here for 24 years and we were giving out calendars when I started here.
Jim O'Neill,"Without a further [dollar] decline, U.S. net foreign indebtedness and the federal debt burden threaten to become overwhelming."
Jim O'Neill,"If you are so powerful in your communication, you may find you cannot get financial conditions to a level of tightness needed to bring inflation down."
Jim O'Neill,The ability for consumers to accelerate their purchases is high. Stronger-than-anticipated demand could result in the BOJ changing their minds about keeping easy policies for too long.
John O'Neill,"If I joined it, I couldn't live in this area because Catholics don't like the police."
John O'Neill,We are honored to have been selected to participate in this important project. We view this opportunity as an endorsement of our proven environmental management practices at our facility.
John O'Neill,At the flea market we'll have a table where we try to sell donated items and we'll contribute that money to the scholarship fund. We'll also cook the hot dogs and hamburgers and help out with the concessions.
John O'Neill,He mixes talent with great work ethic. He had a great freshman campaign and continues to improve. We hope with the continued strength development and experience that he will get faster and faster.
John O'Neill,We now have the ability to look for a match which will assist us in preparing for the World Cup.
Martin O'Neill,"It was a fantastic game and I thought the players were brilliant to come back from two goals behind,"
Martin O'Neill,"It's exciting stuff at the moment. We're scoring goals but the way we're defending means we're needing three and four goals to win games,"
Martin O'Neill,There are a couple of difficult games coming up like away to Hearts.
Martin O'Neill,I don't know where the players get their determination and their courage to keep going and they deserve great credit.
Martin O'Neill,"The goals gave us confidence and the tempo was good, but in the second half we over indulged, started playing fancy flicks and our centre-half started trying back-heels which might please the fans, but I'm not sure about the manager."
Martin O'Neill,"It has happened on more than one occasion now where the Rangers game gets dwarfed because of commitments elsewhere,"
Martin O'Neill,"I left football for personal reasons and these circumstances haven't changed one jot. I can't see them changing for the foreseeable future,"
Martin O'Neill,I am leaving Celtic purely for personal reasons and I am extremely sorry to be departing in such circumstances.
Paul O'Neill,a sign of the growing strength of the anti-terror coalition.
Paul O'Neill,I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street and telling the president. I don't go across the street and tell the president every time somebody calls me.
Paul O'Neill,to assure ourselves that their problems were not going to get translated into larger problems for the U.S. and the world capital markets.
Paul O'Neill,"We are very pleased with our earnings performance for the first half of the year, since we have been able to more than offset a 16 percent drop in aluminum prices on the (London Metals Exchange) since the beginning of 1998, ... We look forward to the addition of Alumax in the next quarter and have been hard at work with Alumax employees to make the acquisition very beneficial to Alcoa customers and shareholders."
Paul O'Neill,I pray daily . . . for peace.
Paul O'Neill,serious money is being blocked now.
Paul O'Neill,"This report shows that if we follow the current law, including the revenue raising components ... then there is a prospect down the road that we cannot meet the obligations that you have made by law to the American people,"
Paul O'Neill,with a view to ensuring that investors in all mortgage-backed securities are provided with the information that they should have.
Paul O'Neill,"If we're going to have a tax reduction ... I don't know why we wouldn't want it now, ... It won't hurt. We'll get ready for the next round of expansion in our economy."
Paul O'Neill,"In our history we have seen times when there is a disconnect between the stock market and the fundamental productive power of our economy, ... The reality is that our economy remains solid, and our recovery is well under way."
Paul O'Neill,"If you look at the market as a forecaster of the future, the markets are now above where they were when we re-opened the markets on September the 17th,"
Paul O'Neill,"I think our economy is coming back,"
Paul O'Neill,"I think ... our economy will rebound into reasonable rates of growth as we move into next year, ... So I am optimistic."
Paul O'Neill,"The U.S. economy has the potential to grow at 3 or 3.5 percent real growth for the indefinite future,"
Paul O'Neill,The company had a duty to inform its shareholders and its employees about things that were going on inside the company. That's not a federal government responsibility.

Paul O'Neill,"With our economy slowing, now is the time to boost consumer confidence with quick congressional action,"
Aristotle Onassis,We must free ourselves of the hope that the sea will ever rest. We must learn to sail in high winds.
Aristotle Onassis,"If women didn't exist, all the money in the world would have no meaning."
Aristotle Onassis,"After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts."

Aristotle Onassis,It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.

Jacqueline Onassis,"There are two kinds of women: those who want power in the world, and those who want power in bed"

Jacqueline Onassis,There are many little ways to enlarge your child's world. Love of books is the best of all.
Jacqueline Onassis,What is sad for women of my generation is that they weren't supposed to work if they had families. What were they going to do when the children are grown - watch the raindrops coming down the window pane?
Jacqueline Onassis,"Dear God, please take care of your servant John Fitzgerald Kennedy."
Jacqueline Onassis,The one thing I do not want to be called is First Lady. It sounds like a saddle horse.

Yoko Ono,Spread the word. Spread the peace.

Yoko Ono,"Marriage is a gamble, let's be honest."
Peter Oppenheimer,"As we anticipated, this pause was even more evident in the March quarter. Our sales teams were not discouraged from telling customers to wait for Intel-based Macs if that was the best thing for the customer."
Peter Oppenheimer,You have to bear in mind that the chip sector was the first industry into a recession and its not unreasonable to believe it would be first to come out. When it comes out of a recession it should herald a recovery for the technology sector but chip inventories are critical.
Peter Oppenheimer,"We are targeting the second-best quarter in the company's history, second only to last quarter, with revenue of about $4.3bn."
Peter Oppenheimer,We had nearly $14 billion in revenue â€“ the best in our history.

Bill O'Reilly,"Sean Penn is a left-wing guy, ... He's been that way, his father was that way, he's always going to be that way. He goes down to New Orleans with his boat, he rescues some people, and he does some good. The right kills him, and his wife curses at the right - it's all just a whole big charade. It doesn't really mean anything other than the fact that the guy did actually rescue some people."
Bill O'Reilly,"a real debate on the issues, not his silly name-calling."
Bill O'Reilly,"But I don't have any confidence in Donald Rumsfeld at this point. Do you, Colonel Cowan? I don't think he's leveling with the American people. I think that he doesn't have enough people over there to clean up the corruption, or fight the insurgency, or provide security for the oil pipeline, which they need [for] the money. I don't have any confidence in the secretary of defense at this point."

Bill O'Reilly,"They established their patriotic credentials long ago, and are either supportive of the Bush agenda or know when to keep their traps shut."

Bill O'Reilly,"If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."
Bill O'Reilly,Americans will respect your beliefs if you just keep them private.
Bill O'Reilly,"Yeah, I'm obnoxious, yeah, I cut people off, yeah, I'm rude. You know why? Because you're busy."
Bill O'Reilly,Dan Rather is guilty of not being skeptical enough about a story that was politically loaded.
Bill O'Reilly,"How desperate some in the print media are to smear Fox News. In the words of Teresa Heinz Kerry, the newspaper critics can shove it."
Bill O'Reilly,"You want to have two guys making out in front of your 4-year-old? It's OK with them. A guy smoking a joint, blowing the smoke into your little kid's face? OK with them. And I'm not exaggerating here. This is exactly what the secular movement stands for."
Bill O'Reilly,"That's my advice to all homosexuals, whether they're in the Boy Scouts, or in the Army or in high school: Shut up, don't tell anybody what you do, your life will be a lot easier."
Bill O'Reilly,Public misbehavior by the famous is a powerful teaching tool.
James O'Shaughnessy,"If you have a 401(k) at work and you don't use it, it's like literally walking by buckets of money every day,"
James O'Shaughnessy,"In terms of thinking about market valuations, think, do I care? My goals are 10, 20 years from now, not now. If you have shorter-term goals, you should be aware that market valuations fluctuate wildly."
James O'Shaughnessy,"The model never varies. It never has an ego problem; it never has a fight with its spouse; it never wants to prove that it's right. The model is never hung-over after a night of partying -- it just does the same thing, time and time again. Very boring, very profitable."
James O'Shaughnessy,"I tell people to design their ideal life. What do you want to do? What do you want to be? ... Sit down, add up your expenses, write out your life."

John O'Shea,"I rate the Sydney horses as an amazing bunch and Paratroopers in the best of them,"
John O'Shea,"Frankie was all aggression, a 119-pound stick of dynamite, ... He wasn't a very big guy at all but he definitely had huge heart. He never went back (in the boxing ring), always forward, forward, forward."
John O'Shea,"I see it as a slow Rwanda. No one is prepared to take the necessary action. We knew that the AU troops couldn't do the job, but so far there has been nothing but talk - the UN is preparing for this or that, but nothing is being done yet."
Eddie O'Sullivan,"As well as the return of the more senior players, we still have a good blend of youth with Andrew Trimble, Rory Best, Neil Best and Jerry Flannery all coming into the Six Nations with a little bit more experience."

Eddie O'Sullivan,It's great that we're authors of our own destiny in this championship.
James O'Sullivan,You look at this floor and you see a striking polarity. It's the market--people who say they want fuel economy and others who say they want power. We try to give them both.
James O'Sullivan,This has important implications for overall growth.
James O'Sullivan,Those factors caution against extrapolating the third-quarter surge.
James O'Sullivan,"Those factors caution against extrapolating the third-quarter surge,"
James O'Sullivan,"Frankly, the risk of a major pickup seems to have faded lately. We haven't gotten more action from energy prices."

Paul O'Sullivan,While new growth for the year is expected to moderate we aim to exceed overall market growth.
Paul O'Sullivan,"Our mobile customer numbers showed strong growth, despite the market getting closer to saturation and experiencing strong price competition with capped plans."
Ronnie O'Sullivan,The physical and mental pain [of playing snooker] has been taking its toll.
Ronnie O'Sullivan,"Losing used to hurt me,"
Ronnie O'Sullivan,I know what I want to do and there's no point giving my secrets away.
Ronnie O'Sullivan,I do entertain a lot of negative thoughts and I haven't got any self-belief. But I haven't done bad for someone without any self-belief.
Tim O'Sullivan,"[It was the pre-season CAA-favored Rams' first conference victory (1-1-1). O'Sullivan has made a number of lineup alterations, among them moving senior left back Stephen Shirley to holding central midfielder.] In the last two weeks, he has been one of the bright spots, ... He has become an on-field leader we did not have."
Tim O'Sullivan,There is not a lot of conviction buying dollars now.

Magglio Ordonez,You have to get used to winning. Winning is a habit. Losing is a habit.
Magglio Ordonez,The doctors have cleared me. I'll be ready to play by spring training. Everybody will see. I'm pain-free and in better shape than ever now after rehabbing so long.
Magglio Ordonez,"I want to spend time with my fans. This team made a big commitment to sign me here. I have to return that. I have to be here. I have to spend time with my teammates, with the fans, with all you guys. I need to do that. Detroit has a lot of good fans."

Ed Orgeron,We had a good practice today. We went through every special situation you can think of. We concentrated on sudden change and overtime. It was needed and good work. We just wanted a practice where we covered all the bases and all the things that can happen in a football game.

Origen,"This also is a part of the teaching of the Church, that there are certain angels of God, and certain good influences, which are His servants in accomplishing the salvation of men."
Origen,"This also is a part of the Church's teaching, that the world was made and took its beginning at a certain time, and is to be destroyed on account of its wickedness."

Origen,"Now our whole activity is devoted to God, and our whole life, since we are bent on progress in divine things."
Origen,"Having refuted, then, as well as we could, every notion which might suggest that we were to think of God as in any degree corporeal, we go on to say that, according to strict truth, God is incomprehensible, and incapable of being measured."
Origen,"For whatever be the knowledge which we are able to obtain of God, either by perception or reflection, we must of necessity believe that He is by many degrees far better than what we perceive Him to be."
Origen,"For if the mystery concealed of old is made manifest to the Apostles through the prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise men, understood what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what was made manifest to the Apostles."
Origen,"But the Wisdom of God, which is His only-begotten Son, being in all respects incapable of change or alteration, and every good quality in Him being essential, and such as cannot be changed and converted, His glory is therefore declared to be pure and sincere."
Origen,"But God, who is the beginning of all things, is not to be regarded as a composite being, lest perchance there should be found to exist elements prior to the beginning itself, out of which everything is composed, whatever that be which is called composite."
Origen,"But Paul, in his preaching of the Gospel, is a debtor to deliver the word not to Barbarians only, but also to Greeks, and not only to the unwise, who would easily agree with him, but also to the wise."

Suze Orman,The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom
Suze Orman,We never had it as rough as the kids have it today. Look at the price of a gallon of gas or a piece of real estate or a college education.
Suze Orman,"They got married, they got divorced, and half their money goes out the window."
Suze Orman,I think they've been baby bummers.
Suze Orman,If you have debt I'm willing to bet that general clutter is a problem for you too.

Suze Orman,A big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the what-ifs of life.
Jonathan Ornstein,"Our lawyers feel these guys were trying to pull out all the stops from bringing our low fares to the marketplace and felt the suit was necessary. Frankly, I always view lawsuits as negative energy, and a lot of time spent on lawyers' pay with very little good coming out of them. But it's clear these guys were willing to pull out all the stops and so we felt we had no choice."
Jonathan Ornstein,We are delighted to put this piece in place as we prepare for the inauguration of go! service.
Jonathan Ornstein,"Given the difficult operating environment and US Airways transition and Hawaii startup expenses, we are pleased with these results. Focusing on cost, our transition and Hawaii startup expenses of $3.6 million for the quarter were within plan."
Jonathan Ornstein,It is strategically the most important endeavor that we've embarked upon since I've been with the company.
Norman Ornstein,"My understanding is that now, after taking soundings, he's thinking about running for leader."
Norman Ornstein,"Even if the reality is, there's nothing more that he could have done back in Washington or anywhere else ... the symbol matters."
Norman Ornstein,Even those people in the leadership who've done commendable jobs may find themselves in the cross hairs just because it's possible there will be a more widespread desire for change.
Norman Ornstein,There's no question that it will hurt him and it will hurt him significantly. He's still getting the solid support from his base. The question now is whether his performance with the hurricane begins to affect his performance with his base.
Norman Ornstein,"The pivotal moment in the 1992 campaign was when [the first President] Bush said, 'The economy is not as bad as you think it is'. If this president reaches a point where he's suggesting the same thing -- and that's not far from where they are now -- then they have a problem."
Norman Ornstein,"It's a disaster for DeLay. They've not only formally started the process, but this is a public petition."
Norman Ornstein,There's a sense that there is a culture of cronyism and corruption and incompetence
Norman Ornstein,"If you passed a steroids bill now while letting the deficit careen out of control and not doing much to get Iraq on track, they would attract a lot of ridicule for spending their time on it,"
Norman Ornstein,I think it's clear we're in damage control now.
Norman Ornstein,"If you passed a steroids bill now while letting the deficit careen out of control and not doing much to get Iraq on track, they would attract a lot of ridicule for spending their time on it."
Norman Ornstein,"It's a self-perpetuating system involving interests, members of Congress, people in the executive branch and patronage positions and so on."
Norman Ornstein,It's the most expansive vision of the executive power of a president in our lifetime. To suggest that (Congress has) given him a blanket authority to do what he has done is a vast stretch.
Norman Ornstein,"Congress as a whole needs to step back and look at the way it conducts its business. It's not just lobbyists influencing members of Congress, it's members of Congress shaking down lobbyists for money."
Norman Ornstein,Lots of members have been appalled at the kind of Gilded Age mentality of the party. Others felt like they had to take one for the team.
Norman Ornstein,"When you have a dramatic expansion of the ability of individual members to direct federal funds or to designate contracts, you are creating the most fertile environment for corruption imaginable."
Norman Ornstein,"But, after the terrible lapses that occurred here, they are going to be on the defensive, and the ability to push other things onto the agenda will be limited."
Bobby Orr,I don't know if anybody could shoot it like he shot it. Not only was it hard - a lot of guys can shoot it hard - but he got it around the net most of the time.
Bobby Orr,"In my mind he's the most talented player I've ever seen. If it were not for health problems, God only knows what his numbers would have been."

James Orr,We need to know this information.
James Orr,"Daves track record of revenue growth combined with strong profitability performance in both Customer Care and Information Management reflects his deep knowledge of the business and the needs of our clients. While we are making good progress in 2005 and we remain comfortable with our 2005 revenue and earnings guidance, Daves leadership will allow us to continue to build our growth and profitability while further leveraging our unique customer care and billing value proposition."
Robert Orr,This is a very good start but there is a lot of work to be done.
Robert Orr,"And the fundamental question is, why does someone with such extraordinary wealth look for the taxpayers of the state to subsidize his ventures?"
Robert Orr,We need to stop the race to the bottom that subsidizes the largest businesses at the expense of small companies and taxpayers.
Robert Orr,"While it all sounds good, what are the real specifics and where is the money coming from? And the fundamental question is why does someone with such extraordinary wealth look for the taxpayers of the state to subsidize his ventures?"
Robert Orr,This is not a single-elimination tournament. There are other games to be played.
Robert Orr,We're disappointed in the conclusions. I think there's serious constitutional consequences to it. Who knows what other revenue-raising measures could be slipped into legislation.
Robert Orr,It's really troubling from a public policy standpoint to have business conducted this way. It gives government and government officials a black eye.
Brian Orser,They have a television on in the lounge and I'll duck in a few times between floods to check things out. It's exciting to see Russ going for Olympic gold.
Brian Orser,And I've actually taken a few golf lessons from Russ.
Brian Orser,"They had a TV on in the lounge, so I ducked in to watch the action between lessons."
Daniel Ortega,"The fact is that the United States is behind what has happened in Nicaragua, and what they did was to promote a confrontation between Nicaraguans."
Daniel Ortega,"His intelligence. He?s skillful and he?s very, very intelligent. He always just makes that right play."
Daniel Ortega,"We grew up in a situation where we didn't know what freedom or justice were, and therefore we didn't know what democracy was."
Daniel Ortega,"The people of Nicaragua were suffering oppression. This made us develop an awareness which eventually led us to commit ourselves to the struggle against the domination of the capitalists of our country in collusion with the U.S. government, i.e. imperialism."
Daniel Ortega,Today the winds of hope blow through Latin America and the Caribbean.
David Ortiz,I found out that they are doing whatever is possible to trade him.
David Ortiz,"I'm just trying to break the rules,"
David Ortiz,Everybody has something to prove each year. Everybody has a responsibility in this game. Even the batboy.
David Ortiz,I just love the feeling from the fans and when I'm walking on deck I can hear people screaming and wishing you the best. That puts you into the game more than anything.
David Ortiz,"One thing I know is that Gabe is a tough guy. He's a guy that is not afraid of pain. So when I see everybody running on the field to get him up, I knew there was something wrong."
David Ortiz,He was all right. He got away with some mistakes.
David Ortiz,I talked to Manny like a week ago and he was going to Italy tomorrow.
David Ortiz,It's an honor because Edgar was one of my superheroes when I was coming up.
David Ortiz,Johnny always played hard here. I wish it had been different.
David Ortiz,"You think every hitter out there wins a Gold Glove? ... Dude, Jose Canseco won an M.V.P."
David Ortiz,"Eleventh inning, man. You've got to bring your A game, ... Those guys, you can't be giving them a lot of chances."
David Ortiz,"I'm still sort of fighting myself. Every year it's the same. You start a little off of where you want to be. I'm not going to see too many good pitches to hit, so I've got to make my adjustments as I can."
David Ortiz,We have to keep fighting.
David Ortiz,What can you do? ... Nothing but keep fighting.
David Ortiz,It doesn't matter if we were down 3-0. You've just got to keep the faith. The game is not over until the last out.
David Ortiz,"In my country, the Dominican Republic, people are very excited about the World Baseball Classic. People are always asking me, 'Are you going to play? Are you going to play?' It's what they want to see. It's been crazy. But I don't know what's happening with it. I've been trying to find out about the Classic, but it's tough to get any information about it."
David Ortiz,"Ortiz said. ''We are the same age. We hang out together. Watching TV together and seeing what was going on in New Orleans, we knew we had to do something."
David Ortiz,You don't want to make a big mistake. Those guys always take advantage of that. I've been watching them for a long time. You have to play your best against them. It doesn't matter how bad they've been playing or how bad they've been struggling. You've got to bring your 'A' game against them all the time.
David Ortiz,You get used to it. I take it as it comes. They say I have a natural ability to do it.
Kyle Orton,"The Bears have described Orton as mature beyond his years, and although that's a good thing, it's worth noting that just because Gary Coleman was mature beyond his years, it didn't make him Sir Laurence Olivier ."
Kyle Orton,[Orton's] got my vote.
Kyle Orton,"I think that's my strength coming from Purdue. We threw the ball to a lot of different guys, we had a lot of different options with every single play. I think that's one of my strengths, is to be able to see the field, see who's coming, see who's blitzing and where the holes are going to be."
Kyle Orton,"They confused me, ... I've got a lot of learning to do."
Kyle Orton,"I'm a young guy, I'm looking for improvement every week. I'm not arrogant enough to say that I don't have anything to work on I've got a ton of stuff to work on. Every game that I am on the field is an advantage for me. I have a ton of stuff to work on."
Kyle Orton,"I obviously know the recent history,"
Kyle Orton,I'm not happy with that one. We've got to get better.
Kyle Orton,"It seems like when you're a good football team and you keep on pressing on people, you press them into mistakes, ... That's just what we're doing. We're wearing on people."
Kyle Orton,It was a lot of fun and a big confidence builder. It was a big comeback.
Kyle Orton,So I'm not scared of anything. I've got a lot of confidence in myself and how I can play. I'm just going to try and give us a chance to win every game.
George Orwell,"Good novels are not written by orthodoxy-sniffers, nor by people who are conscience-stricken about their own orthodoxy. Good novels are written by people who are not frightened."
George Orwell,"He is a man of thirty-five, but looks fifty. He is bald, has varicose veins and wears spectacles, or would wear them if his only pair were not chronically lost. If things are normal with him, he will be suffering from malnutrition, but if he has recently had a lucky streak, he will be suffering from a hangover. At present it is half past eleven in the morning, and according to his schedule he should have started work two hours ago; but even if he had made any serious effort to start he would have been frustrated by the almost continuous ringing of the telephone bell, the yells of the baby, the rattle of an electric drill out in the street, and the heavy boots of his creditors clumping up the stairs. The most recent interruption was the arrival of the second post, which brought him two circulars and an income tax demand printed in red. Needless to say this person is a writer."
George Orwell,For a creative writer possession of the ''truth'' is less important than emotional sincerity.
George Orwell,"The child thinks of growing old as an almost obscene calamity, which for some mysterious reason will never happen to itself. All who have passed the age of thirty are joyless grotesques, endlessly fussing about things of no importance and staying alive without, so far as the child can see, having anything to live for. Only child life is real life."
George Orwell,"They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening"

George Orwell,"The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection â€¦ that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals."
George Orwell,"The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals."
George Orwell,The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection.
George Orwell,The existence of good bad literature --the fact that one can be amused or excited or even moved by a book that one's intellect simply refuses to take seriously --is a reminder that art is not the same thing as cerebration.
George Orwell,"All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives lies a mystery. Writing a book is a long, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand."
George Orwell,"To write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no reliable words. Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up."

George Orwell,To see what is in front of one's nose requires a constant struggle.
George Orwell,"Throughout recorded time... there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable."

George Orwell,"The atmosphere of orthodoxy is always damaging to prose, and above all it is completely ruinous to the novel, the most anarchical of all forms of literature."

George Orwell,"We of the sinking middle class may sink without further struggles into the working class where we belong, and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful as we feared, for, after all, we have nothing to lose."
George Orwell,The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.
George Orwell,"The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun."
George Orwell,"Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them"
George Orwell,All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.

Rex Osborn,Don't leave the engine running or the keys in the ignition. Park it in a garage if you can.
Rex Osborn,"If you're going to go through the same training, why not be a police officer and get paid?"
Rex Osborn,You should also know who you are lending your car to. We've had people who said they loaned their car a neighbor and called because they haven't been seen again. (Officers) will ask what the neighbor's name is and they have no idea what the last name is. It doesn't happen often but it does happen.
Rex Osborn,We believe it will go up because one of the people who steal cars for a living is back out on the streets.
Rex Osborn,Our town has grown. For a good quality of life you have to stay ahead of the curve.
Adam Osborne,The future lies in designing and selling computers that people don't realize are computers at all
Adam Osborne,Venture capitalists are like lemmings jumping on the software bandwagon.
Adam Osborne,We can learn from IBM's successful history that you don't have to have the best product to become number one. You don't even have to have a good product.
Adam Osborne,"I take what I see work. I'm a strict believer in the scientific principle of believing nothing, only taking the best evidence available at the present time, interpreting it as best you can, and leaving your mind open to the fact that new evidence will appear tomorrow."
Adam Osborne,This is the ultimate con game - I'm having fun and people pay me to do it.

Tom Osborne,"One of the goals we have set for this year is that we never want to get beat by seven points or less, ... That might sound funny, but if you look at last year's results, we lost three games by seven or less. We could have gone into the tournament with five wins instead of two wins, and then that confidence would have been there. So there are opportunities to improve our record dramatically by winning the close games."
Tom Osborne,"That delay helped us. We had a couple of guys who were ready to fall out from the heat. We went inside and watched 'Hoosiers' for for about 30 minutes, and told the kids to just get relaxed. We fed them some fruit and peanut butter, and then came back out and played well."
Tom Osborne,"This is information that seniors need to have and understand, ... The Medicare prescription bill was a contentious one in Congress. The average person on Medicare will see a savings of 50 percent in prescription drug costs with this program."
Tom Osborne,"Rarely do you have everything come together, a good supporting class and that key quarterback there for three years. Anytime you break in a quarterback, no matter, how talented it's hard to go out and win every game."
Tom Osborne,"I have told these kids that they could be the best senior class that we have ever had, ... All five are going to be great contributors and solid leaders. And they want to make sure they are having fun. They know how much they are depending on these juniors and sophomores and freshmen."
Tom Osborne,"Each individual may decide if it is an advantage to be in a plan, ... It is a voluntary program."
Tom Osborne,"I think we have a lot of confidence, and I think we've got a lot of athletic ability. We have put in more offense in a week and a day than we ran all of last season. We had 14 seniors last year, but seven of those were first-year players. So now, most of our kids have been in the system at least a year, with some having two or three years' experience."
Jack Osbourne,"But you know, my mom having to go to the hospital seven times... like passed out because of pain... I wouldn't come home and sit with my family and be with my dad - I'd call someone up and... I'd go and get obliterated drunk and I'd go, like, on two-week benders."

Chris Osgood,Manny is going to play the majority of the games. But it would be nice to play a little more.
Joe Osha,We think that the worst is past in terms of the downturn.
Joe Osha,"While many of the stocks in this group are already down by 50 percent over the past several weeks, we believe that inventory concerns, coupled with telecom service provider capital spending concerns, will weigh on the group for the next one to two quarters."
Joe Osha,"While many of the stocks in this group are already down by 50 percent over the past several weeks, we believe that inventory concerns, coupled with telecom service-provider capital-spending concerns, will weigh on the group for the next one to two quarters. We note that the group in aggregate still has the highest valuations in the semiconductor business, even after the recent decline."
Joe Osha,Intel's status as an industry bellwether has allowed the stock to move with the industry in the past.
Joe Osha,"June improvement may yet materialize, but it's not turned up yet and defending a sequential revenue increase is getting tougher."
Adams Oshiomhole,Our traditional method of striking has not resolved the problem of price increases and other socio-political problems in Nigeria.
Adams Oshiomhole,This fuel price increase is the eighth in six years and life has become expensive for Nigerians who are dying from hunger and hardship.
Adams Oshiomhole,"Nigerians have spoken their anger, hunger, hardship and frustration and if the government fails to listen, the responsibility and consequences of what follows lie squarely at its doorstep because we cannot guarantee peace and security in this kind of environment."
William Osler,"Half of us are blind, few of us feel, and we are all deaf."
William Osler,"The great minds, the great works transcend all limitations of time, of language, and of race, and the scholar can never feel initiated into the company of the elect until he can approach all of life's problems from the cosmopolitan standpoint."
William Osler,A physician who treats himself has a fool for a patient.
William Osler,Nothing in life is more wonderful than faith.
William Osler,Nothing in life is more wonderful than faith - the one great moving force which we can neither weigh in the balance nor test in the crucible
William Osler,The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease
William Osler,"Observe, record, tabulate, communicate. Use your five senses. . . . Learn to see, learn to hear, learn to feel, learn to smell, and know that by practice alone you can become expert."
William Osler,"There is a form of laughter that springs from the heart, heard every day in the merry voice of childhood, the expression of a laughter -- loving spirit that defies analysis by the philosopher, which has nothing rigid or mechanical in it, and totally without social significance. Bubbling spontaneously from the heart of child or man."
William Osler,It is much more important to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what sort of a disease a patient has.
William Osler,"There are, in truth, no specialties in medicine, since to know fully many of the most important diseases a man must be familiar with their manifestations in many organs."
William Osler,"To study the phenomena of disease without books is to sail an uncharted sea, while to study books without patients is not to go to sea at all."
William Osler,"He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all."
William Osler,The desire to take medicine is perhaps the greatest feature which distinguishes man from animals.
William Osler,"Study until 25, investigate until 40, profession until 60, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance."
William Osler,"Here's the advice Sir William Osler gave the students at Yale: Live neither in the past nor in the future, but let each day absorb all your interest, energy and enthusiasm. The best preparation for tomorrow is to live today superbly well."
William Osler,Advice is sought to confirm a position already taken.
William Osler,"Take the sum of human achievement in action, in science, in art, in literature -- subtract the work of the men above forty, and while we should miss great treasurers, even priceless treasures, we would practically be where we are today. . . . The effective, moving, vitalizing work of the world is done between the ages of twenty-five and forty."
William Osler,"The value of experience is not in seeing much, but in seeing wisely."
Donny Osmond,"My father instilled in me the attitude of prevailing. If there's a challenge, go for it. If there's a wall to break down, break it down."
Donny Osmond,"If you're climbing the ladder of life, you go rung by rung, one step at a time. Don't look too far up, set your goals high but take one step at a time. Sometimes you don't think you're progressing until you step back and see how high you've really gone."
Donny Osmond,Success sometimes can really bite you in the shorts.
Donny Osmond,I never smile unless I mean it.
Donny Osmond,I don't want my album coming out with a 'G' rating. Nobody would buy it.
Kevin Osnes,"They have everything in their favor. Revenge, the home court, the regional. We just want to play our best."
Kevin Osnes,"The kids are really happy. Their goals for the season were to win the district and the regional. They've accomplished that. Now, we are looking forward to the state tournament and to see how far we can go."
Kevin Osnes,We played a tough schedule this season in preparation for these type of games. It's paid off for us at the district and regional level and it did again tonight.
Kevin Osnes,"As a team, we have to understand that the game starts inside-out."
Kevin Osnes,I'd lot rather seen them with my own eyes. Other former coaches scouted for me. The coaching fraternity has been very good to me this year.
Kevin Osnes,There were a lot of mixed emotions in that locker room after the game. Our season's so long and to be where we were â€” right there with a lead in the fourth quarter with a chance to put it away and go to the state championship game â€” was rather disappointing.
Kevin Osnes,We've been able to control the tempo. We've done well on the defensive boards and our defense has been solid. We're a balanced scoring team with consistent offensive output and we haven't gotten rattled or lost our composure or patience even when we're down.
Kevin Osnes,I believe we are a real mirror image of each other. We're two of the top teams of the state. It is going to be a battle.
Joel Osteen,I am excited about the opportunity of expanding our outreach with Free Press.
Joel Osteen,Another thing I remind myself is that God knows what's best for me.
Joel Osteen,Don't put a question mark where God has put a period.
Joel Osteen,"It is flattering to be mentioned in such company; However, it is more rewarding to know that so many lives are being changed for the better."
Joel Osteen,"My mother was very ill with terminal cancer she was given a few weeks to live, but she started speaking the word praying healing scriptures and it didn't happen overnight, but in time she got better and she's healthy today. Why did God heal my mother and not someone else's I don't know. I just know I'd rather die believing."
Joel Osteen,"[In August 2004, he did a free appearance at the 18,000-seat Philips Arena in Atlanta and filled it beyond overflowing, with the fire marshal turning away as many as 8,000 people.] I didn't know what arena size to get, ... Atlanta was our first. I couldn't believe it."
Joel Osteen,I made a decision when my father passed away that I was going to be who God made me to be and not try to preach like my father.
Michael Osterholm,There's very limited lab space there.
Michael Osterholm,"That's the difference between planning for an F1 hurricane or an F5,"
Michael Osterholm,What we need to be doing now is the basic planning of how we get our communities through 12 to 18 months of a pandemic.
Michael Osterholm,Understand that a lot of the things we need to do to prepare are not related to magic bullets.
Michael Osterholm,"How do you provide food, water ... basic security for the population?"
Michael Osterholm,What this research does is it provides us with the evidence that we have to look into the eyes of H5 and realize it . . . has the potential to be a cousin of H1N1. Then that tells us we're potentially going to be experiencing an F5 and not an F1.
Michael Osterholm,"Ninety-five out of 100 will live. But with the nation in crisis, will we have food and water? Are we going to have police and security? Will people come to work at all?"
Paul Otellini,"Intel's Pentium III processor operating at 1 GHz is the highest performance microprocessor for PCs, enabling Intel's customers to ship the fastest personal computers in the world."
Paul Otellini,"Intel's Pentium III processor operating at 1 GHz is the highest performance microprocessor for PCs, enabling Intel's customers to ship the fastest personal computers in the world,"
Paul Otellini,"The importance of performance per watt is obvious for things you carry along with you, such as laptops - you want higher performance and longer battery life. But increasingly it is essential for things beyond mobility."
Paul Otellini,Growth in our industry is clearly back.
Paul Otellini,"In recent years, the notebook has seen great evolution, but the good old desktop has not. But the desktop still has an enormous installed base; desktops are more than 70 percent of all PCs sold, about 85 million units per year."
Paul Otellini,Intel's investments in R&D and capital are enabling the company to post its third consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth.
Paul Otellini,But we're not going to take 90 days to take action.
Sid Otton,Thank you. Thank you very much. You provide us with tremendous support.
Sid Otton,"As long as I'm healthy and keep enjoying the ride, I'm going to keep going."
Sid Otton,There are two big emotions tonight. One of them is a downer. It was a great night for the kids except for what happened to Justin.
Alexander Ovechkin,"We had a good game tonight, but we made a few too many mistakes. Tomorrow is a big game and we can't make those mistakes."
Alexander Ovechkin,We came out and played hard. I'm happy to score three goals to win this game. It's my first hat trick in the NHL and it feels like my first goal in the NHL.
Alexander Ovechkin,It was a funny goal.
