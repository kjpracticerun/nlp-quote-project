Dwyane Wade,"That's why we go through preseason, for guys to get it in their heads, `You've got to trust other guys,' even though all of us feel we have the ability to take over the game,"
Dwyane Wade,"It's all a win-now philosophy. We've got some old guys on this team. Gary (Payton) ain't got five, six more years left. Shaq ain't got five, six more years left. That is the reason the trade was made. We'd be kidding ourselves if we thought the trade was for us to grow together for the next three years. No, it's not. We understand that."
Dwyane Wade,"No matter what, it's going to be sore. It's just a matter of how much pain you can take. I think I'll be fine."
Dwyane Wade,"Maybe I got hurt for a reason - to bring these guys here and we all celebrate together over on Biscayne Bay one day,"

Dwyane Wade,It's not one guy sticking me the whole game where we're both getting tired.
Dwyane Wade,"Having him back there as a force willed us to victory on the defensive end. We're lucky to have him, especially with Shaq being in foul trouble. We're lucky to have the best backup center in the league."
Dwyane Wade,"Y'all might have made him mad. I think y'all lit a fire under him, so that's good."
Dwyane Wade,"He wasn't missing and he was looking good. He had that confident look. His eyes were real big and when that happens, you know he's confident."
Dwyane Wade,It's just a sprained ankle that's sore. It just happened so it's a quick turnaround. The doctors and trainers didn't want me to test it. A day to get it better tomorrow and we'll see.
Dwyane Wade,The Dallas game was a disaster. But you know what? Sometimes you need games like that to wake yourself up and look yourself in the mirror. It was three bounce-back games for us.
Dwyane Wade,This was a good one for me as far as my consistency goes because that's a good team that doesn't beat itself. It was just a matter of pulling the trigger and making my shots.
Dwyane Wade,Our defense is coming along. We're getting our rotations down. The communication is better. The main this is we're all beginning to understand what everyone is doing.
Dwyane Wade,"Third preseason game, and coach looked like he coached the end of the season, ... Guys are putting their heads down already."

Dwyane Wade,"I didn't have my athletic ability tonight the way I would have liked to have it. But I was able to make the plays I had to make with a couple blocked shots and a couple steals. I would have liked to have more athletic ability tonight, but I did what I had to do."
Dwyane Wade,I didn't have my athletic ability tonight.
John Wade,"Go to any team. If you're not hurt, you probably haven't been playing."

John Wade,"It's frustrating, ... If I get desperate, I'll call my friends at CSU and DU. It's not the worst thing, but it is a minus."
John Wade,"To have an experience like this, it's unbelievable. I never dreamed of doing something like this."
John Wade,"I'm not sure that temporary discipline is what some of these kids need. I think more of a prolonged approach would be best. Their tenure over there is very temporary, and I haven't seen any evidence that when they go back they are behaving any better."
John Wade,"We'll see how dedicated I am to the treadmill. That's the only way to get rid of it. I'm not a doctor, but I know 50 pounds less would be nice not to carry around, on your joints, on your internal organs, all that mess."
John Wade,"I'm a realist in the fact it's going to be loud and communication is going to be an issue. But I'm not going into the game saying it's a disadvantage for us. Besides, a fast start will take the air out of the crowd."
Roy Wadia,There are still many questions.
Roy Wadia,"It means that there is a question mark that hangs over the progress of the virus in China. It's perhaps more significant to get animal viruses, because this virus is still something that is primarily in the animal sector."
Roy Wadia,"In large parts of China, especially in the countryside, over the last 20 or 30 years, the health system has been crumbling. You've got problems in terms of being able to provide basic health care to people. Surveillance is key to containing any outbreak, and to preventing any pandemicâ€¦not only in the animal sector, of course, but then you have to be able to also survey the human population."
Roy Wadia,"This is a reiteration of how much of a public health threat bird flu really is. Sometimes it takes a human case or a suspected human case to raise the alarm, to remind us that no country, whether China or anywhere else, can afford to be complacent."
Roy Wadia,"The virus is of course entrenched in the environment, not only in China but in many other countries."
Roy Wadia,"Details and logistics still have to be finalized, but the commitment is there, and it is hoped that this sharing will serve as a template for a regular virus sharing mechanism for the future."
Roy Wadia,"If the animals in the area were sick and dying, and if they were dying in small numbers, it might have been very difficult to identify that as an outbreak."
Roy Wadia,"As more outbreaks occur among poultry and animals around the world, and as more human cases occur, the virus has more chances to transmit more effectively from animals to humans, or possibly among humans as well."

By reducing the number of vendors to be managed, these OEMs can speed products to their customers faster."

Robin Wagner,"This is the sixth generation of expander IC products that LSI Logic has brought to market. Our experience in development, validation and interoperability testing dramatically reduces customer risk and underscores LSI Logic's position as the recognized leader in supplying SAS component products.

William Wagner,"But in embryonic, I think there's some truth that we're falling behind because there's a lot that we can't do, ...

Rufus Wainwright,"It seems like the older I get, the more unreal the world becomes."
Rufus Wainwright,"I definitely was always expected and encouraged to be a songwriter from a very young age, ... But really it's because, as a child, I thought I was Judy Garland. And when I started out, I was a little nuts. I thought I was a classic, legendary superstar when only 10 people knew who I was. I feel in some ways that my confidence is misinterpreted as arrogance, which is understandable. But I've also always thought that false modesty is evil."

At the same time we're wholly owned by Best Buy, and we're creating incentives to take advantage of a shared consumer experience like integrating promotions and taking advantage of fulfillment from Best Buy.

Alice Walker,"The experience of God, or in any case the possibility of experiencing God, is innate."
David Walker,"We're going to have to restructure Social Security and Medicare. And, frankly, Social Security will be a lot easier than Medicare. If there's one thing that could bankrupt America, it's health care. And it's out of control."
David Walker,"Of course I wish he was wearing it, ... He was all about safety. He's a 10-year veteran. He knows what wrecks can do. Why he wasn't wearing it I don't know."

David Walker,"I grew up pretty anti-Catholic, to say the least. It's a radical journey."
David Walker,"It hurt, but at the same time I knew there was more to life than crying and pouting about an injury. I've got to move on."
David Walker,"I'm just looking forward to playing a game, ... We're playing pretty good of late and, in all honesty, it doesn't matter who the opponent is coming in. Our guys ... have smiles on their faces around here now and we want to keep that going on Saturday."

Herschel Walker,The majority of the people that I was growing up with were going off into the military. A lot of my classmates thought of going into the military.
Herschel Walker,"The hardest thing I had to overcome in life? I think racism. That's so difficult because I don't think anyone can ever understand it. It's not that people don't want to understand it, but they don't want to touch it."
Herschel Walker,That person has to be accountable for himself. I think that's what we have to do in society today is to be accountable for yourself. I think we have the tendency to always want to live someone else's life.
Herschel Walker,My favorite subject probably was math. I love math. Figures just intrigue me. I was really good at math. English probably was my worst subject. But I used to write a lot of poetry. I used to write poetry all the time.
Herschel Walker,"If I had to come up with something that just came to me, I think growing up in a small town, I want knowledge. I still think today, knowledge is one of the keys."
Herschel Walker,"I was a little different. I still say I'm a little different, because success to me is not having the most money, or having the biggest car or the biggest house."
Herschel Walker,"I never dreamed about being an actor, because that was out of reach. Coming from a small town that was big in farming, and also big in clothing factories, you don't dream about being a professional football player or an actor."
Herschel Walker,"I don't read a lot of the sports, because I think people sometimes either build it up, or you have this guy that hates sports that is going to write bad about it, so I figure I'm not going to read it. Because I'm not going to let him put an idea into my head."
Herschel Walker,"Growing up, I started developing confidence in what I felt. My parents helped me to believe in myself. I wasn't the best looking guy, I wasn't the best athlete in the world, but they made me feel good about myself."
Herschel Walker,"God, my parents, my wife. I don't have a lot of friends, because I'm always moving around. I don't drink, so I don't hang out in bars. But they've been very big in my life. Because they have helped to encourage me."

Herschel Walker,"Coming from a small town it was tough to dream big. When I grew up in a small town in Georgia, my biggest dream was one day to be able to go to Atlanta."
Herschel Walker,Believing that no one is better than the other. You know I grew up in the South. My senior year there was a very big racial tension.
Herschel Walker,"Because my parents, growing up, they worked hard. Everyone in my family woke up early in the morning. I used to see my mother and my father go off to work, and come back and, no matter what, they had time for the kids."
Herschel Walker,"All these older kids here, and I'm the only one from a town that's so small, if everyone breathed at the same time, you'd run out of oxygen. Man, there is nothing there."

Herschel Walker,"Lets not push it under the rug, or push it to the side because, no matter what, it's going to keep coming up. You know, if you never deal with that dirt up under the carpet, it's going to get larger and larger, and it's going to keep coming up."

Jeff Walker,"I'd feel better if I had time to read the language,"
Jeff Walker,"It makes you tear up a bit just to see that the kids can do something for you. There's one resident who knew that I did not have breakfast, lunch or dinner yesterday. At 10 at night, she was shoving crackers in my pocket telling me to keep my strength up as we were walking through here. I made her take them back, but they try and give back as well too."
Jeff Walker,We've had more demand for the iMac than we have seen for any computer in (our) history. It's just phenomenal.

Jeff Walker,"It's really proven itself to us that everyone wants to address their personal health, but they need some support to do that. It's the buddy system."

Jimmy Walker,"What it comes down to is money. The more they can carry and the faster they get there, the more money they make."
Jimmy Walker,I've been beating myself up with some of the decisions I've made. It's just been bad course management.
Jimmy Walker,"In my kennel, you'll see all different shapes, sizes, color patterns. Because it's not about that. It's about their instinct."
Jimmy Walker,He's giving it his very best.
Jimmy Walker,We still have high expectations here with Coach Weis. The environment was great today and this was a great game.
Jimmy Walker,"It's like a kid. When he's born, he could be a doctor. But if he's in the wrong environment, he could end up in jail. It's not that I'm a great trainer, I've just tried to put him in the right environment."
Jimmy Walker,We have grown from a company that did $5 (million) to $7 million a year 18 years ago to one that now does in excess of $60 million a year.
John Walker,"This has been in the back of my mind for several years, but I just didn't know how to get the project done."
John Walker,The team?s improvement over the course of the season was evident in the tournament.
John Walker,"Without a doubt, we're excited. We're excited about the new school and the community is behind us. The Village Golf Club is great to have us here. We're looking for good things. Sports are important for kids. We have some good young talent. One nice thing is we all will be together next year. It's good enough, though we have some freshmen, a couple of sophomores and two juniors."
John E. Walker,"These studies resulted eventually in a complete sequence analysis of the complex from several species, and in the atomic resolution structure of the F catalytic domain of the enzyme from bovine mitochondria, giving new insights into how ATP is made in the biological world."

John E. Walker,"My father was a stone mason, and a talented amateur pianist and vocalist."
Johnny Walker,"I knew I could take over the game. When T.J. went out (with foul trouble), I knew it was up to me to keep it close."
Johnny Walker,It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out -- it's just an attack on traditional retirement and medical benefits.
Johnny Walker,"We all listen to the same music; we all came from the same place, standing on the shoulders of the same giants. I'd be willing to bet that The Rolling Stones are more envious of our lifestyle, living here in Kentucky, playing loads of different Americana music. That's what they were going for. We're closer to the source than they are, really. I think they would love to come down and stay in Covington with us and stay up until 5 in the morning, playing guitar and singing Townes Van Zandt songs and Leadbelly songs. It'd be right up their alley. It's no mistake that we have the same kind of thing going on."
Johnny Walker,I would love to see that happen. But Dave's not the type of person who looks out for himself. All he cares about is this team.
Johnny Walker,The players on the Maryland football team all made straight As. Their Bs were a little crooked.
Johnny Walker,"I was kind of glad that he didn't call a timeout, giving us the experience of playing through a situation like that. Me being a senior, I think I recognized that and slowed it down and got the momentum back on our side."
Johnny Walker,"We have a minimum amount of manpower in the state of Montana, but we have a maximum amount of cooperation."
Larry Walker,"If you can't feel relaxed around Reggie Sanders, you're a nervous and self-conscious person. They could lock you into a room of strangers, and you would feel like you were his brother right away."
Larry Walker,"We couldn't get to the free throw line for some mysterious reason. We couldn't get a three to go down, we didn't make enough shots and threw the ball away too much."
Larry Walker,"Any time you have the opportunity ... look, we all realize that we can get our butts handed to us in a heartbeat."
Larry Walker,Reggie? Good luck. Congratulations. ... You guys win the championship down there?
Larry Walker,"Give those kids credit. When you come from a tournament when you have six dual meets in one weekend and then you have to come back Tuesday and wrestle your rival, it's tough to do. Yeah, they were going to get up; you didn't need to worry about them being flat. But they had a long weekend. Those kids had to come back and make weight. Give them a lot of credit for what they did and what they accomplished. We came out and did what we had to do. We just came up a little bit short."
Larry Walker,I'm still grateful I get the honor to put my country's name on my chest as a coach.
Larry Walker,"J.R. has worked so hard in the off-season. Tonight he showed you what kind of kid he is. Tonight, he wrestled Eck a lot better than he did in December. J.R. is certainly coming around."
Larry Walker,"I don't want to be one of those guys that say goodbye to everybody and say 'This is my last fight, it's my last game,' and here they are playing four years later."
Larry Walker,"Suppan brings consistency, but he needs to start hitting home runs, ... It's exciting. It's always exciting to see pitchers hit home runs. He probably never thought he would be the one to do it. It was a pathetic home run trot, but it was fun to watch."
Larry Walker,Robbie has wrestled some tough competition and that prepared him for that match. It was a big win for him on Senior Night.
Larry Walker,"My body is really telling me no. Playing for Team Canada would be a great honor. Not being able to do that, I knew I was done. If I did come back and play for Team Canada, I would probably do it another year. But I just feel like I can't do it. My neck is still achy."
Larry Walker,He needed a win like that. He's got to believe he can compete against anyone in the state.
Larry Walker,"Baseball is not a game played on paper. On paper, they win."
Margaret Walker,"We're trying to make sure no one falls through the cracks,"

Margaret Walker,Friends and good manners will carry you where money won't go.
Mark Walker,"That's something that's hurt us a lot, ... Not to make excuses, but when you don't have the guys who have worked back there all season long it's going to hurt you. Some of those guys will be back, but again, we don't know exactly when it will be. It's a case by case deal."
Mark Walker,"That's partly a reflection of short vacations, ... My guess is that people who take a month off and travel experience longer lasting benefits than people who take three days off and work while they're away."
Mark Walker,It's been a real eye-opener. I can't see a government reacting to a crisis in any other way.
Mark Walker,We're in the middle of an appeal to the Radiation Control Board.
Mark Walker,"Bradley has done a good job and he's earned the right to play, ... That doesn't mean there's not competition there. We'd like to get Pete Towne some time too."

Mary Walker,"There's a lot of retirees (in Mountain Home), and I really think the city and the other people who live here need to know about this program."
Mary Walker,We are thrilled to be involved with this grant. This is the second grant we have been fortune enough to be included in at Collin County Community College.
Mary Walker,This is perhaps a classic shaken baby case. There is the hemorrhaging behind the eyes and some other indicators that medical experts tell us that indicate that this is indeed a shaken baby.
Mary Walker,It gives our workforce a great opportunity to expand their knowledge within the normal working environment.
Mary Walker,"What's coming up in the future is very exciting but a little crazy for the consumer, ... Today there are no standards for various home devices to communicate together. So you'll see a lot of really neat technology appear, but the challenge for consumers is how to get it all to work together."
Mary Walker,We're looking into her as a caregiver to her own children.
Mary Walker,"Everybody liked him. He's very charming, and he'd talk about everything he was doing in Eastern Europe."

Paul Walker,"I'm into being a dad, that's where my focus is most of the time. I'm an actor that's my job, but it's not my life. I have a lot of other interests too."
Paul Walker,My father isn't affected by too many things but even he couldn't stand the language. It's definitely not for everyone.
Paul Walker,"Gold could rise to $850 in the next 18 months, as the dollar is likely to come under renewed pressure."
Paul Walker,They're his everything. They are his family. Not to mention that I think they saved his neck a countless number of times. He feels pretty bad about leaving them behind.
Paul Walker,"You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy. Everything else is just sprinkles on the sundae."
Peter Walker,We need to make public health a priority.

Randy Walker,"I keep being reminded about how tough the remainder of our schedule is. But we just need to worry about us, not about who we're going to play."
Randy Walker,"He has a long way to go, but he accepts that and is one to work hard, and he has enough in his physical style of play to be a good risk."
Randy Walker,"We've had a great week. We've had a little bug running around the team this week. But I think by and large, it's dissipated. We're ready to go."
Randy Walker,I think it was a good week for us. We accomplished a lot with some of the practice we had in the off week. We're trying to improve our execution and do the little things a little bit better. ... We think we can correct some of the problems we faced in the heartbreaking loss to Penn State.
Randy Walker,"We made some mistakes to let this thing get to where it was, but last time I looked, we had more points on the scoreboard. We were playing a top-15 team in the country, and that's no small achievement. It wasn't a work of art, but we won."
Randy Walker,"That's a bad memory. Obviously, we didn't play as well as we needed to, but it was a lot tougher than it should have been. It would be a place I'd really strongly encourage them taking a neutral crew."
Randy Walker,"Man, I was wanting to hug Brother Billy when I saw that ice."
Randy Walker,"Defenses loves preparation, they love repetition."
Randy Walker,"I'm always the bad guy. I tell the staff and the leaders of the team, 'It'd be nice if some of you would take a little of that on.' I feel like the Wicked Witch of the West all the time, but I'm not afraid of being unpopular. I worry about trying to do the right thing."
Randy Walker,"If there's any justice, ... this kid is going to have a heck of a year."
Randy Walker,There's no question they did a great job of reversing momentum.

Randy Walker,"It doesn't hurt to have a four-year starter at quarterback,"
Randy Walker,I can see the evaluation process going all the way through (fall) camp. We could go to October. I hope not.

Randy Walker,"The last few years we've found ways to win some games,"
Randy Walker,"I don't know if I've ever had a game quite like that one. We've played a lot of games like that, so I guess I should learn to expect things like that."
Randy Walker,It's tough to lose a game like that.
Randy Walker,I don't know if I've ever had a game quite like that one.
Randy Walker,"After two years of working with Garrick, I truly believe he has a great future and can be a special coach. He has an impressive background, as a coach and a player, and he will be committed to excellence with our offense and quarterbacks. I'm excited about this move for Garrick and our football team."
Randy Walker,"I said it is going to be a crazy year and there are a lot of football teams that could win this league. I don't think that's changed. A lot of people can win the Big Ten, including the team we're playing this week and including us. Maybe I'm nuts, but I believe it."
Randy Walker,"I'll say what I say on the sidelines: There's a lot of football left, ... There's a lot of football left in this season a lot. We need a great off week."
Randy Walker,There's a lot of football left. We're just one game out.
Randy Walker,I've been coaching football for 30 years. I've seen a lot of good football players -- but I haven't seen any better than A.J. Hawk.
Randy Walker,"I reminded them in the locker room, there's still a lot of football left in the season. This thing is going to be a wild race to the end, and hopefully we can keep getting better as a football team."
Randy Walker,"If they knock you out in the first round, they do not let you come back and keep fighting. We have to make sure the game goes four quarters."
Randy Walker,"If you're prone to losing your focus, you can lose it fast in an environment like that."
Randy Walker,"I couldn't ask for more from our defense. They scored a couple more touchdowns, they forced them to kick and gave us the ball back. Fifty points looks bad and they got some yards, but we've been in that game all year and we were today."
Randy Walker,"Give a defense three or four weeks to prepare. Normally, we get two or three days. The defense loves preparation. I think this game will surprise some people. Our defense has been maligned, but they've made plays when they had to."
Randy Walker,My understanding is things haven't changed with him. It's out of our control as a football program. I don't anticipate having him.
Randy Walker,"I've made clear my commitment to Northwestern. I'm not a 1-800 guy, calling everybody. Does everybody have a price? Sure. But there's a value in the kind of kids I get to coach, the institution I represent, where I live. I don't know if there's a better job."
Randy Walker,"The Big Ten is probably too strong. College football has a certain amount of variability when it comes to who plays for the national championship, but if you look at the Big Ten and the quality of football, it is as good as it has ever been. The trouble is, you show up every week, and it's tough."
Randy Walker,"I feel really sold on these guys. We've been rated pretty low before, but I like the class we have. Those people pick us low every year."
Randy Walker,"I believe it's gonna be one of those years where you could be 6-2 and be the Big Ten champion. I've said this since August at the Big Ten media luncheon. I think it's gonna be a very balanced, competitive year."
Randy Walker,"We had expectations, we had high belief in ourselves. But [prior to Saturday], there was nothing to confirm it."
Randy Walker,"Defenses love preparation, they love repetition. I've said from the beginning, I think this game will surprise some people. I think it's going to be a better display than what people might think."
Randy Walker,You're not sleeping in your own bed. You have some typical logistical issues that are gonna take you out of your normal routine. We have a young football team and I've tried to explain to them how important it is to be able to handle these 'adjustments' the right way.
Randy Walker,"Playing a top-15 football team in the country, not a small achievement. But we do have a way of making it interesting. 'Why can't we do this easy?' I kept saying in the fourth quarter."
Robert Walker,I think he can potentially become the new strong voice inside the appropriations process for space.
Robert Walker,"Those numbers are staggering, and I can't believe the U.S. government can see those kind of figures. Why make criminals out of honest people?"
Robert Walker,"It's funny; the two teams we've got the most exposure on are the Vikings and the Raiders,"
Robert Walker,All Seattle did was hold court at home. There's no doubt in my mind that the public is going to pound Pittsburgh.
Robert Walker,Cleary Tom DeLay has been a powerful ally inside the appropriations process and the leadership process in the Congress and you don?t lose an ally like that without having some consequences.
Robert Walker,"Offshore is where the big bets are made now. From the bettors' point of view, offshore books are the best thing that could have ever happened. It's a great alternative to illegal bookmakers."

William Walker,"She has cheap prices and good food, it's worth a drive."
William Walker,"Both sides had agreed they would keep a cease-fire. The cease-fire was broken down continuously, and at the present time it is almost nonexistent."
William Walker,"It looks like execution. People with no value for human life murdering these men who to me look like farmers, workers, villagers. They certainly didn't deserve to die in circumstances like this."
William Walker,"Light and life were extinguished. It was wrong. It was only the most dramatic recent example of why levels of tension, bitterness and frustration are so high,"
William Walker,He is a great friend of higher education. We could think of no one better suited to the Board of Visitors.
William Walker,Actually the prospect of going into debt is just enough to discourage some people from applying to college.
William Walker,"They approached citizens as they walked or drove by, asking for money and saying it would go to charity."
Paul Wall,"You're working with such limited space, it's not really possible,"
Paul Wall,We take pride in the unique craftsmanship - it's elegant and it's flashy.
Paul Wall,were so far away they had no idea of the impact we were making. They saw the music as local music that would never break out.
Alan Wallace,The existence of biases hurts recruiting. Intentionally overlooking some things just because you want to promote certain kids.

Alfred Russel Wallace,"To expect the world to receive a new truth, or even an old truth, without challenging it, is to look for one of those miracles which do not occur."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"What we need are not prohibitory marriage laws, but a reformed society, an educated public opinion which will teach individual duty in these matters."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"Truth is born into this world only with pangs and tribulations, and every fresh truth is received unwillingly."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"To say that mind is a product or function of protoplasm, or of its molecular changes, is to use words to which we can attach no clear conception."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"There is, I conceive, no contradiction in believing that mind is at once the cause of matter and of the development of individualised human minds through the agency of matter."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"The foregoing considerations lead us to the very important conclusion, that matter is essentially force, and nothing but force; that matter, as popularly understood, does not exist, and is, in fact, philosophically inconceivable."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"Nature seems to have taken every precaution that these, her choicest treasures, may not lose value by being too easily obtained."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"It has been generally the custom of writers on natural history to take the habits and instincts of animals as the fixed point, and to consider their structure and organization as specially adapted to be in accordance with them.."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"If this is not done, future ages will certainly look back upon us as a people so immersed in the pursuit of wealth as to be blind to higher considerations."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"I then walk off into the swamp along the path of logs and tree-trunks, picking my way cautiously, now glancing right and left on the foliage, and then surveying carefully the surface of the smooth round log I am walking on."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"I spent, as you know, a year and a half in a clergyman's family and heard almost every Tuesday the very best, most earnest and most impressive preacher it has ever been my fortune to meet with, but it produced no effect whatever on my mind."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"I am decidedly of the opinion that in very many instances we can trace such a necessary connexion, especially among birds, and often with more complete success than in the case which I have here attempted to explain."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"But naturalists are now beginning to look beyond this, and to see that there must be some other principle regulating the infinitely varied forms of animal life."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"But I think that a little consideration will show you that belief is quite independent of our will, and our common expressions show it."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"As well might it be said that, because we are ignorant of the laws by which metals are produced and trees developed, we cannot know anything of the origin of steamships and railways."
Alfred Russel Wallace,"On the spiritual theory, man consists essentially of a spiritual nature or mind intimately associated with a spiritual body or soul, both of which are developed in and by means of a material organism."
Alfred Russel Wallace,Modification of form is admitted to be a matter of time.
Alfred Russel Wallace,"In all works on Natural History, we constantly find details of the marvellous adaptation of animals to their food, their habits, and the localities in which they are found."
Ben Wallace,"There ain't nothing to worry about, because you're going to win some and you're going to lose some."
Ben Wallace,"We put ourselves in a tough situation. We had to bail ourselves out with our defense. If we play like that for three quarters, it's going to take an effort like that down the stretch to get a victory. We have to start giving that effort from the start."
Ben Wallace,"I don't think he looked like he was winded at all. To me, he looked like he was gaining strength."
Ben Wallace,The thing that he didn't show in Detroit was the passion for the game to want to go out there and want to dominate the game.
Ben Wallace,Everybody is hurt and disappointed right now. But everybody is going to come back ready to play.
Ben Wallace,"It didn't matter, they were still going to lose. As long as we win the game, I am good. I don't have so much pride that I can't see the big picture."
Ben Wallace,Everybody in this locker room that went through that Game 7 really started to prepare themselves and get ready for the season probably two weeks after that Game 7. That was the big reason we came back so focused and ready to play.
Ben Wallace,There ain't no hard feelings.
Ben Wallace,"When a team is short-handed, you can't allow them to hang around and feed off their emotions. Knowing that they got guys out, guys want to come out and play a little extra hard, try to pick it up. You can't afford to let those type teams hang around too long."
Ben Wallace,"Um, Larry likes to coach."
Ben Wallace,We had a little more energy because we were at home. It's tough to play away from home on Christmas.
Ben Wallace,That just shows the makeup and character of our team. That's what we hang our hats on -- getting stops.
Ben Wallace,"[For a team that is fueled by adversity -- -- whether real or make believe -- the hard-knock Pistons have added another chip to their collective shoulders. How dare somebody say they can't win it without Brown?] Before Larry got here, we knew what kind of team we had, ... With him gone, we still know we capable of getting it done."
David Foster Wallace,"What TV is extremely good at - and realize that this is all it does - is discerning what large numbers of people think they want, and supplying it."
David Foster Wallace,"We're kind of wishing some parents would come back. And of course we're uneasy about the fact that we wish they'd come back - I mean, what's wrong with us?"
David Foster Wallace,"TV's real agenda is to be liked, because if you like what you're seeing, you'll stay tuned. TV is completely unabashed about this; it's its sole raison."
David Foster Wallace,This might be one way to start talking about differences between the early postmodern writers of the fifties and sixties and their contemporary descendants.
David Foster Wallace,This diagnosis can be done in about two lines. It doesn't engage anybody.
David Foster Wallace,"The reader becomes God, for all textual purposes. I see your eyes glazing over, so I'll hush."
David Foster Wallace,"The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, then what do we do?"
David Foster Wallace,Rap's conscious response to the poverty and oppression of U.S. blacks is like some hideous parody of sixties black pride.
David Foster Wallace,Fiction's about what it is to be a human being.
Gerald Wallace,"We have a problem understanding that just because we are up 12 or 15 with 3 minutes to go, that doesn't mean the game is over. We just can't do this if we expect to win and be one of the elite teams in the league."
Gerald Wallace,"I couldn't straighten my leg or bend it. It felt like I bumped knees at first, but the pain got more and more intense. Then I didn't try to get up. I don't really know what the diagnosis is, but I'm getting ready to go over and get some tests done."
Gerald Wallace,"We know guys are banged up and hurt, and then Brevin goes down. When that happens, other guys have to step up and make a play. Right now everybody is stepping up to the challenge."
Gerald Wallace,"Tonight just showed the heart of this team. We were lousy and horrible in the first half, but we turned it around in the second half."
Gerald Wallace,Opportunities can slip away. Tonight was a prime example where we controlled this game from the opening tip. It shouldn't have even come down to where it is so close that we're struggling and fighting for every possession.
Gerald Wallace,I don't feel any pressure. I'll take on all the competition. I'm ready.
Gerald Wallace,They started feeding the ball back to Brand and he took advantage of the mismatches he had. It was hard for us to leave the guy we were guarding to double-team Brand. It put us in an awkward position.
Irving Wallace,"Read all you can about it, interview experts on it, even travel to the sites of the story to guarantee authenticity and get a feel for the background."
Irving Wallace,Every man can transform the world from one of monotony and drabness to one of excitement and adventure.
Irving Wallace,"To be one's self, and unafraid whether right or wrong, is more admirable than the easy cowardice of surrender to conformity."
Irving Wallace,Every man can transform the world from one of monotony and drabness to one of excitement and adventure
John Wallace,Those were eight big points. If he doesn't get those points we're in big trouble.
John Wallace,We've had more success than they (scientists in Australia and New Zealand) have. Everyone has been trying different methods. We just got lucky.
John Wallace,The task of establishing causality is much more difficult than reaffirming the reality of the warming.
John Wallace,"When you consider the power of these units and then think of four separate devices that you'd have to make room for, or stack on top of each other, they really are quite small for what they do."
John Wallace,"It's like one big family here. Everyone gets along, and that's nice."
John Wallace,"I'm probably one of Coach Boeheim's biggest supporters, ... I'll always be grateful to him for showing faith in me from the start. When I was a freshman, he let me make some mistakes that freshmen make. He wasn't constantly looking over your shoulder. As long as you were doing things beneficial to the team, he was cool with that. He didn't overcoach."
John Wallace,"This activity was, in fact, a completely lawful exercise, and the board should reject any suggestion that it impose (a) civil penalty or refer for prosecutor this matter."
John Wallace,"In response to events unfolding in the U.S., the London Stock Exchange is evacuating Exchange Tower as a precaution. We have contingency arrangements in place, which means that we will continue to run the market through to the close."
John Wallace,Our kids play very good defense. That's what keeps us in games.
Kenny Wallace,"If those drivers were just with Busch teams, I think everything would be fine. It's their research and development, their constant testing and wind tunnel time; it's hard to compete with those types of teams."
Kenny Wallace,"Well, it's very boring. It's very boring. I guess I view it as a necessary evil."
Kenny Wallace,"I always do look forward to the stand-alone events,"
Mark Wallace,"We're obviously going for an integration that hasn't been done before. Some work on integration going on with particular pieces in Canada, the US and my old group in the UK but we're taking a bigger slice now."
Mark Wallace,"Because it was fully involved, we did defensive operations and fought the fire from the outside. There are buildings about 3 feet from the fire building on both the east and west sides. So, our main focus was to contain the fire to the original building."
Mark Wallace,"From a planning perspective, the community was cheated in having a longer amount of time to plan a response to the CDE."
Mark Wallace,"Animals have over evolutionary time survived these disturbances over and over and over again, ... Individual adaptation to the environment will serve them as it does in normal circumstances."
Mark Wallace,I will not accept that there has not been a focus on student achievement in this district. That's not fair.
Mike Wallace,"She was a genuine, lovely, fine woman who was bruised by what happened to her husband. [She was] intelligent, loyal and raised wonderful kids."
Mike Wallace,"If you come at it from subject matter, you're never going to get there, Leave it open to struggle and contest, and don't give up too quickly."
Mike Wallace,You don't talk to your agent about money?
Mike Wallace,You came back for money?
Mike Wallace,"I admire him. He was his own man, in search of himself."
Mike Wallace,I can't think of a better job for a reporter. It's been a joy.
Mike Wallace,Because I think you will want to have the freedom that you have now. But you're going to need more money to have the freedom that you now have.
Mike Wallace,"He had a lot of nice gestures for me, and so did his dad, but I'm sorry. I'm sure they make mistakes over there every now and then. He's a championship driver and he'll recover from it."
Mike Wallace,That's like a smack in the face before you even get started. I guess you can always be a critic when you're standing on the outside.
Mike Wallace,"You essentially strengthened your body and your performance with a cocktail of steroids and growth hormones,"
Mike Wallace,"It was faster, more violent, more confrontational than baseball."
Mike Wallace,"And what you're doing to baseball now, you're taking on the whole baseball establishment,"
Mike Wallace,She's of a certain age now. She doesn't want to keep getting on planes. She's very wise to do what she's doing.
Rasheed Wallace,"I don't know what they were trying to do. But whatever it was, it didn't work."
Rasheed Wallace,There were about five minutes left and they were down by eight points. I could see maybe trying something like that if it was a two-point or a three-point game. But why do it when you're eight points down?
Rasheed Wallace,"I can't speak for other teams, but for us, we're definitely trying to voice our objection. I don't have a problem with that dress code if a man is injured and has to be on the bench during games. But it's kind of crazy to sit up there and try to tell us how to dress on the way to work. We're not in that head office in New York. To me, that's crazy."
Rasheed Wallace,"Some people say that without Larry we won't get back, but he wasn't the one out there playing. It's cool, though. We know we're going to be there. It's going to be a lot of bandwagon cats at the end of the year, just like it was last year."
Rasheed Wallace,Some people say our starting five is like an all-star team. But we don't see ourselves like that. We see ourselves as a unit.
Rasheed Wallace,As long as we got the win. We gotta deal with that other (stuff) every night. But we fought through it and got the W.
Rasheed Wallace,"I'm not a big fan of zone myself. I'm more a man-to-man. But, if it's for the team, I'm with it."
Rasheed Wallace,"Man, we're just playing. It doesn't have anything to do with being extra physical or nothing like that. That's the way we've been playing all year."
Rasheed Wallace,"Hey, we're just playing, man. Ain't got nothing to do with being extra physical. That's the way we've been playing all year."
Rasheed Wallace,"It does matter. We can't be letting the man run loose scoring 50, 60, 70, 80 points. That's not good."
Rasheed Wallace,"I'm not a big fan of individuality. My wife and kids will like it, but I'd rather have a championship."
Rasheed Wallace,I don't care about No. 16. I'm just going to be cheering from home.
Rasheed Wallace,I was just taking what they were giving me - open shots. I just wanted to take advantage of it.
Rasheed Wallace,This wasn't any kind of statement -- you make statements in the playoffs. This was just playing a game against a very good team.
Rasheed Wallace,"We knew if we were going to win this game we were going to have to go out there and play hard and make those diving plays, those hustle plays. And that's what we did to get back into the game and took it from there."
Rasheed Wallace,It's no statement. It's just another game. Statements won't be made until the playoffs.
Rasheed Wallace,"We just have a little bit more freedom. L.B. is a more technical coach, who wants you to run your sets, but Flip says that if we see an opening, we should go ahead and attack."
Rasheed Wallace,That's our main food that feeds this team.
Rasheed Wallace,"Keep us on the back-burner. We won't lose our swagger at all, because when you put that food on the back-burner, it's just simmering and it tastes better. When you got that food on the front burner, that's the one you're paying attention to the most, and that's the one that might burn. We're on that back-burner."
Rasheed Wallace,We just couldn't make a shot. We had to buckle down and play some defense.
Rasheed Wallace,"It was (crappy). It was (crappy). I will say from especially myself, on both ends, offense and defense, our effort in that first half was (crappy)."
Rasheed Wallace,"Body (Wallace) was blocking shots left and right, grabbing rebounds. The kid's a monster. I am just glad he's on my side."
Rasheed Wallace,Ain't no pressure games or big games for us. We're just playing. We're just playing basketball.
Rasheed Wallace,They made the hustle plays - the extra battle for the loose balls and the second and third efforts on some of their shots. That's what beat us.
Rusty Wallace,"[This week: Wallace has scored 24 top-15 finishes, more than any other driver, in 31 races this season. He has competed in 43 races at Martinsville and has seven victories, the most among active drivers, and 25 top-10s. His last victory there came in April 2004.] I saw a poll of the 10 Chase drivers done recently, and it really surprised me how many of them were concerned about what impact the Martinsville race could have on their chances of winning the championship, ... Man, that's certainly not the case with me and my team. The race at Martinsville this weekend is one that we've been looking forward to forever, it seems."
Rusty Wallace,I'm not going to be merciless. I'll be a little edgy; I'll speak the truth.
Rusty Wallace,I speak the truth. I've learned when to say it and when not. I've tried to carry the torch that Dale [ Earnhardt ] left behind and tried to be a good representative with all the rest of the drivers.
Rusty Wallace,"As soon as I fired it up and pulled out, I knew I was in trouble. The engine just welded itself shut."
Rusty Wallace,"I really think this is my calling. I'm excited about it. When I retired, television was something I felt I knew."
Rusty Wallace,Sometimes bad things can bring on good things. This brought about a whole era of safety. It took something dramatic before they started thinking and looking out of the box.
Rusty Wallace,"I'm very concerned about safety,"
Rusty Wallace,"I'm really disappointed that Mark has been talked into running that extra year, ... The thing I feel bad about for Mark is that he and I have been out there getting all these accolades, and now Mark's having to say, 'It looks like I'm coming back.'"
Rusty Wallace,"It was twice as wild when I started, because when I started, there was no spoiler rule, ... Guys were running wide-open with only an eight-degree rear spoiler, and cars were out of control, sliding and spinning out, going in the air and flipping upside-down. It was just totally crazy."
Rusty Wallace,"Evidently, what they did was within the rules,"
Rusty Wallace,"Kenny went in to use the rest room, and they had the toilet paper roll with the springs on the side, and he kept pulling the paper, and it kept breaking off. He said he pulled and pulled and pulled, and it broke and broke and broke, and the whole time this toilet paper is breaking off I'm in the truck and we're gone. We thought he was there."
Rusty Wallace,"The car here is the car I drove last time, ... (Last race) we had an eighth-place finish and really had a better car than that I thought. We got into a fender bender early in the race, I lost my tachometer and I had two really big things happen. All that stuff is fixed right now so let's hope we have a good, smooth race."
Rusty Wallace,"You could win the title without winning a race, but that's not the way I want to win it, ... Would I be disappointed to win the championship and not win a race this year? That's not a real easy question to answer."
Rusty Wallace,"I like our chances over a 10-race span,"
Rusty Wallace,"The racetrack said, 'You get a release from the judge, we'll let you race,'"
Rusty Wallace,"I'm going to watch a little of the truck race and talk to a prospective new sponsor,"
Rusty Wallace,I can't believe I came the whole season with no problems and right now at the very end it all goes to [heck]. I hate it for the team and all the fans.
Rusty Wallace,"I think by the end of the year, he'd have a lot of knowledge. He'd be up on the wheel and ready to go then."
Rusty Wallace,"I've still got a pin in my wrist that's about 8 inches long from that accident. I got hurt at some racetracks a little bit, but never as bad as I got hurt at Talladega."
Rusty Wallace,I ask myself why would I retire and its because I don't like running 36 races. I hate running 36 races. I don't like being away from home that much.
Rusty Wallace,This will be a fun weekend.
Rusty Wallace,"You guys are probably getting sick of seeing me get all this stuff. But I'm enjoying it, even if you aren't."
Rusty Wallace,What we have to do is keep that top level of consistency going. We have to be there at the end of all 10 races and get everything we can out of each and every one of them.
Rusty Wallace,"It's our consistency that has gotten us this far, and there's really no need to be looking for some other game plan, ... This is my final season as a driver and I want to go out being remembered as a winner."
Rusty Wallace,"That just shows how important consistency is and it's our consistency that has gotten us this far,"
Rusty Wallace,"It really hasn't hit me hard, yet. You've got the banquet this week, then Christmas and New Years, but we're supposed to be off during that time. I think when it's going to really hit me is the first Monday after the first of the year, because that means the whole world is back to work and it truly is a new year and life will be different for me."
Rusty Wallace,"Then, at the end, the lapped cars were really tough to get around on the restarts and that got me way behind."
Rusty Wallace,"Then, at the end, the lapped cars were really tough to get around on the restarts and that got me way behind,"
Rusty Wallace,It's just one of those racing accidents.
Lori Wallach,"That a member of Congress who is supposed to represent one of the U.S. states hardest hit by NAFTA job loss, and whose constituents care deeply about poverty in Central America, would become a deciding vote to expand NAFTA to six more nations is unimaginable, given the damage the NAFTA model has proven to cause to U.S. working people and Mexico's poor."
Lori Wallach,There's nothing to it. The actual text of the [CAFTA] agreement is what's binding and the text of the agreement is a catastrophe.
Lori Wallach,It didn't have any of the actively anti-environmental provisions of this [CAFTA] agreement.
Lori Wallach,"There's nothing to it, ... The actual text of the [CAFTA] agreement is what's binding and the text of the agreement is a catastrophe."
Lori Wallach,They need to go back into the existing agreement and repair the rules that limit a country's ability to have environmental safety and human rights laws.
David Walliams,"When I was at school I was watching The Young Ones,"

David Walliams,We sit in a room for months trying to think of funny things.
David Walliams,"I don't get recognized much, and am very happy with that. The fans I have met have all been delightful."

David Walliams,I love wearing drag.
David Walliams,People feel they know me because of my Little Britain characters - But I'm not a Little Britain character. No one knows what I'm really like.
David Walliams,I would recommend that anyone who wants to do comedy on TV to do radio first.
David Walliams,"Oh yes, of course I was bullied - The boys used to call me Daphne, which was meant to put me down. I was very camp."
Jeannette Walls,Confidence doesn't come from thinking you're perfect or flawless. That's arrogance. Confidence comes from appreciating the beauty of your texture.
Jeannette Walls,My life is not just about the past.
Jeannette Walls,I was so worried that people wouldn't like me or my story.
Jeannette Walls,I never had any question that my parents loved me. I had a real sense of self confidence.

Horace Walpole,"Old friends are the great blessings of one's later years. Half a word conveys one's meaning. They have a memory of the same events, have the same mode of thinking. I have young relations that may grow upon me, for my nature is affectionate, but can they grow [To Be] old friends?"
Horace Walpole,Alexander at the head of the world never tasted the true pleasure that boys of his own age have enjoyed at the head of a school.

Bill Walsh,"The ongoing construction of the stadium has continued at a rapid pace, and we're extremely pleased with the progress. It's projected to be done on time. But, in moving the San Jose State game to Spartan Stadium, we feel it gives us that extra week to assure ourselves that the stadium will be 100 percent ready."
Bill Walsh,"I would have expected this. He's a brilliant person, and he's got emotional integrity. He was one of the most unique people I've ever known. He was a kid, and it was like he was 35 or 40. He was 19. He was a totally mature adult, and he was brighter than I was."
Bill Walsh,"It's an honor and privilege to at least temporarily represent the university as athletic director, ... My job is to continue as best I can the program Ted Leland has developed over a period of time. The heritage that exists in the athletic department and the history cross my mind."

David Walsh,"The average American adolescent is sleep-deprived,"
David Walsh,"The whole purpose is to assure the public we are dealing with these cases promptly, efficiently and fairly. This is a serious problem, and it's an embarrassment."
David Walsh,"We've made big mistakes. There are some instances in which we blew it. We've got to give more direction, and we've got to do it right."
David Walsh,I don't think there's any debate that the relationship has been affected by such a large turnover on the board.
David Walsh,The viability of defined benefit plans in the U.S. is questionable. It's a real conundrum.

John Walsh,"You know, everybody uses this word [closure] and banters it around. ... I don't have any closure and most parents of murdered children or crime victims don't really have closure because your life is changed forever by that event."
John Walsh,"You know, everybody uses this word [closure] and banters it around. ... I don't have any closure and most parents of murdered children or crime victims don't really have closure because your life is changed forever by that event,"
John Walsh,It's very early in the game and we need to look at the specifics of the bill language.

John Walsh,I figured out how to catch fugitives without a gun.
John Walsh,America is ready for intelligent talk. I am ready to bring some humanity to TV.

John Walsh,One missing child is one too many.
Mike Walsh,It's my understanding (the expansion) is developer-funded.
Mike Walsh,I'm excited about our team. I've heard some pops in practice I haven't heard in years. It kind of opened my eyes.
Mike Walsh,"The law firm comparison tool not only gives law firms an opportunity to showcase their credentials to prospective clients and grow their practices, but also provides valuable benefits to corporate counsel who rely heavily upon martindale.com to identify, evaluate and select outside counsel. By populating the data fields on martindale.com as richly as possible with detailed information about their firms, our law firm customers can enhance their visibility among in-house counsel and improve the likelihood of being favorably compared against competitors."
Mike Walsh,"Many of our patrons have made The Pier their meeting place for generations, ... It is not uncommon to see children and grandchildren of early customers now coming as regulars. The live music, food, view of Lake Austin and relaxing environment seem to call them back."
Mike Walsh,"I figured it will keep me in shape for basketball,"
Paul Walsh,"With the advent of technology, services like ours mean retailers can better plan for changes,"
Paul Walsh,"We're honored to have been selected by Rolls-Royce to provide additional technology for this high-profile program. Tremendous heat is generated during the short-clutch engagement, which is where our expertise comes into play."
Paul Walsh,"In September, weather really influences sales, especially early-morning temperatures, ... When Mom steps out in the morning and feels that chill, it really makes a difference."
Paul Walsh,"Apparel is a category that hadn't yet seen a trigger to boost sales, ... Rule of thumb is if you see consumers wearing coats, hats and gloves when they're in a department store like Macy's, that's probably what they'll also be looking to buy. And we're seeing that."
Paul Walsh,"Apparel is a category that hadn't yet seen a trigger to boost sales. Rule of thumb is if you see consumers wearing coats, hats and gloves when they're in a department store like Macy's, that's probably what they'll also be looking to buy. And we're seeing that."
Paul Walsh,"Katrina was a hurricane on steroids. For the rest of the year, the pre-hurricane effect -- now renamed the ?Katrina effect? -- will have a bigger impact on consumers that usual."
Paul Walsh,The first step when creating best practice standards for mobile web users is to understand what they actually need and want. This field trial is just one example of how the MWI is embracing users' views and applying this knowledge to create a user friendly environment.
Paul Walsh,"The local power outages and structural damage can have a long-lasting effect, but it isn't wide-reaching,"
Paul Walsh,This is a strong first half performance. We have invested in our brands and built our market positions.
Paul Walsh,"This offers huge opportunity to grow, with new brands such as Smirnoff Ice,"
Julie Walters,One girl's father offered to take the pictures and we all worked together to come up with the themes for each photograph. We had an initial donation by one girl's brother to cover all the production costs and now we have calendars ready for sale.
Julie Walters,We were very explosive and took advantage of the opportunities that we had.
Julie Walters,"I don't know if you can change things, but it's a drop in the ocean."
Marc Walters,"Erskine, they just overpowered us. They are just so much better than all of the rest of the teams."
Marc Walters,"Scott took that like a team man. Some guys would have been deeply disappointed, but Scott was all about it. He said Adrian needs the shot, he's got more experience."
Marc Walters,I had three girls who stepped up and did more than they've done all year.
Marc Walters,"Our girls have been working hard. Our girls are trying to get better, and we're making progress."
Marc Walters,"A win at No. 1 doubles may have helped stem their confidence some, but we won't know if that would have made a difference in the match. They are very talented at the top three spots and that was tough to overcome when they can play comfortably with a 3-0 cushion."
Robert Walters,"We've got chicken, hamburgers and shrimp, ... but we're running out of paper plates."
Robert Walters,The Fed still thinks short-term interest rates are low enough to be pushing the economy so they are continuing to remove monetary stimulus at a pace that is likely to be measured.
Robert Walters,The ranch has a duty to make sure its hillside stays on its property.
Vernon A. Walters,The United Nations has become a place where many countries seek to achieve a lynching of the United States by resolution.
Vernon A. Walters,It is an endless procession of surprises. The expected rarely occurs and never in the expected manner.
Vernon A. Walters,I'm a participant in the doctrine of constructive ambiguity.
Vernon A. Walters,I don't think we should tell them what we're going to do in advance. Let them think. Worry. Wonder. Uncertainty is the most chilling thing of all.
Bill Walton,"The setters struggled (last weekend), but we had practice just for the setters on Monday and Tuesday and they've been perfect,"
Bill Walton,"No matter how good you get, there's always something further out there."
Bill Walton,"I grew up in San Diego in a non-athletic environment. My parents were not interested in sports. Their loves were art, literature and music. I gravitated towards sports because of my older brother Bruce and the first coach I ever had, who, like John Wooden, made it fun and really emphasized the joy of playing the team game."
Bill Walton,"He has everything a top coach has. He has the leadership, the passion, the commitment, the dedication, the vision, the human touch. He needs a real chance to go to a real team."
Bill Walton,"But you have to understand, my beard is so nasty. I mean, it's the only beard in the history of Western civilization that makes Bob Dylan's beard look good."
Bill Walton,"A lot of people understand what not saying anything means, so, in effect, not saying anything is really saying a lot."
Bill Walton,Bill Russell was my favorite player of all-time.
Bill Walton,"Right now, you know, it's not about the refs or anything else, it's about hitting first, getting on the run and never looking back."
Bill Walton,"That's what makes it so fun to be on a team. You're sitting at your house, thinking up this wild, crazy stuff as to how it's going to go, and the other guys are sitting at their houses doing the same thing."
Bill Walton,Life is about growth. People are not perfect when they're 21 years old.
Bill Walton,"I don't sleep much. I'm on the go. My mind is racing. My wife says my mind is like the rolling dials on a slot machine. So, yeah, I think about everything."
Bill Walton,"At 49, I can say something I never would have said when I was a player, that I'm a better person because of my failures and disgraces."

Bill Walton,I had the only beard in the Western Hemisphere that made Bob Dylan's look good.
Bill Walton,"Well, we've made some changes on this tour. We're no longer sleeping in the parking lots and swimming in the fountains. We've been staying in hotels most of the way, though I will say some hotels have declined to take us because we're just having too much fun."
Izaak Walton,"I have laid aside business, and gone a'fishing."
Izaak Walton,"As no man is born an artist, so no man is born an angler."
Izaak Walton,"In so doing, use him as though you loved him."
Izaak Walton,"God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent recreation than angling."
Izaak Walton,Good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue.
Izaak Walton,Angling may be said to be so like the mathematics that it can never be fully learned.
Izaak Walton,"Words are men's daughters, but God's sons are things."

Izaak Walton,"Those little nimble musicians of the air, that warble forth their curious ditties, with which nature hath furnished them to the shame of art."

Sam Walton,Capital isn't scarce; vision is.
Sam Walton,"I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time."
Sam Walton,"I have always been driven to buck the system, to innovate, to take things beyond where they've been."
Sam Walton,"Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self-esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, it's amazing what they can accomplish."
Sam Walton,Each Wal-Mart store should reflect the values of its customers and support the vision they hold for their community.
Sam Walton,"There is only one boss. The customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else."
Sam Walton,High expectations are the key to everything.
Abby Wambach,"To watch people push themselves further than they think they can, it's a beautiful thing. It's really human."
Abby Wambach,"People do this to live a healthy lifestyle and that's exactly the type of life I want to promote,"
Abby Wambach,"Right now we have a very recent goal of beating Canada and leaving this World Cup with our heads held as high as we can hold them. There's a lot of pride in still being in the World Cup right now, and there's a lot of pride going into the next 10 months of our preparation for the Olympics."
John Wanamaker,Do the next thing.
John Wanamaker,Courtesies cannot be borrowed like snow shovels; you must have some of your own.
John Wanamaker,"When a customer enters my store, forget me. He is king."
John Wanamaker,Nothing comes merely by thinking about it.
John Wanamaker,"Keep up the old standards, and day by day raise them higher."
John Wanamaker,"I know half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, but I can never find out which half."
John Wanamaker,It's easy to work for somebody else; all you have to do is show up.
John Wanamaker,"Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don't know which half."
John Wanamaker,"Any seeming deception in a statement is costly, not only in the expense of the advertising but in the detrimental effect produced upon the customer, who believes she has been misled."
John Wanamaker,Courtesy is the one coin you can never have too much of or be stingy with.
John Wanamaker,People who cannot find time for recreation are obliged sooner or later to find time for illness.
Vishal Wanchoo,What's fantastic about this marriage is the two product sets are incredibly complementary.
Vishal Wanchoo,"With computers at every bedside, patient medical records available online, and technology to review cases, the physicians at Pepin are uniquely positioned within the healthcare industry. Using GE's transformational medical technologies can help these physicians make faster and more informed decisions, streamline healthcare costs, reduce medical errors and enhance and improve the quality of patient care."
Vishal Wanchoo,Our relationship with MP4 demonstrates GE's continued commitment to personalized healthcare by providing transformational medical and information technologies to bring our customers closer to their patients.
Charles Wang,"The proposed combination of CA and CSC would create the next-generation, world-class information technology services provider that will lead our industry into the next millennium,"
Charles Wang,"The proposed combination of CA and CSC would create the next-generation, world-class information technology services provider that will lead our industry into the next millennium."
Charles Wang,We are pleased that our shareholders believe the existing members are the best qualified.
Dave Wannstedt,Leonard can make big plays; he's already shown that ... The biggest thing about this team is they have talent and experience on offense.These guys are all seniors and most of them have played for two or three years.
Dave Wannstedt,"He made more plays in one week at linebacker than he made the entire season at safety last year. I just think he's comfortable there. He doesn't have to think as much, and he can get to the football."
Dave Wannstedt,"I was disappointed how our guys responded, and that's my responsibility. We didn't respond the way you need to come back and win the game."
Dave Wannstedt,"He's got to stay healthy. He knows his position. He knows his responsibility. So, I expect good results."
Dave Wannstedt,"No. 1, he's learning a new offensive system. There is a growing period there that has to take place."
Dave Wannstedt,"I had to take the emotion out of it. Once I realized this was what was best for me and my family, I knew I needed to pursue it again."
Dave Wannstedt,This class will be a good foundation for the future. Most of these players had a lot of (other offers). Most of these players chose the University of Pittsburgh because they expect to win.
Dave Wannstedt,"He was the ideal guy, because of his athletic ability, to move around and get in some mismatch situations -- flank him out, move him around, trick people and throw him the ball."
Dave Wannstedt,You have to respect their passing ability because they have a lot of weapons and they can make plays in the passing game.
Bob Ward,"He was tremendously important to Fisher athletics. When you start back and you're trying to have a gym, and a basketball program, and adding women's sports, it was a very tenuous journey. His presence, sense of humor and stature in the community helped us greatly."
Bob Ward,"When my father testified at the trial, ... there was a full-page picture of him on the witness stand, pointing his finger at John Gilbert Graham."
Bob Ward,"Bobby was everywhere, all around the events and greatly involved with the kids at Paint Valley. He will be greatly missed."
Bob Ward,The consequences of biomedical research are much more immediate for the general public. We need to ensure that there are proper safeguards and commercial interest never overrides the public interest.
Bob Ward,"Openings are about getting reacquainted. We're all glad to be back, playing music with each other again. The audience will be in a festive mood Wednesday."
Charlie Ward,"It wasn't as tough as people make it out to be, ... I was at peace about it after 11 years. I was able to play for a long time and experience a lot of different things."
Charlie Ward,"I've always been the coach on the team; all my teams, ... Point guard, quarterback ... regardless I was a player-coach."
Charlie Ward,"Of course, there's one more hurdle to jump. We still have to have an audience. Will they come? We don't know, but we're going to give it a good try."
Elizabeth Ward,"One of the big factors that may account for this finding is access to high-quality medical care. Often communities that have high poverty rates either lack access to good quality care, or people have to travel longer distances to obtain high-quality care."
Elizabeth Ward,"Even though it's declining currently, we would still like to see a great deal of progress in coming decades, because it certainly is declining less than heart disease."
Elizabeth Ward,"I am so happy because it is just exhausting being a single mother who is married. So I couldn't wait for him to come home, and after a couple days of sleep, he's going to have to start doing his honey-do list like changing the light bulbs that I couldn't reach, walking the dogs, helping out with the baby and all those wonderful things husbands should do."
Elizabeth Ward,It's really the result of cumulative public health efforts to educate the public about the dangers of tobacco and also due to the imposition of excise taxes and state tobacco-control programs.
Elizabeth Ward,I like the idea of people knowing where their food comes from. It's nice to not be so dependent on large-scale grocery chains.
Elizabeth Ward,"The print material that are being distributed at parties and social events have been extensively tested for the appeal of the adolescent market, including the Jamaican cartoons and parenting crossword puzzles and word games,"
Elizabeth Ward,"Another excellent year, illustrating the hard work, commitment and motivation of our students, together with excellent teaching and guidance from staff and strong parental staff."
Elizabeth Ward,People don't make these choices in a vacuum. We need to make environmental and community changes to encourage people to make healthier choices.
Elizabeth Ward,"While we have so much information about changes that would be necessary to decrease the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, it's not clear how to change society and change policy to help those changes take place. It's disturbing that we have so much information now but we haven't really achieved the social will to make the kinds of changes that would need to be made to really impact tobacco smoking and the trends of increasing overweight and obesity."
Elizabeth Ward,We do have fairly high rates of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer. I think that is having a very positive impact on mortality rates for those diseases.
Elizabeth Ward,The factors that contribute to cancer and the factors that help to prevent cancer and detect it early don't change overnight. This reflects that we have a great deal of knowledge about certain major causes of cancer and major preventative actions that people can take and these still need to take hold.
Elizabeth Ward,People have still not fully gotten the message that the most important things that they can do to avoid cancer are to avoid tobacco smoking and maintain a healthy body weight and physical activity.
Hines Ward,Take it for what it's worth.
Hines Ward,"I don't really worry about that,"
Hines Ward,"I do want my fair market value, ... The Marvin Harrison, Randy Moss, Terrell Owens numbers out there are ridiculous. I wouldnâ€™t try to ask for that. Not to say that Iâ€™m any less of a player than those guys but I know how this organization is run, how the offense is, for me, itâ€™s all about getting the opportunity to start his career in one place and end his career in one place; and what a better place to do it than in the Black and Gold. Thatâ€™s all I want is a commitment from this organization that I can retire as a Steeler."
Hines Ward,I wanted to be here to support the guys.
Hines Ward,"I didn't sleep much. I had nerves. It didn't hit me until the second quarter, 'I'm playing in the Super Bowl.' I left some plays out there I usually could make in my sleep. But I have no complaints."
Hines Ward,I got so upset at myself on the touchdown pass that I dropped. I make that catch in my sleep a hundred times a night.
Hines Ward,"It's tough to go undefeated, but they have the potential."
Hines Ward,"Wow, this is amazing. You guys make us go out and play with passion in our hearts each and every Sunday."
Hines Ward,My mother had to overcome a lot more things.
Hines Ward,"When I was there, it wasn't cool to be a mixed kid. There probably was some hatred there. Some of the kids are treated badly and, sadly, it happens, but it's not the kids' fault."
Hines Ward,"I just hate to see that I'm getting put into that same category because I think our situations are totally different,"
Hines Ward,"We have to stay away from the negative plays. The third-and-longs, those are hard to overcome. We overcame a couple of them last year but last year we were a great team with second-and-short, third-and-short."
Hines Ward,Everybody hurts when you lose. But he takes it hard.
Hines Ward,"The whole holdout was strictly business, and for me it was about getting the opportunity to retire as a Steeler, ... It was not about money or greed, it was about me wanting to retire as a Steeler and to have that chance to retire as a Steeler. Thats all I can really ask for."
Hines Ward,"It was funny,"
Hines Ward,"I didn't want to make it a media circus. It's something that's part of football, it happens. It was a road I had to come across and I tried to handle as best and as professionally as I could."
Hines Ward,Somebody should write about a book about this. Because it's better than fiction.
Hines Ward,We call him the Tasmanian devil because he's always wreaking havoc.
Hines Ward,Ben has a desire to be the best. You can see that in him. He's going to be a great quarterback for a lot of years.
Hines Ward,"It's a book waiting to be written. We're in that position to put him in the Super Bowl. A lot of guys just want to go out and play not only for themselves, but for a guy like Jerome Bettis."
Hines Ward,"[And if anyone still insists on believing the Steelers  arenâ€™t competitive when it comes to paying their players, Ward answered that as  well.] I think they went out of their way, ... This (contract) was far  more than what I expected."
Hines Ward,"The great ones don't miss balls in the Super Bowl. And I want to be considered one of the great ones. To be named MVP is a great honor, but I still left some plays out on the field. I could have had an even better day."
Hines Ward,"We knew it was going to go for a touchdown. The great ones don't drop balls in the Super Bowl, and I want to be considered one of the great ones."
Hines Ward,"We've had to come from behind and he's done that. He's done a great job of handling adversity, calming guys down, making little jokes in the huddle. That's just the way he is."
James Ward,"To me, it is just freedom for my race and just overall cultural freedom for everyone and liberty. Martin Luther King Jr. was just a brilliant man in my eyes. If he was here, I would want to thank him for everything he did for us."
James Ward,"They don't have the same cultural diversity at their school. Even though we wish they could have, they don't. We just carry ourselves with respect on the court and show them that they are ignorant to the fact that everyone isn't the way they see them."
James Ward,"Those two are the best additions we could have ever had to both of our teams. They add athleticism, character. Everything you could ask for in a friend and an athlete."
Jim Ward,This is a safety issue. This is a safety issue for all residents of the county and residents of the city.
Jim Ward,We expect to deliver strong revenue performance since we have no major patent expirations for the remainder of this decade.
Jim Ward,"There's room for renewed growth in the housing market, even though I admit there's a lot of negative sentiment floating around right now."
Mark Ward,"The first spring, William was with us at home. We were able to participate in the Great Walk and we initially just went as a small family,"
Mark Ward,"The next few years participating in the Great Walk, we've had a few more family members come and slowly but surely William's team is growing."
Mark Ward,"If [a disaster] does come than we'll be capable of responding to it,"
Mark Ward,"It's not a gentleman's agreement; it's a valid, legal contract in every sense of the term,"
Robert Ward,"Our first priority was to do the rescue, ... Once we got (Super and Wolfe), we were still trying to do a search and account for the other occupants."
Robert Ward,Companies that seek streamlined solutions have been turning to Layton Technology since 1997 for two primary reasons: we make it simple and we make it affordable. Not all IT challenges require an abundance of complex add-ons to solve the problem. We have found tremendous success in truly listening to our customers' needs and the development and launch of ObsurferPro exemplifies precisely that.
Robert Ward,"ObsurferPro offers companies the appropriate intelligence through its outstanding monitoring and reporting capabilities to give administrators a view into how the Internet is being utilized throughout the organization to determine who is abusing Internet privileges. While most employers would prefer to give its employees the benefit of the doubt that they are all adhering to corporate policies and procedures, organizations would be penny-wise and pound-foolish in thinking that the ongoing Internet abuse issues in corporate America don't affect them."
Robert Ward,I just hope it is going to be as good a game as all the others and the rain doesn't spoil it.
Robert Ward,"When the fire did break through, we had a crew in that attic (on the 209 side), ... They got lost and disoriented. We had a mayday call."
Sela Ward,"From a morality point of view, I wouldn't even go near, ... But in terms of making an interesting show, I'm sure they'll have to struggle with it."
Sela Ward,"I loved the challenge of doing something I had never done. I'd never done a medical show, a procedural show. ... There is not much time to really delve into the emotions. It's very quick-paced and clipped. It's not about sitting on a sofa and talking about how we're feeling."
Sela Ward,"I feel like only now in my life do I really get it -- do I feel that sense of calm. And I feel very grounded. I feel much more confident. I feel, you know, sexier, more intelligent, more to offer, more wisdom, more life experience to draw from."
Stephen Ward,"The federal position is, as long as a couple of platforms (cable and telephone) are competing, don't worry about the details."
Stephen Ward,"[IBM's strength is in catering to large corporate customers.] But IBM is not focused on really small companies - with, say, 50 workers or less - or on individuals, ... It's not a consumer company."
Stephen Ward,It created a way of getting criticism directly to the doorstep of wireless companies.
Stephen Ward,"If someone were of the belief that large-cap stocks were not going to do well in the coming year, they have several alternatives. For one, there are small-cap index funds."
Stephen Ward,I'm encouraged to see the attorney general taking that action. I hope the FCC takes it seriously.
William Ward,Committing a great truth to memory is admirable; committing it to life is wisdom.
William Ward,Men never plan to be failures; they simply fail to plan to be successful.

William Ward,A warm smile is the universal language of kindness.
William Ward,Happiness is an inside job
William Ward,"Today is a most unusual day, because we have never lived it before; we will never live it again; it is the only day we have. Today can be a healthy unusual day for you -- and for others -- if you take time to give someone a smile . . . to express a word of kindness . . . to lend a helping hand to someone in need . . . to write a note of gratitude . . . to give a word of encouragement to someone who is temporarily overcome with problems . . . to share a portion of your material possessions with others."
William Ward,Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning.
William Ward,"When we seek to discover the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves."
William Ward,The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.
William Ward,A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life.
William Ward,Forgiveness is a funny thing. It warms the heart and cools the sting.
William Ward,"God gave you a gift of 86,400 seconds today. Have you used one to say thank you?"
William Ward,Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.
William Ward,To make mistakes is human; to stumble is commonplace; to be able to laugh at yourself is maturity.
William Ward,"Lose yourself in generous service and every day can be a most unusual day, a triumphant day, an abundantly rewarding day!"
William Ward,"If you can imagine it, you can achieve it; if you can dream it, you can become it."
William Ward,Wise are those who learn that the bottom line doesn't always have to be their top priority.
William Ward,A true friend knows your weaknesses but shows you your strengths; feels your fears but fortifies your faith; sees your anxieties but frees your spirit; recognizes your disabilities but emphasizes your possibilities.
William Ward,The greatest failure is the failure to try.
William Ward,The pessimist borrows trouble? the optimist lends encouragement.
William Ward,A pinch of praise is worth a pound of scorn. A dash of encouragement is more helpful than a dipper of pessimism. A cup of kindness is better than a cupboard of criticism.
William Ward,"Every person has the power to make others happy.Some do it simply by entering a room --others by leaving the room.Some individuals leave trails of gloom;others, trails of joy.Some leave trails of hate and bitterness;others, trails of love and harmony.Some leave trails of cynicism and pessimism;others trails of faith and optimism.Some leave trails of criticism and resignation;others trails of gratitude and hope.What kind of trails do you leave?"
William Ward,Friendship flourishes at the fountain of forgiveness.
William Ward,A second-class effort is a first-class mistake.
William Ward,"Today is a most unusual day, because we have never lived it before; we will never live it again; it is the only day we have.Today can be a healthy unusual day for you -- and for others -- if you take time to give someone a smile . . . to express a word of kindness . . . to lend a helping hand to someone in need . . . to write a note of gratitude . . . to give a word of encouragement to someone who is temporarily overcome with problems . . . to share a portion of your material possessions with others."
William Ward,Each of us will one day be judged by our standard of life -- not by our standard of living; by our measure of giving -- not by our measure of wealth; by our simple goodness -- not by our seeming greatness.
William Ward,"Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character."
William Ward,Obedience to our Heavenly Father starts with our loving service to a needy brother.
William Ward,"Every person has the power to make others happy. Some do it simply by entering a room -- others by leaving the room. Some individuals leave trails of gloom; others, trails of joy. Some leave trails of hate and bitterness; others, trails of love and harmony. Some leave trails of cynicism and pessimism; others trails of faith and optimism. Some leave trails of criticism and resignation; others trails of gratitude and hope. What kind of trails do you leave?"
William Ward,The optimist pleasantly ponders how high his kite will fly; the pessimist woefully wonders how soon his kite will fall.
William Ward,"Freedom's enemies are waste, lethargy, indifference, immorality, and the insidious attitude of something for nothing."
William Ward,A cloudy day is no match for a sunny disposition.
William Ward,The winner persistently programs his pluses; the loser mournfully magnifies his minuses.
William Ward,"Interruptions can be viewed as sources of irritation or opportunities for service, as moments lost or experience gained, as time wasted or horizons widened.

John Warden,I don't believe so.

Andy Warhol,"Those who talk about individuality the most are the ones who most object to deviation, and in a few years it may be the other way around. Some day everybody will just think what they want to think, and then everybody will probably be thinking alike; that"

Andy Warhol,What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest.
Andy Warhol,"I'd asked around 10 or 15 people for suggestions. Finally one lady friend asked the right question, 'Well, what do you love most?' That's how I started painting money."
Andy Warhol,Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.
Andy Warhol,"I never understood why when you died, you didn't just vanish, everything could just keep going on the way it was only you just wouldn't be there. I always thought I'd like my own tombstone to be blank. No epitaph, and no name. Well, actually, I'd like it to say 'figment.'"
Andy Warhol,Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.
Andy Warhol,My idea of a good picture is one that's in focus and of a famous person.

Andy Warhol,Isn't life a series of images that change as they repeat themselves?
Andy Warhol,"I suppose I have a really loose interpretation of ''work,'' because I think that just being alive is so much work at something you don't always want to do. The machinery is always going. Even when you sleep."

Andy Warhol,Fantasy love is much better than reality love. Never doing it is very exciting. The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet.
Andy Warhol,"The most exciting thing is not doing it. If you fall in love with someone and never do it, it's much more exciting."
Andy Warhol,Land really is the best art.
Andy Warhol,I think having land and not ruining it is the most beautiful art that anybody could ever want to own.
Andy Warhol,The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet.
Andy Warhol,I have Social Disease. I have to go out every night. If I stay home one night I start spreading rumors to my dogs.
Andy Warhol,"During the 1960s, I think, people forgot what emotions were supposed to be. And I don't think they've ever remembered."
Andy Warhol,I've decided something: Commercial things really do stink. As soon as it becomes commercial for a mass market it really stinks.

Andy Warhol,"If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There's nothing behind it."
Andy Warhol,"I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're beautiful. Everybody's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic."
Andy Warhol,"It's the movies that have really been running things in America ever since they were invented. They show you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, how to feel about it, and how to look how you feel about it. Everybody has their own America, and then they have the pieces of a fantasy America that they think is out there but they can't see."

Andy Warhol,I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.
Andy Warhol,Employees make the best dates. You don't have to pick them up and they're always tax-deductible.
Andy Warhol,"I'm afraid that if you look at a thing long enough, it loses all of its meaning."
Andy Warhol,An artist is somebody who produces things that people don't need to have.
Jeremy Wariner,"I wasn't surprised by my success at the Olympics,"
Jeremy Wariner,"I'm a whole different runner from a couple of years ago, ... My race has been fundamentally perfect the last couple of years. In the big races I stay confident. I just listened to Coach Hart throughout my career, and there's no telling where I can go from here."
Jeremy Wariner,"Michael leaves all the coaching to coach Hart,"
Jeremy Wariner,All he tells me is to listen to what coach Hart says and if I have any nagging injury then I shouldn't try and run it off.
Jeremy Wariner,Coach Hart told me I could be Olympic champion.
Kate Warne,I'm surprised that technology has continued to be on a tear so strongly today because it's the rapidly growing stocks that will in fact be hurt if interest rates are increased.
Kate Warne,"I think the rest of it was probably just the general feeling that techs had run toward the end of August and people were again beginning to get a little nervous about what was going on,"
Kate Warne,Any nervousness about Cisco translates into Nortel and all other high quality technology stocks and into some of the smaller riskier ones as well.
Kate Warne,"Any nervousness about Cisco translates into Nortel and all other high quality technology stocks and into some of the smaller riskier ones as well,"
Kate Warne,"Basically, all of the companies that have been doing the best this year, in terms of the major leaders, the large caps, really saw a big pull-back today."
Kate Warne,"We don't believe the income trust structure is appropriate for all companies, ... We're concerned that many companies that need to grow, if they become an income trust, are going to find it difficult to access the capital markets at exactly the time where they need additional resources."
Kate Warne,"Clearly, the people who are buying growth stocks are saying the good news from a series of interest rates in the U.S. and Canada will mean inflation remains under control. The overall sentiment today was basically optimistic."
Kate Warne,"I think we are seeing a little follow-through from the election ... but, overall, the market has been pulled down by the drop in oil prices more than anything else."
Kate Warne,I think that the market is in a wait-and-see mood to see whether there is any direction in Friday's reports.
Kate Warne,"Not surprisingly, when we have a market that's not quite sure about direction, you're going to see real volatile days like this where things are turning on emotion rather than on any underlying fundamental."
Kate Warne,"In Canada and U.S., people are watching for (inflation) to be higher then it was last month. In the U.S. everyone is just nervous about whether we're going to see numbers higher than anticipated because that would make the (Federal Reserve Board) less likely to cut more interest rates."
Kate Warne,"It's a good day led by Nortel; surprise, surprise. I had expected that (Canada) would be down today because of the inflation report."
David Warner,To tell an ally - who is shedding blood next to you - that you can't share information is a crime.
David Warner,"On film sets, people get put down in public a lot."
David Warner,I don't think I could be happy as an actor if there was a tyrant on the set.
David Warner,"If people are given quality stuff to watch, they'll watch it."
Jack Warner,"The automatic timing system failed to activate, so they had to re-run the race. (Indiana State officials) were having problems with cameras and timing all day, which was frustrating."
Jack Warner,Sheena James' performance was nice to see on Saturday.
Jack Warner,"I have a theory of relatives, too. Don't hire 'em."
Jack Warner,Anytime you have to triple in events like she does you really have to be on top of your game. It's not like she will be able to go into any of the events fresh.
Jack Warner,Right now she is closing in on the school records for both of those events. She will break those before the end of the season. She is ready to have a great season.
Jack Warner,Leah was solid in all three of her events. She will impress a lot of people this year.
Jack Warner,"If this recommendation is accepted then a repeat of the unfortunate statements that came out of the 2004 internal elections, which brought the party into even higher levels of disrepute would be avoided."
Jack Warner,This meet will give us a good look-see at where we stand in the Big Ten competition. We will be able to test the waters and challenge our team a little more than we did last weekend.
Jack Warner,(Tuggle)'s believing in himself more and more each week. He's working hard and staying healthy. That goes a long way for you in this sport.
Jack Warner,They are really believing that they can compete at the Big Ten level and be successful. Especially after what they did in cross country; they moved up a few spots.
Jack Warner,"Obviously, when you can defend your title it shows how good of an athlete you are. And to do it by beating the No. 1 seed is impressive."
Kurt Warner,"With the talent I've been around, and I've been around a lot of talent, this team matches up very favorably with the talent that I've been around."
Kurt Warner,"It is a struggle and a battle because the air around this place is that -- `same old Cardinals, here we go again.' It's a tough mentality, ... Just like winning is contagious, losing can be contagious."
Kurt Warner,"This isn't anything major, just disappointing. Obviously this is going to take the rest of the season, so that's the disappointing part of it. I'm just thankful that it is what it is, that it will not require any surgery, and that it will be a three to four week injury."
Kurt Warner,We just made some mistakes. We killed ourselves. It wasn't physical. It was mental. That's the frustrating part. You know physically you match up pretty well with them.
Kurt Warner,"[Warner finished 27-for-46 for 264 yards with one touchdown and one interception.] I just hate to lose, ... so all of them are tough no matter how you do it."
Kurt Warner,"She was happy that we got it done so she didn't have to move. Had this not worked out here, I don't know what I would have done."
Kurt Warner,We have to get the ball in the end zone. It's tough to win kicking field goals.
Kurt Warner,"I thought Eli looked poised. It was one of those games where, fortunately for him, he wasn't called upon to do a whole lot. They had a lot of big runs and he had a couple of screens that were probably his biggest plays. I think the game played out the they wanted it to. They took the pressure off him, which allowed him to continue to grow and get better."
Kurt Warner,"It's funny because I've played against so many guys that I've played with over the years the last two weeks, ... It's probably not going to be any different. There's going to be some hugs and smiles before the game, but then you're going to get out there and battle."
Kurt Warner,"The fun thing is now you can really fine-tune on one team, ... Instead of throwing the whole playbook at people and saying, 'Here, learn all this,' you get specific now, you get to watch film, get to attack what you think the Giants are going to do."
Kurt Warner,I expect huge things from this football team. I expect big things from this offence with the playmakers that we have now. I think it matches up very well with teams that I have been on in the past.
Kurt Warner,"We have to be able to run the football,"
Kurt Warner,"I'm fighting that battle not to have that go through my mind, ... Right now it's just working, rehabbing and getting ready, getting to 100 percent, doing what I do, and letting all the chips fall where they may."
Kurt Warner,"Guys hang on every word because they just feel the confidence that comes from him: 'This is what we're going to do, this is how we're going to win. They can pretty much take what he says to the bank."
Kurt Warner,"It's going (to depend) on his confidence to get up, snap and put it in the right spot time and time again, ... But it's more the confidence and the quickness to learning with your off hand. Try and brush your teeth with your left hand. It's not as easy as it sounds."
Kurt Warner,"I love playing here, ... I played in a dome in college. I played inside in Arena Football. I've played in the dome here. I just love playing inside. It's my element. It's what I'm comfortable with. ... It was great to get back in here. If we play this way at home, we're going to be a very, very tough team to beat."
Kurt Warner,"[Warner visited former teammates before the game and said hello to Rams coach Mike Martz, who turned his old job over to Bulger two years ago.] It wasn't that strange at all, ... This is my team now."
Kurt Warner,"It wasn't necessarily anything he showed me on the football field as far as throws, or his physical ability or anything like that. It was just his demeanor in the way that he was able to mentally get through (adversity) and not only stand pat, but continue to ascend."
Mark Warner,"We are committed to working with DEQ as we endeavor to return our plant to full service and restore electric reliability to acceptable levels, while, importantly, protecting public health and the environment."
Mark Warner,"No case has been more troubling, ... Rest assured there is no case I have spent more time thinking about, praying about and reflecting on than this case."
Mark Warner,"What we want to do in Virginia is in the initial facility find places where people could be staying for weeks. We want to then look at working with these communities where people can stay for months. Let's not assume the best case, let's assume the worst case and work from there,"
Mark Warner,I will favorably consider if there's a good opportunity to move some of these jobs to rural parts of the state that have been hard hit by economic transformation.
Mark Warner,"I not going to sign off on something that does not increase security for this state IT information,"
Mark Warner,"I'm going to do everything I can for him, ... I have worked too hard to take the keys to the office and put them in the hands of a guy who has worked against us."
Mark Warner,We need to look at what is going to be the long-term future of our Guard when states need to rely on these soldiers for emergencies and the nation continues to rely on them for overseas deployment.
Mark Warner,"I will not tolerate any assault on the health, safety and welfare of Virginia's citizens or the environment, and I insist on compliance with environmental laws and regulations. This matter must be brought to a swift and responsible conclusion ... The bottom line is that you need to either fully comply with environmental laws and regulations or shut down."
Mark Warner,"Investing in high-quality early childhood education has extraordinary returns, not only for Virginia's children, but also for our workforce and economy. The best investments are made in community-grown programs that truly meet local needs."
Mark Warner,"When I finished school, I took my entire life savings - $5,000 - and invested it in a business. I was young. I was inexperienced. But I was an entrepreneur, and I was proud. And in six weeks, I was broke."
Mark Warner,I'm not sure. I don't get the sense that consumers have fixed the blame yet ...I think we may be one event away or some catalyst away from that blame being pointed at Washington or the administration. I'm not sure it's there yet.
Mark Warner,"My success was due to good luck, hard work, and support and advice from friends and mentors. But most importantly, it depended on me to keep trying after I had failed."
John Warnock,"[Aside from its financial troubles, he said, Xerox is suffering from a problem similar to the one that plagued Adobe and Apple a few years ago: a lack of confidence among investors and potential customers. In 1998, as Asia was undergoing a serious financial crisis,] Adobe hit some rough spots, ... Adobe seems strong now. The cachet is different. But Xerox is in a nosedive."
John Warnock,"One of the biggest parts of my job is to figure out where the company is going. What are the opportunities? So I stay very immersed and very up-to-date on what new companies are being started, what new technologies are emerging, what new ideas are getting floated in business plans, and things like that. I see a lot of product ideas and a lot of new technologies."
John Warnock,We started the company out of frustration with the employer that we had because we were building great stuff and there was no way that this stuff was ever going to get into the hands of the people who could use it.
John Warnock,"I have seen that technology has contributed to improved communication, that it's contributed to better health care, that it's contributed to better food supplies, that it has contributed to all the basic human needs."
John Warnock,"Without television and mass communication, that knowledge wouldn't exist. So I think it actually has the possibility of turning people into more understanding and more empathetic people."
John Warnock,"What I try to do is factor in how people use computers, what people's problems are, and how these technologies can get applied to those problems. Then I try to direct the various product groups to act on this information."
Neil Warnock,This is the best squad I've ever had. I've certainly never had so many quality strikers - I've been used to pulling rabbits out of hats.
Neil Warnock,"I won't deny that I flipped my fingers in his direction, but only because I was so disgusted and frustrated at being humiliated by a fellow manager."
Neil Warnock,"I thought it was going to be cruel for the boys at the end. Obviously, they're technically far better than us, but we hung in there and showed a lot of guts and determination."
David Warren,We are opposed to the use of the Social Security number in tracking students. It will drop like a rock. It will create a central ministry of higher education similar to what the French use. I don't think a single commission member will come out in support of it.
David Warren,And what is different this time is that we have a banking system back to health.
David Warren,"There was no discussion about what those goals mean. Each goal has the potential to help the education system, but each has the ability to hurt it."
Earl Warren,"I always turn to the sports pages first, which records people's accomplishments.  The front page has nothing but man's failures."

Earl Warren,It is the spirit and not the form of law that keeps justice alive.
Earl Warren,We may not know the whole story in our lifetime.
Earl Warren,"Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms."
Earl Warren,"If Nixon is not forced to turn over tapes of his conversations with the ring of men who were conversing on their violations of the law, then liberty will soon be dead in this nation."
Earl Warren,"Legislatures represent people, not acres or trees."
Earl Warren,There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess a crime or a person who calls the police to offer a confession because volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the 5th Amendment.
Earl Warren,"The old Court you and I served so long will not be worthy of its traditions if Nixon can twist, turn and fashion If Nixon gets away with that, then Nixon makes the law as he goes along - not the Congress nor the courts."
Earl Warren,"Before this distinguished assembly and the world, the bells today proclaim the joyous tidings of the completion of this quietly soaring tower."

Earl Warren,Life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.
Earl Warren,"All provisions of federal, state or local law requiring or permitting discrimination in public education must yield."
Earl Warren,"In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education."
Earl Warren,"The man of character, sensitive to the meaning of what he is doing, will know how to discover the ethical paths in the maze of possible behavior."
Earl Warren,"In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics."
Earl Warren,"I'm very pleased with each advancing year. It stems back to when I was forty. I was a bit upset about reaching that milestone, but an older friend consoled me. 'Don't complain about growing old--many, many people do not have that privilege.'"
Earl Warren,To separate children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.
Earl Warren,Ben Franklin may have discovered electricity- but it is the man who invented the meter who made the money.
Earl Warren,"I always turn to the sports pages first, which records people's accomplishments. The front page has nothing but man's failures."
Earl Warren,The most tragic paradox of our time is to be found in the failure of nation-states to recognize the imperatives of internationalism.
Frank Warren,He is gentle. He never gets angry. You'd never know he'd ever been a fighter. He talks to the people and he speaks with sincerity.
Frank Warren,The market is healthy. But there's still not a lot of momentum out there.
Frank Warren,"I am absolutely delighted to have entered into this agreement with SMG management and our past working relationship over the last ten years illustrates that their expertise in their field and our expertise in boxing compliments each other perfectly,"
Frank Warren,"He's had injuries, but you've seen him fight on American TV. ... It's denigrating my own man. I don't understand it. He will be there on March 4 and see where we are. I have all the faith he will prove to the world how great of a champion he is."
Frank Warren,"The bottom line is I have an agreement with him, ... We have had an excellent relationship and I certainly don't want to go down any court route, but at the end of the day I have to look after Sports Network's interests. We're still talking and hopefully something will be resolved."
Frank Warren,"That's just the kind of fight that I want to see Joe in and just the kind of fight audiences would love,"
Gerard Warren,"Guys came out and worked hard and ran hard (Wednesday). I guess he rewarded us with a short individual practice, go out and do a little conditioning and wish the guys well on their trips home or wherever they're going for the bye week."
Gerard Warren,It's just like practice. It's so routine.
Gerard Warren,"Players on other teams can't believe how he allows the players to police the locker room and police the team. (Otherwise), he tells you what he expects from you and what he wants to get accomplished."
Gerard Warren,Part of me is still in Cleveland. But that's the past. My heart and my mind are in Denver.
Gerard Warren,It means I was in the loudest game I've been a part of. It means this team keeps going (in the playoffs) and we get to be at home again. We like our chances with that.
Gerard Warren,Our game plan was to pressure him and force him to make some bad throws and interceptions. We did our job and it worked.
Gerard Warren,"If I don't hold that trophy, it won't be an enjoyable season."
Gerard Warren,"(I'm) somewhat excited, but this game is next. This isn't the final game. (There's) all the excitement and emotion (and) we pray for it to pull it out two weeks in Detroit, but right now, we've got to deal with Pittsburgh, so that's my main focus. (There's) no time to be excited."
Mark Warren,He could have killed that young woman.
Mark Warren,"The security at the time had been delegated back to the ground exiting point, ... We wanted to make sure the referees were in a secure position with a minute to go."
Mark Warren,"We thought security was adequate,"
Mark Warren,Under no circumstances can the USA reject or ignore a binding decision of the ICJ. To do so would put it in the company of rogue nations like Libya and Iraq.
Rick Warren,"I believe one of the secrets of effective ministry is keep it simple-be simple... Simple does not mean shallow and simple doesn't mean simplistic, and simple doesn't mean superficial. It just means understandable."
Rick Warren,What's in your heart? ... What disturbs you?
Rick Warren,"If God only used perfect people, nothing would get done, ... God will use anybody if you're available."
Rick Warren,God loves to bring good out of bad. He loves to turn crucifixions into resurrections. Every obstacle is an opportunity. Every problem has potential. Every crisis is an opportunity for ministry. Every hurt God wants to use for His glory.
Rick Warren,"Life is all about stewardship. It all belongs to God - he just loans it to us for a short period of time. The first command God gave to man was to take care of the Earth, which includes managing and protecting the environment."
Rick Warren,"It comes from service. It is by giving our lives away that we find meaning, because that's the way we're wired, I believe, by God."
Rick Warren,I hope that the community will cooperate and not hassle the clerks with what they have to do. It's a good store and serves a good need to the community.
Rick Warren,"You dont judge the strength of an army by how many soldiers sit and eat in the mess hall, but by how they perform on the front line. Likewise a churchs strength is not seen in how many show up, but in how many serve in the ministry."
Rick Warren,"You donâ€™t judge the strength of an army by how many soldiers sit and eat in the mess hall, but by how they perform on the front line. Likewise a churchâ€™s strength is not seen in how many show up, but in how many serve in the ministry."
Rick Warren,"During the next 90 days, people are going to be more open to the Gospel than in years. It is God's responsibility to make people receptive; it is our responsibility to sow the seed."

Lemuel Washburn,"If God exists, what objection can he have to saying so?"

Gary Waters,"That (run) was paramount. We talked about, going into the game, that this team was on their last leg. They felt if there was one game they had a chance, it was against us. I told our team to go out and take them away, because then there's nothing else left. And that's what happened."

Gary Waters,"We put him situations to score off screens. But he also has the ability now to dribble penetrate and do other things, go to the basket or give it up. If he does both, that's tough to shut down."

Muddy Waters,"There's no way in the world I can feel the same blues the way I used to. When I play in Chicago, I'm playing up-to-date, not the blues I was born with. People should hear the pure blues - the blues we used to have when we had no money."

Roger Waters,Each small candle lights a corner of the darkWhen the wheel of pain stops turning And the branding iron stops burningWhen the children can be children When the desperados weaken When the tide rolls into greet themAnd the natural law of science Greets the humble and the mighty And a billion candles burning Lights the dark side of every human mind

Roger Waters,I confess I've never felt like a passenger.
Roger Waters,I always used to look at books and wonder how anybody could come up with so many words. But my divorce and then falling in love with somebody else has released in me an ability to write in other ways apart from songs.

David Watson,There aren't necessarily clear points of difference between what's normal and abnormal. Abnormal behavior may just be an exaggeration of normal behavior.

David Watson,"If they are confident in what they are doing and confident in their ability to sell the story, they should let the vote happen. They are getting into games I don't think they should be getting into."

Paul Watson,"Back in 1980, whale watching surpassed whaling as an industry. Now it's worth about four times as much. Whale watching provides far, far more jobs to people than whaling ever did. Whale watching has become an ally in the fight to end whaling."
Paul Watson,"Earlier in life [he] had such a severe alcoholism problem that he almost died and was homeless for extended periods of time. He has been sober for decades and came out of his addiction through AA,"
Paul Watson,"These guys are so gentle, it's like shooting a puppy dog. I don't see how there's any honor in that."

Shane Watson,I know I am a good contributor and I back my ability.

Alan Watts,"But at any rate, the point is that God is what nobody admits to being, and everybody really is."
Alan Watts,Buddhism has in it no idea of there being a moral law laid down by somekind of cosmic lawgiver.

Alan Watts,"If you study the writings of the mystics, you will always find things in them that appear to be paradoxes, as in Zen, particularly."
Alan Watts,"The reason we have poverty is that we have no imagination. There are a great many people accumulating what they think is vast wealth, but it's only money... they don't know how to enjoy it, because they have no imagination."
Alan Watts,The reason we want to go on and on is because we live in an impoverished present.
Alan Watts,Wars based on principle are far more destructive... the attacker will not destroy that which he is after.

Alan Watts,"To the philosophers of India, however, Relativity is no new discovery, just as the concept of light years is no matter for astonishment to people used to thinking of time in millions of kalpas, (A kalpa is about 4,320,000 years). The fact that the wise men of India have not been concerned with technological applications of this knowledge arises from the circumstance that technology is but one of innumerable ways of applying it."
Alan Watts,"To be angry about trifles is mean and childish; to rage and be furious is brutish; and to maintain perpetual wrath is akin to the practice and temper of devils; but to prevent and suppress rising resentment is wise and glorious, is manly and divine."

Alan Watts,"Reality is only a Rorschach ink-blot, you know."

Alan Watts,"But to me nothing - the negative, the empty - is exceedingly powerful."
Alan Watts,"The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance."
Naomi Watts,"He also talked about how he was an only child and his mom raised him, so he had an understanding of that emotional relationship."
Naomi Watts,"The parallels are being drawn between me as a mother and Samara's mother and what I have done to my child and what was done to her by her mother, ... So there's things for the audience there to play with and look into, and that's clearly why Samara's drawn to me."
Naomi Watts,She had a great emotional journey in the first one and it was not just your classic genre picture with a damsel-in-distress kind of role. It was more than that and that's what drew me to the first. And I always knew when I did the first that there was going to be a number two.
Naomi Watts,Faces of Fear: The Cast

Evelyn Waugh,Instead of this absurd division into sexes they ought to class people as static and dynamic.
Evelyn Waugh,There are no poetic ideas; only poetic utterances.
Evelyn Waugh,"If we can't stamp out literature in the country, we can at least stop its being brought in from outside."
Evelyn Waugh,"In the dying world I come from, quotation is a national vice."
Evelyn Waugh,What is youth except a man or woman before it is ready or fit to be seen?
Evelyn Waugh,"Pray always for all the learned, the oblique, the delicate. Let them not be quite forgotten at the throne of God when the simple come into their kingdom."
Evelyn Waugh,My unhealthy affection for my second daughter has waned. Now I despise all my seven children equally.
Evelyn Waugh,I think to be oversensitive about cliches is like being oversensitive about table manners.
Evelyn Waugh,Art is the symbol of the two noblest human efforts: to construct and to refrain from destruction.
Evelyn Waugh,I put the words down and push them a bit.
Evelyn Waugh,All this fuss about sleeping together. For physical pleasure I'd sooner go to my dentist any day.
Evelyn Waugh,Money is only useful when you get rid of it. It is like the odd card in Old Maid; the player who is finally left with it has lost.
Evelyn Waugh,Perhaps host and guest is really the happiest relation for father and son.
Evelyn Waugh,"Don't hold your parents up to contempt. After all, you are their son, and it is just possible that you may take after them."
Evelyn Waugh,One forgets words as one forgets names. One's vocabulary needs constant fertilizing or it will die.
Evelyn Waugh,Manners are especially the need of the plain. The pretty can get away with anything.
Evelyn Waugh,"In the dying world I come from quotation is a national vice. It used to be the classics, now it's lyric verse."
Evelyn Waugh,Almost all crime is due to the repressed desire for aesthetic expression.
Evelyn Waugh,Other nations use 'force'; we Britons alone use 'Might'.
Evelyn Waugh,News is what a chap who doesn't care much about anything wants to read. And it's only news until he's read it. After that it's dead.
Evelyn Waugh,Punctuality is the virtue of the bored.
Evelyn Waugh,"Not everyone grows to be old, but everyone has been younger than he is now."
Evelyn Waugh,What a man enjoys about a woman's clothes are his fantasies of how she would look without them

Evelyn Waugh,Only when one has lost all curiosity about the future has one reached the age to write an autobiography.
Evelyn Waugh,"When we argue for our limitations, we get to keep them."
Evelyn Waugh,I haven't been to sleep for over a year. That's why I go to bed early. One needs more rest if one doesn't sleep.
Evelyn Waugh,Only when one has lost all curiosity about the future has one reached the age to write an autobiography
Evelyn Waugh,"Your actions, and your action alone, determines your worth."
Evelyn Waugh,"We cherish our friends not for their ability to amuse us, but for ours to amuse them."
Steve Waugh,It's funny with Michael ... in his first book I was his mentor and in the second I had become his tormentor.
Steve Waugh,"One-day cricket being the more commercial aspect of the game, so I think you can rotate."
Steve Waugh,"They don't seem to have had the hunger normally associated with Australian cricket sides. From Australia's point of view, there have been a few injuries and too many statements in the papers leading up to the series."
Steve Waugh,They don't seem to have the hunger normally associated with Australian cricket sides.
Steve Waugh,"England have played excellent cricket and have met head on the challenges both on and off the field. They have called Australia's bluff during the series, and certainly dominated the last couple of Tests. You have got to look at how England have played. They have played very good cricket. They have put a lot of pressure on (Australia)."
Steve Waugh,In accepting I hope the award will help the focus on me to be about more than just cricket. If it is meant as a recognition in some way of the other work I've done in the community in Australia and in India then I'm grateful indeed.
Steve Waugh,"England have played excellent cricket and have met head on the challenges both on and off the field,"
Steve Waugh,"I've said before what a great privilege it is to represent your country, this award takes this privilege to a new and totally unbelievable level for me,"
Steve Waugh,"There may have been something behind that dinner, but I just took it as a casual conversation,"
Gerard Way,"One time, Bert and I were making out for so long it wasn't even funny..But then it was funny."
Gerard Way,So how was Christmas for you guys? Did you all get lots of nice black tee shirts?
Gerard Way,"Dumbass, that wan't one of the choices."
Gerard Way,I'd rather be a creature of the night than an old dude.
Gerard Way,So many people treat you like you're a kid so you might as well act like one and throw your television out of the hotel window.
Mikey Way,"Were really greedy about the electricity in our iPods. We hoard it. Were like, Yo, Im only on half a f**k battery and I have a plane ride!"
Mikey Way,"Weâ€™re really greedy about the electricity in our iPods. We hoard it. Weâ€™re like, â€˜Yo, Iâ€™m only on half a f**k battery and I have a plane ride!"
Mikey Way,"Yeah, I had a headache, really bad. I was in a gas station and there was a pot of coffee and I looked at it for about a minute and then my brother (motions at Gerard) got a coffee and he taunted me."
Mikey Way,I could eat my body weight in sushi.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"You never really know until you put the movie in front of an audience. I am a big advocate of screenings, which are getting harder and harder to do nowadays."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,You just can't make any movie and it will be good now. This is a really a difficult time to be in films.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,You do what it takes. It was on me to deliver.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,You can kind of feel when things are going to work out.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"We've seen so many films now, that you have to be on par with the best films that have preceded you. You just can't make any movie and it will be good."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,We felt like we had done as much as you can do with the slasher genre. We were trying to find the next group of scary movies that were ripe for parody.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,We do nods to Charlie's Angels and Mission Impossible because they are popular with our fan base.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,We cut some scenes completely because they proved to be just too gross. That was one instance where the joke was too disturbing.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,Usually what happens is that you screen all of it and then when the audience doesn't respond to it - you cut out whatever is holding the story down.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,This is really a difficult time to be in films.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,The worst thing that can happen is you shoot something six months before you release it because a whole lot can happen in six months.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,The pressures having grown up in this business can be really rough. And it is a testament to you that you have remained focused and NOT lost your mind.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,My brothers can be a little out of control sometimes and so somebody has to be able to keep them focused.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,Just making a good movie is hard to do.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"It's really hard to take this stuff seriously. A lot of it is sexual, but it's not offered up that way. It's just body parts, gross kind of stuff."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"It's rare that you cut out something that is really good. You screen all of it, and when the audience doesn't respond, you cut out whatever is holding the story down."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,In rare instances you have to give up what you thought was a great scene.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I'm not on all the time. I like to have fun and be funny, but I'm much more of a thinker."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,I'm just calm under fire. I'm not intimidating at all.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I throw it all in there, Kung Fu, blaxploitation, horror."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,I think a lot comes from having the experience of doing stand-up comedy. It allows you to figure out the psychology of an audience; what things are funny and not.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,I put the cameras on her and told her to be obnoxious as she could possibly could be. She was.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,I put heavy emphasis on the characters.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,I put a scare in everybody to make the date even as I kept shooting. But That's the good thing about coming from a low-budget world.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,I prefer the smaller budget versus the bigger budget because the mentality that goes along with big budget filmmaking doesn't really suit me; the mind-set that money is the answer.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I opened for Prince at the Houston Coliseum in front of 10,000 people. I said, Hi, and they booed. They didn't want to see me. It can be a tough time."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I like to have fun and be funny, but I'm much more of a thinker."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I have been a director who has starred, participated on both sides of the filmmaking process."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I go through a whole process with the actors first, building and creating characters, then I encourage them to sort of live in that character when they're in the screen."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I enjoy the character interplay. Sometimes the audience is not laughing, but smiling, and that is almost just as good because it keeps them ready to laugh."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,Everybody worked at a level they never worked before and will probably never work again. Our goal was not to disappoint the audience.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,Creativity is the answer. I always prefer the creative solution to an expensive solution.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,All I need is a camera and I'll make things happen.
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"There are two phases to a movie. First you shoot the movie, and then you make the movie. Generally, post-production is longer than filming."
Keenen Ivory Wayans,"I always prefer the big laugh. That is always the objective, especially with a film like Scary Movie 2."
John Wayne,I'm the stuff men are made of
John Wayne,"There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves"
John Wayne,Tomorrow hopes we have learned something from yesterday.
John Wayne,I stick to simple themes. Love. Hate. No nuances. I stay away from psychoanalyst's couch scenes. Couches are good for one thing.
John Wayne,Which would cause the fire to burn back on itself where there's no fuel since its already been burned.
John Wayne,"I've had three wives, six children and six grandchildren and I still don't understand women"
John Wayne,"somewhat troubled by the absence of a consistent policy governing our willingness to permit the President to participate in these private, commercial tributes . . . ."
George Weah,I am looking forward to victory. We won the first round and I am confident we will win the second round.
George Weah,I think he will deliver me from my suffering.
George Weah,"You chose me because I am a peace ambassador. You have a case. While we are looking into the case we want you to remain calm. The streets of Monrovia do not belong to demonstrators. Do not go into the streets to riot,"
George Weah,I will go on my knees and ask the Liberian people to participate in bringing peace and stability to our country.
George Weah,"It is a special honor -- for me, for Liberia, for all of Africa,"
George Weah,"I can see in your eyes, I can see in your faces, I can see you cry. But what I want to say, there's no reason to cry. Do not, in the name of peace, go in the streets and riot."
George Weah,"They say I do not have the qualifications to be president, that I do not have education. Well I would never divide the Liberian people."
George Weah,"While we were preaching transparency and democracy, our election was fraudulent,"
George Weah,"The whole world is preaching democracy, so we have no doubt that this election will be free and fair."
George Weah,I think someone who takes the presidency must not take it to learn. (There is) a crisis of leadership and it needs someone who understands already the depth of human suffering and the difficulties we are confronted with. There's no time for learning.
George Weah,"You have to be courageous because we have not lost the election. We want you to have courage. We want you to know that everything we do is peace first and peace last,"
George Weah,My government will be open. Anyone found guilty of corruption will be dealt with in accordance with the law. If you are corrupt you will have to hang your boots.
George Weah,not about my popularity. People have been supporting me since my childhood. They are supporting me because they want a change not about my popularity.
George Weah,"No books, I'll vote for you!"
George Weah,"We are seeking the advice of the international community and all the people that are involved to see if everybody can arrest this situation. While we are preparing ourselves for the legal side, we are also asking our people to be very calm."
Dennis Weaver,"He just exploded out of the starting blocks. Very good reaction time, excellent concentration and lots of practice."
Dennis Weaver,"To get what you want, STOP doing what isn't working."
Dennis Weaver,"When we realize we can make a buck cleaning up the environment, it will be done!"
Dennis Weaver,We don't have to sacrifice a strong economy for a healthy environment.
Earl Weaver,"I don't think, in all the years I managed them, I ever spoke more than thirty words to Frank and Brooks Robinson."
Earl Weaver,He was a happy person and was loved and welcomed wherever he went.
Earl Weaver,"If you know how to cheat, start now."
Earl Weaver,Momentum? Momentum is the next day's starting pitcher.
Earl Weaver,I think the National League has better biorhythms in July.
Earl Weaver,"This ain't a football game, we do this every day."
Earl Weaver,"The key step for an infielder is the first one, to the left or right, but before the ball is hit."
Earl Weaver,It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.
Earl Weaver,"Don't worry, the fans don't start booing until July."
Earl Weaver,I think there should be bad blood between all clubs.
Earl Weaver,"Coaches are an integral part of any manager's team, especially if they are good pinochle players."
Earl Weaver,A manager should stay as far away as possible from his players. I don't know if I said ten words to Frank Robinson while he played for me.
Earl Weaver,"Nobody likes to hear it, because it's dull, but the reason you win or lose is darn near always the same - pitching."
Earl Weaver,"The job of arguing with the umpire belongs to the manager, because it won't hurt the team if he gets thrown out of the game."
Earl Weaver,I became an optimist when I discovered that I wasn't going to win any more games by being anything else.
Earl Weaver,The only thing that matters is what happens on the little hump out in the middle of the field.
Earl Weaver,"On my tombstone just write, 'The sorest loser that ever lived.'"
Earl Weaver,"The key to winning baseball games is pitching, fundamentals, and three run homers."
John Weaver,It would be malpractice not to prepare for a potential presidential candidacy. We need to talk to the grassroots and the people who can fund a 50-state campaign.
John Weaver,Human embryos are not potential human beings. Human embryos are human beings with potential.
John Weaver,"It is not an end in itself; rather the beginning of the rebalancing of our portfolio and the building of a less leveraged company that can grow and prosper over the long haul,"
Richard Weaver,The assertion of purpose in a world we felt to be purposeless would be a form of sentimentality.
Richard Weaver,The Southerner tends to look upon nature as something which is given and something which is finally inscrutable. This is equivalent to saying that he looks upon it as the creation of a Creator.
Richard Weaver,"Where simple massness exists, everyone is in everyone else's way, and a certain perilious liberty has been traded for stultification."
Richard Weaver,"People who give up their own land too readily need careful weighing, exactly as do those who are so with their convictions. Even Solomon said that the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. One gives up the part for the whole only to discover that without parts there is no whole."
Richard Weaver,"Man is a mixture of good and evil, and he can never be perfected in this life. The notion of his natural goodness is a delusive theory which will blow up any social order that is predicated upon it."
Richard Weaver,Equality is a disorganizing concept in so far as human relations mean order.
Richard Weaver,"In the last analysis, provincialism is your belief in yourself, in your neighborhood, in your reality. It is patriotism without belligerence. Convincing cases have been made to show that all great art is provincial in the sense of reflecting a place, a time, and a Zeitgeist."
Gary Webb,We commonly see problems in adults that had been present since childhood but which take a toll on the heart over time.
Gary Webb,"After spending three years of my life looking into this, I am more convinced than ever that the U.S. government's responsibility for the drug problems in South Central Los Angeles and other inner cities is greater than I ever wrote in the newspaper."
Gary Webb,You can't believe the government - on anything. And you especially can't believe them when they're talking about important stuff.
James Webb,"It's an excellent naming opportunity for potential benefactors,"
James Webb,Surely the President realizes that the moment a man steps foot on the moon will be a definitive one in the history of the world.
James Webb,These seminar leaders never talk about how much of your personal time it takes. They don't talk about the sweat equity.
Mark Webb,"While I am disappointed by the verdict, my team and I feel strongly that we brought an important safety issue to light with this case."
Mark Webb,They are the most qualified company.
Mark Webb,"It lets me know how brave all of our Patriots were, and what they gave up. A lot of them, their lives."
Mary Webb,"On the highest point of the bare opposite ridge, now curtained in driving storm-cloud, towered in gigantic aloofness a mass of quartzite blackened and hardened by uncountable agesFlat, white stones lay about like tombstones with no name, no date, no word of hope, fit for the nameless, dateless dead, beasts and men, who had gone into the silence of annihilation."
Mary Webb,"To many women marriage is only this. It is merely a physical change impinging on their ordinary nature, leaving their mentality untouched, their self-possession intact. They are not burnt by even the red fire of physical passion --far less by the white fi"
Mary Webb,"We've had many other instances in history where (governments) had to re-jig expenditures to make sure that they stayed on course. That may be the scenario they're facing this spring,"
Mary Webb,The divine egoism hat is genius.
Mary Webb,The divine egoism that is genius.
Mary Webb,"If you stop to be kind, you must swerve often from your path."
Mary Webb,"The past is only the present become invisible and mute; and because it is invisible and mute, its memorized glances and its murmurs are infinitely precious. We are tomorrow's past."
Mary Webb,"Nature's music is never over; her silences are pauses, not conclusions."
Mary Webb,Saddle your dreams before you ride em.
Mike Webb,"I really believe that. The guys who aren't even playing have amazing talent. Joe Ford, (junior) Ben Pemberton, those guys can play ball, and all it takes is the adjustment to Division I basketball."
Mike Webb,"It's like playing golf, I guess. I think she's kind of had a case of the yips. Nobody's really been talking about it, but we worked with her in practice and noticed her elbow out a little too far. She was just in a slump, but she came out of it today."
Mike Webb,"We wanted to run if we could on rebounds. But we knew we had an advantage with our three guards, all three of them can shoot free throws really well."
Chris Webber,"I'm definitely looking forward to getting back out on that floor and shooting and running back in the arena, getting used to Wachovia again,"
Chris Webber,Y?all are gonna dog me the rest of my life. I just want to win.
Chris Webber,"Four of those jumpers, I hit him on the head on purpose. He was just hot."
Chris Webber,"It's been tough every night, but we're getting there."
Chris Webber,"We're getting there. It's been tough every night, but we're getting there. We've got a lot of [young] guys getting on-the-job experience, so I give them credit."
Chris Webber,"We have to be consistent every night, every night, every night. We can't be too excited. We have to stay focused."
Chris Webber,One thing good about the playoffs. You can erase all the regular-season mistakes if you go in and do something unexpected.
Chris Webber,"To me, Sam is one of the best game-changing players I've every played with. When he has his mind and heart in the game, he really gives us a lot of confidence. When he's like that he makes up for a lot of things."
Chris Webber,"Kevin Ollie, if I ever own a team, he?s gonna be the coach. Kevin Ollie is the man. ..As a team, he makes us go. Everything he does in practice, the way he conducts himself, to the way he plays in the game -- it?s not all talent, it?s effort."
Chris Webber,There is a method to their madness. They want those shots and they will live and die by those shots. It's not that it just happened haphazardly; they really want it that way.
Chris Webber,"I'm definitely glad tonight is over. I love visiting here, but as far as playing, there's so much put on it. You just want to bow down so you can keep the memories that you have. The memories I have of this place are wonderful."
Chris Webber,"I believe there is a reason and purpose for everything in life and if this situation allowed me the privilege to have my life intersect with the lives of the children I worked with these past two summers, than it was worth every moment. These kids face challenges and hardships that most of us cannot imagine. I've always tried to give back to the community, especially Detroit because of all it has done for me...I thank the Court for its fairness and guidance during the past few years and to my family, friends and fans for their support."
Chris Webber,"I believe there is a reason and purpose for everything in life and if this situation allowed me the privilege to have my life intersect with the lives of the children I worked with these past two summers, than it was worth every moment"
Chris Webber,"If he doesn't get hurt, he was an All-Star candidate. To me, Gerald Wallace definitely should be the Most Improved Player."
Chris Webber,"This hurts, man. Ten out of 12. How many times have I said the word 'hurt' in an interview after a game?"
Chris Webber,"I met people from every ethnicity imaginable, and I saw how they took pride in their history. It wasn't racial pride. They just held their traditions close."
Chris Webber,I don't think we've ever gone 19 straight field goals missed between 4:41 in the third and (1:05) in the fourth. Does the word 'aberration' (apply)? I can't see that happening again. It's sad that it happened tonight.
Chris Webber,"We just can't get over that .500 hump. If we get up two, three, four games over .500, I really believe it'll snowball."
Chris Webber,We got some more rebounds and that's what we wanted to do. Sam and I work well together. It's fun being out there with athletic players.
Chris Webber,Does that look like fun to you? There's a method to their madness.
Chris Webber,We did not want this to be sports bar. We wanted this to be a very family friendly oriented restaurant with themes.
Chris Webber,"I know we're going to be looked at as a failure, and I don't like starting anything and not finishing it."
Chris Webber,I definitely could not envision this failure. We failed to make the playoffs and that's not a good thing. It's nothing I expected at all. I thought we were capable of winning 50 games and our division. It was nowhere near that.
Chris Webber,"When you're missing 30 points, your defense better be a lot better."
Chris Webber,"I have to tell you that first and foremost, defense is the problem."
Chris Webber,"I definitely need the ball in my hands to shoot it, or to make decisions or to pass,"
Chris Webber,"I love Sacramento. This is a place I still enjoy, I still love the community here, this is a family oriented town, and I still get love from Sacramento. I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't have a restaurant here. This was the only place where I wanted to start this franchise."
Chris Webber,"They want those shots, they'll live an die by those shots, just like Kentucky in college. I played on a team like that before [in Sacramento], and it's very tough to stop a team like that."
Chris Webber,"Coach can drill us and drill us, but it's a state of mind, ... We have to gang-rebound."
Chris Webber,"I definitely won't say coach O'Brien was the reason why, ... That would make him a scapegoat like I was last year."
Chris Webber,"I am blessed that I am feeling really good. Even when my body doesn't feel great, I feel like I know myself enough -- I've played with this injury enough -- to be able to navigate in certain games. I do feel like I'm getting stronger. It's the first time definitely in the last two years, so that feels good."
Chris Webber,"I'm going to get a doctor's note. For me, it keeps down the swelling during the game. Believe me, tights are not something that I choose to wear because of fashion."
Chris Webber,We still haven't turned it around yet. We're still at .500. We're going to turn it around. I believe that. I believe in us.
Chris Webber,I've had hard coaches all my life.
Chris Webber,"I've been in the league 12 years. To sit on the bench and complain about the way things were, that doesn't get anything done. I don't know. I'm playing for a championship and trying to make the playoffs. My effort has never changed."
Chris Webber,I'm not trying to win individual awards.
Chris Webber,I'm a professional; I feel I'm one of the best in the game.
Chris Webber,I just want to fit in and win games for my team.
Bruce Weber,"If we get dropped or moved away, we have nobody to blame but ourselves."
Bruce Weber,"I'm happy. You expect your guys to improve, keep getting better. We work hard on fundamentals, we work hard on the shooting, conditioning, weights, and now we're starting to see that with some of the other players."
Bruce Weber,Dee got more involved -- he made some shots. Sometimes teams are locking in on him and trying to shut down [his] scoring.
Bruce Weber,"I challenged them. I was just trying to make them appreciate (Brown and Augustine). I told them, 'You don't realize who you're playing with. They will win the most games in history of Illinois basketball. You better appreciate them and for their sake play at a high level.' I think they responded pretty well."
Bruce Weber,"You saw it, you write it. I don't have to get in trouble. You know what happened."
Bruce Weber,"Obviously, we are biased. We have great fan support there."
Bruce Weber,The valuations in the exchange space are getting high.
Bruce Weber,"He hasn't had a breakout game since that Memphis game two years ago. As a high school kid, that's what he was known for. It's good to see him do that."
Bruce Weber,"It was great to see Rich make some shots. As a high school kid, that's what he was known for. He's been so consistent at taking care of the ball and guarding. It was good to see a feel-good game for him."
Bruce Weber,"Hey, if that gets them fired up - I'm running out of stuff. There are no more stools because I broke them all. No more cell phones, either. I break them, too. I'm so strong I can just squish them."
Bruce Weber,The big three with the shot clock running down . . . that was the back breaker of the game.
Bruce Weber,I said 'Get it done or I'm getting him out under 11. I don't want to take a risk of an injury or whatever.
Bruce Weber,"I'm disappointed that the streak is over, but I'm more disappointed in the race. We gained one at Wisconsin and lost one here."
Bruce Weber,You're disappointed that the streak is over. But I'm more disappointed in the [Big Ten] race.
Bruce Weber,"He's a quality person, someone you respect as a person."
Bruce Weber,We (recruited him) a little bit. I've known him since fifth or sixth grade and he's a quality player and quality kid. It just wasn't the right situation. And at some point he felt he needed to get away. He went to a prep school (near Boston) and it's worked out great for him now at Washington.
Bruce Weber,"I told them after today's game, we're making progress. Now, put it all together on the road against a good team. If you're going to compete and get a high (NCAA tournament) seed, you have to win some road games."
Bruce Weber,"The first thing is scoring on the road, when the other team gets momentum. The second thing is the progress of the bench, especially on the road. If we can get some progress with those two things, we can be a pretty good team."
Bruce Weber,He's starting to figure out that he can score. He's made some progress to know where he can get and how deep he can get. It's made him more successful.
Bruce Weber,"When we have made some progress, it's when Brian Randle and Rich McBride get involved."
Bruce Weber,One of the problems is we've only played them once the last couple of years. We've lost a little bit of that rivalry. I still think it's a pretty good rivalry. It's a border state. They've been pretty good over the years. I think a lot of people still get excited about Indiana being on the schedule and when that game comes up.
Bruce Weber,"It is a big deal. Dee and James take a lot of pride in it. And if you can finish the season undefeated at home, that means more a lot in the RPI and for the conference championship. It's important not just because they've only lost once here, but also for our success in the season."
Bruce Weber,"Marco has played unbelievable. He's playing with a lot of passion, he's playing like a senior. He's playing very hungry. I think his leadership and his desire has kind of gone down to the younger kids and they're all playing with a lot of tenacity."
Bruce Weber,"My phone kept ringing (Wednesday) last night. I was on the road recruiting. In the end, Ohio State made the baskets they needed to make to get the win."
Bruce Weber,"When we play at Mackey, my (former) neighbors are sitting behind the bench. There will be babysitters there who took care of my kids. It's always going to be a tough situation, but if we win it makes it more rewarding than anything."
Bruce Weber,We didn't understand the high level of intensity and how physical they would play. Everyone made mistakes. I didn't do a good job down the stretch.
Bruce Weber,"I didn't do a great job coaching. Each guy had mistakes. That's what we're going to remember right now. Later on, we'll have the banquet, we'll feel better about it. But right now, it doesn't feel good."
Bruce Weber,They said (the coaches) voted for it. No one looked at the bracket. I don't mind (the semifinal switch). They should have switched (the quarterfinals).
Bruce Weber,It's the NCAA tournament. You play at that magic level.
Bruce Weber,This is why March Madness is so special. You've got the underdogs. You're playing against teams who have been successful in their leagues.
Bruce Weber,"We've had some good luck when we've gone with him at the four. The assistant coaches said, 'They're small so let's go small.' That disrupted some of their flow."
Bruce Weber,He had the game of his life.
Bruce Weber,"We're not great and I've never said we are. But if we play hard and our seniors are great leaders, we can be pretty good. We've won 21 games. It still comes down to the Penn State game. If we win that game, we're (a half-game out of) first place in the Big Ten."
Bruce Weber,"I'm sure he's worn down. A lot of kids are worn down. But it's also a little bit of mental pressure. It's the end of his career, it's the future --playing well for his future as people watch him."
Bruce Weber,"Mike's done a good job. The kids understand what their strengths are, and they execute for the most part."
Bruce Weber,"Matt, he is in a tough situation. He's done an unbelievable job to survive it."
Bruce Weber,"We had a lot to choose from, a lot of guys made improvement. Now we're hoping he has the drive to have a great senior year, continue to improve, and most importantly, stay on track to graduate."
Bruce Weber,"You just have to be so pleased for him, the improvement he's made. People got upset early, he was inconsistent, but he was a rookie in a way (as) a freshman. He had to get a feel of what it was about and get some confidence back. I thought late in the season, he was as consistent as anyone on our team."
Bruce Weber,They're hurt depth-wise. We're catching them --I don't know if it's a vulnerable time --but when there's probably some doubt in their mind. The home crowd might get them going. The key will be if we can get off to a good start and get them to doubt themselves a little bit.
Bruce Weber,"It's over. I told them: 'One, learn from it. It should hurt a little. If it doesn't, we're in trouble. Two, it's a clean slate. It's our fourth season. You did great in non-conference, 14-0, kicked some butt. Conference, you were close but no cigar; you have no one to blame but yourselves (because of the home loss to Penn State). And now we laid an egg. You've got one more chance, and it's how you finish that everyone remembers."
Bruce Weber,"I hope Wisconsin is still doubting a little bit. North Dakota State got them, then Michigan gets them. Who knows? Maybe they lost to Michigan and they'll be mean and hungry and it won't be a good time for us. We'll see."
Bruce Weber,"I hope our team is motivated. If not, it's going to be a quick stay out here. We'll have a better feel (before the game today). If they have energy, if they're anxious to go, that will determine how we play."
Bruce Weber,We'll have to see how it plays out. You'll also end up with a (NCAA tournament) seeding dilemma. You hope you'll all get into the NCAA tournament.
Bruce Weber,"Now you hope for Northwestern to beat Ohio State, and that last game mean something."
Bruce Weber,"I hope Wisconsin is doubting (itself) a little bit. But they might have lost up there, and now they're mean and angry and hungry, and if that's the case, it won't be a good time."
Bruce Weber,I just hope we can get to 33. The Salukis keep winning so we have to keep on their tails. It's great for the program. James (Augustine) and Dee (Brown) have lost one home game. One of their goals is to stay undefeated at home.
Bruce Weber,We are good at closing out on shooters. We work at it very hard. I hope that's a positive. You always say good defense can overcome good offense. We'll see on Sunday if that's true.
Bruce Weber,I attacked it right after the game. I hope I said the right things.
Bruce Weber,Purdue was coming off a bad loss and our kids just thought they were going to win at home.
Bruce Weber,It's hard to separate these two because they've done so much together.
Bruce Weber,He knows he has to break a bad habit.
Bruce Weber,I'm not talking about huge goals. I'm just talking about one game at a time.
Bruce Weber,"It would have been nice, ... We wanted it. It wasn't one of our goals. The thing we did learn was that you have to play the whole 40 minutes. We led for 39 minutes 54 seconds. We didn't defend on the last play. I think it helped us in the Arizona game down the stretch. . . . In the long run, it got us focused again. You watch the film, and it's little things that slipped. All of a sudden they catch up with you, you know. We would have liked to be in the record book, but we still are. It's still a special season."
Bruce Weber,"Come on, we've beaten them four games in a row. We beat them twice this season, beat them last week in their building on Senior Night."
Bruce Weber,We still have a long stretch and a lot of tough games coming up. The season can go a lot of ways. I hope the kids realize that. I hope Dee and James do a great job making sure we're prepared for every game.
Bruce Weber,Rich and Brian and Shaun Pruitt are no longer rookies. They've been in big games. They've been on the road. They've got 20-some games under their belts. That's where we're starting to make progress. They understand what it's about.
Bruce Weber,"We were on a major high after the game at Wisconsin, now we're on a major low. We have to rebound."
Bruce Weber,You saw the game. Write what you saw.
Bruce Weber,"Maybe in the future, if this continues to grow, we can get the players involved."
Bruce Weber,"This has been a crazy trip. It's been a fun couple of days, but our kids have dealt with it and came very focused for the game."
Bruce Weber,"Even in the meeting he didn't say a word, and he's usually making fun of me and cracking jokes. He was quiet before the game. There's no doubt he was nervous."
Bruce Weber,"In the meeting last night, he didn't say a word. He's usually making fun of me."
Bruce Weber,"I like that. If you can't have fun - it's such a long season, you need to have fun along the way. But what I really like is when they know how to turn it on and when to turn it off."
Bruce Weber,"I'm (ticked), to be honest. But what am I going to do? Cry? Whine? Then you guys will make fun of me. So I'll just keep quiet."
Bruce Weber,"You could tell right away. In the team meeting he didn't say a word and he's usually making fun of me, the class clown sitting at the back of the room."
Bruce Weber,"One thing we've learned is that you still have to enjoy it. You have to have fun. But once practice starts, once film starts, once the game starts, you'd better be focused. The coaches are focused and I think our seniors are focused and they aren't going to let anyone slip up."
Bruce Weber,"You don't want to coach against your friends. But once the ball goes up, Matt won't care if I'm on one end and he's on the other. It's just his team against our team. We'll laugh before and laugh after, but in between, we'll battle."
Bruce Weber,"A lot of it is TV. We were disappointed our families and friends don't get to be at tip-off of an NCAA game. You play all these games all year, you earn the right to play in the NCAA, and you're playing before no people. Something's gotta be done about that."
Bruce Weber,"From what we hear, Air Force was one of the last teams in as far as an at-large."
Bruce Weber,"We have a feel for it. But if you were going in blind, it would be a major fear factor. We have three or four tapes (on Air Force). We'll get after it (Sunday) night."
Bruce Weber,"I feel bad for him. That's one of the bad parts of our profession. It affects your family. People have no sympathy. You say it's college, it's amateur basketball, but it's not. It's sad. But we chose to be in the profession, so we have no one to blame but ourselves."
Bruce Weber,He's a good guy. He's a family man and we always enjoyed each other. But he left the Midwest and I elected to stay.
Bruce Weber,I don't want to say never. We'll keep our eyes and ears open.
Bruce Weber,"He has that experience, he's older, he's in better shape, he's really worked at his weights. He actually goes on a treadmill after practice for 15 or 20 minutes to keep his endurance up. He has worked at his game. He's more than just a 3-point shooter now."
Bruce Weber,"Their whole team scares you. They have some experience. They have some guys that have some talent. It's a little bit like Michigan. You're waiting for them to explode. With Minnesota, you don't know when it's going to happen, but it's possible it could any time."
Bruce Weber,It's great tournament experience. I told them afterwards I hope they hurt a little bit. This is a dress rehearsal for the NCAA. The next time we lose we go home and don't get to play again.
Bruce Weber,"A lot of it is having no practice time. Our offense is not good - our timing, our execution of things. We haven't had time to practice. Teams scout and adjust and take away some plays. We haven't been able to add counters."
Bruce Weber,"Sometimes as a coach you worry about preparing and forget about enthusiasm and excitement. We have depended on Dee for the energy and the chest bumping, and he had a little doubt in his head about his performance. He got it back in the second half and then it's contagious."
Bruce Weber,"We need to come home and get a good feeling. We need great energy and great fan energy (tonight) and Sunday against Indiana. It's so key. I hope it's the best medicine, so we can cure a lot of things and have a great finish."
Bruce Weber,I'm not sure we had the greatest energy at the start of the game [against Ohio State]. We just weren't up to the task. We just have to regroup. We have to get some energy.
Bruce Weber,"There's no doubt any kid would love to play. But we needed games early, and now we need some practice time."
Bruce Weber,"Keep doing it, yes, ... It's something that no doubt got us through December, January, maybe into February. . . ."
Bruce Weber,"We're not as flamboyant as last year's team, not an offensive juggernaut. But we play defense and we rebound, and that's got us to 20 wins. I feel this group can be special, too."
Bruce Weber,"They don't have as many weapons. They had an inside threat in Hagen, and Robinson spread the defense outside. Now Grier's a marked man."
Bruce Weber,"Once he starts the offense, he can't stop at the top. He's got to cut through the defense and come off screens. I can put plays in and the play is one or two cuts to get open. But he's got to make plays on his own later in the possession."
Bruce Weber,"Dee has become better and better. He's just doing so much more â€” controlling our offense, spreading out the defense â€” and it's been very effective."
Bruce Weber,"His transition was tremendous. The defense, the pressure, he made some great decisions, some great passes."
Bruce Weber,The key stretch was our defense at the end of the first half. They had a nice lead and we ended with a nice run. And then we stepped up the defense again in the middle of the second half. We limited some of the easier looks and got them to take some tougher shots.
Bruce Weber,One thing that has been constant is our defense. It has carried us early. I hope it continues to carry us until at least Christmas. Motion coaches tell you that you won't be good until after Christmas. I'm crossing my fingers on that one.
Bruce Weber,"Great floor game for Dee. Dee's transition was tremendous. He made some great decisions, some great passes. He got to the hoop (12 points)."
Bruce Weber,He was a late recruit. His dad is an Indiana guy. Matt had a room in the house that was all red with Hoosier stuff. His hope was to go to Indiana. He told us about the room later. We didn't get to see that.
Bruce Weber,"That could be a factor, but we can't control that. It's not affecting us, but it could affect them. Do they rally around their coach? They still have a chance to get into the NCAA tournament, but they need a good finish."
Bruce Weber,"I blame myself a little bit because I've allowed them some freedom. I've tried to give them confidence. I haven't shut them down from shooting some of those shots. Maybe I should have done it earlier, but I was trying to get them feeling good about themselves."
Bruce Weber,I hope this game is a great confidence and momentum builder for us heading into the final stretch of Big Ten play.
Bruce Weber,"Now with the two-game losing streak with us, we're a little bit fragile. Our confidence isn't there. We've got to get some energy going. [The players] have to do it from within. I have to do it. It's a fine line between dragging it out of them, but still not destroying them. It's definitely a test of a coach."
Bruce Weber,"For our team itself, for the confidence, for the momentum, this is a huge win."
Bruce Weber,He could still make some strides with his legs if he really wants to make a commitment. We're going to need him to be big for us next year.
Bruce Weber,"I think they're happy to be here, they're excited. This was a great memory. College is a great time. I just hope they keep coming back."
Bruce Weber,"Watching film, I'm wondering why he's still in college. He's such a talented player. He's a little bit of a Kobe Bryant. He can get you on the pull-up jumper, the three. He can go to the basket. He does so many things, and he's smooth at it. You have to have a sense of urgency against him. If you let down, he's going to get you."
Bruce Weber,"Watching film, I was wondering what he's still doing in college. He's a little bit of a Kobe Bryant."
Bruce Weber,"He's a tremendous legend of our game. Just a tremendous coach, somebody you looked up to when you're coming up in your profession."
Bruce Weber,"If we don't get the trucks rolling down the highway, we don't eat. Everybody suffers. It's in everybody's benefit to keep these trucks moving again."
Bruce Weber,"One thing we do have is confidence. Winning, I believe, is a habit. It's a belief and I believe it's definitely part of our personality as a team. I think they believe in themselves, they have confidence and they believe they should win every game."
Bruce Weber,"At the beginning on media day, I said Iowa was the one because they had the experience."
Bruce Weber,"He will do well. Matt is a very good basketball coach, and he knows the inside and outside of basketball. He also is a good people person and has good energy."
Bruce Weber,It's an amazing list of names associated in Big Ten history. It's a who's who of college basketball. (Augustine) probably doesn't know any of the players. He should be proud. He's part of the elite of college basketball.
Bruce Weber,Indiana State was the last-place team in the Valley. It's college basketball. You have to come ready every game.
Bruce Weber,"It's been one of the best [college basketball seasons] in many, many years, and it's because guys have stayed. Carolina's guys have stayed. Our guys have stayed. Louisville, Oklahoma State, Kansas, Syracuse, you can go right on down the line. That's why college basketball has been so exciting."
Bruce Weber,"It's the end of an era, there's no doubt. That's college basketball. You lose guys. We'll have a little bit of empty-nest syndrome for a while, but you can't do anything about it."
Bruce Weber,"It's been one of the best [college basketball seasons] in many, many years, and it's because guys have stayed, ... Carolina's guys have stayed. Our guys have stayed. Louisville, Oklahoma State, Kansas, Syracuse, you can go right on down the line. That's why college basketball has been so exciting."
Bruce Weber,You always wonder if you can make plays at the end.
Bruce Weber,"I think we did a good job of scheduling for our team. We took advantage of it and maybe won a couple of games that people didn't expect us to win, including myself."
Bruce Weber,It's a tremendous accomplishment. It shows how consistent he's been. He's done it without a lot of flare. He just comes to work and takes care of business.
Bruce Weber,"The record is a great achievement. Every game, he's always there. Now his goal has to be 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds."

John Weber,"We had too many mistakes on offense. We didn't finish off some drives. At times, we ran real hard. And at times, we ran soft."
John Weber,Their quarterback has done a great job and they have two wide receivers that can catch the football. They're a lot like Barron Collier in that they are very balanced. They can run and throw.
John Weber,"It's the best all-around game on both sides of the football that we've played all season. The offensive line got physical and really started to blow people off the football. I've been waiting to see that. Defensively, it was a great effort after their first drive."
John Weber,"I was pleased, but then we got the delay and I didn't think we played with a lot of intensity. But our defense did a good job against a very good football team."
Max Weber,"One can say that three pre-eminent qualities are decisive for the politician: passion, a feeling of responsibility, and a sense of proportion."
Max Weber,"The fate of our times is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the ''disenchantment of the world.'' Precisely the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life either into the transcendental realm of mystic life or into the brotherliness of direct and personal human relations. It is not accidental that our greatest art is intimate and not monumental."

Ben Webster,"As for listening to other recordings - that's just about all that I do. I listen to everyone. First thing when I wake up, I turn my set on."
Ben Webster,I don't listen to my own records a lot. Once in a while - to check out my mistakes. Because you can always see a spot or two in the record where you could have done better. So you more or less study this way.
Ben Webster,"Like every other place, I guess, Kansas City was quite a different city when I was a youngster there. They had quite a few clubs, and we had what we used to call jam sessions every night."

Al Weed,"We need a candidate with vision and ideas focused on the 21st century, not someone who distrusts government and expects us to accept recycled 20-year-old policies."
Kevin Weekes,"He assumed the responsibility to take care of everybody. To make sure everybody is safe is a big responsibility anywhere. In New York City, that's a big task."

Kevin Weekes,"He's a great man, a Toronto man. We have the utmost respect for him."
Kevin Weekes,"It's kind of reassuring because win or lose they'll always be there for you. It's certainly an honor and a privilege, knowing what the minor league hockey arenas and the streets have meant to me here."
Kevin Weekes,It's the city where I was born and raised and played in the minor leagues. It's an honor.
Kevin Weekes,"I always identified with how he is â€” a hard worker, determined, plays hard, practices hard, trains hard. We have a lot in common, and I say that with the utmost respect for him."
Kevin Weekes,"Even when he was sick, you still felt a sense of comfort when he was around. It shows you he not only had a physical presence but a reputation, an aura. I had heard he made it a point to be there on Messier night. Even through the pain and suffering, he was still focused on his responsibilities. It shows character and toughness, too."
Kevin Weekes,"It was just nasty. They certainly feasted on us. If they weren't full after Christmas dinner, they filled up on us."
Kevin Weekes,One thing about coaches and management. They do have freedom of choice.
Kevin Weekes,"The guys really tried to pick me up. We have a lot of character guys on this team and they were very vocal. Heck, they were sacrificing their faces to block shots for me tonight."
John Weeks,"If you ask, 'Is my insurer or HMO likely to pay for the alternative service that I use for the condition for which I use it?' The answer is likely to be 'no,'"

Jack Welch,"Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be."
Jack Welch,Strong managers who make tough decisions to cut jobs provide the only true job security in today's world. Weak managers are the problem. Weak managers destroy jobs.
Jack Welch,If you pick the right people and give them the opportunity to spread their wings and put compensation as a carrier behind it you almost don't have to manage them.
Jack Welch,"If GE's strategy of investment in China is wrong, it represents a loss of a billion dollars, perhaps a couple of billion dollars. If it is right, it is the future of this company for the next century."
Jack Welch,"My main job was developing talent. I was a gardener providing water and other nourishment to our top 750 people. Of course, I had to pull out some weeds, too."

James Welch,"The townspeople outside the reservations had a very superior attitude toward Indians, which was kind of funny, because they weren't very wealthy; they were on the fringes of society themselves."
James Welch,"The title of the poems was The Only Bar in Dixon. We sent it out to The New Yorker on a fluke, and they took them and printed all three in the same issue."
James Welch,"The economic piece is still missing, since it's so hard to attract industry to reservations, but spiritually and educationally, they're doing just fine. Each tribe has a community college now, and they teach the language, they teach the traditions."
James Welch,"Richard Hugo taught me that anyone with a desire to write, an ear for language and a bit of imagination could become a writer. He also, in a way, gave me permission to write about northern Montana."
James Welch,Our literature is in great shape.
James Welch,"Nobody would take checks from Indians, nobody would give them any credit, and nobody would let them drink in the bars. There was a rudeness, a brusqueness, with which the Indians were treated constantly. At a very young age, that had entered my consciousness."
James Welch,"My poems were just kind of all over the place. They had no focus, no location, nothing. Kind of a series of images that could have been set anywhere. A lot of the poems were just exercises for myself."

James Welch,I wrote a lot in study hall to while away the hours.
James Welch,"I wander around, get the lay of the land and try to imagine what kind of people would have lived there in that historical period. What would they eat? What kind of clothing would they wear? How did they shelter themselves? How did they get around?"
James Welch,"I used to object to being called an Indian writer, and would always say I was a writer who happened to be an Indian, and who happened to write about Indians."
James Welch,I think ethnic and regional labels are insulting to writers and really put restrictions on them. People don't think your work is quite as universal.
James Welch,I do believe in the viability of Indian spiritualism.
James Welch,"I did quite a lot of research in France. My wife, who speaks French quite well, and I went back to Marseille three or four times after that."
James Welch,"I am definitely a storyteller, but probably not a traditional Storyteller."
James Welch,"Before, Indian people had been so defeated, they were always looking for outsiders, for the government, to somehow come in and fix things. But now, they seem to realize that they're the only ones who can save themselves."
Raquel Welch,You can't fake listening. It shows.
Raquel Welch,"I'm going into a whole new direction, which I've been wanting to do for so long. I want to be more true to my own voice now."
Raquel Welch,"After the '60s happened -- as great as it was to throw the whole culture on its ear and shake things up -- things became so hedonistic in the '70s and '80s, where everybody was just into pleasing themselves, to such a point that there was just no room for any relationship. Because that would mean you would have to really consider -- and not just be considerate -- all the time, 24 hours a day, someone else and their way of being. That's the totally unselfish thing. And you can't do that when you're walking around with adolescent behavior. I mean, it was fun, but I made so many mistakes that way."
Raquel Welch,"We all have a childhood dream that when there is love, everything goes like silk, but the reality is that marriage requires a lot of compromise."

William Weld,I have absolutely no intention of switching parties under any circumstances ever.
William Weld,"Unlike Senator Helms, I think a proper role for government-and a major achievement-would be to contribute to a sense of community internationally."
Paul Weller,"I still love you, too,"
Paul Weller,I think politicians are so far out of step with what people really want.
Paul Weller,"To me, there's this false veneer of democracy - I suppose we have our say and our votes and all that, but to no avail really. I mean, they made their minds up that they wanted to march into someone else's country, and they're going to do it, with their agendas, and that's that. There were millions of people out on the streets in America and all over the world last year, and it didn't make any difference."
Orson Welles,"Living in the lap of luxury isn't bad, except that you never know when luxury is going to stand up"
Orson Welles,Nobody gets justice. People only get good luck or bad luck.

Orson Welles,as close to a genius as anyone I have ever met.
Orson Welles,Everybody denies I am a genius - but nobody ever called me one!
Orson Welles,I want to give the audience a hint of a scene. No more than that. Give them too much and they won't contribute anything themselves. Give them just a suggestion and you get them working with you. That's what gives the theater meaning: when it becomes a social act.
Orson Welles,"The ideal American type is perfectly expressed by the Protestant, individualist, anti-conformist, and this is the type that is in the process of disappearing. In reality there are few left."
Orson Welles,The director is simply the audience. . . . His job is to preside over accidents.
Orson Welles,The enemy of society is middle class and the enemy of life is middle age.

Charles Wells,She's still not ready. In another three weeks she should be ready to make an appearance.
David Wells,"Instead of trying to make a mess out of the whole situation, I think it's best that you just deal with it. Go in with good thoughts and good goals and try to help this team win a championship."
David Wells,"When you don't have your best stuff, you're trying to hit your spots. I didn't have a good curveball. I just tried to keep the ball down and get ground balls."
David Wells,"Right now, every win is clutch for us. I had a lot of rest, obviously. I just went out there and relaxed and tried to hit my spots. For the most part, I did."
David Wells,"Now that I have had this opportunity to sit down and discuss the issues,"
David Wells,"I'm getting another shot [Thursday] night and then we'll wait 48 hours before I do anything. After the next one, I'll see how it goes."

David Wells,"There's no question in my mind that there's a lot of guys out there still that are probably on them. I mean, they're just playing Russian Roulette."
David Wells,"I'd have a problem with that. If they're going to go four and I'm going to be the odd man out, then that's not going to sit well with me."
David Wells,"I would have never thought I'd make it 25 years in spring training. That's basically for the love of the game. You come out every year, year after year, and do something that you grew up admiring."
David Wells,"That's why I got out in front, having to stop like that. It's not good. You can get hurt like that."
David Wells,We play great at home. We haven't played well on the road.
David Wells,"We're on a high and I think you try to take that into every series, every game, every out and every pitch. We can't worry about who we're playing."
David Wells,The tremendous sales price we achieved on Strawberry Plaza is a testament to the long-term growth and future optimistic economic outlook for retail in the Tampa Bay area.
David Wells,The shadows helped a lot. You take advantage of that and go out and try to have some fun.
David Wells,"It?s always fun to watch him pitch. He?s a good pitcher. I saw what he did to us in 2003. Probably nothing?s changed. He wants the ball, he gets it and goes after them."
David Wells,"They're not going to hurt my feelings as long as they keep it to me and nobody else. Bringing my family and stuff in it, then I'm going to have a problem."
David Wells,"I stunk it up tonight, period. When you don't have it, you don't have it. There's no excuses. I didn't have command, I didn't have my slide-step, and I left balls up in the zone. When you do that, that's what happens."
David Wells,"But he makes the decisions. My thought was there wasn't anyone on base and two were out, give me a chance to get the final out and then maybe we come back and win and I get the decision. As it turned out, we didn't score."
David Wells,"I think the NCAA became sensitive to the criticism in that area, and there's a much greater amount of flexibility today."
David Wells,"Right now, every win is clutch for us. I felt good. My body felt good. Warming up was pretty good. I didn't feel rusty at all."
David Wells,"The money is great, no way am I complaining."
David Wells,The game has changed. What's going on now is nonsense. You have guys complaining about not being paid.
David Wells,"That's me, I'm emotional."
David Wells,I'm not making any excuses. I got my butt kicked in certain games.

David Wells,I'm not going to make any excuses. I just went out and stunk it up tonight.
David Wells,"To pitch a perfect game wearing pinstripes at Yankee Stadium, it's unbelievable. Growing up a Yankee fan, to come out here and make history, it really is a dream come true."
David Wells,"We had a pretty good lead, so why push it."
David Wells,"I'm feeling pretty good right now, but I hope we can just win the whole thing and I can run off into the sunset and say good-bye."
David Wells,"There are guys in the game only because of steroids. They couldn't make it with their natural talent, so they had to enhance themselves. It sucks."
David Wells,"I blame myself more so because I hung a curve. If you want to point a finger, point it at me."
David Wells,"In my whole career, I've never seen this type of race that you had to wait for the last day. There's so many teams that are involved. You've got to smile because we're in it."
Dawn Wells,"What I say is if you've got a talent and God has given you a gift, I think it's kind of your responsibility to try it. Ya know, we can't all dance and sing and paint and have math in our heads. So, wherever you've got that gift I think you should explore it, but my attitude is there's no better time than when you're young."
Dawn Wells,I have a faith in a God that's much bigger than any of this.
Dawn Wells,"As silly as it seems to all of us, it has made a difference in a lot of children?s lives,"
H. G. Wells,"The only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand, and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves on the other."

Ida B. Wells,"The white man's dollar is his god, and to stop this will be to stop outrages in many localities."

Ida B. Wells,"The South is brutalized to a degree not realized by its own inhabitants, and the very foundation of government, law and order, are imperilled."
Ida B. Wells,"The people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare with the press."
Ida B. Wells,The only times an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self-defense.
Ida B. Wells,"The nineteenth century lynching mob cuts off ears, toes, and fingers, strips off flesh, and distributes portions of the body as souvenirs among the crowd."
Ida B. Wells,The negro has suffered far more from the commission of this crime against the women of his race by white men than the white race has ever suffered through his crimes.

John Wells,West Wing. There are certain circumstances where you don't want it to have that gloss.
John Wells,"From the beginning, it (the Firestone property) was visualized as the front yard of the library. It was not intended to be there from the beginning."
John Wells,"The series has celebrated from the beginning in (creator/former executive producer) Aaron (Sorkin)'s conception, the remarkable strength of American democracy.

And we thought that was a really wonderful way to sort of end the series."
John Wells,"The series has celebrated from the beginning ... the remarkable strength of American democracy, and part of that ... is the peaceful passing of power from one leader to another.

Linda Wells,"[That women have developed a preference for large lips reflects changing notions of beauty. Thirty years ago Cheryl Tiegs was the cover girl ideal with her blond hair, blue eyes and relatively thin lips. But the population has become more racially diverse, and ethnic beauties now grace magazine covers.] Once upon a time we used to write a story about minimizing your lips, ... Now that would never happen."
Linda Wells,"They've lost their babies, their hopes, their dreams for their futures,"
Linda Wells,"My heart goes out to them. They've lost their babies, their hopes, their dreams for their futures,"
Linda Wells,Everyone in Hollywood wants to be thin. It is a sign of achievement. And the tabloids keep constant track of who's the thinnest and what the weight watch is and if you gain a few pounds in Hollywood it's suddenly seen as a crisis.
Mike Wells,"We got a little sloppy, especially at the end. The kind of mistakes we made tonight, we just can't afford. We have to play hard and smart for 48 minutes."
Mike Wells,"He's been a good senior leader, just being a good example of how to block on the line. That entire unit is working hard to improve, and Nick's been a huge part of that. He's earning all the recognition he gets, because he's really helping to improve that part of our team."

Mike Wells,We wanted to start bringing the public awareness back up. The drought is not over.
Paul Wellstone,"Bankruptcy has been a safety net not just for low income people, but for middle income people as well, ... It is being shredded. I think all I can say is, we'll just have to see how history judges us."
Paul Wellstone,I think this is really a good example of the commercial calculus and ties taking precedence over everything else. It's sort of like the almighty dollar is triumphing over a lot of other values that we have as a nation.
Paul Wellstone,"behalf of good jobs, a living wage, good healthcare and good education."
Paul Wellstone,The future will not belong to those who sit on the sidelines. Thefuture will not belong to the cynics. The future belongs to those whobelieve in the beauty of their dreams.

Tim Welsh,"My goodness, [the divers have] improved dramatically and they're learning new dives all the time. We think the improvement will continue, and they have plenty of time to do that."
Tim Welsh,"We're not out to compete with the major producers. We'll never be that big, because our market and our goals are different."
Tim Welsh,"They're winners, they're two of the most competitive guys I've ever seen. They have that look in their eyes. They don't say much, they don't complain much ? they just want to win, that's all they care about."
Tim Welsh,"Diving rewards consistency. In the finals, he did the same dives, he just did them better."
Tim Welsh,We knew we had a distinct size advantage.

Eudora Welty,"It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that story books had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming of themselves like grass."
Eudora Welty,A good snapshot stops a moment from running away.
Eudora Welty,A sheltered life can be a daring life as well. For all serious daring starts from within.
Eudora Welty,"Writing a story or a novel is one way of discovering sequence in experience, of stumbling upon cause and effect in the happenings of a writer's own life."

Eudora Welty,Beware of a man with manners.
Eudora Welty,Never think you've seen the last of anything.
Eudora Welty,"To imagine yourself inside another person... is what a storywriter does in every piece of work; it is his first step, and his last too, I suppose."
Eudora Welty,"Writing fiction has developed in me an abiding respect for the unknown in a human lifetime and a sense of where to look for the threads, how to follow, how to connect, find in the thick of the tangle what clear line persists."
Eudora Welty,Writers and travelers are mesmerized alike by knowing of their destinations.
Arsene Wenger,I have got more important things to worry about. We do not even talk about the title. The most important thing I am concerned about is winning our next game.
Arsene Wenger,"Sven is not especially worried about Sol. But I didn't give him anything to worry about because I didn't feel the state of Sol was, for me, worrying. In the short-term I can't use him but for Sven in the longer term I don't think there will be any problem."
Arsene Wenger,"He is OK and he is focused to come back and work out and come back into the team. I don't know where he was, but he sounded fine and I am expecting to see him on Monday or Tuesday."
Arsene Wenger,He's okay and focused to come back and to work hard to get back into the team.

Arsene Wenger,We need good form for the rest of the season and the team is going and is getting better and better every game.
Arsene Wenger,"Sometimes when you have a new responsibility like he has you lose a bit of your main strength, but we need him focussed like he was tonight."
Arsene Wenger,"I'm happy in every department, but the only regret I have is that we could have scored one or two more goals and that means the game is still wide open."
Arsene Wenger,There was a third goal in that game and it is a regret that we didn't get it.
Arsene Wenger,"We have a good game but we need to transform the quality of our game into points and that's what we're missing,"
Arsene Wenger,"We should not have lost. Our side played with a team spirit showing some great quality, but we were punished for a lack of experience and maturity."
Arsene Wenger,I will buy a new goalkeeper but no one else. The most important thing is to develop the quality of the players I already have.
Arsene Wenger,With the youth of our side it was very promising for the club. They have not only shown quality but character as well.
Arsene Wenger,"He is a strong young player and he has good power, pace and skill. Obviously he lacks a little bit of experience but together with Justin Hoyte he will provide good competition for (current first choice right-back) Lauren."
Arsene Wenger,I feel we have a squad with big potential. I'm convinced I'm right to believe in this team and this squad and that they will prove me right.
Arsene Wenger,"It is comparable, this season, and is a good opportunity for us to show we have improved to deal with that kind of thing."
Arsene Wenger,We have a big game on Saturday. It is a good opportunity to do well and we will take on the challenge.
Arsene Wenger,We gave a lot (against Real) on Wednesday night but I feel it was a third great performance from the team in a week.
Arsene Wenger,"We gave absolutely everything, but we lacked a little bit of mental sharpness, maybe because of Tuesday night."
Arsene Wenger,I had a short contact with him last night. He is OK and he is focused to come back and work out and come back into the team.
Arsene Wenger,"I feel the fact that the players make money is good,"
Arsene Wenger,"We have momentum and it's important to keep that going,"
Arsene Wenger,Thierry will make up his mind and when he is ready he will let me know. I don't know if winning the Champions League will be enough.
Arsene Wenger,You could see that was on his mind.
Arsene Wenger,"If we don't get something out of this game, then it will make life very difficult for us. It's a massive game for us as we must get at least a point."
Arsene Wenger,I think they did themselves justice. But we were inexperienced at the start and not really ready to start the game.
Arsene Wenger,"I don't need anything, I just need to go on with my job and say what I want to say,"
Arsene Wenger,The injury looks very serious. It's frustrating and unacceptable because the player had no intention of going for the ball in my opinion.
Arsene Wenger,He is someone who plays on creative instinct.
Arsene Wenger,"When he comes back, he has such hunger."
Arsene Wenger,I don't know when I will see him - next week certainly - but I don't know when. I hope that when he comes back he comes back stronger. There is no reason why he can't be the same player.
Arsene Wenger,For me the intention behind the statement is important. I hope I am right that nothing malicious was planned behind it. I cannot let people say anything without a reaction. I let him get away with it.
Arsene Wenger,It is not the first incident after a game and I hope it is not the last.
Arsene Wenger,I am worried that we have not been getting the right results away from home.
Arsene Wenger,"It was hard work. If we were not resilient and not determined, we would have gone out. You know what to expect when you come here. The sending-off of Diouf did not change the way they played."
Arsene Wenger,Sol is working hard and is getting sharper.
Arsene Wenger,You cannot say that you are happy when you don't win.
Arsene Wenger,"We're scoring goals, we don't concede and that's a good basis to get better."
Arsene Wenger,I'm reasonably pleased but I felt we should have scored more goals.
Arsene Wenger,"Everyone plays the ball over the top and, at the moment, we only concede goals from crosses or balls over the top. I feel we will adapt to that."
Arsene Wenger,I feel we should have won this game by three goals difference. Bolton didn't create anything the whole game and won with one chance and one goal. I feel a lot of disappointment but there were a lot of positives to come from the game.
Arsene Wenger,"Even if we are a bit flat, we can always score goals -- and we know that."
Arsene Wenger,When you miss so many strong players it is good that you score two goals on an away game.
Arsene Wenger,"Even if we are a little bit flat we can always score goals. That's very positive,"
Arsene Wenger,"I feel lucky, in our job, to make 500 games. But I've never been a big fan of looking back. I try to use history to be better tomorrow."
Arsene Wenger,The team was a bit nervy because we have lost a few games recently... When we scored it was a relief and we are not used to this but this victory can give us a new start.
Arsene Wenger,What can I say? We have lost another away game 1-0 and it is happening too often.
Arsene Wenger,"From everyone at Arsenal, we wish Marc well for the future."
Arsene Wenger,"Tonight we played in a restricted way. We didn't play with freedom when we had the ball, but we were in control."
Arsene Wenger,"He never set limits on his conquests and he was a living force who dominated the world. Also he died young (33), which is just like a sportsman or trainer at the top level."
Arsene Wenger,Despite the possession we tried to force the chances...and got away with a 1-0 victory. A fully confident Arsenal would have won by more.
Arsene Wenger,This [Bolton] team was a lot more technical and played better football. Last season we lost the whole season in one day here. At the end of this season this could be seen as a good point.
Arsene Wenger,In all my years in football I had never seen a squirrel on the pitch before.
Arsene Wenger,"We have some games and then we have a break, ... Then we'll think about our options. I love football and what is important is to focus on the game but, if I am attacked, I will respond if I feel it's not right."
Arsene Wenger,"It was everything you want, a disciplined performance and we played very well defensively, played the football we wanted to play. There is still a lot to do but this is a good start. The one regret I have is that I think there was one more goal in this game for us."
Arsene Wenger,"[But will the Vieira cash actually be spent on players? Affirmative.] The money we get from football will stay in football, ... I wanted to buy Baptista because he would have been a real addition to the team. But what I do not want to do is buy a player for the sake of it."
Arsene Wenger,"You can't say it was real football, but they were efficient. We couldn't get into our game. We need to get more muscular."
Arsene Wenger,"I'm focused on football. If I'm attacked, I respond."
Arsene Wenger,I was not happy about it at all. He left his foot in. Anyone who has played football knows when they do not have the ball and he had no chance. He has to be bigger than that.
Arsene Wenger,It was a frustrating match. It was difficult to play football and we couldn't get into our game. Credit to Everton they battled very hard and made a physical combat of it. Once we were 1-0 behind it became difficult.
Arsene Wenger,We face more South American football than Spanish football. We have to dictate an English pace to this game ... but without being caught on the breaks. It will be very important for us to create chances.
Arsene Wenger,"It has crossed my mind to help Emmanuel. He is here to get back to full fitness and find a club,"
Arsene Wenger,"He has not played and he has not been in full training yet. He is only with the fitness coaches at the moment, so he needs at least a week with the team."
Arsene Wenger,"It was a very physical game against a team who were fighting to not go down, with a very, very young Arsenal side. If you look at the average age, it was a very positive game."
Arsene Wenger,"We fear that, that's why we've made an x-ray. We don't have the result of the x-ray yet."
Arsene Wenger,If Thierry is who he is today it is because we have shown faith in him and believe in him.
Arsene Wenger,"We were on the case longer than Chelsea. We monitored him for a couple of years, and emotions are not always rational."
Arsene Wenger,"I feel the game was really never in doubt today because we had a good start, good moment - we missed a few chances but we were always on top of the game, and I never really felt that Charlton had a period that they could come back."
Arsene Wenger,"Overall, the game was never in doubt. It's very important in our situation to get the points."
Arsene Wenger,"[Referring to the supporters' chants of] one more year, ... If there is a referendum there would be no doubt but I have to make the decision and stand up for it. Dennis is 36. He has again shown his class tonight but you cannot base a season on his contribution. We will sit down and talk."
Arsene Wenger,"I am, of course, delighted but there was never any doubt about Sol staying."
Arsene Wenger,"We want to make it our destiny, of course."
Arsene Wenger,"We had great desire, ... We were focused and sharp and kept playing our game, despite everyone saying that we should change after the Chelsea match."
Arsene Wenger,Because it is my desire and because he has a contract.
Arsene Wenger,"He has a contract, it's my desire [Cole stays] and I think he's happy here. I'm 100 per cent certain he will stay and sign a new contract."
Arsene Wenger,When he was out of the game we knew when he came back that he'd have a great desire to play. He finished the goal very well.
Arsene Wenger,I feel psychologically it is important that we go to Stamford Bridge with great desire to come back with points.
Arsene Wenger,"I have no desire to leave,"
Arsene Wenger,"It is always a danger when you have a big game ahead, but there is only one way to prepare well for our Champions League game - and that is to do well tomorrow. Therefore, I feel there is a lot at stake for us tomorrow. It is a massive game for us."
Arsene Wenger,"There is always a danger when you rest regular players during a season. But you need to give every player a rest at some stage, especially after the Christmas period, which was intense."
Arsene Wenger,"I've been disappointed with some of the criticism Jens Lehmann has received this season,"
Arsene Wenger,I really can't remember having as many injuries as this but it is not a crisis. We have enough good players in the team to win the game.
Arsene Wenger,"Usually derbies are 0-0 or completely crazy. In the end it was a cricket score, ... We are back to winning habits in a derby we don't traditionally win."
Arsene Wenger,Usually derbies are 0-0 or completely crazy. In the end it was a cricket score. We are back to winning habits in a derby we don't traditionally win.
Arsene Wenger,What's important for me is that Arsenal are the best team in the country. At the moment we are not. That is the real worry for me.
Arsene Wenger,"I thought for a moment he had lost control of the ball, but it was an amazing try, ... It would have been a fantastic goal."
Arsene Wenger,We became very dangerous and he scored a great goal and after he kept the game under control and then scored a late second goal.
Arsene Wenger,We can focus on the league championship now. We want consistency.
Arsene Wenger,"Robin is improving. We've made big steps with him, he's found his confidence and it's very positive."
Arsene Wenger,It is a miracle we are still in the competition but we are up for this game and I think we will go through.
Arsene Wenger,I am surprised to be the last team from the Premiership in the competition. Nobody expected it.
Arsene Wenger,Coming to Arsenal will give me the opportunity to work with world class players every day and play football at the highest possible level.
Arsene Wenger,"You cannot take class away. Maybe Dennis has lost a little pace, and maybe he needs to play more often than we can give him. But this became his day because he made it so. He scored a great goal and created a second, but he also gave us intelligence and class."
Arsene Wenger,"He's shown again his class. I can understand why he is highly loved here,"
Arsene Wenger,"We're not desperate to buy anybody. But if you find an exceptional player who can add a little class where we need it, we'll do it. He could be one of them."
Arsene Wenger,"It was a goal full of class. Not only that, but fight and determination; that's in every great striker."
Arsene Wenger,It is an incitement to cheat.
Arsene Wenger,"I was worried. We showed a lot of character and resilience tonight. We didn't find our game, in the end with a bit of luck and character we have gone through."
Arsene Wenger,I think we have shown tonight that we are a team with character and resilience.
Arsene Wenger,"I believe that there's something happening in the team. They're growing in confidence. They showed character, to go out there with such a young team and show that resilience, that determined attitude, is something fantastic."
Arsene Wenger,I'm pleased by the quality and character of the team and we kept going to the last minute.
Arsene Wenger,"These young boys are not starting on the red carpet. To start like that and to show that kind of character is needed at Arsenal, because you are always under pressure."
Arsene Wenger,"He had a cut on his eyelid, he has a bloody nose. I don't know if it is broken, we have to check that."
Arsene Wenger,"You know I'm not his best friend but I found that really appalling,"
Arsene Wenger,You know I'm not Ferguson's best friend but I found the booing really appalling.
Arsene Wenger,Martin Jol said he didn't see it (the collision). Frankly I don't believe it that he didn't see it.
Arsene Wenger,"It's difficult to believe we lost. They didn't create the chances, we gave them away."
Arsene Wenger,Maybe they lost their belief but I don't think we would do that as this team is growing together. But it could strengthen our belief if we win.
Arsene Wenger,This team is slowly discovering its potential and is improving its belief and confidence.
Arsene Wenger,"What's good about football is that it's not predictable, ... I feel we have the needed cohesion, the belief and the quality to beat them."
Arsene Wenger,"Walcott has been lively, alert and is playing with belief. He deserves to be involved through his performance rather than the amount of his transfer fee."
Arsene Wenger,They tried all long balls and we were quite comfortable with that. They don't know that we are used to that and get that all the time in England.
Arsene Wenger,"I don't feel he had enough authority on the game,"
Arsene Wenger,I'm pleased when a guy shows professionalism and a winning attitude. You want him to be rewarded.
Arsene Wenger,"I don't look at the passport of people, I look at their quality and their attitude."
Arsene Wenger,We are not far [from an agreement].
Arsene Wenger,"We are close to agreement about another year's contract. It has been his best year for us, even better than the season we went unbeaten."
Arsene Wenger,"He is at an age where he would like three years. If I was in his place, I would as well."
Arsene Wenger,You have to accept when you arrive at the age of 29 it is your last contract and you ask what do I do now? It is healthy.
Arsene Wenger,My advice is to the solicitor more than Ashley Cole. I believe that Ashley is focused on his career and the quality of his games.
Arsene Wenger,"I took legal advice,"
Arsene Wenger,"I find it out of order, disconnected with reality and disrespectful. I will see if I will take any action on that. I leave that door open."
Arsene Wenger,I will see if I take any action. I don't know yet but I will leave that door open. I don't know what I said that was malicious.
Arsene Wenger,"We were a bit lucky tonight. It is a fantastic achievement and the team has great character. We didn't manage to play tonight, I don't know if that was for physical reasons or psychological reasons. We never came into our fluent game â€” we needed luck and resilience and we had both tonight."
Arsene Wenger,We are short at the moment. Ashley Cole will be out for six to eight weeks but Sol Campbell's absence will be shorter than expected. He could be fit for Tuesday.
Pete Wentz,"Texas is always amazing. All the rumors about it are true and the shows are insane. Austin police threatened to arrest us, and we were fined $15,000 dollars for playing Saturday past curfew. Definitely worth it."
Pete Wentz,"[Looking back on what he likes to think of now as his] whine-tasting ... It's a really limited perspective, but I remember at the time it was very, very cathartic. When somebody hangs up on the phone when you're 2,000 miles away from them, you have no recourse. The only reaction there is, is a pen. There's nothing else that you can do."
Pete Wentz,"I feel like we've figured out how to write Fall Out Boy music, but I don't really feel like we've written the definitive Fall Out Boy song yet, where I'm like, 'Wow, that is Fall Out Boy.' So I guess it is continually evolving. But at the same time, it's not growth just for the sake of growth. As you get older and you see the world, your tastes change and hopefully your mind kind of opens."
Pete Wentz,"Emo is over, you can all go home now."
Pete Wentz,"[And Fall Out Boy isn't the notoriously feuding Guns N' Roses.] We're best friends, ... And that's what's most important. They know a healthy Pete is good for Fall Out Boy."
Pete Wentz,"[Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz said part of his band's enthusiasm for the project came from being able to teach a new generation about punk heroes like the band they covered, New York's legendary Gorilla Biscuits.] It's a band that we grew up on and thought was really cool, ... It's definitely influenced Fall Out Boy, so it's definitely cool to be a stepping stone for that band for people to check them out."
Pete Wentz,"If you know me you know how uncool I am. I stutter, wear bad clothes, make bad jokes, make conversation uncomfortable, the list goes on. Thank you for making me feel okay."
Lina Wertmuller,"But she's a woman with the name Ciccone who has an Italian background and was born on the wrong side of the tracks. She doesn't have a great voice but she has great talent, so I was hoping she would have had an idea and not make such a terrible copy."

John Wesley,"When you set yourself on fire, people love to come and see you burn."
John Wesley,"As to matters of dress, I would recommend one never to be first in the fashion nor the last out of it"
John Wesley,"Immediately it stuck into my mind, Leave off preaching. How can you preach to others, who have not faith yourself? I asked Boehler, whether he thought I should leave it off or not. He answered By no means. I asked, But what can I preach? He said, Preach faith till you have it; and then, because you have it, you will preach faith."
John Wesley,Catch on fire with enthusiasm and people will come for miles to watch you burn.
John Wesley,You may be as orthodox as the devil and as wicked

Adam West,"It's important to us. Wetumpka isn't considered a great golf school, but this would be a great way to go out. We've got some young guys who need to keep getting better."
Adam West,I am looking forward to watching the United States compete in the curling and ice hockey events. Curling is a very interesting sport because it's like shuffleboard on ice.
Adam West,"I don't have the exact number, but we didn't lose much in regular competition. The conference, I'm assuming, will be tough as usual. Sandwich, Reed-Custer and Seneca will be very good and tough to beat."
Adam West,"He beat a two-time Class AA state qualifier in Jim Hooker (of Evergreen Park), who was seeded first."
Cornel West,The problem is we need much more moral content.
Cornel West,We had a much deeper sense of community in '67 than we do in '97. This is important to say that not in a nostalgic way because it's not as if '67 was a time when things were so good.
Cornel West,"what is frightening about 1997 is the erosion of the systems of caring and nurturing in America at large, but in particular,black America."
Cornel West,The crisis in black America is threefold...economic...political...and spiritual.
Cornel West,"If we had a whole wave of new leaders in the next five to seven years, black America would be a different place."
David West,The pain is always there. The pain doesn't go away. It's just a matter of me dealing with it and the amount of medication I decide to take that day.
David West,She just threw her heart out.
David West,"Without him, it makes us a little bit more of a half-court basketball team. We're going to have to be able to execute in the half court."
David West,We have grown since then. We are a better basketball team. We play with confidence now.
David West,We didn't take advantage of Steve Nash leaving the game. This team is designed to get up and down the floor with or without him. They exploited mismatches and really attacked us.
Delonte West,"My job is to play basketball. As far as bringing other guys in, that's up to the guys upstairs. I understand that the biggest thing for everyone is to improve this team for next year."
Delonte West,"They kind of stole victory from us. Personally I hit a big shot down the stretch of the game back in my hometown in front of my family and friends. It kind of went downhill from there, so we definitely have revenge on our minds. We want to make a statement."
Delonte West,I guess he had some emotions he wanted to get off his chest. He was just skipping down the Yellow Brick Road in the Wizard of Oz.
Delonte West,We lost our aggressiveness. We came out and thought they were going to roll over and die.
Jerry West,"I am thrilled to be able to stay on, and continue to build a winning franchise for Memphis. The support this city and our fans have shown the Grizzlies made my decision to stay in Memphis an easy one. Memphis deserves a championship team, and I am committed to that goal."

Jerry West,"When it's time for me to walk away from something, I walk away from it. My mind, my body, my conscience tell me that enough is enough."
Jerry West,"To be candid with you, free agency hurts all sports. It's great for athletes making an enormous amount of money. But to say it helps the sports, I don't believe that."
Jerry West,"The support this city and our fans have shown the Grizzlies made my decision to stay in Memphis an easy one. Memphis deserves a championship team, and I am committed to that."
Jerry West,I don't know anything else but the Lakers. This has certainly been more than a job for me as a player. It has certainly meant more to me than just an occupation.
Jerry West,It's discouraging for me to come out there and watch the lack of fan support for a good team.
Jerry West,You can't get much done in life if you only work on the days when you feel good.
Jerry West,"Confidence is a lot of this game or any game. If you don't think you can, you won't."
Joe West,We offered to work for free.
Joe West,"Whether the ball hit him or not, he interfered with Erstad trying to catch the ball, ... I don't think they can see that from the dugout. In fact, I think the only people who can see it are us standing on the line and the first baseman trying to catch the ball. So when I told (Joe Torre) what happened, he was upset, naturally, because it took them out of the inning, but he didn't argue the rule."
Joe West,"The rule states that he has to stay in that running lane during the last half of the distance, which he was not. So whether the ball hit him or not, he interfered with Erstad trying to catch the ball."

Rachel West,"I believe the better employee is the one who will take the risk and sometimes fail rather than the one who never takes a risk or performs above average. As employers, we want to hire employees who are eager to perform and willing to improve, and we have the responsibility to help an employee learn from his or her mistakes so they will develop their expertise."
Rachel West,This certainly demonstrates an employee's willingness and dedication to do whatever it takes to produce the best results.
Rachel West,Effective employees need to be reliable and positive. Our culture supports teamwork. Having a positive attitude and displaying that to co-workers and customers sets the stage for a good outcome.

Timothy West,"You're not allowed to step out of whatever the rules are, politically, or socially, and they'll get you for it, they'll hunt you down. That's the really frightening thing."
Timothy West,"When you're writing about people that are not very well off, you seem to see the kitchen sink. So it was a bit of a sort of cosy phrase that got used a bit too much."
Timothy West,"There'd been a kind of hiccup when all those West End Comedies didn't show entire sections of the community, and that went on far too long."
Timothy West,"The newly decorated theatres produced things like car parks and restaurants, so you could have a good night out, quite cheaply without all that bother of having to go somewhere else."
Timothy West,The foyers now look ridiculously small to us because not all that many people used them.
Timothy West,"The classical writers... playwrights, Jacobean, Elizabethan playwrights, all showed areas of all classes and how they live and painted them pretty authentically."
Timothy West,"That's what plays were about... smart people who did murders, or inherited lots of money or had love affairs or divorces or whatever."
Timothy West,"Suddenly, touring became respectable, and it meant that people didn't feel that they had to travel 250 miles up to London to see a good play."
Timothy West,"Suddenly we saw that you could do plays about real life, and people had been doing them for some time, but they weren't always getting to the audiences. They were performed in little, tiny, theatres."
Timothy West,Plays that had been done in the West End were available for production purposes by repertory. They were mostly light comedies and a lot of thrillers.
Timothy West,"People gradually became more in need of plays, which showed life as it actually was, rather than life as you would like it to be."
Timothy West,No producer should revive a play unless they have a very good reason for it. I think there's quite enough about a good play to make it available to new audiences.
Timothy West,In 1968 the Arts Council managed to get a grant from the treasury to buy up a lot of derelict touring theatres and put them back in the hands of the local authorities.
Timothy West,I'm reluctant to use the word class so much.
Timothy West,I had no money at all when I was a student in the early '50s but I could get into a gallery at the Old Vic for one shilling and sixpence.

Timothy West,I don't believe in right-angled turning points.

Timothy West,"Anybody can decide if they have got the money to fight a case if they don't like a particular thing, and they complain to the watch committee, local council or whatever."

Brian Westbrook,"We don't feel as though we've received a proposal from them that really represents the value that I bring to this team and my market value, ... I think that in the last 2 1/2, 3 years that I've been here, I've brought a lot to this team."
Brian Westbrook,"Once we get the running game going and the passing game going, we're going to be tough to stop."
Brian Westbrook,"If a team is throwing the ball 52, 48 times a game and running it 12 times, if I were a defense, I'd be pinning my ears back,"
Brian Westbrook,"I think it probably will and hopefully the offense gets in a groove running the ball,"
Brian Westbrook,"My agent and the Eagles worked very hard to get this deal done, ... I'm glad to have an opportunity to continue my career in Philadelphia."

Brian Westbrook,"I don't mind doing it. I think I'm a very good offensive weapon, and I think that Dexter Wynn and Reno have been doing a pretty decent job. Hopefully they'll be able to stay back there and keep up the good work."
Brian Westbrook,"I've said it before: I don't think one man ruined this locker room. I can't sit here and say T.O. ruined this locker room, but it had an effect. I don't know how much he distracted us, but part of the issue with Terrell was [that] at some point we weren't always focusing on football. As a team in a competitive sport, you have to be able to do that."
Brian Westbrook,"Me and my agent have told the Eagles' management that we're no longer interested in talking to them as far as the contract situation, ... We don't feel as though we've received a proposal from them that really represents the value that I bring to this team and my market value. I think that in the last 21/2, 3 years that I've been here, I've brought a lot to this team."

Brian Westbrook,"In previous years, we did find ways to win this game."
Brian Westbrook,"I didn't put up yards against anyone but their defense, ... LaMont Jordan doesn't play defense. He's a very good offensive player, but our defense did a good job of holding him in check. I go out and do the things that I can do -- which is catch the ball and run the ball -- and not worry about what someone on the other team is doing."
Brian Westbrook,"I'm glad the Eagles have recognized my talents and dedication to this team, ... Philadelphia is a great football city and a great place to play and we have had a winning tradition on this team that I want to continue to be a part of. The fans are very passionate and have been very supportive of me and this team."
Guido Westerwelle,I don't think that anyone â€” and certainly not peace or de-escalation â€” is served when one trumpets to the world community employing nuclear weapons as an option.
Guido Westerwelle,This is an extraordinarily alarming event when German officials cooperate in such measures. A state of justice cannot allow this.
Guido Westerwelle,This affair stinks to high heaven.
Guido Westerwelle,We want to bolster the rights of the works councils by allowing job alliances at company level. The people we want to weaken are the labor-union officials.
Lezlee Westine,"What's very significant is that it's a comprehensive approach to the competitiveness issue, and he's directly addressing problems."
Lezlee Westine,"TechNet and its member companies applaud President Bush for raising innovation and competitiveness to the top of national policy agenda. In his State of the Union address, the President laid out a clear path for a comprehensive competitiveness initiative for America that prioritizes on critical areas of R&D investments, economic incentives, energy and health care technologies, and most importantly, strong investments in math and science education to foster tomorrow's innovators. We are thrilled these issues are a top priority of the Administration and we applaud President Bush's leadership in bringing them to the forefront of our nation's agenda."
Lezlee Westine,The President has laid out a clear path for a comprehensive innovation agenda that prioritizes critical areas of economic incentives and strong investments in math and science education to foster tomorrow's innovators. TechNet and its member companies look forward to working with both parties to enact policies to create an environment in which innovation can flourish and fuel continued U.S. global economic leadership.
Lezlee Westine,What's really exciting is the bipartisan enthusiasm we see. It's an overall package that addresses concerns looked at in these various reports.
Lezlee Westine,"Obviously, we are thrilled with the treasury secretary's leadership and the Bush Administration's commitment to this. But it's also important to keep it bipartisan."

Paul Weyrich,Politicians often lie.

Paul Weyrich,"Now the truth is, a president really can't control the economy, although his policies do have some effect on it."
Paul Weyrich,Many nations are like rebellious teenagers who try to figure out just how many times they can kick us in the teeth while still taking our money.
Paul Weyrich,Judges were not the biggest issue for most voters in Georgia in 2002.
Paul Weyrich,"It is commonly agreed that children spend more hours per year watching television than in the classroom, and far less in actual conversation with their parents."
Paul Weyrich,"In the past, children learned their values at home, reinforced by organizations such as the Boy Scouts and, of course, their church or synagogue, but in all too many families that is no longer the case."
Paul Weyrich,If a liberal News channel were launched it would fall flat on its face.
Paul Weyrich,"How it is that within 60 days of a general election issue, groups can no longer tell voters that a Member of Congress votes pro-abortion, against guns, against the environment or whatever else is beyond me."

Paul Weyrich,"Despite being able to demonstrate a very large audience, major advertisers at first wouldn't touch Limbaugh."
Paul Weyrich,Cameras in classrooms are no substitute for greater authority by parents and teachers.
Paul Weyrich,"But the threat posed by the radical Islamists represents an unusual conflict, unlike any experienced by our nation before: we face an enemy that is not a state."
Paul Weyrich,"Both on Iraq and the economy, the President ought to be asking his friends in the Congress to pound away on what the opposition has been saying."
Paul Weyrich,Advertisers are very wary of ideological media.
Paul Weyrich,"Absent scandal, a federal judge can serve for decades on the bench, underscoring the importance of appointing judges who have a proper understanding of their constitutional role."
Lindsay Whalen,"I'm trying to get used to playing with it. And not playing four days, I kind of got out of rhythm a little bit."
Lindsay Whalen,"It could be worse, ... I'm already kind of running around and jumping. They kind of said to me `just see how you feel.'"
Lindsay Whalen,"It could be worse, ... I'm already kind of running around and jumping. They kind of said to me, 'Just see how you feel.'"
Lindsay Whalen,"It could be worse, ... I'm already kind of running around and jumping. They kind of said to me 'Just see how you feel.'"
Lindsay Whalen,"I ran the rest of the game, ... It's just a little swollen and a little stiff. It's not painful. It's not horrible pain. Obviously, I played with it in the second half. I was conscious of it, so I could feel something wasn't exactly right. I just played through it. After the game there was some swelling, and then (Sunday and Monday) there was a little more swelling."
Lindsay Whalen,"It will always be a question in everyone's mind, but the fact is I just wasn't healthy."
Lindsay Whalen,"I missed (Game 2) and probably didn't play at full health at any time in the series. But at the same time, not to take anything away from them, they beat us. I don't like to make a whole lot of excuses for the team or for myself. I'm not going to pin the whole series on my leg."
Lindsay Whalen,"That's what you want is a competitive camp. You want to have people fighting for positions. Except for Brooke, we have our core back."
Lindsay Whalen,"Sitting here at halftime, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to go back (home) to a Game 5. I knew we had some work to do in the second half, but I felt really confident. All of a sudden we were down, and then it was like, 'What happened?' It just didn't happen for us."
Lindsay Whalen,I need to take care of my body. I feel better after I have a good meal.
Humpy Wheeler,"I don't think the track will be in the form it currently is the next time we race here (in May). I'm satisfied with what we have for Saturday night, but we'll make some changes before the teams come back next year."
Humpy Wheeler,"That kind of stuff was common back in the old days -- everybody was fighting back then, especially the women. But there wasn't the TV coverage we have today, so it wasn't that big of a deal."
Humpy Wheeler,"You look at common sense you have to say it's coming to Charlotte, but until I hear it, my fingers are still crossed."
Humpy Wheeler,I don't think there's anything wrong with the track. I think there's just an unfortunate set of circumstances that begot this. You can't hang it on Goodyear. I think there's probably been some experimenting down on the pit road.
Humpy Wheeler,I'm not saying there won't be caution flags. But many of them will be based on the intensity of the racing right now and will not be a result of the track surface.
John Wheeler,We are not only observers. We are participators. In some strange sense this is a participatory universe.
John Wheeler,"We live on an island surrounded by a sea of ignorance. As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance."

John Wheeler,It was the defining event and remains a thousand degrees hot.
Lisa Wheeler,"Try to eat like you would at home. So if you do not tend to polish off a three-course meal with a giant hot fudge sundae at home, do not eat one on the plane. I guarantee it is not going to be the best hot fudge sundae you have ever had, so why blow it on a mediocre treat?"
Lisa Wheeler,"We are assaulted in the airport with just about the worst of the worst of fast food. But if you look hard enough, you can eat healthy in the airports,"
Lisa Wheeler,We will be conducting an investigation on the unauthorized burning. We will be relying on the fire department's report and at this point there will be no on-site investigation.
Lisa Wheeler,"When we travel, we cede a lot of control over our schedule, our meals, our workout facilities and so forth, so it is harder to stick to our diet and fitness routine,"
Lisa Wheeler,"When we travel, we have to plan our schedule, meetings, transportation and clothes ahead of time, and we really have to do the same with our fitness regimen."
Lisa Wheeler,"For those travelers lucky enough to fly business or first class, beware of the feeding frenzy."
Lisa Wheeler,Balls are not one size fits all.
Tom Wheeler,"Therefore, we must remind drivers that their primary responsibility is to drive safely and we must educate them on how to recognize when it's appropriate to use a wireless phone, change a CD, or look at a map while driving."
Tom Wheeler,"We distributed samples of these cards to our member companies while the emergency regulations were in force in late 2005. We will distribute these again prior to the heat-season, and we are encouraging our member employers to obtain enough of these training cards to provide to all of their workers."
Tom Wheeler,"Thanks to Discovery, over one million visitors to the National Archives now have a perfect introduction to the depth and diversity of the Archives' holdings. Democracy Starts Here is a moving tribute to the impact of the Archives' records on everyday Americans, and helps put into perspective the exhibits and documents visitors are about to see.

Tom Wheeler,"We're sure frustrated by some of the challenges because we're consumers too,"
Dan Wheldon,"To tell you the truth, it looked very, very bad."
Dan Wheldon,"That's what really got me passionate about American motor sports. Ever since that point, I've kind of aspired to being out here."
Dan Wheldon,"I look forward to the rest of the season, but until it's mathematically impossible for anybody to catch me I'm going to keep trying to do the same."
Dan Wheldon,The biggest thing for me is the self-satisfaction of winning the race. I don't care about who gets the most attention. I've achieved something that's very special to me.
Dan Wheldon,"Tony and I did it to the Penskes earlier in the weekend in practice. If you've got two cars running in line very close to each other, you can pick up speed like that. It felt strange running up there by myself, because I'm used to having Tony or one of my other teammates around. But I had a strong enough engine to hold them off."
Dan Wheldon,"That statistic of most race wins in a season is something pretty special to me. I love the Indianapolis 500, and that's always going to be my favorite race in the world, and it's going to be one of the fondest memories of my life, but that statistic somewhat means as much to a championship for me."
Dan Wheldon,"It is their (the management company's) job to be looking into all of the options for my future and making sure they are right. They certainly did have contact with different teams in different series. That's just part of business, though, ... I'm working on a deal with Andretti Green right now. I'm working on getting something that is fair for both sides. At the same time, if somebody approaches you, you can't just tell them no. You're going to listen to what they say. For me, the most important thing is to be happy and win races."
Dan Wheldon,but I have mixed emotions. I'm happy to be second but I'm also sad to be second.
Dan Wheldon,"Well, it was a win obviously under very difficult circumstances. I think certainly my thoughts and prayers and everybody here, their thoughts are with the Dana family and everybody at Rahal Letterman Racing. It's very difficult to race under circumstances like this. I think everybody in the community and the fans that came out to Homestead-Miami Speedway today should be commended for the effect that they have on the drivers to pull through under very difficult circumstances."
Dan Wheldon,"They will never give me equal treatment because I'm the baby of the team, ... My rental car has probably lost its tires by now."
Deryck Whibley,"Hi, we are Sum 41 and we're just something your parents will never understand"

Deryck Whibley,Green Day was more of the influence than Blink.
Ken Whisenhunt,"You never know when he's going to snap the ball. If you're trying to disguise and he quick-snaps you, you're caught out of place."
Ken Whisenhunt,We're going to take our shots. We're going to put it up. I trust our receivers to make plays.
Ken Whisenhunt,"The running game is always going to be important for us. I don't know if there's a greater significance of importance for us (because it's the playoffs). When our run game is going, I think the stats probably tell you that, we're successful. We do still have to throw the ball. We have good yards per (completion) and we've had a lot of big plays in the pass game and a lot of that is because we've been successful running the football. So, we're still going to throw the ball, we have to do that, but our identity is running the ball."
Ken Whisenhunt,Jerome and Duce have taught Willie patience. They've worked with him on how to read blocks. He's been an accepting pupil. But the one thing you can't teach is his speed.
Ken Whisenhunt,"I had a great visit with Mr. Davis, and I'm grateful for the opportunity. I just realized that I wanted to stay in Pittsburgh."
Ken Whisenhunt,"Logging 15 or 16 games in a row will get them physically and mentally worn out. At the end of the year, you have to be more careful because they reach an information overload."
Ken Whisenhunt,"I believe we can win any game throwing the football. Our identity is running the football and we're going to try to run it, but if a game calls for us to throw the football, I believe we can do that."
Ken Whisenhunt,I don't think he's a guy who enjoys it that much. But he's handled the whole thing well. A lot of that has to do with how he was brought up. Small town. Good family values. He's more interested in hanging with the guys and playing football.
Ken Whisenhunt,Coach and I talked about that at the end of the preseason and he was concerned about where we were from passing game standpoint.
Ken Whisenhunt,"I just saw a lot of character in him today, because he had a couple plays early in the game where he turned the ball over, which was uncharacteristic of him. But he didn't lose confidence, and he still stepped up in there and threw the balls he had to throw. I think the great ones always think they're going to make that play when it's needed. I certainly think he does."
Ken Whisenhunt,"You can't take away his ability to create when he gets out of the pocket,"
James Whistler,"To say to the painter that Nature is to be taken as she is, is to say to the player that he may sit on the piano"

James Whistler,I am not arguing with you - I am telling you.
James Whistler,An artist's career always begins tomorrow.
James Whistler,"You shouldn't say it is not good. You should say, you do not like it; and then, you know, you're perfectly safe."
James Whistler,It would have been called provincial and barbarous; it would have been cited as an incident of low civilization to confuse such art.
James Whistler,"I maintain that two and two would continue to make four, in spite of the whine of the amateur for three, or the cry of the critic for five."
James Whistler,It takes a long time for a man to look like his portrait.
James Whistler,"The rare few, who, early in life have rid themselves of the friendship of the many"

James Whistler,An artist is not paid for his labor but for his vision.
Ed Whitacre,This merger is a logical next step that creates substantial value for customers and stockholders of both AT&T and BellSouth. It will benefit customers through new services and expanded service capabilities.
Ed Whitacre,"If someone wants to transmit a high-quality service with no interruptions and 'guaranteed this, guaranteed that,' they should be willing to pay for that."
Ed Whitacre,"This is a superior management team. They are the best in the industry, and I am confident they will do an outstanding job at this critical time in our company's history,"
Ed Whitacre,"This is the brand that will lead the industry in  delivering the next generation of communications and entertainment services,"
Adam White,"It's a bit of a jump into the unknown. We don't really know what these will sell, but digital technology now lets us make more repertoire available."
Adam White,Might I suggest that you keep the following handy for cut and paste jobs later in the series? ...is run out by Kallis. Kallis plays out another maiden. Kallis steals the strike from the last ball of the over.
Adam White,"It was a tough game all the way through but from the start we knew it was going to be tough,"
Adam White,"If we're going to talk electricity policy, we have to talk about economic and industrial policy too."

Barry White,"As a boy, I believed freedom for America meant freedom for me. There was a time I believed every word spoken."
Barry White,There's people making babies to my music. That's nice.
Barry White,I'm very happy with this new record. It's dealing with different aspects of love-it's me making a statement about people doing something with their lives. It is about caring for others.
Barry White,"I kept my babies fed. I could have dumped them, but I didn't. I decided that whatever trip I was on, they were going with me. You're looking at a real daddy."
Barry White,"I quit high school on my birthday. It was my senior year and I didn't see the point. This was 1962, and I was ready to make music."
Bill White,Do you know what we're voting on?
Bill White,"They want to blame us for disagreeing with them, ... It's a typical ploy. ... The police were the ones who turned this into a mistake. They thought they would embarrass us."
Bill White,"We're good neighbors here. We know this is a U.S. situation here and we're the closest major city so we have tens of thousands of people that will be here,"
Bill White,"We need citizens who may need assistance in evacuating to reach out to friends, family, relatives, neighbors. We need citizens to look at where there are needs in our community for those who may need assistance in evacuating in the storm surge areas and those areas that have been subject to flooding in the 100-year-flood plain and mobile homes,"
Bill White,"We need citizens who may need assistance in evacuations to reach out to friends, family and neighbors, ... There will not be enough government vehicles to go and evacuate everybody in every area."
Bill White,There is no evidence we pose a danger. The evidence is that this other side is a danger.
Bill White,"Use your common sense,"
Bill White,"Use your common sense, ... If you're in a structure that you don't think can withstand wind damage â€” and I can tell you if it's a mobile home, it won't â€” please make your plans and leave."
Bill White,These are a bunch of criminal animals out there.
Byron White,"Sports and other forms of vigorous physical activity provide educational experience which cannot be duplicated in the classroom. They are an uncompromising laboratory in which we must htink and act quickly and efficiently under pressure and then force us to meet our own inadequacies face to face - and do something about them - as nothing else does. In any athletic activity we are thrown upon our own resources to succeed or fail in the face of a strong and immediate challenge. Sports resemble life in a capsule form and the participant quickly learns that his preformance depends upon the development of strength, stammina, self-discipline and a sure and study judgement."
Byron White,"At the heart of the controversy in these cases are those recurring pregnancies that pose no danger whatsoever to the life or health of the mother but are, nevertheless, unwanted for any one or more of a variety of reasons  convenience, family planning, economics, dislike of children, the embarrassment of illegitimacy, etc. ... I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. ... As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court."
Byron White,Maintaining order in the classrooms has never been easy and it is evident that the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.
Byron White,"Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from the failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so."
Byron White,We're the only branch of government that explains itself in writing every time it makes a decision.
Byron White,"The law is constantly based on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalidated under the due process clause, the courts will be very busy indeed."
Byron White,The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution.
Byron White,"The 1st Amendment protects the right to speak, not the right to spend."
Charles White,Monday's CPI number could go a long way toward getting us a better sense of direction. And perhaps what we'll see on Monday is a return back to the normal levels of consumer price index inflation.

Frank White,"If you can get ahead of them and use your breaking ball, you can maybe be OK, but they are a good mistake-hitting team. It seemed like every ball we left up in critical situations, they put good wood on it."
Frank White,"I think he would probably term (his outing) as inconsistent. I don't think he's happy with the (three) walks and the deep counts. But being able to survive and keep the lead, I think he'll settle for that."
Frank White,We've got to get the pitching under control where it can keep us in games.
Frank White,"It's going to be good to get the game back to the way it should be. I think the guys who replaced those guys did the best job they could under the circumstances, but I think it was probably more unfair to the players to have this happen. It's always good when the game comes back to where it should be."
Jake White,"If you don't practice situations beforehand in which you have to defend your lead, you won't necessarily know what to do in match situations."
Jake White,I love it; this whole atmosphere is why you play and coach rugby.
Jake White,"We've got 80 minutes and it could be the best 80 minutes of South Africa's rugby history for a long time. You can't make it any bigger than it is. To win tomorrow you win the Tri-Nations, you win back-to-back Tri-Nations, you go to number one in the world, you beat the All Blacks three times in succession, you can't try to make it any bigger. No South African side has won here (in Dunedin) since 1921. The more you talk about it the more you appreciate just how big this fixture is."
Jake White,This is an interesting choice.
Jake White,If we beat the All Blacks on Saturday it must come close to the achievement of winning a World Cup.
Jake White,"I view that as a tremendous achievement and testimony that the rugby authorities are doing a job in that respect. Apart from broadening our base of young players, we are currently setting the pace at under-19 and under-21 (international) level ? something which we can be extremely proud of."
Jimmy White,"I told him I would have too see about paying him, ... He told me not to worry about it."

Jimmy White,"I made mistake after mistake,"
Jimmy White,"It's funny how the worst of times brings on the best of times,"
Jimmy White,That's a bit of fun but then I shall put in the hard work. Under pressure it's become a struggle and that's something I shall have to sort out.
Joe White,You're not fundamentally limited by the technology itself.
Joe White,It's such a joy to see the joy they get from contributing and helping.
Joe White,"It's not really a radio frequency product. It's what they call inductive coupling, so it's more a magnetic energy transfer to the tag."
Joe White,He didn't put them anyplace that they could be seen by children.
Joe White,"There are buildings that some of your children are in that are older than Joe White. That's unacceptable, those buildings needs to be renovated."

In the process of history, homosexuals have never been castrated, millions of them never died."
Robert White,"Everything we enjoy in society is a direct result of the accumulated learning derived from millions of mistakes. No mistakes, no progress.

Youre growing, learning. And isn't the journey, the experience, not the destination, what life is all about?"
Robert White,"The phrase, Seeing is believing, is often explained as, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. In truth, our minds work in the reverse. An accurate description of human perception is: I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't believed it."

The time will come when you will have to say good-bye to people. You don't know when. It could be tomorrow or next week. Yet, we live as if it will never happen. We get angry with our children or our partner, then leave for the day or longer, forgetting that if something terrible were to befall them, our last words would have been words of resentment and frustration, not love. And we would have to find a way to live with that."
Robert White,"In life, you either have the results you want, or you have reasons to explain why you donÃ†t have them. If you have the results, you donÃ†t need the reasons"

The part of the iceberg that sunk the Titanic, for example, was not the 10 percent above the water; it was the 90 percent below the surface that did the damage.

And we would have to find a way to live with that."
Robert White,"Human beings have an infinite capacity for two things: giving and love. Do you think Mother Teresa ever ran out of love and care to give to the sick and the destitute? At nearly 85 years of age, and with a weak heart, she was still out there giving; traveling and speaking, caring and working as she had been every day since she was a novice. Thats because giving nourishes and replenishes the giver. Taking depletes us and burns us out."
Robert White,"The greatest love of all is happening to me... So goes the popular song. It's a great song. It speaks to the heart, and deeply. It strikes powerfully to uplift the human spirit, at the quest for self-love and self-esteem, the pride in being alive that each of us is entitled to experience simply by being born a human being."
Robert White,"This is about getting the government to move faster in times of emergency and it's about saving lives,"
Robert White,"People who take responsibility for all they create are able to quickly sort truth from fiction in their lives, and in the communication they're receiving from those around them, by using the simple litmus test of â€œbased on results.â€ Wishing and hoping, reasons and excuses will never tell you the truth. If you say you intend to have a happy marriage, have you got one? If you say you want to earn a degree from a good university, have you done it? If you say you want ten million dollars, do you have it? If you don't have what you say you want, then how come? You've either got the results you say you want, or you have reasons to explain why not. Developing a rigorous and honest relationship with results moves you powerfully toward creating your extraordinary life."

We are glad to see resolution."
Robert White,"About the process of growing up .. What follows is tragic. We stop risking for fear of making mistakes, fear of not fitting in, fear of being embarrassed or humiliated by saying the 'wrong' thing. Our instinctive joy and boundless enthusiasm are replaced by playing it safe and looking good. Our spontaneity deserts us, and with it much of our natural creativity. Predictability replaces passion. We learn to reveal very little of who we really are and what we really feel. We sell the richness of our passionate birthright for the security of this burdensome thing called our image. It weighs us down like a suit of medieval armor, restricting our every move, sapping our vitality and aliveness. We wander through life on automatic pilot, controlled by the need to live up to the false image that we invented."
Robert White,"I think Chairman Davis has said he would always prefer that baseball strengthens its own policies and not leave it to Congress to legislate. In the absence of any action, he believes Congress is ready to move forward."

Walt Whitman,"I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you. I loafe and invite my soul, I lean and loafe at my ease... observing a spear of summer grass."
Walt Whitman,I shall use America and democracy as convertible terms
Walt Whitman,"Their manners, speech, dress, friendships, -- the freshness and candor of their physiognomy -- the picturesque looseness of their carriage -- their deathless attachment to freedom -- their aversion to anything indecorous or soft or mean -- the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states -- the fierceness of their roused resentment -- their curiosity and welcome of novelty -- their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy -- their susceptibility to a slight -- the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors -- the fluency of their speech -- their delight in music, a sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul -- their good temper and open-handedness -- the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him -- these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it."
Walt Whitman,"Youth, large, lusty, loving - Youth, full of grace, force, fascination. Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace, force, fascination?"
Walt Whitman,"Do you know that Old Age may come after you with equal grace, force, fascination?"

Walt Whitman,I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.
Walt Whitman,Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturbed.

Walt Whitman,We convince by our presence.
Walt Whitman,"The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity."

John Whittier,"Clothe with life the weak intent, let me be the thing I meant"
John Whittier,One brave deed makes no hero.
John Whittier,"Give fools their gold, and knaves their power; let fortune's bubbles rise and fall; who sows a field, or trains a flower, or plants a tree, is more than all."
John Whittier,"When faith is lost, when honor dies, the man is dead."
John Whittier,"Nothing before, nothing behind; the steps of faith fall on the seeming void and find the rock beneath"
John Whittier,"Somehow, not only for Christmas"
John Whittier,"Before me, even as behind, God is, and all is well."
John Whittier,"The best of a book is not the thought which it contains, but the thought which it suggests; just as the charm of music dwells not in the tones but in the echoes of our hearts."
John Whittier,"They tell me, Lucy, thou art dead, that all of thee we loved and cherished has with thy summer roses perished; and left, as its young beauty fled, an ashen memory in its stead."

John Whittier,The smile of God is victory.

John Whittier,All the windows of my heart I open to the day.
John Whittier,"You don't always win your battles, but it's good to know you fought."
John Whittier,"It is no use trying to sum people up. One must follow hints, not exactly what is said, nor yet entirely what is done."
Kyle Whittingham,No questions asked. Just bring them back and go on your way. I won't even bother to worry about who did it or why.
Kyle Whittingham,"It was a great victory,"
Kyle Whittingham,"He just can't sleep,"
Kyle Whittingham,"I thought Daryl Poston was a bright spot, he obviously has great speed, great quickness. He had ball-security issues last year, but he appears to have those corrected. If he can hang on to the ball and do what he did (Saturday) this fall, then we might have ourselves another 1,000-yard back."
Kyle Whittingham,"It hurts. You don't want to lose players. We'll definitely feel the effects, but team rules and regulations are more important."
Kyle Whittingham,"You can never have enough quality front guys. All you've gotta do is have a couple of years where you're not too good up front to teach you the value of being strong on both lines. It's something we never want to have, a situation here where we are weak up front. That being the case, we probably allot more scholarships up front than other schools for that very reason."
Kyle Whittingham,"We've got to be able to take a game and put it away when we have the opportunity. It's the sign of a young defense. By game four now, we should be starting to grow up a little bit."
Kyle Whittingham,He was doing a nice job. He was making some plays.
Kyle Whittingham,"We have three guys who are ready right now, in my opinion. And one guy that's hurt."
Kyle Whittingham,Players have changes of heart all the time and for whatever reason they decided they want to go in a different direction. . . . For whatever reason they've made the decision to take their game and their education ? whatever the case may be ? elsewhere. I'm not sure if they're going to play anymore or not. It's up to them. I haven't talked to them about that.
Kyle Whittingham,We should have put the game away long before that.
Kyle Whittingham,"It's for disciplinary reasons, and his future with the team will be pending the resolution of his issues."
Kyle Whittingham,"We played about 55 minutes of very good football,"
Kyle Whittingham,"No doubt about it, it was the sweetest victory I've ever been a part of. I could not be prouder of a football team than I am of those guys."
Kyle Whittingham,Thomas and Ryan decided to go in a different direction. We appreciate the contribution they made to the team while they were here and we wish them well.
Kyle Whittingham,"Just about everyone we recruited had a BCS school (scholarship) offer. That was our competition this year. Other than in-state competition with BYU, we had very little competition with Mountain West schools. It was all BCS schools, which is a good thing."
Kyle Whittingham,"We've got to get every athlete in the program bigger, faster and stronger between now and August. We've got to have a heck of a summer conditioning program."
Kyle Whittingham,"Like everyone in America, we're a little thin particularly on the defensive side. So we'll have to limit things on Saturday. We still hope to have a game format with a running clock and so forth. If we hold up we should be able to get that done. If we get a little more banged up we may have to adjust."
Kyle Whittingham,"It's an accomplishment and a lot of these guys on the team have been a part of all of them, ... It's great for the guys and definitely a very positive thing."

Charlotte Whitton,We all have ability. The difference is how we use it.

Hayley Wickenheiser,We did a great job and I am really happy for our team.
Hayley Wickenheiser,We're expecting to go over and win the gold and defend the gold medal. Anything less would be disappointing for us. We know what we have to do. It's just a matter of doing it on the day when it counts the most.
Hayley Wickenheiser,"...is to win the Olympic gold medal this year, that's for sure the biggest one."
Hayley Wickenheiser,"You'd never see that on a men's team with a little baby on the bus who is crying at midnight. All the girls enjoy having him around. It's refreshing if it makes her feel comfortable, we're fine with it."
Hayley Wickenheiser,"We haven't faced a lot of adversity in our own end, but I'm sure they'll be fired up when they hear that comment. They'll be ready to go."

Ranil Wickremesinghe,We have to now ensure there are free and fair elections.
Ranil Wickremesinghe,The economy is the main issue because people are worried about their stomach. I will place economic development before lasting peace.
Ranil Wickremesinghe,"What is at stake is not the provincial council elections, but democracy."
Ranil Wickremesinghe,Now we must ensure a free and fair election. This is a big victory for democracy.
Michelle Wie,"I guess what it boils down to is that the women who are eligible to actually qualify have their own agenda, and trying to get to the 36-hole qualifying probably isn't very high on their list,"
Michelle Wie,"If I had made those two bogeys in a row [last year], it would have been kind of tough because I was really young, ... I'm pretty young now, but I've gotten a lot older and more mature. I have a lot more experience. I know what to expect."
Michelle Wie,"The first time I grabbed a golf club, I knew that I'd do it for the rest of my life."
Michelle Wie,It's not like I invented the World Rankings. All I did was play golf.
Michelle Wie,"Compared to all the disaster, it's such a little amount of money."

Michelle Wie,"Ty Tryon made a lot of money after turning pro, but he might not have been ready. I don't want to make a lot of money for a couple of months and then not be ready."
Michelle Wie,"If someone wants to give you, like, $100 million, it's hard to say no. But I don't want to accept that kind of money right now. I'd feel burdened by it."
Michelle Wie,I'm not really interested in sports psychology. It makes me feel like a crazy person.
Michelle Wie,I'm happy out of my mind. I like beating a lot of people.
Michelle Wie,I think God destined that I play. I think it's all in the books already.
Michelle Wie,"I get bored easily. I like challenges. I've played against men my whole life. I want to play against the best players in the world, men and women."
Michelle Wie,There are so many great players on the men's - and women's - side. Hopefully I can keep improving and eventually play in the Masters.
Michelle Wie,Annika has the type of game I want to work on. She's just so consistent. Hopefully I'll be like that one day.

Michelle Wie,I don't like boys. They're kind of annoying.
Michelle Wie,To play in the men's tournaments I have to keep getting stronger and get more distance.
Michelle Wie,"I'm kind of in between a goody-goody and a rebel. I'm not bad, but I'm not good either. I'm a little crazy."
Michelle Wie,We're all just playing our own game. I don't see it as a rivalry. We're just trying to play our best.
Michelle Wie,You have to make lots of birdies and give your opponent no chance.
Michelle Wie,"I have played in rain before. I have played in wind before. I have played in cold before, but not all put together. They were the hardest conditions I ever played in."

Marcia Wieder,One of your most powerful inner resources is your own creativity.  Be willing to try on something new and play the game full-out.
Marcia Wieder,Willingness is essential in any initiation or in making an dream come true. 'I cant' often means 'I won t.' You can change 'I won t' to 'I will' with willpower.
Marcia Wieder,You can change your beliefs so they empower your dreams and desires. Create a strong belief in yourself and what you want.
Elie Wiesel,Peace is not God's gift to his creatures. It is our gift to each other.
Elie Wiesel,"Writing is not like painting where you add. It is not what you put on the canvas that the reader sees. Writing is more like a sculpture where you remove, you eliminate in order to make the work visible. Even those pages you remove somehow remain."
Elie Wiesel,"That is my major preoccupation /memory, the kingdom of memory. I want to protect and enrich that kingdom, glorify that kingdom and serve it."
Elie Wiesel,I believe that all the survivors are mad. One time or another their madness will explode. You cannot absorb that much madness and not be influenced by it. That is why the children of survivors are so tragic. I see them in school. They don't know how
Elie Wiesel,"When you see the abyss, and we have looked into it, then what? There isn't much room at the edge -- one person, another, not many. If you are there, others cannot be there. If you are there, you become a protective wall. What happens? You become part of t"

Elie Wiesel,"This is the duty of our generation as we enter the twenty-first century -- solidarity with the weak, the persecuted, the lonely, the sick, and those in despair.

Elie Wiesel,"If there is a crisis in the world, the U.N. should send a task force immediately, within 24 hours,"

Elie Wiesel,I write to understand as much as to be understood.

Elie Wiesel,"Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings."

Elie Wiesel,"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference."
Elie Wiesel,"There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest."

Elie Wiesel,"That is my major preoccupation, memory, the kingdom of memory. I want to protect and enrich that kingdom, glorify that kingdom and serve it."

Elie Wiesel,"Because of indifference, one dies before one actually dies."

Mats Wilander,That's the nature of the surface. It's a little slower and the bounce is a bit higher.
Mats Wilander,You make so many mistakes because of the wind. I wouldn't say I'm a good wind player ? nobody is a good wind player ? but I'm an above average wind player.

Oscar Wilde,"If one tells the truth, one is sure sooner or later to be found out"

Oscar Wilde,Time is waste of money.

Oscar Wilde,"He must have a truly romantic nature, for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about."
Oscar Wilde,"One is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalized by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime."
Oscar Wilde,"Only mediocrities progress. An artist revolves in a cycle of masterpieces, the first of which is no less perfect than the last."
Oscar Wilde,"What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress. Without it the world would stagnate, or grow old, or become colorless. By its curiosity Sin increases the experience of the race.

Oscar Wilde,There is no such thing as morality or immorality in thought. There is immoral emotion.

Oscar Wilde,"A man who moralizes is usually a hypocrite, and a woman who moralizes is invariably plain."
Oscar Wilde,Life would be dull without them.
Oscar Wilde,What is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere?
Oscar Wilde,"The Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says."
Oscar Wilde,"For his mourners will be outcast men, and outcasts always mourn."
Oscar Wilde,A misanthrope I can understand - a womanthrope never
Oscar Wilde,The proper basis for marriage is mutual misunderstanding
Oscar Wilde,In old days men had the rack. Now they have the Press.
Oscar Wilde,When a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.

Oscar Wilde,"Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it, but moulds it to its purpose. The nineteenth century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac."
Oscar Wilde,"The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation, not instruction, is the aim of conversation, and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company."
Oscar Wilde,"As one knows the poet by his fine music, so one can recognize the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance, and in neither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice. Here, as elsewhere, practice must precede perfection."
Oscar Wilde,When liberty comes with hands dabbled in blood it is hard to shake hands with her.
Oscar Wilde,Cultivated leisure is the aim of man.
Oscar Wilde,"The mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value."
Oscar Wilde,A kiss may ruin a human life.
Oscar Wilde,The way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test Reality we must see it on the tight-rope. When the Verities become acrobats we can judge them.

Oscar Wilde,"Imagination is a quality given a man to compensate him for what he is not, and a sense of humor was provided to console him for what he is."
Oscar Wilde,"The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes. Change is the one quality we can predicate of it. The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and not on its growth and development. The error of Louis XIV was that he thought human nature would always be the same. The result of his error was the French Revolution. It was an admirable result."
Oscar Wilde,It is because Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way.
Oscar Wilde,The brotherhood of man is not a mere poet's dream: it is a most depressing and humiliating reality.
Oscar Wilde,"The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast."

Oscar Wilde,"Whenever cannibals are on the brink of starvation, Heaven, in its infinite mercy, sends them a nice plump missionary"
Oscar Wilde,The heart was made to be broken

Oscar Wilde,Gossip is charming! History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.
Oscar Wilde,Scandal is gossip made tedious by morality

Oscar Wilde,"When they reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress. Quick, quick, cried the Ghost, or it will be too late, and, in a moment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty."
Oscar Wilde,I live in fear of not being misunderstood
Oscar Wilde,"Yet each man kills the thing he loves, By each let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword!"
Oscar Wilde,There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.
Oscar Wilde,The American father is never seen in London. He passes his life entirely in Wall Street and communicates with his family once a month by means of a telegram in cipher.
Oscar Wilde,Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern; one is apt to grow old fashioned quite suddenly.
Oscar Wilde,Woman's first duty in life is to her dressmaker. What the second duty is no one has yet discovered.
Oscar Wilde,"Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment the universal."
Oscar Wilde,It is only the modern that ever becomes old fashioned.
Oscar Wilde,I can believe anything provided it is incredible.
Oscar Wilde,"What a fuss people make about fidelity! Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say."
Oscar Wilde,Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.
Oscar Wilde,"Misfortunes one can endure -- they come from outside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one's own faults -- Ah! there is the sting of life."
Oscar Wilde,"We Irish are too poetical to be poets; we are a nation of brilliant failures, but we are the greatest talkers since the Greeks."

Oscar Wilde,The only difference between saints and sinners is that every saint has a past while every sinner has a future.
Oscar Wilde,"The great things in life are what they seem to be. And for that reason, strange as it may sound to you, often are very difficult to interpret (understand). Great passion are for the great of souls. Great events can only be seen by people who are on a level with them. We think we can have our visions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing visions have to paid for. Strangely enough, that is what makes them fine."
Oscar Wilde,No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.
Oscar Wilde,I love acting. It is so much more real than life.

Oscar Wilde,"In the wild struggle for existance, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place."

Oscar Wilde,I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly.
Oscar Wilde,I have nothing to declare except my genius.

Oscar Wilde,Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.
Oscar Wilde,The first duty of life is to be as artificial as possible. What the second duty is no one as yet discovered.

Oscar Wilde,It is he who has broken the bond of marriage -- not I. I only break its bondage.

Oscar Wilde,"Better the rule of One, whom all obey, than to let clamorous demagogues betray our freedom with the kiss of anarchy."
Oscar Wilde,"I have met a lot of hardboiled eggs in my time, but you're twenty minutes."
Oscar Wilde,There is no such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that.
Oscar Wilde,"Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her. Misery wakes us in the morning and Shame sits with us at night."
Oscar Wilde,Why was I born with such contemporaries?
Oscar Wilde,"There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it."

Oscar Wilde,"Life is never fair, and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not."

Oscar Wilde,A man who pays his bills on time is soon forgotten
Oscar Wilde,"Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven't the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die"
Oscar Wilde,"And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, none knew so well as I: for he who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die."
Oscar Wilde,A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.
Oscar Wilde,"No man dies for what he knows to be true. Men die for what they want to be true, for what some terror in their hearts tells them is not true."
Oscar Wilde,"People who love only once in their lives are. . . shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination."
Oscar Wilde,Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.
Oscar Wilde,It is a dangerous thing to reform anyone.
Oscar Wilde,"A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal."
Oscar Wilde,All great ideas are dangerous.
Oscar Wilde,An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.
Oscar Wilde,What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
Oscar Wilde,"The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything.  Except what is worth knowing.  Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands."
Oscar Wilde,"The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing"
Oscar Wilde,It is a curious fact that people are never so trivial as when they take themselves seriously.
Oscar Wilde,"Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic -- a temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and to the various impressions that beauty gives us."
Oscar Wilde,"That is what the highest criticism really is, the record of one's own soul. It is more fascinating than history, as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is more delightful than philosophy, as its subject is concrete and not abstract, real and not vague. It is the only civilized form of autobiography."
Oscar Wilde,On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure.
Oscar Wilde,No publisher should ever express an opinion on the value of what he publishes. That is a matter entirely for the literary critic to decide. I can quite understand how any ordinary critic would be strongly prejudiced against a work that was accompanied by a premature and unnecessary panegyric from the publisher. A publisher is simply a useful middle-man. It is not for him to anticipate the verdict of criticism.
Oscar Wilde,"The true critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotional impulse obscure."
Oscar Wilde,It (cricket) requires one to assume such indecent postures
Oscar Wilde,To elope is cowardly; it is running away from danger; and danger has become so rare in modern life
Oscar Wilde,"We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to."
Oscar Wilde,"Do you really think it is weakness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there are terrible temptations which it requires strength, strength and courage to yield to."
Oscar Wilde,"If a man needs an elaborate tombstone in order to remain in the memory of his country, it is clear that his living at all was an act of absolute superfluity."
Oscar Wilde,"Talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact."
Oscar Wilde,"When people talk to me about the weather, I always feel they mean something else."
Oscar Wilde,"The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation, not instruction, is the aim of conversation, and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company"
Oscar Wilde,Conversation about the weather is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
Oscar Wilde,"A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."
Oscar Wilde,Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
Oscar Wilde,The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to lifethat nothing else can bring.
Oscar Wilde,"The great events of life often leave one unmoved; they pass out of consciousness, and, when one thinks of them, become unreal. Even the scarlet flowers of passion seem to grow in the same meadow as the poppies of oblivion."
Oscar Wilde,Conscience makes egotists of us all.
Oscar Wilde,There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a Nonconformist conscience.
Oscar Wilde,Conscience and cowardice are really the same things. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.
Oscar Wilde,A red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red rose. It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses.
Oscar Wilde,I don't at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back. It makes me far too conceited.
Oscar Wilde,"Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up, that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments. They're the only things we can pay."
Oscar Wilde,"I don't like compliments, and I don't see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn't mean"
Oscar Wilde,Women are never disarmed by compliments. Men always are. That is the difference between the sexes.
Oscar Wilde,"Its failings notwithstanding, there is much to be said in favor of journalism in that by giving us the opinion of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community."
Oscar Wilde,"There is much to be said in favour of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community."
Oscar Wilde,"Public Opinion... an attempt to organize the ignorance of the community, and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force."
Oscar Wilde,"In spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union, and the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisect, in spite of Keble College, and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one."
Oscar Wilde,"The exquisite art of idleness, one of the most important things that any University can teach."
Oscar Wilde,"Society produces rogues, and education makes one rogue cleverer than another."
Oscar Wilde,"How clever you are, my dear! You never mean a single word you say."
Oscar Wilde,"Judges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter moments"
Oscar Wilde,"There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating; people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing."
Oscar Wilde,"There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else."
Oscar Wilde,"Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them.  That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary."
Oscar Wilde,"Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility."
Oscar Wilde,"Each class preaches the importance of those virtues it need not exercise. The rich harp on the value of thrift, the idle grow eloquent over the dignity of labor."
Oscar Wilde,"If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilized."
Oscar Wilde,"Civilisation is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt."
Oscar Wilde,Comfort is the only thing our civilization can give us.
Oscar Wilde,"Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt."
Oscar Wilde,She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.
Oscar Wilde,"All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled. It is the secret of their attraction."
Oscar Wilde,The one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.
Oscar Wilde,"Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow. Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating."
Oscar Wilde,"While to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free, to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all"
Oscar Wilde,Charity creates a multitude of sins.
Oscar Wilde,"Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity! None of us are perfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts."
Oscar Wilde,It is only the superficial qualities that last. Man's deeper nature is soon found out.
Oscar Wilde,Women have a wonderful instinct about things. They can discover everything except the obvious.
Oscar Wilde,"Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself."
Oscar Wilde,He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realise.

Oscar Wilde,The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.
Oscar Wilde,The books that the world calls immoral are the books that show the world its own shame.

Oscar Wilde,The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.
Oscar Wilde,"If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all."
Oscar Wilde,"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all."
Oscar Wilde,Sins of the flesh are nothing. Sins of the soul are shameful.
Oscar Wilde,There are three kinds of despots. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the body. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the soul. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the soul and body alike. The first is called the Prince. The second is called the Pope. The third is called the People.

Oscar Wilde,"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.

Oscar Wilde,"Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment."
Oscar Wilde,"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming pe"

If it was only the other way! If it was I who were to be always young, and the picture that were to grow old! For this--for this--I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!"
Oscar Wilde,"My experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better, they don't know anything at all."
Oscar Wilde,"He to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives."
Oscar Wilde,Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one must have wealth.

Lawrence Wilkerson,What he seems to be saying to me now is the president failed to discipline the process the way he should have and that the president is ultimately responsible for this whole mess.

Jonny Wilkinson,very much out of his control.
Emma Willard,There are many females of ability to whom the business of instructing children is highly acceptable; and who would devote all their faculties to their occupation. For they would have no higher pecuniary object to engage their attention; and their reputation as instructors they would consider as important.

When the U.S. Department of Agriculture released their new food pyramid in April, many critics cheered that, at last, better guidance was being given to consumers on making healthy food choices.

Walter Willett,It would be a huge misinterpretation to believe that it doesn't matter what we eat to prevent heart disease and cancer.
Walter Willett,"It was a mistake, and this study really confirms that it was the wrong direction to go for nutritional advice. It did do harm. It was a lost opportunity. People were given the idea that it was only fat calories that counted. This should be the nail in the coffin for low-fat diets."

Prince William,"Harry can paint but I can't. He has our father's talent while I, on the other hand, am about the biggest idiot on a piece of canvas.

Prince William,"Only the mad girls chase me, I think."
Prince William,"The party is on my birthday, June 21 - my 21st on the 21st, which is Midsummer's Day, the longest day of the year and the longest night for a lot of people who are helping to organize it. My father very kindly suggested having a party, although he's probably regretting it now."

Andy Williams,"The best part about it is he's super self-conscious, and we had to do a follow-up call to tell him he was awesome. To this day he still wants to come to shows. He thinks he was a part of something awesome, and that's great. It's flattering."
Andy Williams,I've discovered that there's another way of living that I have never known. Things have changed.

Bernie Williams,"Every year, we go through challenges. With my dad, it was what I was going through. As a professional player, you have to rise above, you can't use it as an excuse. It was definitely on my mind, but I wouldn't put it as a reason. I just didn't hit."
Bernie Williams,"I'll have to use a lot of caution. Hopefully, the situation will not come."

Bob Williams,"I see him in two to three years being over $100 million annually in endorsements, ... There are still some major categories, he's not in: soft drinks, telecommunications, fast food.

Eric Williams,We knew Rapid Response met a critical need of public safety agencies across the country because of the clear benefits this solution provides emergency response personnel.

Gary Williams,I'm very proud of our team. We did a great job in just about every situation.
Gary Williams,"I know I've worked hard, and I know the players have worked hard this year. We've had to overcome some things, and I hope that's good enough. We're going to be just like everybody else: we're going to wait and see what happens Sunday. That's all we can do."
Gary Williams,"We knew it was going to be a tough game, even when we got up 18 in the second half. For us to hang on like that and win, that was big."

Gary Williams,"The truckers get notoriety, ... Eighty-thousand pounds of muscle, blood and steel in a pile. It's spectacular."
Gary Williams,"I thought he needed another year because he was limited offensively. Just another year of basketball at the college level wouldn't have hurt him. (But) once we found out he was going to be a lottery pick, then for a player, you almost have to go. There really wasn't much of a decision there. For Chris, maybe that was his best time to go."
Gary Williams,"As a college basketball coach, I'm upset for the future of game. Somebody has to be accountable. You can't blame just one group of people for this, unfortunately."
George C. Williams,"The only realistic view is that a human life arises gradually, which is not much help in making personal decisions or devising public policy."

George C. Williams,"Most evolving lineages, human or otherwise, when threatened with extinction, don't do anything special to avoid it."
George C. Williams,"Job's avoidance of rebellion against God has nothing to do with God being good or wise or anything like that; it's strictly because God is so powerful, and you don't fight something when you are so much weaker than that which you would fight."
George C. Williams,"I think that my main criticism in that book was directed at the general assumption that adaptation characterizes populations and species, rather than simply the individuals in the populations and species."
George C. Williams,I am convinced that it is the light and the way.
George C. Williams,"Ever since then, all descendant vertebrates have had the forward end of the digestive system and the forward end of the respiratory system very much involved with each other. This manifests itself in the human body with a crossing of the two systems in the throat."
George C. Williams,"Darwin based his theory on generalizations that were strictly empirical. You can go out and see that organisms do vary, that variations are inherited, and that every organism is capable of increasing its numbers in sufficiently favorable circumstances."
Greg Williams,"It's just one game. I would've loved to come away with a victory, but we missed too many free throws and open shots for that to happen. That will come, though."
Greg Williams,"Utilities used to provide reliable service in return for higher rates, ... But with the restructuring of the industry, it moved from almost a 100 percent emphasis on reliability to a greater emphasis on economy -- on cheaper rates."
Greg Williams,"Sales of our analog products are being impacted by continued softness in the channel. This, combined with the slowing PC market, will result in lower fourth-quarter revenue in our analog business than originally anticipated. We expect that the growth in our other businesses will remain on track during the quarter,"
Greg Williams,"Drew was living on the edge in a couple of innings during the game. But he stayed around the plate and let the defense play behind him, and that's all we could ask."
Greg Williams,"The hunt seat riders rode extremely well. We had new riders that performed well and there is no doubt that they had the momentum. There were some girls that we were unsure on how they would perform, but they pulled through. It was more of a pleasant reassurance than anything."
Greg Williams,I don't sense any real tension in terms of direction. They are all pretty much aligned.
Greg Williams,All the seniors will be competing and they are great leaders. We will miss their riding and their consistency.
Greg Williams,"For two years, UT fans called our show complaining that Mack can't win the big game. Now they're comparing him to Darrell Royal."
Greg Williams,"He was pretty much a victim of my lack of success. He has an extremely intelligent basketball mind. He's constantly studying the game, and he never has let the game bypass him in any way."
Greg Williams,"Andrew was really in control from the beginning. I tell our pitchers, the best pitch in baseball is strike one. I haven't had a chance to look, but I think Andrew was 0-1 on a lot of batters in the game."
Greg Williams,It was good to see Steve Reynolds and Brian Snider back in action. You saw how we threw them into the fire in that second game and they responded.
Hank Williams,"We make our own whiskey and our own smoke, too. Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do."
Hank Williams,"I've been around a long time, and life still has a whole lot of surprises for me."
Hank Williams,Thank you for all the love you gave me. There could be no one stronger. Thank you for the many beautiful songs. They will live long and longer.

Heather Williams,Revolve your world around the customer and more customers will revolve around you.
Heather Williams,I think it's free speech and I'm pro-choice. They have the right to put the ads up and have their viewpoint out there.

Jason Williams,"He sort of put the responsibility on myself to come into camp and earn a spot, and that's what I'm looking forward to doing,"
Jason Williams,"I've been praying it won't go to trial. But sometimes reality sets in, and I realize that a dismissal is probably not going to happen."
Jason Williams,"UAB came out pressing us, and we spent a lot of time in practice on our press breaker. The first time we took care of the basketball. That's what we have to do this time."
Jason Williams,"As it stands, I have fired four rounds, killed four squirrels and been visited by four police officers. The first time, they SWAT-deployed. This is silly."
Jason Williams,"It seems like now we're giving them both things. In our league I don't think you can take away everything. You got to give up something, so we just got to take away whatever's working for them that evening."
Jason Williams,It seems every game we're playing against teams battling for that last playoff spot and those are good games for us to get ready for playoff hockey. We want to get it into their heads that they're not going to beat us in the playoffs.
Jason Williams,"I'm going to do my best and let the chips fall, ... I can only control what I can do on the ice."
Jason Williams,I'm not letting him write anything. I didn't do anything. I just took his pen.
Jason Williams,"I think that the opportunity to be a kid another year and not have to not worry about the responsibilities of paying bills, and worry about getting an agent and worry about getting an accountant was important."
Jason Williams,"Everybody says that it takes a loss to lose and I think it did take a loss for us to lose in a sense. But overall, when we win games here at Duke, and we don't play well, we might as well have lost the game."
Jason Williams,"We play fair and we play hard. If we win the game we win, if we lose the game, we lose."
Jay Williams,"People who love sports should have a place where they can get all they want. Of course we all could do with out the false rumors, but it really is harmless for the most part."
Jay Williams,I know Jerry Krause is loving it. Because now I can save all my energy for the real season.
Jay Williams,It was excellent insight into the history of Apache culture.

Jennifer Williams,Love is smiling on the inside and out.
Jennifer Williams,I'm looking forward to it. You go home smelling awful every night. I wash all my smoky clothes separate from the rest of my clothes.
Jimmy Williams,"To tell you the truth, we didn't know he missed it until their crowd started cheering."

Jimmy Williams,"One of our focuses is learning how the components were obtained and the devices made,"
Jimmy Williams,"Our players are young, and they're hungry. It's bigger than just football around here. I mean, it's football, but it's really, really bigger than that."

John Williams,"A woman only has won once in 25 years. She's good and beaten all these guys, but it depends on all of the games."

John Williams,"We are looking at home and abroad for players, but that's not a name I've heard mentioned."
John Williams,"As I told one parent, we appreciate the generosity, but every drop of fuel that we put in a bus is fuel that could have gone in an ambulance or emergency vehicle trying to help the relief effort. Now, as we look at the news in the newspaper and on television of what's going on, to imagine an ambulance trying to help those people might run out of fuel because we're running the chess team over to Colleton County, well, to us it highlights some priorities."
John Williams,"The problem for the U.S. is that the economy is growing faster than the rest of the world, and, therefore, our demand for imports far exceeds the demand for our exports by other countries."
John Williams,"It was a combination of a lot of things: concerns about emerging markets, a drop in consumer confidence, and the expectation that the Fed is still tilting toward an easing."
John Williams,"I can laugh about it, but it's been very hard. One collection company was getting ready to put a lien on my house, but I was able to get that stopped. It's been a real battle."

Joseph Williams,"I remember the feeling over there the guys and I had, listening to the demonstrators over here. All we wanted to do was come back and kick their butts."
Joseph Williams,"I remember the feeling over there the guys and I had, listening to the demonstrators over here, ... All we wanted to do was come back and kick their butts."
Joseph Williams,"What will really help us out is the heavy rain they are predicting this weekend. [Thursday's fire] was a difficult fire because it broke off in three different directions and it was so dry, it moved very rapidly."
Joseph Williams,"The fire actually, because of the wind, split into three major directions. At one point, it jumped Long Island Avenue, but mostly, though, it was contained [in the brush]."
Joseph Williams,"We didn't say anything about it until they started mouthing off over there. The boys didn't like that, and I didn't either. That was the mistake they made."
Kenneth Williams,"They're going to open an emergency shelter at the Pentecostal campground (this) afternoon, after we satisfy some security concerns. That facility will be able to house about 320 people. The dormitory rooms have beds and phones, and there are also shower facilities available."

Kenneth Williams,"I feel in this regard, Congress has personally failed me, as an FBI special agent and as an American."
Kenneth Williams,We've had offers for housing of evacuees be it permanent housing or temporary housing... the community has poured out a lot of offers for housing. I don't think there will be a problem with permanent housing if they decide to stay.
Kenneth Williams,"We know grooming is important for people. To get their hair done, to get makeup and things like that - that makes a person feel better."
Kenneth Williams,"People need to be peppered or even outraged occasionally. Our national comedy and drama is packed with earthy familiarity and honest vulgarity. Clean vulgarity can be very shocking and that, in my view, gives greater involvement."
Kenneth Williams,"I see myself as a roving mosquito, choosing it's target."

Kit Williams,"This thing would pay for itself to the city over time. This will generate new sales tax. I don't think anything would have happened on that site. It would have sat there and decayed without the help the city has provided through this redevelopment district. If the project would have worked without the city investing $3 million, then that site would have been developed a long time ago."
Kit Williams,"The city had probably made some inadvertent technical mistakes in computing overtime, ... The city had paid firefighters about what the Fair Labor Standards Act would have mandated, but we paid EMT pay, Hazmat pay and longevity pay as a specific amount every pay period rather than including it as a pay component for overtime pay computation."
Kit Williams,"The state law has basically no effect on city ordinances, which remain in effect as long as they are more strict than the state law. A city ordinance doesn't overrule state law. A city ordinance can't make things less strict than state law."
Kit Williams,"You see, my ambition was not to confound the engineering world but simply to create a beautiful piece of art."
Kit Williams,The reason the ancient Chinese chose south is probably because north was inauspicious to them. That was where the marauding hordes came from.
Kit Williams,The rabbit is significant in that the handle on the original South Pointing Chariot was carved in the form of a rabbit. Because the handle extended out front it meant that wherever the rabbit went the chariot had to follow.
Kit Williams,The original item looked like a little hand cart with the figure of a man mounted on a platform between the wheels. The man's outstretched arm always pointed south.
Kit Williams,"The hoop is there to remind us not to jump through it, not to submit to someone else's control."

Kit Williams,"In practical terms the South Pointing Chariot was a simple direction finder. It could have been made to point in any direction - north, south, east or west."
Kit Williams,"If you look closely you can see that they are all interconnected, symbolic of a never-ending circle in which it is simply impossible for the dog to catch the rabbit."
Kit Williams,"If we listen human instinct actually tells us what we need, but advertising makes us want things we don't need and things we can't have."
Kit Williams,"I took lots of photographs and had planned to write a treatise on how it worked, but I quickly got bored with that idea and wrote a scientific fairy tale instead."
Kit Williams,"I think most artists find it difficult to part with their work but it's the parting that keeps us alive and keeps us working. In the case of the chariot, although it's been sold I actually still have it, just in another form."
Kit Williams,"I started by looking at what others had done before me. You see, over the years there have been attempts by many different people to reconstruct the chariot."
Kit Williams,"I made every single piece myself, each individual component, so it was quite time consuming."
Kit Williams,"He was so tenacious he defied the distraction of women by refusing to have them in his presence, just as later in life he denied his blindness by calling for more and more candles."
Kit Williams,Having designed and built several clocks during my career it suddenly occurred to me that when you look at the face of a clock both hands have the same center.
Kit Williams,"As I was working I noticed that the way I designed the differential gearing actually created a spare drive that sat directly below the emperor's feet, or where they would be if he were to sit in the chariot."

Larry Williams,We're excited about this opportunity.
Larry Williams,"I have to give credit to a lot of hard work by quality staff members who are truly interested in students and learning, ... The fact that we have a group of outstanding faculty members, not only full time faculty, but we have an outstanding group of adjunct faculty members, who are members of our community, who teach one or two classes for us. Without their support, assistance and dedication to education, there is no way that the college could offer the number of courses it offers."
Larry Williams,The most common bad habit I have seen in traders - good and bad ones - is the inability to react correctly to market action.
Larry Williams,This is an area where we see growth.

Larry Williams,"My argument to you is that this is not new construction. This is reconstruction. We can talk about how much of the building we leave so we can qualify for reconstruction, but the truth is, there is no definition we know of that says when a reconstruction becomes new construction."
Larry Williams,It's our job as economic developers in the state to make sure any prospect receives all available incentives.
Larry Williams,What you will be looking for is a day that closes above the prior day's high and most likely 'breaks' out to the upside to close above a trading range. This is the twitching worm that causes the public to leap before they look.
Larry Williams,"The next time you see an outside day with a down close lower than the previous day, don't get scared, get ready to buy!"
Larry Williams,Rock and Roll has no beginning and no end for it is the very pulse of life itself.

Lauryn Williams,It's going to be an exciting race. I know she's training hard. That's the sort of person she is.
Lauryn Williams,If I get a start like that (in the final) god knows what will happen.
Lauryn Williams,I had a great time and those kids gave me a real feel for the Russian community and what it's like to be here. The kids were very genuine and well educated and there was a nice enthusiasm throughout the room. It was a wonderful opportunity.
Lauryn Williams,"In college, you just thought about having fun. Now you have to think about making money and putting food on the table. It's become more of a job."

Linda Williams,"They had no food, they had no water, they had no option but to leave. It's been a long few days for them."
Lindsey Williams,The talks have been constructive. We have had progress.
Lindsey Williams,"The talks continued today, but there was no progress."
Lindsey Williams,"We are in discussions with the UAW and can't comment on content or progress,"
Lindsey Williams,"This represents the potential of major savings at that location, pending the outcome of the talks."
Lindsey Williams,"We are in good-faith discussions with our unions, but we cannot just keep talking and losing money indefinitely."

Lindsey Williams,We never stopped negotiating. We are working toward reaching a consensual agreement by the end of the month.
Lindsey Williams,Our situation is not one where we can negotiate indefinitely to reach an agreement.

Margaret Williams,"It does get good coverage because of this being West Texas and every Friday home game we sell the book. It goes much farther than just Midland. Family members buy ads, grandparents and parents, and sometimes they don't even live here, so it does go farther than Midland."

Matt Williams,We feel we will get a better performance from Webster. It's a form issue. He has got his enthusiasm back and has been playing very well for Edinburgh.
Mike Williams,"The industrial market has really picked up with just monster absorption. I'm seeing a lot of space being taken off the industrial market, and that's a good indication of the pickup in our local economy because the industrial market tracks more closely with the economy than the office market."
Mike Williams,"We have been asked to do a complete analysis of safety net services, and the strengths and weaknesses of that system. Any issue is on the table."
Mike Williams,Our interpretation was that we couldn't alter the rules in any way that would potentially discriminate against her. His clarification was different than we interpreted his ruling on Monday. It was good to get that.

Mike Williams,"I might go down. But I am still on my high fat, low exercise diet."

Mike Williams,"Needless to say, the Red Cross would not have been able to feed, shelter and comfort hurricane survivors without the unprecedented influx of first-time volunteers, both volunteering time and money."
Mo Williams,We're trying to get to the point where coming down the stretch we know what we want and know how to get to it. I think it's just our inexperience coming down the stretch. . . . Everything's tight. The pressure's on us and a lot of times we've got to make plays. They're a championship team and we're trying to get where they're at.
Mo Williams,It's hard getting into a rhythm but that's no excuse. I'm just trying to do what I can.
Mo Williams,"It's very frustrating. I'm just pushing it through, giving what I can to the team."

Pat Williams,"With leadership comes some wonderful perks.  But that good stuff ruins more leaders than anything I've seen in my life. Without character, folks, we can't lead."
Pat Williams,"[There's also an element of unfairness to giving a coach a quick hook.

It's like a nervous breakdown with a paycheck."
Pat Williams,"Very poised. Very relaxed, ... God has tapped this kid with special gifts, and he seems very aware of it. He can tell there is a special purpose in his life."

Pat Williams,"We can't win at home. We can't win on the road. As general manager, I just can't figure out where else to play."
Pat Williams,"We were so bad last year, the cheerleaders stayed home and phoned in the cheers."

Randy Williams,"It?s just hard to believe that a town of 7,500 can have that many people come through and have that much fun. We?ve had rain a couple of times, but the Biscuit goes on, no matter what."
Randy Williams,All of those markets are seeing growth from Asia and Europe.
Randy Williams,It's a step in the right direction. It's a signal that Homeland Security has got the message that a handy and inexpensive card as an alternative to a passport is needed.
Randy Williams,"They call it the premier blues festival in the country, ... because itâ€™s really where the blues began. Itâ€™s almost like going to church. Itâ€™s holy ground."

Robbie Williams,"The problem is, I don't think I've got too much to offer at the minute. I'm busy working on myself. This sounds like real therapy talk, but it's like, you've got to be happy with yourself before you can go out and get yourself a girl."

Robin Williams,"The moments of comedy are there. But the whole idea of a vacation is the stripping away of stuff and then, by the end of the vacation, (at least) in my life, you do have these moments as a group, as a family having a great time, so mellow again. It takes a while to do that but that's what this movie is about."

Marianne Williamson,"Prayer enables us to transform the world, because it transforms us."

Marianne Williamson,"Life as we knew it is passing away, and something new is emerging to take its place, ... The Gift of Change: Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life."
Marianne Williamson,"Meaning doesn't lie in things. Meaning lies in us. When we attach value to things that aren't love -- the money, the car, the house, the prestige -- we are loving things that can't love us back. We are searching for meaning in the meaningless. Money, of itself, means nothing. Material things, of themselves, mean nothing. It's not that they're bad. It's that they're nothing."
Marianne Williamson,"We have to wage peace. That's the law of the spirit is the waging of peace, because if we simply seek to manage the effects of hatred, which does need to be done, of course. But if all we do is manage the effects of hatred, then hatred will simply stalk us the next decade or the next generation. We need to dismantle hatred itself."
Marianne Williamson,"We cannot get to our knowledge because the world is too loud. And we tend to make it louder as we cry out in pain, pretending we are singing."

Marianne Williamson,"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you NOT to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."
Marianne Williamson,We are beautiful because God created us that way
Marianne Williamson,There is nothing Madison Avenue can give us that will make us more beautiful women.  We are beautiful because God created us that way.
Marianne Williamson,"We have made up a God in our image. Because we are angry and judgmental, we have projected those characteristics onto Him. But God remains who He is and always will be: He is the energy, the thought of unconditional love. He cannot think with anger or judgment. He is mercy and compassion and total acceptance."
Marianne Williamson,"For many people, God is a frightening idea. Asking God for help doesn't seem very comforting if we think of Him as something outside ourselves, or capricious, or judgmental. But God is love and He dwells within us. We are created in His image, or mind, which means that we are extensions of His love, or Sons and Daughters of God."
Marianne Williamson,"We are born to manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."
Marianne Williamson,Forgiveness is the stroke of God within us. The American people haven't ignored what he did. He asked for forgiveness and the American people gave it to him. Theirs is the higher morality.
Marianne Williamson,"What if we truly believed there is a God -- a beneficent order to things, a force that's holding things together without our conscious control? What if we could see, in our daily lives, the working of that force? What if we believed it loved us somehow, and cared for us, and protected us? What if we believed we could afford to relax?"
Marianne Williamson,We are so trained in the thought system of fear and attack that we get to the point where natural thinking -- love -- feels unnatural and unnatural thinking -- fear -- feels natural. It takes real discipline and training to unlearn the thought system of fear.
Marianne Williamson,"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.  It is our Light, not our Darkness, that most frightens us."
Marianne Williamson,Family... a group experience of love and support.
Marianne Williamson,The purpose of daily prayer is the cultivation of a sense of the sacred. Sacred energy renews us.
Marianne Williamson,"Dear God,Please bring your LightInto the darkened cornersOf our world today.May Divine LoveCast out all fear,And peace prevail on earth.Forgive us,Oh God,For our errors.Forgive others for theirs,As well.Please help us, God.Amen"
Marianne Williamson,"Love is what we are born with. Fear is what we learn. The spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and prejudices and the acceptance of love back in our hearts. Love is the essential reality and our purpose on earth. To be consciously aware of it, to experience love in ourselves and others, is the meaning of life. Meaning does not lie in things. Meaning lies in us."
Marianne Williamson,"The secret of success is to realize that the crisis on our planet is much larger than just deciding what to do with your own life, and if the system under which we live the structure of western civilization begins to collapse because of our selfishness and greed, then it will make no difference whether you have $1 million dollars when the crash comes or just $1.00. The only work that will ultimately bring any good to any of us is the work of contributing to the healing of the world."
Marianne Williamson,To look to God is to look to the realm of consciousness that can deliver us from the pain of living.
Marianne Williamson,"May we not succumb to thoughts of violence and revenge today, but rather to thoughts of mercy and compassion. . . . We are to love our enemies that they might be returned to their right minds."

Marianne Williamson,"But beauty itself is not given to us by anyone; it is a power we have within us from the gate, a radiance inside us."

Marianne Williamson,"May we not succumb to thoughts of violence and revenge today, but rather to thoughts of mercy and compassion. We are to love our enemies that they might be returned to their right minds."
Marianne Williamson,"Fill you mind with the meaningless stimuli of a world preoccupied with meaningless things, and it will not be easy to feel peace in your heart."
Marianne Williamson,The spiritual path - is simply the journey of living our lives. Everyone is on a spiritual path; most people just don't know it.
Marianne Williamson,Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here.
Marianne Williamson,"As we become purer channels for God's light, we develop an appetite for the sweetness that is possible in this world. A miracle worker is not geared toward fighting the world that is, but toward creating the world that could be."
Marianne Williamson,"Nothing liberates our greatness like the desire to help, the desire to serve."
Marianne Williamson,"We may have bad weather in Ireland, but the sun shines in the hearts of the people and that keeps us all warm."

Marianne Williamson,Maturity includes the recognition that no one is going to see anything in us that we don't see in ourselves. Stop waiting for a producer. Produce yourself.
Marianne Williamson,"If you give your life as a wholehearted response to love, then love will wholeheartedly respond to you."
Marianne Williamson,God is definitely out of the closet.
Marianne Williamson,God exists in eternity. The only point where eternity meets time is in the present. The present is the only time there is.

Marianne Williamson,"Our past is a story existing only in our minds. Look, analyze, understand, and forgive. Then, as quickly as possible, chuck it."
Marianne Williamson,Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.
Marianne Williamson,"We are not held back by the love we didn't receive in the past, but by the love we're not extending in the present."
Marianne Williamson,We receive His peace when we ask Him for it. We keep His peace by extending it to others. Those are the keys and there are no others.
Marianne Williamson,"As we let our light shine, we consciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence actually liberates others."
Marianne Williamson,"We can always choose to perceive things differently. You can focus on what's wrong in your life, or you can focus on what's right."
Marianne Williamson,"The goal of spiritual practice is full recovery, and the only thing you need to recover from is a fractured sense of self."
Marianne Williamson,"Forgiveness is not always easy. At times, it feels more painful than the wound we suffered, to forgive the one that inflicted it. And yet, there is no peace without forgiveness."
Marianne Williamson,The only work that will ultimately bring any good to any of us is the work of contributing to the healing of the world.
Marianne Williamson,"In every community, there is work to be done. In every nation, there are wounds to heal. In every heart, there is the power to do it."
Marianne Williamson,The practice of forgiveness is our most important contribution to the healing of the world.

Bruce Willis,"Our marriage is like anybody's marriage, It goes through ups and downs. It's a little garden that you have to tend all the time. When we're home, it's not like we walk around all dolled up going, ''We are celebrities! We are famous!'' I change diapers. I clean up dog doo."

Dontrelle Willis,"I was trying to tell him to call time. Next thing you know, (Rollins) was running. The situation got out of hand quickly."
Dontrelle Willis,"I just got off the phone with my mother and she was just yelling and screaming. I can't blame her. When your son is a 24-year-old millionaire, regardless of whether he's throwing a baseball or working for Donald Trump, it's a beautiful thing."
Dontrelle Willis,"That was the first instinct I had ? to slide, ... I figured the quickest way I could get to the plate was to reach out as far as I can. I just said, 'I'm going to give up my body.' It's all about putting pressure on the other guys."

Al Wilson,"He's definitely progressed as a player, just understanding the game more, from what I see."
Al Wilson,"I've always told people that he has the best hands on the team, including all the wide receivers and the running backs. I think that second touchdown showed it. Jake threw him a bullet and he just caught it with ease. It's good to have a guy like that who has such versatility."
Al Wilson,We know where we stand and where we are. Why bring it up? It's the past. That happened last year.
Al Wilson,The only way a team can move the ball on us is if we make mistakes. We realize that so far.
Al Wilson,"It's definitely in the back of your mind, but we know we still have a job to go out and do."
Al Wilson,"Man, I think we just got to the point where if we were going to lose, we were going to lose fighting. If you don't like the way it's going, you have to do something about it. We did something about it, we got after them in the second half."
Al Wilson,"As defensive players, you love to get after the quarterback. It gives you an opportunity to make big plays. And when we starting doing that, some big plays started showing up."
Al Wilson,"We would love to bring a playoff game back to the city of Denver. Trust me, I know we haven't won the AFC West since I've been here. Trust me, I know that, and you don't have to tell me that. But that's what we push for. We're pushing to win our division, first of all. And once you win your division it gives you a home playoff game and possibly home-field advantage and you go from there."
Al Wilson,"It's a worldwide, televised event. The phone rings more after you play on 'Monday Night Football.' People call up and let you know how you looked on TV. If you had a good game, they say, 'You were awesome!' And if you have a bad game, they say: 'Al, you messed up. What were you thinking?"
Al Wilson,"He does allow me the freedom to do a few things, as long as I don't hurt the defense and I make sure I'm on the right page."
Al Wilson,Ron and I have known each other since college. I knew he was a (heck) of a player. You don't win the Heisman just because they want to give it to you. You win the Heisman because of what you do.
Al Wilson,"It feels good. Anytime you get it, I think it says a lot about the character of the defense."
Al Wilson,"It's tough. It's a crazy business. It was unfortunate for us, but we still have to find a way to make plays, find a way to get it done. We just didn't do that."
Al Wilson,"Let's be honest now, he's a special kind of athlete. He's fast. He's strong. He's intelligent and hungry. And you don't find that all the time in different players. And especially finding all those attributes in one player."
Ann Wilson,"Women are sometimes so emotionally attached to the house that they cannot see the financial pros and cons of it,"
Ann Wilson,But I think after this tour Nancy's gonna score another Cameron Crowe movie called Elizabethtown and I'm gonna do a million things which I'm not sure what they are right now.
Ann Wilson,"Led Zeppelin, you can't find a better band to pay homage to."

Ann Wilson,I don't think we'll ever use the same sound techniques.
Ann Wilson,I don't think we will use the 80s glossy sound again.
Ann Wilson,Fleetwood Mac are more like a folk-rock band.
Ann Wilson,All the songs that were written for that album are just all our first sophomore songs. So they're all from real life. Very sweet and very innocent.
Ann Wilson,We're just pleased that all parties were able to reach an agreement and that the lawsuit has come to an end. We now look forward to moving on with the business of raising money to support Iowa State University.
August Wilson,"I have a robust imagination and I have imagined for myself many things,"
August Wilson,"I might be a different kind of fool, but I ain't gonna be the same fool twice."
August Wilson,"I'm trying to take culture and put it onstage, demonstrate it is capable of sustaining you. There is no idea that can't be contained by life: Asian life, European life, certainly black life. My plays are about love, honor, duty, betrayal - things humans have written about since the beginning of time."
August Wilson,"Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing. Use the pain as fuel, as a reminder of your strength."
August Wilson,"To my observation, the black middle class has failed to return the expertise and sophistication and resources that they've gained in American society over the past 50 years back to the community,"
August Wilson,"The fact that he was a self-made man, that he was a lieutenant in the army and became the emperor, I liked that,"
August Wilson,All you need in the world is love and laughter. That's all anybody needs. To have love in one hand and laughter in the other.
Bill Wilson,"To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world."
Bill Wilson,"A child should not be forced to read this kind of literature, ... I don't think many adults would want to read this kind of literature."
Bill Wilson,"AdCorp is a great example of some of the exclusive top-quality films we're delivering to movie fans on a daily basis. Short films are traditionally an under-exposed and under-appreciated genre, so whether they're comedies, dramas or romances, we're thrilled to offer filmmakers an exciting interactive program that reaches the largest audience of movie fans on the web."
Bill Wilson,The budget stays the same but the salary increases. That is the problem because there is a natural progression of increase.
Carl Wilson,He's the master of delay.
Carl Wilson,In the early part of the '60s I was influenced by the Ventures.
Carl Wilson,"Sure, we've had our fair share of ups and downs, but I don't know if we've had more than any other rock band... we just have a way of getting ourselves into hot water."
Carl Wilson,I thought Jimi Hendrix... was just phenomenal.
Carl Wilson,"I remember growing up always loving the guitar. I used to love to watch the people play on the Country Western shows on TV. My folks told me that when I was just a toddler, I used to pretend I was playing a guitar on a toothpick."
Carl Wilson,"I had been playing for about a year and a half when the Beach Boys formed. When our folks went to Mexico on business, we would take the food money they had left us and we would rent instruments."
David Wilson,I'm just happy to see the fruits of their hard work come to pass. All three are very fortunate to have been able to get to this point. How many kids out there have this dream and don't get to this point?
David Wilson,"With moisture, our homes have so many products in the home that are food sources for mold growth, so not only is it the structural damage and the paint loss and the discoloration, but the potential for significant biological growth - either mold or bacteria."
David Wilson,"He's not afraid to not conform . . . and that can upset people, so it's pretty correct [that there's two clear schools of thought on Connolly]. He would have his enemies, but he'd have a lot of supporters as well."
David Wilson,"We're starting to see young people with old people diseases. These diseases include hardening of the arteries, heart attacks, and diabetes."
David Wilson,Most people assumed that spring 2006 was for a domestic Japanese launch and historically Europe has always been the last to receive Japanese technology. I think it is actually good news that we are attempting a simultaneous launch so people don't resent the fact that other territories have it first. I think people have been positively surprised that it will be out before Christmas.
David Wilson,"An Olympic gymnast may have started instruction as a preschooler, but there are other sports, such as shooting, where a 17-year-old young woman recently became a champion after just two years of competition. It turned out she was a natural."
David Wilson,"They've both been playing extremely well, but I think George has probably got a slight points advantage at the moment if you had to pick between the two. And continuing on with the good form that he's had so far this year I think he could just edge out Phil for the starting spot."
Dennis Wilson,"The thing I wonder about is where does Brian's creative spark come from? Not his subjects or anything, but his spark. What makes it so great for me is that I really don't know. There's a mystery behind Brian, even to me."
Dennis Wilson,I can tell you the day The Beach Boys will no longer exist - never. We'll be on stage in wheelchairs.
Dennis Wilson,I made a dollar a day sweeping a laundry out. Then we made a record that was number two in Los Angeles. We got so excited hearing it on the radio that Carl threw up.
Dennis Wilson,He just had a very unique way of expressing himself physically with his kids.
Dennis Wilson,My mom had to beg the guys to let me play. I couldn't even play the drums right - Brian had to show me.
Dennis Wilson,"They say I live a fast life. Maybe I just like a fast life. I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world. It won't last forever, either. But the memories will."
Dennis Wilson,"If there wasn't The Beach Boys and there wasn't music, I wouldn't even talk to them. But through the music I fell in love with my brothers."
Dennis Wilson,All I need is a big surfboard and a piano.
Dennis Wilson,The Beach Boys are not a superstar group. The music is the superstar of the group.
Dennis Wilson,There will always be a Beach Boys. Being a Beach Boy is like being in love.
Dennis Wilson,"Brian was the oldest, I was in the middle and Carl was the baby. I was the troublemaker. Brian got great grades and Carl got the kind of grades I did. I failed everything. I was too busy fighting and running wild."
Dennis Wilson,The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.
Douglas Wilson,It's hard to design a space when people just say they need help with a sun room. You can do anything with any room.

Douglas Wilson,Little did we know it would be watched by millions of people and break viewing records.
Douglas Wilson,It started as just a little cable show.

Douglas Wilson,They don't know they're living in a glass house.
Douglas Wilson,"I try to instill in people the idea that they've all got individual personalities, and they should do what they want to their homes."
Douglas Wilson,I'm having the time of my life and I'm glad people are enjoy it.
Douglas Wilson,"I look at each episode in two ways - from a design standpoint and from an entertainment standpoint - this is TV, after all. We usually succeed on at least one of the levels."
Douglas Wilson,I've had rooms that didn't come out to my liking.
Douglas Wilson,I see the same coffee table everywhere. It's mass marketing.
Douglas Wilson,I enjoy talking to fans.
Douglas Wilson,"I gave the couple a hint of a design that would work great with the bones of their home. They weren't ready for it, and they embarrassed themselves and that's too bad."
Douglas Wilson,"I am the young, edgy New Yorker."
Douglas Wilson,"Throughout the country, I see the same design problems and solutions over and over."
Douglas Wilson,"Ripping up carpet is easy, tiling is the issue."
Douglas Wilson,I was supposed to be the antithesis of Frank.
Douglas Wilson,"I don't think about how I wear my hair. I get out of the shower, put on some gel and it dries. I got blessed with good hair from my parents."
Douglas Wilson,"Yeah, I spent about 20 years in a dorm room. It took me a while to graduate."
Douglas Wilson,Use plants to bring life.

Gretchen Wilson,It became apparent to me really fast that I wasn't going to be able to make a living and pay my bills playing on Broadway.
Gretchen Wilson,They're the kind of people who were honest. They'd listen and tell me what they thought - the kind of honesty you need when you're trying to perfect your craft.
Gretchen Wilson,"Word gets around quickly in Nashville. It's a big city, but it's got that small-town gossip aspect to it. If you have something to offer, it doesn't stay a secret for very long. We kept at it ... Sony (Epic Records) turned me down twice before they gave me a record deal."
Gretchen Wilson,"As the attorney general of the home state of country music I want to discuss my concerns of your promotion of smokeless products, particularly as it relates to the youth who attend your concerts and who listen to your music,"
Gretchen Wilson,"We wanted to create an environment where we wanted to raise our children in, an environment of diversity and inclusion."
Gretchen Wilson,What I'm doing is a dream come true but at the same time its work. It's like anything else. The only time it doesn't really feel like work to me is when I'm on stage and doing what I've prepared myself for my whole life which is to stand out in front of a crowd and sing.
Gretchen Wilson,"I don't really think about having had a hard life. It was just my life, and it's all I knew. It made me who I am - all the good and bad - and it's where all of the songs on Here For The Party came from. I've lived them all."
Gretchen Wilson,"I got to where I couldn't listen to country radio. Country music is supposed to have steel and fiddle. When I hear country music, it should be country."
Harold Wilson,"From now the pound abroad is worth 14 per cent or so less in terms of other currencies. It does not mean, of course, that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse or in your bank, has been devalued."
Harold Wilson,"Our big guy (Julian McLain) got in foul trouble early, and it seemed like on the other end it didn't work out. I'll just say early we didn't hit our open jump shots and then probably missed more free throws than we usually do."

Jacqueline Wilson,I try to have reasonably happy endings because I would hate any child to be cast down in gloom and despair; I want to show them you can find a way out of it.
Jacqueline Wilson,"While some of my other books have sold more widely, Midnight seems to be the most passionately loved. There's something about its secret, rather dark fairy world that appeals very strongly."

John Wilson,"We want to send a very strong message ... this is not what we expect out of civilized society, ... We're going to make an example of somebody."
John Wilson,They are a logical counterpoint to the endless sea of self-congratulations ... We take ourselves a little less seriously than the others awards groups. We're basically here to poke fun of everyone else. It's not so much a slap in the face as a banana peel on the floor.
John Wilson,"I got sick and tired of my lady wearing ugly underwear to bed, so I turned to the Internet."
John Wilson,Prices have stayed up because people in control of supply decided they could keep them up.
John Wilson,Too many security officers live day to day. They just want to be treated with dignity.

John Wilson,We don't need another Teflon-like hidden risk at DuPont.
John Wilson,It's a responsibility that everyone has to take if they want to live in hurricane-prone areas. We're a nation that wants accountability and that's good. But we all need to accept the responsibility that we have a part in this role and it's not up to a few agencies to bail us out.
John Wilson,Al Hendrix wanted to give the legacy to Janie for one purpose: to keep the legacy alive. She started from scratch with $26 million in debt while everyone was waiting in the sidelines for her and her husband to fail. But they have been extremely successful.
John Wilson,This is largely because of the efforts of Janie and her husband. What they did as far as attaining income with securing new tapes not only helped current revenues but will show in future revenues as well.
John Wilson,The government should step in and block this sale.
John Wilson,"The government has rightly focused on the mantra of 'Internet access for all,' but people need to have everyday work, family and leisure reasons for taking advantage of access."
John Wilson,He loves the relay events. He would give up individual events to swim relays.
John Wilson,"More brainpower is a good thing. The current higher education infrastructure can't meet all of the demand, and that's why we welcome George Mason University to the area."
John Wilson,"In the medley relay and coming out of the second heat we really had no competition to get pushed. Besides that, setting a time that put us into states was really the key thing there."
Larry Wilson,I'm going to have to work longer. Longer and harder.
Larry Wilson,"He looked at the stadium, looked at the logistics and venue-- and fell in love with it."
Larry Wilson,"No one wants to pay more on water bills, ... But it's federally mandated and everyone knows it's the law."
Larry Wilson,"We'll have a variety of family shows, concerts, motor sports, wrestling and speakers series. I have some major -- and I mean major -- concerts that will be announced in the coming months."
Larry Wilson,"It's a big deal that Congress is voting to approve increasing the national debt. They say 'We're going to control spending' and then they turn around and make huge budget amendments, sending us further into debt."
Larry Wilson,"A lot of children, grandchildren, really have no idea what these soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines did during that time period. To them, that's grandpa. To find out what these men actually endured is amazing."
Larry Wilson,"I thought it was pretty rotten. If she's driving a cab and doing this, it doesn't help business any."
Mark Wilson,I think that's probably one of his best races he's run. I think he has the talent. This year he's kind of been holding back and I think he did step up Monday.
Mark Wilson,We've got talent in every area of the field. The first 11 and the next seven or eight guys who sit on the bench are all plenty good enough to come in and do the job every week as well. That ups the tempo in practice every day and that's why we're working so hard and playing so well.
Mark Wilson,"There a lot of locals who have come out to support it. This year, I've seen families. In talking to some our members, the art galleries and some of those folks are doing pretty well."
Mark Wilson,"We have experienced all too often that our wounded troops suffering from severe head trauma have had to be flown to hospitals such as Brook Army Medical Center in Texas to receive specialized head and brain trauma treatment. We are proposing the privately funded construction and donation of a specialized brain trauma unit on the west coast at Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, California. The Freedom Is Not Free Foundation has garnered massive support from the civilian and corporate communities for such a site and we will be presenting our proposal for a Private Sector/Government funded partnership to make sure this project comes to fruition."
Mark Wilson,"I've got to enjoy it and tomorrow will be a struggle because, you know, maybe they're not going to be going in. You always try to compare yourself with how you were doing the day before."
Mark Wilson,A lot of credit goes to our offensive line. I told them at halftime to give the running backs a second to get into the holes and that's what happened in the second half. It was a team effort.
Mark Wilson,"They ran together just about the whole race and there was only a two second difference between them. They've been doing that all year long, going back and forth. This time they kind of partnered up and had some good competition between them, ... Looking ahead we'd like to see both of them contend for one of those top two places at districts. We just need our middle and back end to move up more and we've been moving up. We were in the 20s and now we're in the teens, so we're starting to see some improvement there."
Mark Wilson,isn't a matter of race.
Mark Wilson,"I think the problems are to be worked out themselves in the dressing room. And we will do that. It's a great bunch of lads - plenty of ability in there, plenty of talent - we'll kick, scrap and fight our way out of this."
Mark Wilson,"The big thing with Lars was that he was keenly interested, and he had a good, bright mind. And then you tie in his athletic ability. That's the recipe for success in billiards."
Mark Wilson,"The farmer then has an incentive not to sell his land, ... And society has what it wants - open space."
Mark Wilson,"Our kids played hard and stepped up. We practiced hard the last two weeks. It was one of those hard fought battles,"
Mark Wilson,"The costs of an annuity are a humongous drag on a portfolio. You add in the ordinary income-tax rate on withdrawals, and it's very hard to make it work out."
Mark Wilson,"The costs of an annuity are a humongous drag on a portfolio. You add in the ordinary income tax rate on withdrawals, and it's very hard to make it work out."
Mark Wilson,We're looking for improvement every meet from them. If they can do that - keep improving - eventually we'll get our points there.
Mark Wilson,It's a mess out there with health-insurance costs.
Mark Wilson,We have 26 girls out and that's as many as I can remember in a long time. I can remember just a few years ago going to meets and not being able to fill all the events. It's going to be fun this year.
Mark Wilson,"They're a pretty good football team, ... But we just weren't focused."
Mark Wilson,"Everything comes down to economics. The incentive is to sell the land to non-ag buyers,"
Mark Wilson,"(Finding lodging) has been a disaster. There just isn't any place for people to stay. We've tried to accommodate teams that are coming from far off with late games, either noon or 4 o'clock, so they can drive in."
Mark Wilson,This is a new direction in wealth management.
Mark Wilson,"There are lots of planning opportunities in the timing of withdrawals to pay for college. For high school juniors, we're rebalancing to prepare for payout. For seniors, we may not plan payouts until the family has gotten their financial-aid package."
Mark Wilson,Let's not cheat our children out of an education.
Mark Wilson,"None of those teams got to play in the fall. Now, they're back. Gulf Coast United has boys teams in every age group. That's awesome, and big news for them."
Mark Wilson,"Psychologically, going into the next two games against (the Galaxy), it's a great big boost for the boys. We performed great tonight and it's a fantastic win that sets us up now for the next two or three games."
Mark Wilson,"We're still really young on the boys' side, ... We just have to be patient and we'll eventually get better. We're running a lot of first-year juniors and sophomores and we've got to get the experience and understand how to run those races."
Ralph Wilson,"We've got a great game. It's going to go on. We'll work something out along the way. These things always get worked out eventually. Maybe not this morning, but eventually."
Ralph Wilson,"The owners panicked. They were afraid there might be a work stoppage. But we would've had 12 months to sit down and work a better deal out. With this deal, there's going to be half the clubs under water."
Ralph Wilson,"I got the sense in the room they were just afraid of a work stoppage, afraid of the union, and they would accept anything. The union should've asked for more; they would've gotten it. It was a panic deal. I've seen it before, but not like this."
Ralph Wilson,I just don't think we made enough progress in the last five years. I just think we need a fresh start and that's why this change is being made.
Ralph Wilson,"Yes, we could lose money, despite the sharing of TV money and all the audio stuff. Don't believe everything the PR machine at the league office puts out."
Ralph Wilson,"As I sit here today, this is not a matter of making money for the Buffalo Bills, this is a matter of surviving."
Ralph Wilson,This is not a matter of making money for the Buffalo Bills. It's a matter of survival. We just want to survive. And I think a lot of other clubs are in the same fix.
Ralph Wilson,"This new deal is worse than the one we had. You want labor peace, but you also want a fair deal."
Ralph Wilson,We're in a small market and we have worked really hard to keep this thing going. All I want is enough so I can hang onto the canoe.
Ralph Wilson,"I just don't think they're as interested in the game as the old owners, I really don't."
Ralph Wilson,I just don't feel we've made enough progress in the last five years. I think we have a good future. But I do think we need a fresh start.
Ralph Wilson,"We sleepwalked. We didn't have any emotion. We just haven't shown any enthusiasm, not today, not for the last three weeks ... Last week, Cincinnati came out and they were really aggressive -- like we used to be. It was the same this week."
Ralph Wilson,"We sleepwalked, ... We didn't have any emotion. We just haven't shown any enthusiasm, not today, not for the last three weeks ... Last week, Cincinnati came out and they were really aggressive -- like we used to be. It was the same this week."
Ralph Wilson,"While I am committed to western New York, the long-term viability of our franchise may be in serious doubt."
Ralph Wilson,"I cannot charge $80, $90, $100-dollars for a sideline seat. I must charge in this area what the community can bare."
Ralph Wilson,He was hired to be the GM and would never coach the team. We are excited to have Marv as our general manager.
Ralph Wilson,We don't want to be baseball. It's the Yankees and everybody else there.
Ralph Wilson,Marv and I entered into an agreement initially that made him the general manager of the Bills. He was hired to be GM and would never coach the team. We are excited to have Marv as our general manager as we move forward in hiring a new head coach.
Richard Wilson,"He wanted to be a great architect and design great public buildings. Instead, he was doing a lot of private commissions. He just did these 'white elephants,' as Henry James called them,"
Richard Wilson,What language are you talking in now? It appears to be Bollocks.

Richard Wilson,Most of my mail comes from young people.
Steve Wilson,We never found a real model (for our vision).
Steve Wilson,"You have to learn the basics of your instrument. It is like sports: if you don't have the fundamentals, you don't get very far. Natural talent will only carry you so far."
Steve Wilson,The kind of building we were looking for was his philosophy. We want so much happening in this building that it will be vibrant day and night.
Steve Wilson,"It gives us some pretty broad exposure. And with the variety of music being performed, it brings a diverse group who wouldn't otherwise hear us. We try to choose music that people know and can sing along to, get the audience involved."
Steve Wilson,The mother will come right back to them. She won't abandon them because of human scent.
Steve Wilson,"We wish Rich nothing but the best. With all the changes at Sun management, he's got a big opportunity to influence change at one of the biggest companies in the world."
Steve Wilson,Laughter itself probably isn't going to build stronger muscles. Laughter itself isn't going to increase stamina.
Steve Wilson,"I believe that if people can get more laughter in their lives, they are a lot better off. They might be healthier, too."
Steve Wilson,The childlike physicality of laughter exercises is restorative for adults.
Steve Wilson,Managing to have a sense of humor makes it a lot easier to manage people
Steve Wilson,"It's a great opportunity to poke fun at people,"
Steve Wilson,"A lot of restaurants are involved with fresh, local, organic food. This is just another step in the process of being green."
Steve Wilson,"The effects of laughter and exercise are very similar. Combining laughter and movement, like waving your arms, is a great way to boost your heart rate."
Steve Wilson,"Our primary need is for people to realize that this disaster is not going to last just a couple of weeks. The effects will last months, therefore we will need volunteers and contributions for months."
Steve Wilson,"This case may raise conflict-of-interest questions,"
Steve Wilson,The audiences all over Europe are great. They really appreciate the music. Italy - there is such a warm spirit there. It maybe have something to do with it being on the Mediterranean. I am a little mystic about it. It is the way that people live. People don't live in a lifestyle based on competition so the stress level is not as prominent.
Steve Wilson,"The agreement is not evidence in this case, and as such is not a public record subject to disclosure,"
Steve Wilson,"Because of that search, ... we became a community. We shared our tears and affection. We now hold our children closer."
Steve Wilson,"Dealerships spend thousands of dollars on advertising. When you can get that at the national level, it certainly helps us, ... It's driving traffic. It's getting people to come in."
Tim Wilson,"I think keeping it out there, keeping it in the news, in front of the mind and the money that's come forward, all of these things are going to help solve the case."
Tim Wilson,"While improving water quality is an important part of this project, (best management practices) that are implemented are also aimed at improving the landowners' operation as well,"
Tim Wilson,"I have mixed feelings. It's always been there and it's been good for employment, but you don't know what will be developed there if it's gone."
Tim Wilson,"We now have reason to believe our daughter had engaged in this behavior for at least a year, maybe too."
Tim Wilson,"Other manufacturers have developed software that hints at the power available in Apple's Core Image architecture, but we have gone deep to tap the full potential of this technology, expand the degree of customization it offers, and enable its application in a professional editing environment."
Tim Wilson,"We would like to extend our appreciation to the cooperating landowners and the agencies that have provided additional funding to make this project a success so far, ... We are also looking for landowners who are interested in funding for projects to repair the shoreline of Elm Lake itself, or its many tributaries that may have been damaged by heavy rains in May and June."
Tom Wilson,"Our relationship with Sterling Bank & Trust has been active for many years. They have steadily increased their involvement with us and have shared in our successes. This naming rights agreement puts the Sterling name and brand identity on a club that will set the standard for luxurious, upscale hospitality in Detroit and, for that matter, all of professional sports. Sterling has made a substantial investment in our new addition and we are confident that they are going to receive a great return."
Tom Wilson,We want to get them all into school.
Tom Wilson,"We're talking about research that was conducted statewide without regard to geography, partisanship, gender or any other criteria, ... The only votes I'm trying to suppress are dead people, criminals and those who wish to corrupt the system."

Tom Wilson,We couldn't be more thrilled that Callaway Golf has extended its support of the Junior World Championships. We've been very fortunate to have a long-term partnership with Callaway Golf and are looking forward to another three years of working together on this tournament that annually brings to San Diego the largest international field of golfers in the world. The history and prestige of the tournament has been a true measuring stick for junior golf around the world.
Tom Wilson,It will be a physical run-oriented game which Newton has played for years. We have to force them in situations that they don't want to be in. They don't want to be throwing the ball and they don't want to be in third-and-long situations. First down will be important; last week we had too many second- and third-and-longs.
Tom Wilson,Mosquitoes remind us that we are not as high up on the food chain as we think

Tom Wilson,If I had a nickel for every time I said Why me? I'd have probably said Why me? more often.
Tom Wilson,A smile is happiness you'll find right under your nose.

Tom Wilson,"I have watched Valley for many years, and it's been more out of admiration than anything else of how they go about their business,"
Tom Wilson,Wisdom doesn't necessarily come with age. Sometimes age just shows up all by itself.
Latoya Wily,"We've got to find an anecdote to overcome all the obstacles and challenges we've had. By the time the SWAC tournament comes around, hopefully we'll pick it up and find ourselves. It's been frustrating. We've got to learn how to pull through it and find ourselves as a team."
Latoya Wily,"I'll put it like this â€” everybody has their bad games and good games. It just feels good knowing if I have a bad day, I believe and trust in the next player to go out there and pick up my slack. It's going out there and playing for your team. We want to play for our team, our school and our coach."
Latoya Wily,I know a lot more about the program. I'm getting the system down this year. Coach is really doing a good job helping coach all of us. We're just trying to help each other out. We're all a big family. Shan is going to get a lot of double- and triple-teams. We need to believe in each other.
David Wimhurst,"It's been a very agitated day, but there has been little actual violence."
David Wimhurst,"We came in here unarmed. We've been in these situations before. I draw your attention back to those who are responsible for this violence and those who are responsible for controlling this violence, and they are not doing that."
David Wimhurst,Our mission was to verify that the voting centers the electoral council had selected physically existed. It had never been our job to determine the location of voting centers.
David Wimhurst,"First there is the fact that the first round of elections (on February 7) is finished, and with the election of Mr. Rene Preval I think there is a certain relief in the population happy to see its candidate chosen."
David Wimhurst,"We're quite convinced the elections will be held on schedule and will unfold, we hope, with no incidents so that everyone can make their choice democratically and freely."
David Wimhurst,"You'll see more patrols, more soldiers out than usual from now and until elections. All the last minute arrangements are in place. We expect a large turnout."
David Wimhurst,There's some frustration and anger on the voting lines. People have ben waiting several hours now and in some cases they haven't even got inside.
David Wimhurst,There's some frustration and anger on the voting lines.
David Wimhurst,"Obviously, we always hope that they will see their way to completing the Lusaka protocol and peace agreement, but all evidence to date suggests that this is not what they intend to do."
Dave Winfield,It won't taint (his memory). Leave it alone.
Dave Winfield,He didn't bask in fame or glory or the money he made. He relished in the notion that a little short kid from the projects in Chicago couldn't accomplish anything in life.
Dave Winfield,"You know, many of you kids can't relate to what it takes to get to the top rung, the top of the heap, to have success. We're looking for things that come in a minute. It just doesn't happen."
Dave Winfield,"You know, heroes are ordinary people that have achieved extraordinary things in life."
Dave Winfield,You have to go understand that life and baseball is littered with all kinds of obstacles and problems along the way. You have to learn how to overcome them to be successful in life.
Dave Winfield,"You have to be like a clock spring, wound but not loose at the same time."
Dave Winfield,"To the people out there, baseball is a simple sport. But it is complex. It is never easy."
Dave Winfield,"To give you an idea what it feels like to be going in with some of the best baseball players of all-time, I mean it is fantastic. I have to say this about them, there are so many of these guys up here that were my role models, people I looked up to, people I wanted to be like."
Dave Winfield,"Those are real heroes. Hilton Smith, guys that played in the Negro Leagues, never got a chance in the Major Leagues. But you kept on playing."
Dave Winfield,"There is no way, believe me, despite my name being Winfield, and loving the game dearly. It wasn't in the cards. I didn't know what it was going to take to get here."
Dave Winfield,"There are other people like Henry Aaron. Man, just for being the best and breaking records at a time when people didn't want you to."
Dave Winfield,"There are a lot of people who influenced me, nurtured me, helped me along the way. But I can just recall looking back, the first time I got my baseball glove. Put it on the wrong hand, all those kind of things."
Dave Winfield,"The Yankees won the pennant, we went on to the World Series, 41 years after that in the city of Toronto. The great city of Toronto, and all the provinces in Canada, everybody reached out and they were excited because we won the first World Series ever, across the border."
Dave Winfield,The sooner I get into the Hall of Fame the better.
Dave Winfield,The people like the American Legion Post that gave us a chance to play. A place to play and a chance to play.
Dave Winfield,"The people in my life that were not only what I call heroes, but these are the people that overcame extraordinary circumstances in life."
Dave Winfield,"Roberto Clemente, not only because you played right field like it was supposed to be played, but your humanitarian efforts will live on forever."
Dave Winfield,"People I look to: again, Hank Aaron, man you challenged the status quo and the records of the game. Monumental feats in an era where people didn't like that."
Dave Winfield,"Now it's on to May, and you know about me and May."
Dave Winfield,"Made it through high school, went to the University of Minnesota."
Dave Winfield,I chose baseball because to me baseball is the best game of all.
Dave Winfield,I am truly sorry that a fowl of Canada is no longer with us.
Dave Winfield,"But I'll tell you this, it started with my mother. I have to give her. God bless her and rest her soul. I had a good foundation at home, so when I was able to go off and do these things in baseball there was always support."
Dave Winfield,"And then 45 years later, as I finished my career in the great city of Cleveland, that was another great way to end my career, going to the World Series."
Dave Winfield,"And I found out, the other part of it is that I found out and in my desire to life successfully, that baseball fit very well into my life. It's been a great teacher, trainer, mentor and you'll see what I mean in the next few minutes that I have to speak."
Dave Winfield,"All though I didn't meet him. His legend and his saga and his story is just that. Jackie Robinson, we all have to tip our hat to him. Because he made the game available to guys like me."
Dave Winfield,"Everyone has a breaking point, turning point, stress point, the game is permeated with it. The fans don't see it because we make it look so efficient. But internally, for a guy to be successful, you have to be like a clock spring, wound but not loose at the same time."
Dave Winfield,"I never had to cheat, I get them with what I got."
Dave Winfield,"These days baseball is different. You come to spring training, you get your legs ready, you arms loose, your agents ready, your lawyer lined up."
Leanne Winner,School-board members and superintendents are very upset about this provision.
Leanne Winner,This is not about Speaker Black. This is about what is in the best interest of children.
Leanne Winner,"We think it's important for children to be able to see. However, we oppose any provision that creates a barrier to children being able to exercise their constitutional right to an education."
Jeanette Winterson,"It's true that heroes are inspiring, but mustn't they also do some rescuing if they are to be worthy of their name? Would Wonder Woman matter if she only sent commiserating telegrams to the distressed?"
Jeanette Winterson,This hole in my heart is in the shape of you. No one else can fit it. Why would I want them to?
Jeanette Winterson,"I have a theory that every time you make an important choice, the part of you left behind continues the other life you could have had. Some people's emanations are very strong, some people create themselves afresh outside of their own body. This is not fancy. If a potter has an idea, she makes it into a pot, and it exists beyond her, in its own separate life. She uses a physical substance to display her thoughts. If I use a metaphysical substance to display my thoughts, I might be anywhere at one time, influencing a number of different things, just as the potter and her pottery can exert influence in different places. There's a chance that I'm not here at all, that all the parts of me, running along all the choices I did and didn't make, for a moment brush agains teach other."
Jeanette Winterson,"Your weak point is the open, vulnerable place where you can always be hurt. Love, in all its aspects, opens the self so fully."
Jeanette Winterson,Writers have to have a knack for listening. I need to be able to hear what is being said to me by the voices I create.
Jeanette Winterson,"With animal behavior, they're all fine until you introduce some rogue element into the cage, and then they go crazy."
Jeanette Winterson,Whether you want to call it God or the mystery of the cosmos doesn't matter to me.
Jeanette Winterson,"When it is time to get to work, I go away completely and don't do anything except the work. And that can be 16 hours a day."
Jeanette Winterson,Whatever is powerful to you can be translated into something which will matter to somebody that you will never know.
Jeanette Winterson,What's invisible to us is also crucial for our own well-being.
Jeanette Winterson,What you risk reveals what you value.
Jeanette Winterson,"We shall all die, and our lives will be irrelevant then."
Jeanette Winterson,"To me, life, for all its privations, is a luminous thing. You have to risk it."
Jeanette Winterson,"To create a past that seemed authentic but would be a fiction, you need an invented language."
Jeanette Winterson,There are so many separate selves; no one who writes creatively hasn't felt that.
Jeanette Winterson,The work that lasts over time is the work which still speaks to us when all contemporary interest in that work is extinct.
Jeanette Winterson,The curious are always in some danger. If you are curious you might never come home.
Jeanette Winterson,"Quest is at the heart of what I do-the holy grail, and the terror that you'll never find it, seemed a perfect metaphor for life."
Jeanette Winterson,"Ordinary professionalism and 20 years' experience can accomplish a lot, but it can't access the hidden places."
Jeanette Winterson,One room is always enough for one person. Two rooms is not enough for two people. That is one of the conundrums in life.
Jeanette Winterson,"Nobody knows anything about Shakespeare the person. It's all legend, it is all rumor."
Jeanette Winterson,My friends and the people who are close to me know what I am. And that is enough.
Jeanette Winterson,My characters are always on the outside; the spotlight's not on them. But they do get somewhere.
Jeanette Winterson,My books always begin with a sentence and an image - not necessarily connected.
Jeanette Winterson,Many people feel their outer self isn't the whole self.
Jeanette Winterson,"London is a small place, and it is very incestuous. People know where you live. Everybody is sort of on top of each other."

Jeanette Winterson,It is helpful for a woman artist not to have a husband.
Jeanette Winterson,"In my subconscious, my books were part of a single emotional journey."
Jeanette Winterson,"If you continually write and read yourself as a fiction, you can change what's crushing you."
Jeanette Winterson,"If we make anything that lasts, it outlives us."
Jeanette Winterson,I'm not a quitter.
Jeanette Winterson,"I wanted to invent myself as a fictional character. And I did, and it has caused a great deal of confusion."
Jeanette Winterson,"I wanted to cause trouble, but I know now it stays with you."
Jeanette Winterson,I think we still believe that ambition is for boys.
Jeanette Winterson,"I think people deceive themselves about themselves, particularly as they get older."
Jeanette Winterson,I think it would be very foolish not to take the irrational seriously.
Jeanette Winterson,"I think heterosexuality and homosexuality are a kind of psychosis, and the truth is somewhere in the middle."
Jeanette Winterson,"I never wanted children. If I'd been deeply in love with a man and he'd wanted children, it would have been difficult."
Jeanette Winterson,I never cared about money.
Jeanette Winterson,I like to think the price I paid by being open about my private life helped.
Jeanette Winterson,"I like to look at how people work together when they are put into stressful situations, when life stops being cozy."
Jeanette Winterson,I hated historical novels with fluttering cloaks.
Jeanette Winterson,I hate the word lesbian; it tells you nothing; its only purpose is to inflame.
Jeanette Winterson,I had relationships with men as well as women. I wasn't choosing; I didn't think I had to.
Jeanette Winterson,I don't write for any group. I write to bring about a change in consciousness.
Jeanette Winterson,I don't understand why people talk of art as a luxury when it's a mind-altering possibility.
Jeanette Winterson,"I don't read reviews because by then it's too late - whatever anyone says, the book won't change. It is written."
Jeanette Winterson,I don't believe in happy endings.
Jeanette Winterson,"I didn't mind being unpopular at school, because everyone else was a heathen."
Jeanette Winterson,I believe in communication; books communicate ideas and make bridges between people.
Jeanette Winterson,Everything in writing begins with language. Language begins with listening.
Jeanette Winterson,"Creative work is incredibly difficult, and that is where the tests lie."
Jeanette Winterson,"Confidence and superiority: It's the usual fundamentalist stuff: I've got the truth, and you haven't."
Jeanette Winterson,"Art saved me; it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence."
Jeanette Winterson,Anything outside marriage seems like freedom and excitement.
Jeanette Winterson,"Always in my books, I like to throw that rogue element into a stable situation and then see what happens."
Jeanette Winterson,"Academics love to make theories about a body of work, but each book consumes the writer and is the sum of his or her world."
Jeanette Winterson,I am not interested in genres. I am interested in doing the best work I can in whatever medium.
Jeanette Winterson,You play. You win. You play. You lose. You play.
Jeanette Winterson,I wanted to write a new fable and see how many rules you could break.
Jeanette Winterson,"However it is debased or misinterpreted, love is a redemptive feature. To focus on one individual so that their desires become superior to yours is a very cleansing experience."
Jeanette Winterson,"They say that every snowflake is different. If that were true, how could the world go on? How could we ever get up off our knees? How could we ever recover from the wonder of it?"
Jeanette Winterson,"You never give away your heart; you lend it from time to time. If it were not so, how could we take it back without asking?"
Jeanette Winterson,"There are many forms of love and affection, some people can spend their whole lives together without knowing each other's names. Naming is a difficult and time-consuming process; it concerns essences, and it means power. But on the wild nights who can call hyou home? Only the one who knows your name."
Jeanette Winterson,"I live alone, with cats, books, pictures, fresh vegetables to cook, the garden, the hens to feed."
Mary Wise,It was absolutely amazing to watch Jane's performance in game two. Eleven kills - that's just not done. She was in a total different zone. I don't know if we would have won that match if she had not had that performance.
Mary Wise,"Going into the match my hope was that I could play her for a long period so she could get into a rhythm, ... And I think that's what happened. The hitting errors came because she was just early, I have to think that's waiting a year and a half to hit."
Mary Wise,How many ways did Amber's absence affect us? ... I think today I can tell you. We are much further ahead in training camp because we're not trying to find a right side. We spent much of last year's preseason just filling that gap and now we don't have to do that. We're further along than we were a year ago.
Richard Wiseman,What his research seems to be saying is that women are the laughers and men get the laughs.
Richard Wiseman,social contract for disaster
Richard Wiseman,"Magicians are manipulating your consciousness. They are showing you something impossible. They're getting you to construct a narrative, which simply isn't true. So that means they know how to make you aware of certain things and blind to other things. What I'm hoping is that magic, this entertainment vehicle that has been around for a long time, will give us a real insight into the deep mysteries of consciousness."
Grant Wistrom,"It's kind of tough to say it's all for nothing, but we're back at zero now and we don't have anything to show for it."
Grant Wistrom,I couldn't be happier for him.
Grant Wistrom,"For the coach, I'm sure it's nice to coach when there's a lot less egos on the field."

Grant Wistrom,"That's Bryce for you. Now, I don't know much about his athletic ability ..."
Roby Witcher,The kids were ready to go. We really felt like the other night we should have won the basketball game and we gave ourselves the opportunity to do that  We're going to do the best we can in the bracket we are in. Sixth place is certainly better than watching the rest of the games from the stands.
Roby Witcher,"That's a good basketball team. We knew we would have to play very well to beat those guys. Unfortunately, we came up short."
Roby Witcher,"I hope it gets back to that. When we were growing up, guys my age practiced the outside shot or mid-range jump shot. These kids are practicing how high they can get up on the rim."
Jason Witten,"Julius has just done an unbelievable job of being the featured back and understanding that this team is going to go as far as he can take us as far as an offense. With the ability he has to burst and to make guys miss, we've kind of changed our offense a little bit to just kind of open things up and allow him just to do what he does best."
Jason Witten,"It is disappointing, to let these games slip down the stretch. That's when you have to play your best football. But to be in a situation, where we've still got a chance, that gives us a little bit of hope. ... If we can win those, we've still got a good chance."
Jason Witten,"All of us are very good friends, ... Its neat for us to be a part of it Some people came up and told me after the season, Wow, Shockey didnt have a very good year. Well he caught 60 passes. Its amazing the standards they have now for the position."
Mary Wittenberg,"Our women showed how gutsy, determined and talented they are,"
Mary Wittenberg,We predicted and hoped for a race for the ages. And we got one that will never be forgotten by those who saw it.
Mary Wittenberg,The race is on to remove the snow before it melts and potentially re-freezes as ice.
Mary Wittenberg,Monday is the start of two races. One of the races will be over in 2Â½ hours. The other race â€” to be the world's greatest marathoner â€” won't be over for 18 months.
Mary Wittenberg,The race is on to remove the snow before it melts and potentially refreezes as ice. This just keeps it all interesting.
Mary Wittenberg,I can't think of any other athlete any better to lead this event. He stands on the threshold of greatness.
Mary Wittenberg,"Alan Webb is a major international force as a mile and 1,500-meter runner. As we bring back the Fifth Avenue Mile to its old glory, I can't imagine a better athlete to lead the way."
Mary Wittenberg,"In my wildest dreams I didn't think we'd see races like this,"
Mary Wittenberg,"The beauty of our sport is it's a close-knit community. It's like a family, where sometimes you're better for the rivalries within it. But now we're at a point where we're only going to be better together."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"In order to be able to set a limit to thought, we should have to find both sides of the limit thinkable (i.e. we should have to be able to think what cannot be thought)."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,Our civilization is characterized by the word ''progress.'' Progress is its form rather than making progress being one of its features. Typically it constructs. It is occupied with building an ever more complicated structure. And even clarity is sought only
Ludwig Wittgenstein,A philosopher who is not taking part in discussions is like a boxer who never goes into the ring
Ludwig Wittgenstein,Philosophy is not a theory but an activity
Ludwig Wittgenstein,At the end of reasons comes persuasion
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"We regard the photograph, the picture on our wall, as the object itself (the man, landscape, and so on) depicted there. This need not have been so. We could easily imagine people who did not have this relation to such pictures. Who, for example, would be repelled by photographs, because a face without color and even perhaps a face in reduced proportions struck them as inhuman."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,The limits of my language mean the limits of my world
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"If we spoke a different language, we would perceive a somewhat different world."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"The real discovery is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to. - The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,For a large class of cases -- though not for all -- in which we employ the word ''meaning'' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"If you do know that here is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded"
Ludwig Wittgenstein,"Philosophy is like trying to open a safe with a combination lock: each little adjustment of the dials seems to achieve nothing, only when everything is in place does the door open."

Ludwig Wittgenstein,Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.
Ludwig Wittgenstein,Language is a part of our organism and no less complicated than it.
Ludwig Wittgenstein,Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.
Ludwig Wittgenstein,A man will be imprisoned in a room with a door that's unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does not occur to him to pull rather than push.

Ludwig Wittgenstein,"Never stay up on the barren heights of cleverness, but come down into the green valleys of silliness."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,One of the most misleading representational techniques in our language is the use of the word 'I.'
Ludwig Wittgenstein,The human body is the best picture of the human soul.
G. Wodehouse,She had a penetrating sort of laugh. Rather like a train going into a tunnel.
G. Wodehouse,"Golf... is the infallible test. The man who can go into a patch of rough alone, with the knowledge that only God is watching him, and play his ball where it lies, is the man who will serve you faithfully and well."
G. Wodehouse,"Has anybody ever seen a dramatic critic in the daytime? Of course not. They come out after dark, up to no good."
G. Wodehouse,Why don't you get a haircut? You look like a chrysanthemum.
G. Wodehouse,"Golf, like measles, should be caught young."
G. Wodehouse,"I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled."
G. Wodehouse,Few of them were to be trusted within reach of a trowel and a pile of bricks.
G. Wodehouse,"He was white and shaken, like a dry martini."
G. Wodehouse,"The cup of tea on arrival at a country house is a thing which, as a rule, I particularly enjoy. I like the crackling logs, the shaded lights, the scent of buttered toast, the general atmosphere of leisured cosiness."
G. Wodehouse,Sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character.
G. Wodehouse,"To find a man's true character, play golf with him."
G. Wodehouse,"It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them."

P. Wodehouse,Memories are like mulligatawny soup in a cheap restaurant. It is best not to stir them.
P. Wodehouse,I know I was writing stories when I was five. I don't know what I did before that. Just loafed I suppose.
P. Wodehouse,The least thing upset him on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows.
P. Wodehouse,"Every author really wants to have letters printed in the papers. Unable to make the grade, he drops down a rung of the ladder and writes novels."
P. Wodehouse,The fascination of shooting as a sport depends almost wholly on whether you are at the right or wrong end of the gun.
P. Wodehouse,There is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.

David Wolf,"We see some upside risk to the third quarter and further out balances on the back of energy (particularly natural gas) prices, which continue to sustain themselves at elevated levels."
David Wolf,"Don't eat the lasagna the night you land, ... And that hot shower, don't make it a long one. It's a little hard to stand up, especially when you're washing your hair and your head has to move. That can get you twirling around pretty good."
David Wolf,"It really comes down, more than anything else, to 'do you have a job?' and 'are you confident about keeping your job?'. If the answer to both of those are 'yes' then consumer confidence is going to be strong."
David Wolf,"If oil prices and gold prices go down, the Canadian dollar will go with them."
David Wolf,"Space is a non-forgiving environment, particularly during EVA. We accept some risks, as we do with every launch, because we know the benefits."
David Wolf,"Earthworks Entertainment are credible people in the entertainment industry and have had a number of successes, ... We want to work together and figure out how to bring the Big Dog character to life through media."
David Wolf,Was he a great genius? Was he an eccentric? Was he someone who was trying to raise his consciousness in a way people can't even imagine? He was on his own path and everybody gets to be their own judge listening to the stories people tell in the film.
David Wolf,"I seriously wonder if he would go to a premier of a movie about his life because he would have other things to do. He was not into the pomp and circumstance of celebrity or fame. He was into fulfilling his destiny of making art. And I think he would have been happy and bemused, but he would have probably been on his way to Horn Island."
David Wolf,"Disney has a business model predicated on the widest possible exposure of its media properties to drive attendance at its theme parks and purchases of home video and licensed products. Without broad, consistent local distribution of its films and TV shows in China, their model won't work."
David Wolf,"If the provinces' budgets get a little better and the federal budget a little worse, it can only be good for provincial bonds."
Dick Wolf,"It's like a long-term marriage. There are stresses and strains intermittently, but we are kind of stuck with each other."
Dick Wolf,"TV is not about ideas. It's about execution. And writing and casting. That's why most of TV drama's biggest stars have been character actors, not romantic leads. Peter Falk. Telly Savalas. Angela Lansbury. They can inhabit a role for years, and that's the TV challenge. I like to say a successful movie lasts 110 minutes. A successful TV series lasts 110 hours."
Dick Wolf,Conviction
Dick Wolf,Everyone connected with 'Conviction' is excited about being part of the breaking wave of a brand new technology.
Dick Wolf,"You have this disturbing reality that there are a lot of people who would rather say, 'I'm on strike' than 'I'm unemployed.' And those are the people who vote for strikes."
Dick Wolf,"When this strike is over, there will be fewer jobs. The people who were unemployed prior to the strike aren't going to be the first ones back to work."
Dick Wolf,"When it went on the air, the sales department hated it. It was the highest advertising pullout show in the history of NBC. At the early focus groups, people were saying, 'Who are these people? Why should we watch them?"
Dick Wolf,"Well, television has become an unforgiving environment and you don't get to make mistakes. That was the great thing about Universal in the old days."
Dick Wolf,"To quote General Patton, 'I don't like paying for the same real estate twice.' If it's not done, you say, 'This is not what we agreed on.'"
Dick Wolf,"TIVO executives stand up and say, 'Well, we're not getting rid of commercials, but we are letting them fast forward, because people like commercials, and if they see one that they like they stop and watch it.' I mean, please."
Dick Wolf,There was an interesting article in Los Angeles Magazine about women directors. A woman director makes one bad independent film and her career is over. Guys tend to get an opportunity to learn from their mistakes.
Dick Wolf,"There are professional negotiators working for the writers and the actors, but basically you've got the writers and actors negotiating against businessmen. That's why you get rhetoric."
Dick Wolf,"There are other options out there, after all, like read a book, go on the Internet, rent a movie."
Dick Wolf,"Their argument is that most shows are losers, which is true, but it's also disingenuous to say, 'We are not going to take the risk unless it is totally covered by the few successful shows that are out there.'"
Dick Wolf,The threat to free television. The reason television is free is because it is a life support system for commercials. That fundamental aspect is about to change.
Dick Wolf,"The story drove the book. That had a very seminal effect on the way I saw writing and storytelling. If you can set a character in a story that is compelling and has a backbone, you draw people in."
Dick Wolf,"The most positive step is to try to expand the employment base by making it, if not economically friendly, at least not economically disastrous, for studios to take on deficits."
Dick Wolf,"The heart and soul of network programming is series programming, the weekly repetition of characters you like having in your house."
Dick Wolf,"The great strikes of the '50s and '60s were bloody and awful, but at that point there were only three networks. Everyone came back to work."
Dick Wolf,"The environment doesn't change that radically. You are still going to go home at night and NBC is going to be there, ABC and CBS will still be there."
Dick Wolf,The agendas on the management side of the table now are not in sync like they used to be because you have vastly different entities supplying programming to networks.
Dick Wolf,The ad revenues still go up because nothing dependably delivers the eyeballs that successful series do.
Dick Wolf,"T.V. has to be edited and scored and everything else, and if you don't like what you're watching it can be a very painful process."
Dick Wolf,"People recognize certain things, like 'D' means 'this dialogue stinks.' We're dealing with shows that are written here, shot in New York and posted back here. Accurate communication is a necessity."
Dick Wolf,"People do have viewing patterns, and you disrupt those at your own peril. That's something that everybody learned after 1988. The numbers have gone down every year since that strike. Big time."
Dick Wolf,"It's show business. No show, no business."
Dick Wolf,"It's a very competitive business. And everybody I know who does it is extremely competitive, but they show it or don't show it in different ways."
Dick Wolf,It was like in Samoa when they'd put up a movie screen on the beach and show movies and the locals would run behind the sheet to see where the people went. It was pretty grim.
Dick Wolf,"If you're going to vote on a television contract, there is a certain rationality to saying that the same structures that are applied to Health Plan participation should be placed on the right to vote on a strike."
Dick Wolf,"If the scripts are not good, I'll tell somebody, 'This isn't good.'"
Dick Wolf,"I would say that if you really wished to be a working member of the community, don't go out on strike because then there's no work and no potential of work."
Dick Wolf,"I was running Miami Vice, but it wasn't my show so I got to learn an enormous amount. You were basically getting trained to have your own show."
Dick Wolf,"I was raised not to be rude, but I also try to get the best work out of people."
Dick Wolf,I try to just communicate what I want done as clearly and simply as possible.
Dick Wolf,I think most people don't react well to being screamed at. It's counterproductive.
Dick Wolf,I hardly see myself as a futurist.
Dick Wolf,"I get bored with establishing shots of people getting out of cars and walking into buildings, getting into elevators and then 45 seconds later they have a line."
Dick Wolf,"I don't think you can really make television based on what you think audiences want. You can only make stories that you like, because you have to watch it so many times."
Dick Wolf,I do love television. But the business is accelerating and people are not getting the chance to fail.
Dick Wolf,Everybody knows things are not the same. The people running the TV end of a major vertically integrated company know how much money a successful show can make.
Dick Wolf,"Drama or comedy programming is still the surest way for advertisers to reach a mass audience. Once that changes, all bets are off."
Dick Wolf,As soon as you become complacent your show gets canceled.
Dick Wolf,"And the consumer doesn't care. They don't watch networks, they watch TV shows."
Dick Wolf,Advertising is the art of the tiny. You have to tell a complete a story and deliver a complete message in a very encapsulated form. It disciplines you to cut away extraneous information.
Ron Wolf,I would think he's worth it. They might not.
Ron Wolf,There's no truth to it. That's just somebody writing something to write something. That's all speculation.
Ron Wolf,"The bottom line in today's game is that you pick for need, rather than picking for players. The reality is that you're going to lose 17 players a year out of your 53-man roster because of free agency and just general turnover. Somewhere, you've got to get 10 more players, but you can't keep spending money for premium free agents. It's how you fill those needs, and a lot of them have to come from the draft."
Ron Wolf,"They come from everywhere. They have zone dogs, zone blitzes."
David Wolfe,"They've raised their risk hurdle in the short term, ... They're owning more assets when the industry is under siege. But if they didn't make a move they'd be in trouble."
David Wolfe,"If the lilacs bloomed earlier, it could mean we had a milder winter, so look out for potential insect outbreaks."
David Wolfe,"The brand redesigned, reinvented and repositioned itself to appeal to a younger, more fashion-aware  though far from cutting-edge  customer."
David Wolfe,"I will keep doing what I'm doing, no matter where I'm at. I'm truly excited about where fashion is finally headed."
David Wolfe,"When the history of 20th century fashion is written, he is going to be one of the stars. He almost single-handedly put Milan on the fashion map. He expressed a new kind of masculinity with less structured men's wear - historically, his men's wear is more significant than his women's wear."
David Wolfe,White is going to be pushed so hard in the fashion media I think it's going to be a winner.
David Wolfe,What he did for Chanel made fashion history and changed the direction of status brands. And his H&M deal was an extraordinary thing to do. He's the bravest of them all - he takes chances and they all seem to pay off.
David Wolfe,"They aren't old because their customers aren't old. The problem with Blass was that the ladies he dressed started dying of old age. Ladies today go to the gym, they go to the surgeon, they look better than ever. Dying is not an option."
David Wolfe,"I'm good at my job for a midwestern American. Maybe it's because people in fashion often mistake common sense for genius. I mean, some model walks down the runway in an impossible outfit, and I state the obvious  no one is going to wear that  and people are like, you're brilliant!"
David Wolfe,"They say that, given the improvements in Charlotte's situation and given her continuing improvement, the doctors should not have in their back pockets an open consent from the court to let Charlotte die regardless of the circumstances at the time and regardless of the views of her parents."
David Wolfe,"If my motion for a 14-year continuance was inappropriate, then certainly the sheriff's action is just as inappropriate. I don't know what possible motivation the sheriff had for his actions."

James Wolfe,There is such a choice of difficulties that I am myself at a loss how to determine.

James Wolfe,You know too well the forces which compose their army to dread their superior numbers.
James Wolfe,"The impossibility of a retreat makes no difference in the situation of men resolved to conquer or die; and, believe me, my friends, if your conquest could be bought with the blood of your general, he would most cheerfully resign a life which he has long devoted to his country."
James Wolfe,"The formidable Heights of Abraham are now surmounted; and the city of Quebec, the object of all our toils, now stands in full view before us."
James Wolfe,"Possessed with a full confidence of the certain success which British valor must gain over such enemies, I have led you up these steep and dangerous rocks, only solicitous to show you the foe within your reach."
James Wolfe,"I congratulate you, my brave countrymen and fellow soldiers, on the spirit and success with which you have executed this important part of our enterprise."
James Wolfe,"A few regular troops from old France, weakened by hunger and sickness, who, when fresh, were unable to withstand the British soldiers, are their general's chief dependence."
James Wolfe,"Now God be praised, I will die in peace."
Linda Wolfe,We just didn't want to have an inner-city school-type situation.
Linda Wolfe,"In Brandon, everybody kind of owns the school."
Linda Wolfe,Many of them also have other issues including a lack of transportation. Parents may have to miss time from work to take their child to the doctor and that can be an issue for a low-income family as well.
Sidney Wolfe,"be able to get away with twisting the truth a little bit, enough to convince patients to go to their doctors [and] to convince their doctors to prescribe the drug."
Sidney Wolfe,"There's no unique evidence of any benefit, and there's still persistent evidence of risk."
Sidney Wolfe,"A critical part of improving the system for drug safety is remembering, admitting and learning from past mistakes."
Sidney Wolfe,To put out a guideline that reiterates existing law and regulations is a stunt.

Thomas Wolfe,Making the world safe for hypocrisy.
Thomas Wolfe,"Le Corbusier was the sort of relentlessly rational intellectual that only France loves wholeheartedly, the logician who flies higher and higher in ever-decreasing circles until, with one last, utterly inevitable induction, he disappears up his own fundamental aperture and emerges in the fourth dimension as a needle-thin umber bird."
Thomas Wolfe,"All things on earth point home in old October; sailors to sea, travellers to walls and fences, hunters to field and hollow and the long voice of the hounds, the lover to the love he has forsaken."
Thomas Wolfe,Fields are won by those who believe in the winning.
Thomas Wolfe,"Publishing is a very mysterious business. It is hard to predict what kind of sale or reception a book will have, and advertising seems to do very little good."

Thomas Wolfe,Loneliness is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man.
Thomas Wolfe,The notion that the public accepts or rejects anything in modern art is merely romantic fiction. The game is completed and the trophies distributed long before the public knows what has happened.
Thomas Wolfe,"It is very comforting to believe that leaders who do terrible things are, in fact, mad. That way, all we have to do is make sure we don't put psychotics in high places and we've got the problem solved."
Thomas Wolfe,"If a man has talent and can't use it, he's failed. If he uses only half of it, he has partly failed. If he uses the whole of it, he has succeeded, and won a satisfaction and triumph few men ever know."
Thomas Wolfe,"At the outset, at least, all three groups had something else to recommend them, as well: They were headquartered 3,000 miles away from the East Side of Manhattan."
Thomas Wolfe,"We are always acting on what has just finished happening. It happened at least 1/30th of a second ago. We think we're in the present, but we aren't. The present we know is only a movie of the past."
Thomas Wolfe,The reason a writer writes a book is to forget a book and the reason a reader reads one is to remember it.
Thomas Wolfe,There are some people who have the quality of richness and joy in them and they communicate it to everything they touch. It is first of all a physical quality; then it is a quality of the spirit.
Thomas Wolfe,"This is the artist, then, life's hungry man, the glutton of eternity, beauty's miser, glory's slave."
Thomas Wolfe,"Not even the most powerful organs of the press, including Time, Newsweek, and The New York Times, can discover a new artist or certify his work and make it stick. They can only bring you the scores."
Thomas Wolfe,There is no spectacle on earth more appealing than that of a beautiful woman in the act of cooking dinner for someone she loves.

Alice Wonderland,The Night Before Christmas.
Alice Wonderland,was at the time thought to be rather bold. Reading these books wasn't quite like being in a secret society or a clique. But it certainly made you feel different from a lot of people in Leeds and they did put you in touch with a wider world.
Alan Wong,"It won't put us under, but it could hurt. We have to see what our competitors do. We might be able to pass a little along to our customers but if we increase our costs we could lose some business."

Alex Wong,U.S. markets are starting to worry about the earnings of multinational companies in the face of the strong dollar.
Alex Wong,"The market is drawing support from several factors, including follow-through buying of HSBC."
Alex Wong,"The market seems to have found support at 15,300 this morning. I think the fact that Nasdaq recovered on bargain hunting in some tech stocks in late trade on Wednesday has stopped stocks falling so sharply here."
Alex Wong,PCCW still has more upside potential but I think we will see some resistance when it reaches HK$15.5.
Alex Wong,"PCCW still has more upside potential but I think we will see some resistance when it reaches HK$15.5,"
Alex Wong,The market is down on Wall Street's performance but it may rebound from here because Hutchison and Cheung Kong don't seem to have too much downside and China Mobile's share price in the U.S. didn't fall too sharply overnight.
Alex Wong,"The market is down on Wall Street's performance but it may rebound from here because Hutchison and Cheung Kong don't seem to have too much downside and China Mobile's share price in the U.S. didn't fall too sharply overnight,"
Alex Wong,The decline today was a disappointing end to the year. The weak performance was attributable to weak Asian stocks as well as profit-taking after recent gains.
Alex Wong,"There probably isn't too much downside from here. The performance of other Asian markets is quite encouraging so I think the index may hold above 16,000 and maybe rise to 16,250 later in the day."
Alex Wong,Financials are the natural choice for bargain hunters because retail sales in the U.S. were weak so investors feel the upside for interest rates may be less than expected.

Andrea Wong,"By midseason, I think viewers will be hungry for the return of 'Stars' and 'Bachelor,' ... Both shows, with their romance and glitter, are the perfect antidote to cold, snowy January."
Andrea Wong,"From my perspective, I'll take a great idea from wherever it comes."
Andrea Wong,"What's important is that it's going to bring talent to the marketplace and expose great new creative ideas. Ultimately, that's great for our industry."
Andrea Wong,"I've frequently said that fall is a bad time to launch reality programming. The audience has a real hunger to check out the new dramas and comedies this time of year, so we elected to not launch any new shows."
Andrea Wong,"American audiences, when they sit down to watch TV, like to be taken on a roller coaster ride. They don't like subtlety."
Andrea Wong,There's never been anything to put a dent in it. There continues to be a huge appetite for the show.

Beatrice Wood,"You see, I was never stage-struck the way most girls were."

John Wooden,Be prepared and be honest.
John Wooden,"Don't measure yourself by what you have accomplished, but what you should have accomplished with your ability."
John Wooden,Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.
John Wooden,Never mistake activity for achievement.
John Wooden,"It isn't what you do, but how you do it."
John Wooden,"Consider the rights of others before your own feelings, and the feelings of others before your own rights."
John Wooden,"Failure is not fatal, but failure to change might be."
John Wooden,You can't live a perfect day without doing something for someone who will never be able to repay you.
John Wooden,"There are many things that are essential to arriving at true peace of mind, and one of the most important is faith, which cannot be acquired without prayer."
John Wooden,The main ingredient of stardom is the rest of the team.
John Wooden,Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
John Wooden,It's the little details that are vital. Little things make big things happen.
John Wooden,A coach is someone who can give correction without causing resentment.
John Wooden,What you are as a person is far more important that what you are as a basketball player.
John Wooden,"I liked quickness very much and Pete had it. And I really liked his acceptance of the role he had. He didn't get to play nearly as much as he expected to when he came, but he accepted it."
John Wooden,Ability is a poor man's wealth.
John Wooden,Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
Bob Woodruff,"When I realized there was a job that existed in this world where I could be in the middle of huge world events and actually get paid for it, it was an epiphany for me."
Bob Woodruff,"What's good for the viewers is good for us personally. One of the fears that Peter expressed to me over the years was that once you get to this chair, once you get to this position, you're not able to go out to the big stories and the things you've always loved your whole life as a journalist to do."
Bob Woodruff,"It's really good for the reporters in the field, too, to know that when they do all this work and sometimes risk their lives to do it, there's a place that an audience can find it."
Paul Woodruff,reasoning without knowledge depends on working out what is most reasonable to believe. What is most reasonable to believe is the view which best survives adversary debate.
Paul Woodruff,"If it is not controversial, it is not about democracy. If it is not dangerous, if it does not ask us to consider changes that frighten the establishment, it is not about democracy."
Paul Woodruff,"I've taught here 33 years, and during those years, the deans of the larger colleges have become increasingly powerful, especially in their control over undergraduate advising and education. For the central administration to take a role in undergraduate education would be a revolutionary change."
David Woods,Wisdom comes with age - it's knowing that you don't know.
David Woods,Money is the biggest cause of friction in a marriage.
David Woods,"I am not so negative. It may not be what we want, but it does not have to be a failure."
David Woods,You need to make a budget - and saving needs to be part of it.
James Woods,"When I was in high school, we were all laboring under the illusion, or maybe it was a reality, that everyone in our school was a virgin."
James Woods,Do you think I want to be the one lone voice against the Hollywood liberal establishment? It's not going to do me any good.
James Woods,"Sometimes the way you respond to horrific, evil deeds is the measure of one's self as a man, as a nation, as people, as a community."
James Woods,You could see all this fire and smoke and electricity flying everywhere. You could see arcs of electricity. It was just crazy.
John Woods,"There's no consequence to them because Nova Scotia Power has been coddling these electric-heat customers and not forcing them to pay the cost they have been incurring,"
John Woods,"Many of these electric-heat customers, although they're found in the residential class, really behave very much like a commercial customer, yet they are being priced as a residential."
John Woods,My involvement has been nonstop since basketball ended.
Tiger Woods,"I don't know if I even have an aura, man. I just try to win."
Tiger Woods,"My dad has always taught me these words: care and share. That's why we put on clinics. The only thing I can do is try to give back. If it works, it works."
Tiger Woods,"Patience was the key today. I played a couple of bad shots but made key putts, didn't drop any shots and kept the momentum going,"
Tiger Woods,It played hard. It (the wind) was down off the left when I hit. When Robert (Allenby) hit it was in off the right. The wind was just swirling enough where it made it a little bit difficult.
Tiger Woods,"The thing is, you see all the money that's available out there. I see where am I going to play. I have no place to play yet. I'm not exempt. I have no security. So if I don't turn pro and I don't make it out here, where am I going to go? Nike? Hooters? Asia? Anywhere but here, I guess."
Tiger Woods,I hope they learn some things that will help their golf game grow.
Tiger Woods,Pretty high. It's fun to see that all of the hard work that Hank and I have been putting into it is starting to pay off.
Tiger Woods,"He's a guy that understands how to play the golf course. Experience helps a lot on this golf course -- where to miss it, how to play it, the angles you need to have."
Tiger Woods,"The only thing you can do is take a learning experience from it, positives and negatives, and apply them to the future. What did you do right, what did you do wrong, and I did a lot of things right this week,"
Tiger Woods,"I've fallen in love with the course, and the environment. I've never been a fan of TPC courses, so it's nice to play old-school courses like this one that are laid out right in front of you. It's not one of the hardest, but it's fair and you know you have to go low."
Tiger Woods,"Her focus, her determination, her preparation over the winter months ... people don't realize how hard she works. She didn't get to this level by just hoping she could play well."
Tiger Woods,"Well, dad wasn't feeling well and it's just the same stuff, just tried to go out there and hopefully make his spirits a little better. Just trying to make him understand that I love him dearly and want him to hang in there and keep fighting, which he always does. He's a very stubborn man, which is good."
Tiger Woods,"The Player of the Year means a lot because it's from your peers. That is like the ultimate compliment. The money list doesn't really interest me that much only because if you play more, you have a better chance of making more money and I don't play that many events. I'm concentrating on the bigger events. If I can win more events than anyone in a year and more majors than anyone in a year, it's going to be a great year."
Tiger Woods,"One of the things that my parents have taught me is never listen to other people's expectations. You should live your own life and live up to your own expectations, and those are the only things I really care about it."
Tiger Woods,"Dad is doing better. He's my best friend. Any time you can spend as much time with your parents that you truly love, especially when he wasn't feeling all that well, it meant the world to me."
Tiger Woods,"Hundreds of balls, and you might only make one. That's a shot ... once in a lifetime."
Tiger Woods,"Michael left because of the Bulls' management, not because he'd lost his love of playing the game."
Tiger Woods,It will always be the ball and me.
Tiger Woods,"If you are given a chance to be a role model, I think you should always take it because you can influence a person's life in a positive light, and that's what I want to do. That's what it's all about."
Tiger Woods,"I'm not as far along as Jack Nicklaus was at this age, but I'm trying."
Tiger Woods,I'm aware if I'm playing at my best I'm tough to beat. And I enjoy that.
Tiger Woods,I want to be what I've always wanted to be: dominant.
Tiger Woods,"I love to play golf, and that's my arena. And you can characterize it and describe it however you want, but I have a love and a passion for getting that ball in the hole and beating those guys."
Tiger Woods,"Don't force your kids into sports. I never was. To this day, my dad has never asked me to go play golf. I ask him. It's the child's desire to play that matters, not the parent's desire to have the child play. Fun. Keep it fun."
Tiger Woods,"As a kid, I might have been psycho, I guess, but I used to throw golf balls in the trees and try and somehow make par from them. I thought that was fun."
Tiger Woods,"And I don't cook, either. Not as long as they still deliver pizza."
Tiger Woods,You can always become better.
Tiger Woods,"If money titles meant anything, I'd play more tournaments. The only thing that means a lot to me is winning. If I have more wins than anybody else and win more majors than anybody else in the same year, then it's been a good year."
Tiger Woods,"Green and black go well together, don't they?"
Tiger Woods,"I did envisage being this successful as a player, but not all the hysteria around it off the golf course."
Tiger Woods,I'm addicted. I'm addicted to golf.
Tiger Woods,My main focus is on my game.
Tiger Woods,Hockey is a sport for white men. Basketball is a sport for black men. Golf is a sport for white men dressed like black pimps.
Tiger Woods,I get to play golf for a living. What more can you ask for - getting paid for doing what you love.
Mike Woodson,I am extremely excited to add a player of Joe's background to our team. He is a great young talent. Atlanta will soon learn how important it was to finalize this deal.
Mike Woodson,"I am extremely excited to add a player of Joe's background to our team, ... He is a great young talent. Atlanta will soon learn how important it was to finalize this deal."
Mike Woodson,"He is a great young talent in our league and when you couple him with the young talent we currently have on the roster, I can't wait to see them mesh as a unit."
Mike Woodson,"I don't agree that it's a risk either way,"
Mike Woodson,We can't get a reputation for being a team that can't get to the free throw line and can't finish games.
Mike Woodson,"They got the job done, and that's the nice thing about our team now. They're playing, they get down, and they don't think they're down. They're playing to win and that's what it's all about."
Mike Woodson,"There are a lot of guys who are probably going to hate me in the next few weeks, ... Mostly because we're going to work harder than these guys ever have. We're going to work 10 times harder than we did last year because we know we have that much more work to do."
Mike Woodson,"That's the funny thing when you're dealing with young guys, 19-year-olds,"
Mike Woodson,"The bottom line is that I'm going to fight for my team. They're fighting for me, I'm going to fight for them. I don't know what Josh did for his technical. He was mad because he fouled out of the game. He didn't say anything to the official."
Mike Woodson,"They are our two best players, and these young guys look up to them. They've got to lead by example, and they've been doing that. And I think when they do that, the young guys see that and get excited about the things that are going on around them."
Mike Woodson,I don't have any complaints with our crew. They are playing hard and we have been in every game we've played this year.
Mike Woodson,Lang has an NBA body. We'll get a good week of practice in next week with just two games and then we can see where he can fit in.
Mike Woodson,"There's a standard of behavior in the locker room, on the floor and everywhere else that I think you have to uphold as a good teammate that just isn't there. I'm not going to tolerate it. Not from Salim or anyone else on this team."
Mike Woodson,"We were aggressive tonight. When we got into the paint, we took advantage of it. We attempted 49 free throws, that's a season-high for us."
Bob Woodward,I have to go to the prosecutor. I have to tell the truth.
Bob Woodward,"It's a story of how he does his job,"
Bob Woodward,"Given Cheney's background on national security going back to the Ford years, his time on the House Intelligence Committee, and as secretary of defense, Bush said at the top of his list of things he wanted Cheney to do was intelligence. In the first months of the new administration, Cheney made the rounds of the intelligence agencies - the CIA, the National Security Agency, which intercepted communications, and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency."
Bob Woodward,I explained in detail that I was trying to protect my sources. That's job No. 1 in a case like this. I hunkered down. I'm in the habit of keeping secrets. I didn't want anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed.
Bob Woodward,I explained in detail that I was trying to protect my sources. That's job No. 1 in a case like this. I hunkered down. I'm in the habit of keeping secrets. I didn't want to do anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed.
Bob Woodward,"I explained in detail that I was trying to protect my sources. That's job No. 1 in a case like this, ... I hunkered down. I'm in the habit of keeping secrets. I didn't want anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed."
Bob Woodward,"I hunkered down. I'm in the habit of keeping secrets, ... I didn't want anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed."
Bob Woodward,I hunkered down. I'm in the habit of keeping secrets. I didn't want anything out there that was going to get me subpoenaed.
Bob Woodward,"Obviously the publishers, because of historical curiosity or the significance of it, I think expected more, ... It obviously was not as much as some of my other books, but I don't know how much a writer can get involved in trying to second-guess that."
Bob Woodward,"This is the old crowd kind of re-launching the wars of Watergate, and saying let's make the conduct of the sources we used the issue, rather then their own. The record of Watergate crimes is staggering, voluminous and irrefutable"
Bob Woodward,I think it was a great experience for us to play some very good competition. That's why we go; hopefully this will make us better for the rest of the season.
Bob Woodward,We're not going to have another Watergate in our lifetime. I'm sure.
Bob Woodward,We need to police ourselves in the media.
Bob Woodward,"Way before Watergate, senior administration officials hid behind anonymity."
Bob Woodward,Watergate provides a model case study of the interaction and powers of each of the branches of government. It also is a morality play with a sad and dramatic ending.
Bob Woodward,Watergate is an immensely complicated scandal with a cast of characters as varied as a Tolstoy novel.
Bob Woodward,"Using these unnamed sources, if done properly, carefully and fairly, provides more accountability in government."
Bob Woodward,"There's hostility to lying, and there should be."
Bob Woodward,"There may yet be another Watergate book. I have thought a book about the aftermath of Watergate and its impact could be done, perhaps by me or someone else."
Bob Woodward,"There is a garbage culture out there, where we pour garbage on people. Then the pollsters run around and take a poll and say, do you smell anything?"
Bob Woodward,There are people who take rumors and embellish them in a way that can be devastating. And this pollution has to be eradicated by people in our business as best we can.
Bob Woodward,"The Washington Times wrote a story questioning the authenticity of some of the suggestions made about me in Silent Coup. But as a believer in the First Amendment, I believe they have more than a right to air their views."
Bob Woodward,The source known as Deep Throat provided a kind of road map through the scandal. His one consistent message was that the Watergate burglary was just the tip of the iceberg.
Bob Woodward,The number of illegal activities were so large that one was bound to come out and lead to the uncovering of the others. Nixon was too willing to use the power of government to settle scores and get even with enemies.
Bob Woodward,"The legislator learns that when you talk a lot, you get in trouble. You have to listen a lot to make deals."
Bob Woodward,"The failure of the system to deal quickly was attributable to Nixon's lying, stonewalling and refusal to come clean. So it took 26 months for the final truth to be known."
Bob Woodward,"The fact of the Watergate cover-up is not nearly as interesting as the step into making the cover-up. And when you understand the step, you understand that Richard Nixon lied. That he was a criminal."
Bob Woodward,The central dilemma in journalism is that you don't know what you don't know.
Bob Woodward,"The biggest rap on me is that I don't find a Watergate every couple of years. Well, Watergate was unique. It's not something Carl Bernstein, I, or the Washington Post caused."
Bob Woodward,Suppose Watergate had not been uncovered? I'd still be on the City Desk.
Bob Woodward,Some newspapers have a hands-off policy on favored politicians. But it's generally very small newspapers or local TV stations.
Bob Woodward,Not a season passes without new disclosures showing Nixon's numerous attempts at criminal use of his presidential powers and in fact the scorn he held for the rule of law.
Bob Woodward,"Nixon's grand mistake was his failure to understand that Americans are forgiving, and if he had admitted error early and apologized to the country, he would have escaped."
Bob Woodward,Nixon's attempts to order subversion of various departments was bound to come out in some form.
Bob Woodward,"Nixon had some large achievements in foreign affairs. They will be remembered. But a president probably gets remembered for one thing, and Watergate will head the Nixon list, I suspect."
Bob Woodward,"Newspapers that are truly independent, like The Washington Post, can still aggressively investigate anyone or anything with no holds barred."
Bob Woodward,"Many people have their reputations as reporters and analysts because they are on television, batting around conventional wisdom. A lot of these people have never reported a story."
Bob Woodward,"Lawyers didn't seriously get involved in the Watergate stories until quite late, when we realized we were on to something."
Bob Woodward,It was accountability that Nixon feared.
Bob Woodward,"If you interviewed 1,000 politicians and asked about whether the media's too soft or too hard, about 999 would say too hard."
Bob Woodward,"If information is true, if it can be verified, and if it's really important, the newspaper needs to be willing to take the risk associated with using unidentified sources."
Bob Woodward,"I'm not going to name some of my colleagues who are very well-known for their television presentation, but they wouldn't know new information or how to report a story if it came up and bit them."
Bob Woodward,"I think people are smart enough to sort it out. They know when they're watching one of these food fight shows where journalists sit around and yell and scream at each other, versus serious issue reporting."
Bob Woodward,"I think journalism gets measured by the quality of information it presents, not the drama or the pyrotechnics associated with us."
Bob Woodward,I suspect there have been a number of conspiracies that never were described or leaked out. But I suspect none of the magnitude and sweep of Watergate.
Bob Woodward,"I recently read some of the transcripts of Nixon's Watergate tapes, and they spent hours trying to figure out who was leaking and providing information to Carl and myself."
Bob Woodward,I recently did the David Letterman Show about my book. He was very serious and made no jokes and it caught me off guard a little bit. He was much more serious than some of the joke shows that journalists get on.
Bob Woodward,"I have gone on the air and announced my telephone number at the Washington Post. I go into the night, talking to people, looking for things. The great dreaded thing every reporter lives with is what you don't know. The source you didn't go to. The phone call you didn't return."
Bob Woodward,I have found people don't want to be told. That they can figure it out.
Bob Woodward,"I give lectures for money, but all the money goes to charity. So, I make no money from it."
Bob Woodward,I gave my word that this source would not be identified unless he changed his mind. He has not.
Bob Woodward,"I don't think there will ever be a permanent truce, but I believe the media needs to be more careful and be willing to count to 10 before rushing on the air or into print."
Bob Woodward,I don't think it's useful for somebody to argue with reviews.
Bob Woodward,"I deal with first-hand sources. And give the people, even John Sununu, the opportunity to respond to what I've been told by first-hand sources."
Bob Woodward,"I believe Watergate shows that the system did work. Particularly the Judiciary and the Congress, and ultimately an independent prosecutor working in the Executive Branch."
Bob Woodward,I believe there's too little patience and context to many of the investigations I read or see on television.
Bob Woodward,Even now there is no evidence that anyone involved in the Nixon operation was going to threaten us.
Bob Woodward,"Deep Throat's information, and in my view, courage, allowed the newspaper to use what he knew and suspected."
Bob Woodward,Deep Throat was a very unfortunate name given to the source by the managing editor of The Washington Post.
Bob Woodward,Deep Throat did serve the public interest by providing the guidance and information to us.
Bob Woodward,Clinton... believes that the Washington Press Corps is so out of touch that it is absolutely inconceivable that reporters would understand the issues that people are really dealing with in their lives.
Bob Woodward,"Clinton feels a profound alienation from the Washington culture here, and I happen to agree with him."
Bob Woodward,"Because of Watergate in part, I am kind of a magnet for calls and information and suggestions."
Bob Woodward,A reporter's ability to keep the bond of confidentiality often enables him to learn the hidden or secret aspects of government.
Bob Woodward,I think that everyone is kind of confused about the information they get from the media and rightly so. I'm confused about the information I get from the media.
Bob Woodward,"When you hear in the tape recordings Nixon's own voice saying, We have to stonewall, We have to lie to the Grand Jury, We have to pay burglars a million dollars, it's all too clear the horror of what went on."
Bob Woodward,"People like to pigeonhole and say, Well, I'm a Washington insider, and you know, that's quite silly. What does that even mean?"
Adam Woodworth,"Kids can get bored just looking at things. But if they can touch it, throw it, pull it or push it, they really enjoy it. I should know this. I have two children (Tyler, 10, and Alyssa, 4). Right now our target-age group is up to probably 7-year-olds. But we get kids 8, 9, 10 and 11 who have a really good time with it. I want kids to walk out of here saying they've had a really good time. For me, it's really rewarding to see smiles."
Adam Woodworth,There is also an area with an inclined track where kids can build a kite then fly it around the room. The kids then take the kite home. We have a water table in the shape of a leaf where several kids can gather around with water toys and explore.
Adam Woodworth,It's really moving to see this kind of support for the museum from the Oak Lawn community and the area.
Alexander Woollcott,His huff arrived and he departed in it.
Alexander Woollcott,It comes from the likes of you! Take what you can get! Grab the chances as they come along! Act in hallways! Sing in doorways! Dance in cellars!
Alexander Woollcott,"All the things I really like to do are either immoral, illegal or fattening."
Alexander Woollcott,"At 83 Shaw's mind was perhaps not quite as good as it used to be, but it was still better than anyone else's."
Alexander Woollcott,Many of us spend half of our time wishing for things we could have if we didn't spend half our time wishing.
Alexander Woollcott,Germany was the cause of Hitler as much as Chicago is responsible for the Chicago Tribune.
Alexander Woollcott,"Nothing risque, nothing gained."
Alexander Woollcott,There is no such thing in anyone's life as an unimportant day.
Alexander Woollcott,"Everything I like is either illegal, immoral or fattening."
Alexander Woollcott,"All the things I really like are either immoral, illegal or fattening."
Alexander Woollcott,The English have an extraordinary ability for flying into a great calm.
Alexander Woollcott,I'm tired of hearing it said that democracy doesn't work. Of course it doesn't work. We are supposed to work it.
Bob Woolmer,But as he walks away he can be proud that many people all around the world are sad to see him go - cricket will be poorer without him.
Bob Woolmer,We had a bad day basically while India played very good cricket and I have to give credit to them for batting and bowling well. We were thrashed.
Bob Woolmer,We had three very good pitches for the series against England (last month) and I believe good pitches produce good cricket.
Ian Woosnam,I've got no objection to women coming into our game if they are good enough.
Ian Woosnam,"I thought, 'Great, I've been practicing my putting all night,"
Ian Woosnam,It's a place I absolutely love and adore. I've missed the cut the last couple of years. It would be nice to make the cut and hopefully challenge some way or other.
Ian Woosnam,It's very useful for people with high-profile jobs.
Ian Woosnam,I hurt my shoulder on the fifth tee - just hitting it too hard when you're too old.
Ian Woosnam,I didn't ask him about that. We were just trying to play the golf course and concentrate on not letting it beat us up too much.
Ian Woosnam,I tried some different swing thoughts round the golf course and got it going. I want to win some money and get up that Order of Merit and get some confidence going.
Ian Woosnam,"getting to know what a person is like, his character and what sort of game he has. It's a captain's job to get to know these guys a bit more."
Ian Woosnam,"In America they are very much individuals. That's what (U.S. captain) Tom Lehman's job is, to get them to play more as a team, practice together."
John Wooten,The athlete who says it can't be done should not get in the way of the one who is doing it.
John Wooten,I told Harry he had earned the honor so why take your name off the list when deep down in your heart you know you want to get in some day. I think Harry has learned from the experience.
John Wooten,"I have great faith in Dan Rooney and the commissioner,"
William Wordsworth,"Three sleepless nights I passed in sounding on,Through words and things, a dim and perilous way."
William Wordsworth,Wisdom married to immortal verse.
William Wordsworth,"Up! up! my friend, and clear your looks;Why all this toil and trouble?"
William Wordsworth,"I traveled among unknown men, in lands beyond the sea; nor England! did I know till then what love I bore to thee."
William Wordsworth,And the most difficult of tasks to keepHeights which the soul is competent to gain.
William Wordsworth,A deep distress hath humanized my Soul.

William Wordsworth,"A reasoning, self-sufficing thing, An intellectual all-in-all!"
William Wordsworth,"Give unto me, made lowly wise,/ The spirit of self-sacrifice."
William Wordsworth,"A few strong instincts, and a few plain rules."
William Wordsworth,Rest and be thankful.
William Wordsworth,Lost in a gloom of uninspired research.
William Wordsworth,"The grim shape/ Towered up between me and the stars, and still,/ For so it seemed, with purpose of its own/ And measured motion like a living thing,/ Strode after me."
William Wordsworth,What is pride? A rocket that emulates the stars
William Wordsworth,What is pride? A whizzing rocket that would emulate a star.
William Wordsworth,Rapt into still communion that transcends/ The imperfect offices of prayer and praise.
William Wordsworth,"She dwelt among the untrodden ways Beside the springs of Dove, A maid whom there were none to praise And very few to love."
William Wordsworth,"Because the good old ruleSufficeth them, the simple plan,That they should take, who have the power,And they should keep who can."
William Wordsworth,"[Poetry] contains a natural delineation of human passions, human characters, and human incidents."
William Wordsworth,Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility
William Wordsworth,By our own spirits are we deified:We Poets in our youth begin in gladness;But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.
William Wordsworth,Never to blend our pleasure or our prideWith sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.
William Wordsworth,"Neither evil tongues, rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life, shall ever prevail against us."
William Wordsworth,"Strange fits of passion have I known:/ And I will dare to tell,/ But in the lover's ear alone,/ What once to me befell."
William Wordsworth,"But, why, ungrateful, dwell on idle pain?"
William Wordsworth,"As in the eye of Nature he has lived,So in the eye of Nature let him die!"
William Wordsworth,To her fair works did Nature linkThe human soul that through me ran. . . .
William Wordsworth,Thou unassuming commonplaceOf Nature.
William Wordsworth,Come forth into the light of things; Let nature be your Teacher.
William Wordsworth,"Why do not words and kiss, and solemn pledge, And nature that is kind in woman's breast, And reason that in man is wise and good, And fear of Him who is a righteous Judge - Why do not these prevail for human life, To keep two hearts together, that be"
William Wordsworth,She seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of earthly years.
William Wordsworth,He murmurs near the running brooksA music sweeter than their own.
William Wordsworth,"Hearing often-times the still, sad music of humanity, nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power to chasten and subdue."
William Wordsworth,"Where the statue stood/ Of Newton with his prism and silent face,/ The marble index of a mind for ever/ Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone."
William Wordsworth,In years that bring the philosophic mind.
William Wordsworth,"O Reader! had you in your mindSuch stores as silent thought can bring,O gentle Reader! you would findA tale in everything."
William Wordsworth,"[A] mind forever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone."
William Wordsworth,"Men are we, and must grieve when even the shadeOf that which once was great, is passed away."
William Wordsworth,"How men livedEven next-door neighbors, as we say, yet stillStrangers, not knowing each the other's name."
William Wordsworth,An unexampled voice of awful memory.
William Wordsworth,"Rapine, avarice, expense, This is idolatry; and these we adore;  Plain living and high thinking are no more"
William Wordsworth,". . . I would stand,If the night blackened with a coming storm,Beneath some rock, listening to notes that areThe ghostly language of the ancient earth,Or make their dim abode in distant winds.Thence did I drink the visionary power;And deem not profitless those fleeting moodsOf shadowy exultation: not for this,That they are kindred to our purer mindAnd intellectual life; but that the soul,Remembering how she felt, but what she feltRemembering not, retains an obscure senseOf possible sublimity. . . ."
William Wordsworth,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!  Shades of the prison-house begin to close upon the growing boy

William Wordsworth,A day spent in a round of strenuous idleness.
William Wordsworth,"Turning, for them who pass, the common dustOf servile opportunity to gold."
William Wordsworth,"Great God! I'd rather be A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn"
William Wordsworth,"Science appears but what in truth she is,/ Not as our glory and our absolute boast,/ But as a succedaneum, and a prop/ To our infirmity."
William Wordsworth,"Whither is fled the visionary gleam?Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
William Wordsworth,Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore of nicely-calculated less or more.
William Wordsworth,"I am already kindly disposed towards you. My friendship it is not in my power to give: this is a gift which no man can make, it is not in our own power: a sound and healthy friendship is the growth of time and circumstance, it will spring up and thrive li"

William Wordsworth,"No human ear shall ever hear me speak;No human dwelling ever give me food,Or sleep, or rest: but, over waste and wild,In search of nothing, that this earth can give,But expiation, will I wander on --A Man by pain and thought compelled to live,Yet loathing life -- till anger is appeasedIn Heaven, and Mercy gives me leave to die."
William Wordsworth,"And homeless near a thousand homes I stood,And near a thousand tables pined and wanted food."
William Wordsworth,"A Creature not too bright or good, For human nature's daily food;  For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles"
William Wordsworth,What are fears but voices airy? Whispering harm where harm is not. And deluding the unwary Till the fatal bolt is shot!

William Wordsworth,"Characters of the great Apocalypse,/ The types and symbols of Eternity,/ Of first, and last, and midst, and without end."

William Wordsworth,Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.

William Wordsworth,"With an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, and the deep power of joy, we see into the life of things."
William Wordsworth,Wisdom is oftentimes nearer when we stoop than when we soar.
William Wordsworth,"Life is divided into three terms - that which was, which is, and which will be. Let us learn from the past to profit by the present, and from the present to live better in the future."

William Wordsworth,Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart.

William Wordsworth,"Whether we be young or old,Our destiny, our being's heart and home,Is with infinitude, and only there;With hope it is, hope that can never die,Effort and expectation, and desire,And something evermore about to be."
William Wordsworth,Stepping westward seemed to be/ A kind of heavenly destiny.
William Wordsworth,"For by superior energies; more strict affiance in each other; faith more firm in their unhallowed principles, the bad have fairly earned a victory over the weak, the vacillating, inconsistent good."
William Wordsworth,"No motion has she now, no force; she neither hears nor sees; rolled around in earth's diurnal course, with rocks, and stones, and trees."
William Wordsworth,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
William Wordsworth,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
William Wordsworth,Ten thousand saw I at a glance/ Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

William Wordsworth,"Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,Are a substantial world, both pure and good:Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,Our pastime and our happiness will grow."
William Wordsworth,From the body of one guilty deed a thousand ghostly fears and haunting thoughts proceed
William Wordsworth,"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting. The soul that rises with us, our life's star, hath had elsewhere its setting, and comet from afar: not in entire forgetfulness, and not in utter nakedness, but trailing clouds of glory do we come from God, who is our home."
William Wordsworth,"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The soul that rises with us, our life's star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar.

William Wordsworth,"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting. Not in entire forgetfulness, and not in utter nakedness, but trailing clouds of glory do we come."
William Wordsworth,All things have second birth;The earthquake is not satisfied at once.
William Wordsworth,Impulses of deeper birth have come to him in solitude.
William Wordsworth,"One in whom persuasion and beliefHad ripened into faith, and faith becomeA passionate intuition."
William Wordsworth,"This city now doth, like a garment, wear the beauty of the morning; silent bare, ships, towers, domes, theatres and temples lie open unto the fields and to the sky; All bright and glittering in the smokeless air."
William Wordsworth,Plain living and high thinking are no more:The homely beauty of the good old causeIs gone.
William Wordsworth,"Mark the babe not long accustomed to this breathing world; One that hath barely learned to shape a smile, though yet irrational of soul, to grasp with tiny finger -- to let fall a tear; And, as the heavy cloud of sleep dissolves, To stretch his limbs, becoming, as might seem. The outward functions of intelligent man."
William Wordsworth,Like an army defeated/ The snow hath retreated.
William Wordsworth,The thought of our past years in me doth breed perpetual benedictions.
William Wordsworth,"With Nature never do they wageA foolish strife; they seeA happy youth, and their old ageIs beautiful and free."
William Wordsworth,"But an old age serene and bright, and lovely as a Lapland night, shall lead thee to thy grave."
William Wordsworth,The mind that is wise mourns less for what age takes away; than what it leaves behind.
William Wordsworth,"We live by admiration, hope and love"
William Wordsworth,"We live by admiration, hope and love; and even as these are well and wisely fixed, in dignity of being we ascend"
William Wordsworth,"Action is transitory a step, a blow, The motion of a muscle, this way or that 'Tis done, and in the after-vacancy We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed"
William Wordsworth,Thought and theory must precede all salutary action; yet action is nobler in itself than either thought or theory
William Wordsworth,"Action is transitory a step, a blow, The motion of a muscle, this way or that  'Tis done, and in the after-vacancy We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed"
William Wordsworth,"To begin, begin."
William Wordsworth,Why art thou silent! Is thy love a plant / Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air / Of absence withers what was once so fair?

William Wordsworth,The child is father of the man.
William Wordsworth,"In modern business it is not the crook who is to be feared most, it is the honest man who doesn't know what he is doing."

John Worsfold,"He's a very good footballer and he's still a developing footballer so there's no doubt he'll keep improving throughout this year, and I would expect over the next year as well."
John Worsfold,All of them (the players) just sticking at it and never conceding and showing real determination.
John Worsfold,"I think we kicked 4.6 in the third quarter, and seven points straight in the last - but the boys were pretty tired so I am going to take that into account, certainly in the last quarter."
Sam Worthington,To supply people for ages in camps makes no sense... You have to rebuild that cabana that they rent out to tourists on the weekend. They need help getting their fields repaired and their boats repaired.
Sam Worthington,A lot of these people were getting to where they didn't need help anymore. You have to start all over again.
Sam Worthington,You help families focus on the future through their children.
Sam Worthington,People care and are willing to help me out my desperate circumstances.
James Worthy,"Hatred would be a strong word, ... We really respected each other. A lot of people didn't realize that the Lakers and the Celtics had the utmost respect for one another and probably feared each other the most. We knew we were equally talented and we knew that we balanced each other out on the floor, and there had to be an edge."
James Worthy,"You have to totally drop your ego and start from scratch, and learn a new business,"
James Worthy,"[Following a high-profile basketball career,] I wanted to do more than just show up and sign autographs and meet and greet, ... So, I thought, what if I could join with a company and start learning the business from scratch?"
James Worthy,I started getting letters from college in the tenth grade.
James Worthy,I played basketball to try to get my parents from working so hard.
Klaus Wowereit,"This will cost a lot of money, but it's necessary for our citizens."
Klaus Wowereit,The first weekend in September stands for the pure zest for life. A warm welcome to Berlin!
Klaus Wowereit,We are proud that people of varied origins and predilections feel at home in our city and celebrate together.
Klaus Wowereit,"doesn't fulfil everyone's wishes and dreams, but it's a great step forward."
Klaus Wowereit,"A greeting message is good advertising for Berlin, especially for international visitors, ... We want them to come to Berlin. But anyone who has a problem with it doesn't have to go to the (S&M) event."
Ann Wright,"Research indicates that two out of every five consumers are unfamiliar with hybrid technology and its benefits, ... This clinic ensures that our customers not only have the most current information about their hybrid, but understand how to benefit most from it."
Ann Wright,"That won't be our last hybrid model, ... But we're not in a race with Toyota."
Ann Wright,"We see what's going on in the market, ... There does seem to be a shift toward the performance end of it. We obviously have to be competitive, but the No. 1 priority for any of these programs we're setting up is fuel economy and emissions."
Ann Wright,"I get all the time, 'You need more. You need more,' ... But the quality and performance out in the field has been very good. We are going to increase volumes, but we're going to do it at a pace where we can maintain really good quality."
Ann Wright,"With all these possibilities on the horizon, it's tough to predict what the future is going to hold,"
Ann Wright,"I don't doubt these women have bad experiences. I myself had bad experiences in a monogamous relationship years ago, but that doesn't make me against all marriage."
Ann Wright,"There is no doubt about this with Cindy -- she started the movement, she'll finish the movement."
Ann Wright,"Texas is known as prime territory for pursuing college-going students, ... and that is especially true for minorities because of our demographic growth."
Ann Wright,Come to Washington to help America put pressure on this administration.
Ann Wright,"We created about 300 ambassadors for us, ... It's free advertising, and we're getting some great feedback from them."
Bill Wright,"Our guys had some quality at bats even though we struck out a lot early. We took some good things from those at bats and didn't get discouraged. We learned things each time. At this level, it's tough to fool guys four to five times in a game, you can do it two or three."
Bill Wright,"This was a very good benchmark. I'd feel very comfortable saying Catalina's the best girls golf team in the state, hands down."
Bill Wright,The balls were hitting her are just as crisp (as in the Sabino game). They're just finding their way in.
Bill Wright,He really competed and did an outstanding job of shoving balls into the strike zone.
Bob Wright,We've made more space where there was none. We have expanded by 12 booths this year by using the lobby.
Bob Wright,He was all heart. He had the passion and it takes that passion to make something of yourself in the restaurant business.
Bob Wright,"In times like these, a journalist's contribution to his country is measured in terms of illustrious commitment and sacrifice, ... There was no one more devoted to his calling than David Bloom and for that we are both grateful and humbled."
Bob Wright,"NBC is excited about the investment in WWF Entertainment, ... The WWF is widely recognized as having created a leading brand and has done a remarkable job gathering large audiences in the coveted male demographics."
Bob Wright,"Having all of the distribution and all the commercial aspects lined up with the content should make us a more effective organization, give us a chance to make faster decisions or make everyone feel comfortable about who we are."
Bob Wright,"As CEO and then chairman of CNBC, Pamela led the network through a most challenging era in business news reporting. The network has retained its strong profitability, and the CNBC audience continues to be among the wealthiest in all of cable television."
Bob Wright,It has built a strong name for itself and it's a very advertising-friendly platform.
David Wright,He works his tail off. His work ethic is one of the best in the game and he's always trying to improve his game. He just cares so much and maybe that's why he got into a funk last year. He pressed so hard.
David Wright,No one's going to be selfish. Not this year. We can have a special year with all the talent we have here.
David Wright,"Every hitter struggles. If Delgado or Floyd struggle, it's my job or someone else's to pick them up. If I'm struggling, someone will pick me up. No one wants to struggle, but it is part of the game."
David Wright,"He's got that goofy smile and the kids love him with the big head. He reminds me of Ramon Castro. He's very friendly, outgoing. Mr. Met just symbolizes mascots in general the quirky nature, the way he carries himself. It's fun to look up in the stands sometimes and see what kind of shenanigans he's up to."
David Wright,"He's got that goofy smile and the kids love him with the big head, ... He reminds me of Ramon Castro. He's very friendly, outgoing. Mr. Met just symbolizes mascots in general the quirky nature, the way he carries himself. It's fun to look up in the stands sometimes and see what kind of shenanigans he's up to."
David Wright,"We have such a versatile lineup. We've got speed and power and that produces good at-bats. Everybody in the lineup sees better pitches. Up and down the lineup, we help each other out."
David Wright,"We've got Carlos Delgado, Carlos Beltran, Cliff Floyd, guys that have a lot of power."
David Wright,"I see many parents who still view this as a rite of passage, like they know their kid is going to experiment with pot just like they'll experiment with cigarettes. I'm telling you, it's absolutely not OK to think like that anymore. I'm pretty sure most of these parents would be shocked if they sampled some of the pot that's out there right now."
David Wright,"It just scared me a little bit. I felt a real, real sharp pain."
David Wright,"I don't think he got it in as much as he wanted to. He kind of left it over the plate and I put a nice, easy swing on it."
David Wright,"Some kids manage to get through that experimentation with no lasting problems. But others don't, and there's no way of knowing ahead of time which group your kid will fall in."
David Wright,I have a lot of respect for guys who go out there with aches and pains and play hurt. I would hope that respect is mutual.
David Wright,I hope that nothing happens in Washington.
David Wright,Obviously it hurts not having our big guys out there. But we're not going to win too many games getting three hits and one run.
David Wright,To go to the Welcome Home Dinner at 0-1 wouldn't have been any fun.
David Wright,"It's not a fun experience. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again."
David Wright,"As a hitter, you hate to see that electric slide move. He brings a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of energy."
David Wright,"You run out of things to say about Pedro. As he goes, the rest of the team goes. Our energy level picks up a notch when he pitches."
David Wright,There's just an energy level that gets kicked up a notch when Pedro pitches.
David Wright,You look in the stands and you see grown men crying. It was special to be a part of it as a player. You've got to be The Man to have a major-league game stop for you. As a teammate you go through a wide range of emotions. It's obviously sad. I saw a tear come from his eye. But it's also great to see the fans respect and support him the way they did.
David Wright,"We're trying to make everyone uncomfortable with this report. Whether it's students or higher-education leaders or governments, we all have to do more."
David Wright,It's clearly interesting to see what direction they're going.
David Wright,Sounds like the kind of stuff routinely done with this kind of network. It's hard to imagine they would design one without it.
David Wright,"I have everything in my iPod, from rap to country to R&B to alternative to Sinatra."
David Wright,"[So the Wrights were crushed -- at first -- when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 23 that the Constitution does not stop cities from seizing homes to make way for commercial development projects.] What we didn't realize right away, ... was that the decision would be a positive development for those of us who don't want to see people's houses taken away."
David Wright,"It's a confidence thing. The second half of last year, I felt more confident and I feel more comfortable this spring. That's the big thing for me. I can work on drills and footwork all day, but if I don't feel comfortable, it's not going to matter. As a young player, especially in New York, you make a couple of errors early and you start pressing a little bit. I've got to relax. I've thrown so many balls over to first base, I can probably do it blindfolded."
David Wright,"He just has this look in his eye that's confident. He has that inner confidence, that swagger, that trickles down. When your leader has that confidence, it makes you confident."
David Wright,What other choice do we have?
David Wright,"When money is involved like this, you have to be really good friends."
David Wright,"I may tone it down, ... Back off on batting practice, back off on taking ground balls. Get to bed earlier."
David Wright,"You look at it, you've got to take one game at a time and play good baseball. Yes, we started hot, but there have been a ton of teams that start hot, then they go into a drought after that. So we have to stay focused and continue doing what we're doing."
David Wright,You've got to be the man to have a major league baseball game stop for you and to have a five-minute tribute and to have five or six curtain calls. That's when you know you've done something. ... It's obviously sad. I saw a tear come from his eye.
David Wright,We have to take baby steps before we can take giant leaps.
Ian Wright,"We aim to be producing 75% of our work for Avon in Poland by Q1 2007,"
Ian Wright,We aim to be producing 75% of our work for Avon in Poland by Q1 2007.
Ian Wright,"I am a predatory striker, ... That is why people say they would have liked to see us playing together. He does what he does outside the box and I would be inside waiting to get bits and that would have been good to see."
Ian Wright,"It would be different if it was someone you didn't like and he was a horrible person, giving it all the time, but he's not like that."
Ian Wright,I never travel without my sketch book.
Ian Wright,"We are viewing this expansion as a long-term strategy for business expansion in Eastern Europe, ... We are going to pursue sites in Russia and perhaps other locations as well."
Jay Wright,"It looked a lot worse than it was. Al is going to be released. He has vision and it's going to be day-by-day prognosis now. But it's much, much better than we initially anticipated."
Jay Wright,"If we have seniors like this and I'm yelling and screaming at halftime, we're in a lot of trouble. They've got to take responsibility and they did."
Jay Wright,"It's a calculated risk. We are confident we'll be able to do that, but it's still a risk. Until you get it back, it's never in the bag."
Jay Wright,"It's going to be important for him to get back playing and just feel good. The only risk he has is the exact same thing happening, but that's the same risk as if it never happened before."
Jay Wright,"I'm very excited about the fact that his progress has been so encouraging. But I still would, however, encourage him to come back and have a full senior season."
Jay Wright,It was crazy. We are a defensive team. We take pride in that. We just couldn't stop them. I just never had the feeling that you can't stop anybody.
Jay Wright,"We're a defensive team. We take pride in that. And we just couldn't stop them. ...I've never had that feeling, where you just couldn't stop somebody."
Jay Wright,"We're expecting the doctor to say he can practice. If he is cleared, he'll practice today right after his appointment."
Jay Wright,It is an honor being picked by coaches in a league like this. Now we have to go out and earn it.
Jay Wright,Is that with an asterisk? ... It's an honor because obviously the coaches have a high regard for our players. Now we have to go out and earn it.
Jay Wright,"What happened? I thought this was a home game for us and all of a sudden when they cut it to seven, that shocked me. Where did all those people come from?"
Jay Wright,"I thought this was a home game for us. When they cut it to seven, (the crowd noise) shocked me."
Jay Wright,"I hate when everybody talks about our toughness, because we're not the only tough team. Immediately a good, smart [opposing] coach will challenge his team."
Jay Wright,Look at the teams that get No. 1 seeds. They're always traditionally strong programs. I'm happy for all the Villanova players that we got that.
Jay Wright,"We've got very good shooters, and I don't think it was a matter of them not being on their game. Texas just contested everything."
Jay Wright,It's good to get them the minutes. It's encouraging to me. I can sleep at night [thinking about] the future.
Jay Wright,"I had mixed feelings. I wanted it to end nicely for him, but not at our expense. He had a great game and we got the win. We wanted to be focused, but there was so much going on. Our hotel looked like I spent a weekend in Scranton. My sons were wearing Gerry McNamara jerseys that the Scranton fans gave them."
Jay Wright,Jason has gone through more injuries than any player we have ever coached. He has a great reservoir of faith and mental toughness. We are confident he will come back strong from this.
Jay Wright,"They just don't fear failure. They've been through so much. They're going to play you for 40 minutes and whatever happens, happens."
Jay Wright,"[The Owls are] athletic and long, and that's what Louisville is. We'll be playing in a tough environment, so I feel good going into that game because of the way we played against Temple."
Jay Wright,"We played extremely tough and aggressive. Our defense and rebounding kept us in it. ... Every time Louisville made runs at us [our] guys made big plays. Game number one in the Big East, that's what it's going to be like."
Jay Wright,"We played extremely tough and aggressive. Our defense and rebounding kept us in it. ... Every time Louisville made runs at us (our) guys made big plays. Game number one in the Big East, that's what it's going to be like."
Jay Wright,"I think it changed the game. I think he was way ahead of his time. He caught the country by surprise the year he went to the Final Four. I think even after years he had all that success going to the Final Four, I think that it still took all of us a long time to catch up."
Jay Wright,"We want to shoot 3s, ... We have great confidence in Allan and Mike and Randy, especially. Those three are pretty deadly."
Jay Wright,Our lineup gets dictated by the circumstances of the game.
Jay Wright,"It did take longer, but, given the circumstances, I understand why it took longer. I don't think given all of our circumstances, it could have happened any quicker."
Jay Wright,"Given the circumstances, I understand why it took longer."
Jay Wright,"[So it was understandable that Wildcats coach Jay Wright expressed much caution in the wake of Fraser's return to practice on Monday. It was his first workout since Oct. 22, when he had his left knee scoped after experiencing swelling following Villanova's second practice.] He looked real strong, ... Now we have to be concerned with how his knee responds after every practice. We're going to take it very, very slow."
Jay Wright,"Look at Kyle missing the first semester and coming back and being able to play because of his basketball IQ. Shane has not been on campus the whole first semester, and has been able to come in and pick things up rather quickly."
Jay Wright,"We ran into a team that played better basketball than us. I think we can play a lot better and we can shoot a lot better, and the other team had a lot to do with that. They were really good."
Jay Wright,That was a great college basketball game. We were very fortunate to get out of here with the win.
Jay Wright,"That's the advantage of having seniors, we know that Randy and Allen are going to make those big plays when we need them."
Jay Wright,I'm real proud of our team. To win the conference over a 16-game schedule is a great accomplishment.
Jay Wright,"That's the beauty of this team. We have a lot of guys who have the ability to score, but give it up because of the other guys. And then when they're needed, they'll do it. Like tonight, we needed Mike and Kyle to score and they did. Randy gets 10 rebounds tonight and he's in foul trouble and he doesn't care because we won. It's a fun team to coach."
Keith Wright,"We've been stockpiling fuel, just in case. We have enough on hand that we'll still be able to provide police and fire protection and public works assistance if there is a temporary shortage."
Keith Wright,"This has not dampened my enthusiasm for the game I have been in for over 20 years,"
Keith Wright,"If there was a disease outbreak, within seconds we can trace the animal, the property it came from, and every movement the animal has made. It means the region can be isolated, while the rest of the country can keep trading."
Martin Wright,"[We] can report that the service was withdrawn, due to lack of patronage, after its operation on Friday 23 December."

Martin Wright,We do believe that very quickly we can get down to the same costs as offshore wind.
Michael Wright,The Ron Clark Story' is the true story of one teacher's courage to leave his small hometown and head to one of the most challenging public schools in the country.
Michael Wright,"THE RON CLARK STORY is the true story of one teacher's courage to leave his small hometown and head to one of the most challenging public schools in the country.

Michael Wright,But this agreement will help us meet the needs of the community.
Orville Wright,"With twelve horse power at our command, we considered that we could permit the weight of the machine with operator to rise to 750 or 800 pounds, and still have as much surplus power as we had originally allowed for in the first estimate of 550 pounds."
Orville Wright,"With all the knowledge and skill acquired in thousands of flights in the last ten years, I would hardly think today of making my first flight on a strange machine in a twenty-seven mile wind, even if I knew that the machine had already been flown and was safe."
Orville Wright,"When the motor was completed and tested, we found that it would develop 16 horse power for a few seconds, but that the power rapidly dropped till, at the end of a minute, it was only 12 horse power."
Orville Wright,"When the machine had been fastened with a wire to the track, so that it could not start until released by the operator, and the motor had been run to make sure that it was in condition, we tossed a coin to decide who should have the first trial. Wilbur won."
Orville Wright,"We were then satisfied that, with proper lubrication and better adjustments, a little more power could be expected. The completion of the motor according to drawing was, therefore, proceeded with at once."
Orville Wright,We laid the track on a smooth stretch of ground about one hundred feet north of the new building.
Orville Wright,"We estimated that we could make one of four cylinders with 4 inch bore and 4 inch stroke, weighing not over two hundred pounds, including all accessories."
Orville Wright,"We decided to place the motor to one side of the man, so that in case of a plunge head first, the motor could not fall upon him."
Orville Wright,"The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center."
Orville Wright,"The ability to do this so quickly was largely due to the enthusiastic and efficient services of Mr. C.E. Taylor, who did all the machine work in our shop for the first as well as the succeeding experimental machines."
Orville Wright,"One of the Life Saving men snapped the camera for us, taking a picture just as the machine had reached the end of the track and had risen to a height of about two feet."
Orville Wright,"No data on air propellers was available, but we had always understood that it was not a difficult matter to secure an efficiency of 50% with marine propellers."
Orville Wright,"In our gliding experiments we had had a number of experiences in which we had landed upon one wing, but the crushing of the wing had absorbed the shock, so that we were not uneasy about the motor in case of a landing of that kind."
Orville Wright,"If we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true, there would be little hope of advance."
Orville Wright,"Before leaving for our camp at Kitty Hawk we tested the chain drive for the propellers in our shop at Dayton, and found it satisfactory."
Orville Wright,Before leaving camp in 1902 we were already at work on the general design of a new machine which we proposed to propel with a motor.
Orville Wright,"A sudden dart when a little over a hundred feet from the end of the track, or a little over 120 feet from the point at which it rose into the air, ended the flight."
Orville Wright,"In just six weeks from the time the design was started, we had the motor on the block testing its power."
Orville Wright,Isn't it astonishing that all these secrets have been preserved for so many years just so we could discover them!
Orville Wright,The airplane stays up because it doesn't have the time to fall.
Orville Wright,No flying machine will ever fly from New York to Paris.
Paul Wright,"If they pay a good yield, it's worth taking a look at."
Paul Wright,These guys work real hard together and have been willing to take on new roles for the benefit of the team. The team is unselfish and stands behind one another. Even with all the injuries we are constantly having people step up and answer the call.
Paul Wright,"I'm not surprised at all by how we played. We have a lot of talent this year, and it's great to open the season against a team like Fenwick. You are able to find out right away where you stand."
Paul Wright,It doesn't fit. It sticks out. But it's his land.
Richard Wright,We knew about that. We want to get him over to join up with the squad and he can travel back for the court case.
Richard Wright,It's routine practice. There's nothing unique or unusual about it.
Richard Wright,"Your Honor, only during the government's case."

Richard Wright,Men can starve from a lack of self-realization as much as they can from a lack of bread.
Richard Wright,I'd like to see the bay cleaned up before I die.
Richard Wright,"I would hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo, and if an echo sounded, no matter how faintly, I would send other words to tell, to march, to fight, to create a sense of hunger for life that gnaws in us all."
Richard Wright,Don't leave inferences to be drawn when evidence can be presented.
Steven Wright,"The Stones, I love the Stones. I watch them whenever I can. Fred, Barney."
Steven Wright,"Two babies were born on the same day at the same hospital. They lay there and looked at each other. Their families came and took them away. Eighty years later, by a bizarre coincidence, they lay in the same hospital, on their deathbeds, next to each other. One of them looked at the other and said, so. What did you think?"
Steven Wright,"Babies don't need a vacation, but I still see them at the beach... it pisses me off! I'll go over to a little baby and say What are you doing here? You haven't worked a day in your life!"
Steven Wright,Don't you hate when your hand falls asleep and you know it will be up all night.
Steven Wright,My friend has a baby. I'm writing down all the noises the baby makes so later I can ask him what he meant.
Steven Wright,Last year I went fishing with Salvador Dali. He was using a dotted line. He caught every other fish.
Steven Wright,"I went down the street to the 24-hour grocery. When I got there, the guy was locking the front door. I said, 'Hey, the sign says you're open 24 hours.' He said, 'Yes, but not in a row.'"
Steven Wright,You can't have everything. Where would you put it?
Steven Wright,"When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me, Did you sleep good? I said No, I made a few mistakes."
Steven Wright,"Babies don't need a vacation, but I still see them at the beach... it pisses me off! I'll go over to a little baby and say 'What are you doing here? You haven't worked a day in your life!'"
Steven Wright,At one point he decided enough was enough.

Harry Wu,"The Chinese come over here with a smiling face, ... but they have bloody hands."
William Wycherley,"Poets, like whores, are only hated by each other"

Zakk Wylde,Ozzy has dyslexia.
Zakk Wylde,We were sitting on the bus one day and there were 5 of us hanging out. There was only one beer left in the cooler and we actually all took a little cup and split it. It was a pathetic day in a rock and roll when five grown men have to be sitting there sharing a beer.

Zakk Wylde,The way I look at it you can always get better.

Bill Wyman,Everything had to be done in-between Stones time.
Bill Wyman,"I didn't want to stay in the Stones, and be stuck in a position having to play a music I didn't like anymore and that restricted me from doing all the others things I'm interested in because of time."

Bill Wyman,I think anyone would want to see their favorite band in a small club over a large stadium.
Bill Wyman,"Because of the fashion, the young people don't have any access to the history of music, unless people like me revive it. There are very few people to revive it, because you can't earn any money doing it."
Bill Wyman,The Stones always tried to do the odd smaller gig when they could.
Bill Wyman,I live in a house that was built in 1480. It has a moat around it. It is like a little baby castle.
