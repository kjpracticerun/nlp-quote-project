Marc Faber,"Geopolitical tensions are on the rise and could at some point in the future have a very negative impact on the global economy and financial markets,"
Marc Faber,"Twenty years ago, ... [a family] spent its income on housing, clothing, food appliances, cars, a radio and a TV. Today, it will spend additional money on a DVD player, computers, fax machines, printers, several cellular phones and a whole host of other new electronic gadgets...modern society requires people to continuously enlarge the 'basket of goods' that are considered necessary to lead a 'good life.'"
Marc Faber,Over the last six to nine months the economy has performed again much better.
Marc Faber,"It's a step in the right direction, although not a big step, ... helps stabilize the currency for a while, but it's addressing the symptoms why the currency's weak, not the causes why the currency's weak."
Mark Fabiani,Cheney is a card-carrying member of the old guard. Some of his past votes are hard to explain away in any era.
Mark Fabiani,"Our position was and is that if we have an opportunity to explore other options in the county, then we'll do so."

Donald Fagen,We're not getting any younger.
Donald Fagen,People are usually afraid to say what's on their mind.

Jeff Fager,"Mike Wallace has been the heart and soul of this broadcast since he and Don (Hewitt) started it almost four decades ago. Millions and millions of Americans have tuned in to '60 Minutes' on Sunday nights over all those years to see him in action and to find out what questions he would be asking each week. I'm glad he'll be around to do an occasional interview. He's had such a powerful impact on all of us who work here, on how we conduct interviews and how we report stories, that there will always be a piece of Mike in everything we do."
Jeff Fager,"They were telling us lives were in danger, could we please hold off â€” and it was a plea from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's not something that happens every day."
Jeff Fager,"I think there's some anxiety, but I don't think it's unhealthy. More people make it a little more tense at times, but I think it benefits the viewer. Getting on the air depends on how good your story is."
Russ Fager,He's showing us a lot in practice. He's a hard worker. He's just been a sponge. He's learning like crazy. I think he's having fun playing with a higher level of player. I think he's going to do very well for himself.
Russ Fager,"We found him just by sheer luck. I was going after some boys from England, and Barry's name popped up. We had what he wanted. Hopefully, he has what we wanted."
Russ Fager,"I think we're going to be very strong defensively. I think we're going to have the ability to score goals. I think it's going to be a matter of being healthy, and everyone staying on the field."
John Fahey,"As for the source of the music, I believe it comes from the unconscious; that there is no such thing as talent."
John Fahey,"In fact, I would go so far as to say that I am playing emotions and expressing them in a coherent public language called music."
John Fahey,"We're trying to find ways for our kids to give back to the community, give back to the school, ... We're also really working on giving them the work they can take with them way beyond high school."

John Fahey,"Regarding fame, fortune and Oregon I do wish I had more money."
John Fahey,"But I say these things in an objective dispassionate manner because, you know, and I can't explain why, but being one of the greatest guitarists in the world simply is not very important to me."

John Fahey,"As soon as the groupie finds out that you make errors in everyday life like everybody else does and that you are human, they turn on you and hate you."
John Fahey,"I know many inferior guitarists who are very proud of the fact that they are as good as they are, when in fact they are only moderately good."
John Fahey,"I thought I'd be wasting my time to go to commercial record companies and make demos for them, because don't forget, I was doing what I was doing and nobody understood what I was doing."
John Fahey,"They are too focused on the audience rather than on their own emotions, or they are too focused on technique or perhaps on both."
John Fahey,"Oh, 1962. The music scene was so bad that several of us decided to come out to Berkeley and take over the folk music scene here."
John Fahey,I was using them as teachers for technique but I was never trying to be a folk.
John Fahey,"Well folks, that's about it for the show tonight."
John Fahey,The other thing in composition is opening up the unconscious.
John Fahey,"So I learnt a few country western songs, I bought a chord book, and right away I started writing my own stuff, which nobody else did that, I don't know why."
John Fahey,"Well I was on the one hand, the more I played the guitar the more I began to really love the guitar and to love virtually any kind of music that anybody played well on guitar."
John Fahey,How can I be a folk? I'm from the suburbs you know.
John Fahey,"When I play, I very quickly put myself into a light hypnotic trance and compose while playing, drawing directly from the emotions."
John Fahey,So I was really composing for full orchestra and of course I didn't know enough chords or harmonies yet but I came up with some interesting stuff.
John Fahey,"As for fame, it can go to your head and you can become full of yourself."
John Fahey,"While I recognize in the back of my mind that I am an occasionally brilliant guitar composer and arranger, innovator and player."
John Fahey,I just want to be treated like an average guy.
John Fahey,I also know that I am not a great technician.
John Fahey,"From a social perspective, I am looking for friends, not acolytes."
John Fahey,Being worshipped is a horrible experience.
John Fahey,"See my father knew a lot about music, he played the piano and he would do theory and stuff like that, but I didn't learn anything from him, but I played that for him and he liked it a lot."
Douglas Fairbanks,I've never felt better.
Douglas Fairbanks,"I remember you and recall you without effort, without exercise of will; that is, by natural impulse, indicated by a sense of duty, or of obligation. And that, I take it, is the only sort of remembering worth the having. When we think of friends, and call their faces out of the shadows, and their voices out of the echoes that faint along the corridors of memory, and do it without knowing why save that we love to do it, we content ourselves that friendship is a Reality, and not a Fancy -- that it is built upon a rock, and not upon the sands that dissolve away with the ebbing tides and carry their monuments with them."
Douglas Fairbanks,Every week we had a different story and setting. Some were costume and period; some were modern. Some were comedy; some were tragedy. Some were melodrama. They were all different.
Richael Faithful,"William and Mary students should know that this is an institution that values safety, and more importantly, protects its students. While it's important to be fair in the judicial process, we also really need to make sure that survivors feel safe after the incident and receive the best response possible."
Richael Faithful,"It might be public information, but that is not ethical."
Richael Faithful,"It's really out of control. You have gossip everywhere, you have misunderstanding everywhere and you have students who aren't fully informed."
Randy Falco,"This is about realizing that the Olympics is more than about network television now, and the future is about being a content provider. In the future, it's going to be about going deeper with audiences, of finding ways to satisfy people in different ways."
Randy Falco,"The Olympics remain one of the biggest events on television. Despite this being the most competitive quarter I've seen in my 30 years in the television business, the Olympics continue to perform as they have throughout the past decade, compared to the current network television landscape."
Randy Falco,"The Olympics really are much more than a sporting eventÂ  It really is an entertainment event and in that sense, it brings to the set a much more diverse audience,"
Randy Falco,"It was a very important issue to the West Coast affiliates. They felt that they knew their local audiences better and they lobbied us very, very hard."

Randy Falco,Let's work together to design and measure new advertising strategies.
Peter Falk,"He sent the script over and I read it that first night, and about page 45 or 50, I called him up and said I'd do it. I didn't even finish it. You look for a part that you can score in. If I like this character and I can play it, the people are going to laugh or be interested, that's what you look for. They send me things that I wonder why they would send to anybody."
Peter Falk,"For my money, Patrick McGoohan is the quintessential Columbo adversary."
Peter Falk,"I think Morris has a fantastic zest for life. He's hit upon something, and that is this central question: 'I'm full of life now, but what do I see in the future? A slow, steady disintegration into paralysis. Do I go out while I'm on top, or do I want to hang around, inch by inch, watching myself decay and have my family watch me decay?' He approaches this subject with tremendous humor, and he's never depressing -- he's always way ahead of everybody else, and full of life. He's a fantastic character."
Peter Falk,"Paul never told me anything about why he wrote it -- he never mentioned his father and he never mentioned my father, ... He never put me in a position in which I would feel a lot of external pressure other than wanting my reaction to the script. That's the way I would do it. That's the way I know a real professional would do it. That's the proper to do it."
Peter Falk,"Sometimes I see my father in me,"
Jimmy Fallon,"I often try to reassure myself by saying, Well, at least it canÂ«t get any worse. But the truth is, it always can. And thatÂ«s what really terrifies me."
Jimmy Fallon,"Researches tested a new form of medical marijuana that treats pain but doesn't get the user high, prompting patients who need medical marijuana to declare, Thank you?"
Jimmy Fallon,"It makes me nervous seeing a 20-foot me, like I'm getting too big or something, ... Not that I mind being recognized. When I'm 60 I'll be begging for this."
Jimmy Fallon,"New Scientist magazine reported that in the future, cars could be powered by hazelnuts. That's encouraging, considering an eight-ounce jar of hazelnuts costs about nine dollars. Yeah, I've got an idea for a car that runs on bald eagle heads and Faberge eggs."
Jimmy Fallon,"Sometimes I wish I had a terrible childhood, so that at least IÂ«d have an excuse."
Jimmy Fallon,"Sometimes I wish I had a terrible childhood, so that at least IÂ´d have an excuse."
Jimmy Fallon,They say a dog is a manÂ«s best friend.ThatÂ«s if youÂ«re lucky enough to get one of those friendly dogs.

Jimmy Fallon,I'm going to North Pole to help out Santa this year.
Jimmy Fallon,I first met Queen when we worked together on Saturday Night Live and you just saw immediately that she got comedy. Immediately she got every joke.
Jimmy Fallon,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's publicist told USA Today that the actor has not ruled out running for governor of California, saying that he will make a decision soon. Reportedly Arnold needs that time to learn how to pronounce gubernatorial."
Jimmy Fallon,Researches at Yale found a connection between brain cancer and work environment. The No. 1 most dangerous job for developing brain cancer? Plutonium hat model.
Jimmy Fallon,Don't keep reaching for the stars because you'll just look like an idiot stretching that way for no reason.
Jimmy Fallon,I never sing in the shower. It's very dangerous.

Jimmy Fallon,You only think of the best comeback when you leave.
Jimmy Fallon,"We had the guys from X Men 2 do the cameras. They had a 360 camera that would go from one car, up in the air and over to another car in a continuous shot while the film was still rolling, going 90 mph."
Jimmy Fallon,They got a great performance from me. I was happy.
Jimmy Fallon,There couldn't have been a better Hollywood ending for us. It's beyond baseball. It's rooting for your family.
Jimmy Fallon,"Sometimes in a movie, the lines are so perfect."
Jimmy Fallon,Sandler's always good. Tom Hanks gave me some good advice.
Jimmy Fallon,Listening is more important than talking. Just hit your mark and believe what you say. Just listen to people and react to what they are saying.
Jimmy Fallon,"Leno, Conan. They are both really funny. They really know how to land one."
Jimmy Fallon,"In New York, there are so many potholes, they're like craters on the moon. That's another traffic thing."

Jimmy Fallon,"I had a gun and I had to run and shoot, which is not easy."
Jimmy Fallon,I didn't act like I was there. I just got into the story.
Jimmy Fallon,"Researches tested a new form of medical marijuana that treats pain but doesn't get the user high, prompting patients who need medical marijuana to declare, Thank you?"
Jimmy Fallon,"We picked the Red Sox because they lose. If you root for something that loses for 86 years, you're a pretty good fan. You don't have to win everything to be a fan of something."
Jimmy Fallon,I just really don't like being the center of attention that much. It's kind of ironic.
Jimmy Fallon,"When I see professional clowns, mimes, or people who makes ballon animals, I think of their relatives and how disappointed they must be."
Jimmy Fallon,"If you're a sports fan you realize that when you meet somebody, like a girlfriend, they kind of have to root for your team. They don't have a choice."
Padraic Fallon,"We believe that this research will lead us to develop a new ways of preventing and treating asthma and anaphylaxis, which can then be extended to treat inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis,"
Padraic Fallon,"In Africa, for example, the immune system is too busy chasing after worms to bother going after house dust mites,"
Padraic Fallon,"These animals did not develop difficulty in breathing. The presence of the worms blocks pulmonary inflammation, ... We believe that this research will lead us to develop new ways of preventing and treating asthma and anaphylaxis, which can then be extended to treat inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis."
Agnetha Faltskog,There was a time when the music fell silent. Both within me and around me.
Agnetha Faltskog,I can spot empty flattery and know exactly where I stand. In the end it's really only my own approval or disapproval that means anything.
Agnetha Faltskog,My path has not been determined. I shall have more experiences and pass many more milestones.
Agnetha Faltskog,There is a danger of changing too much in the search for perfection.
Jerry Falwell,"Homosexuality is Satan's diabolical attack upon the family that will not only have a corrupting influence upon our next generation, but it will also bring down the wrath of God upon America."
Jerry Falwell,There's been a concerted effort to steal Christmas.
Jerry Falwell,God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve
Jerry Falwell,Billy Graham is the chief servant of Satan in America
Jerry Falwell,"Joseph Farah raises a clarion call to action in his new book, 'Taking America Back.' He hits the nail on the head on every issue. What's more, he lays the blame for America's problems right where it belongs ? in the lap of liberalism. His insightful analysis of what he calls 'this evil ideology' is worth the price of the book. Don't miss it!"
Alan Faneca,We're still trying to figure out exactly how much he played. I think it grows. I think he gets a little more playing time every year.
Alan Faneca,We worked on that all week. I'm really proud of the guys. That's one of the parts of the running game that helped us -- we didn't have to overcome a 5-yard penalty a couple times here and there. Even if there's a 2-yard gain it was positive. We were moving in the right direction.
Alan Faneca,"I don't know if it's a big motivator. It's helped guide us a lot through this season, (learning to) take it game by game."
Alan Faneca,"I don't know if it's a big motivator, ... It's helped guide us a lot through this season, (learning to) take it game by game."
Alan Faneca,"So much hard work goes into it, it was great for it to finally pay off."
Alan Faneca,We've worked real hard on that.
Alan Faneca,"They were giving us a lot of different looks today. And for some reason, we just didn't get a lot of push against them. We're going to have to go back, look at film, and figure out how to get better."
Alan Faneca,"The camaraderie here's a little different than a regular game, so that's going to be fun, too."
Alan Faneca,"His growth from last year to this year, his comfort level with the offense, with what NFL defenses do. He's been able to react, to be in sync, and that's when you're playing your best football. I'm definitely excited to play with him now."
Alan Faneca,"The character that is brought into this locker room is tremendous. That's how you get a close-knit group of guys who are always together, never pointing fingers. It's a true credit to the organization."
Alan Faneca,"If that's what the birth certificate says, that's what he is. But he's playing older than that ... he's playing like he's been in the NFL a lot longer than two years."
Alan Faneca,"We go out there and do our job from the beginning, it might not be quite as loud."
Dakota Fanning,I had never been around horses at all. That's why I wanted to do it.
Dakota Fanning,My dad named me Dakota and my mom came up with my first name Hannah. So it's Hannah Dakota Fanning.
Dakota Fanning,"I think it's just when you're playing the character, just kind of into your character, you're kind of thinking and feeling what she's thinking and feeling at the time, ... So if she's doing that, you're doing that."
Dakota Fanning,"I don't like to get things during the year, ... I like to wait for my birthday or Christmas. I may see something that I'll say, 'I'd really like that for my birthday.' I like to have things to look forward to."
Dakota Fanning,"When I go home, I play with my baby dolls and strollers and stuffed animals, pretend like they're real dogs."
Shawn Fanning,"Nobody has ever built a reliable peer-to-peer service, where people can really access all the music they want in one location, ... Once I got it into my head, I couldn't imagine the media space without one."
Shawn Fanning,"Well, user feedback was excellent. Even when the software didn't work at all, there were few people who were avid users, and there were people who were just sending excellent feedback and excellent ideas."
Shawn Fanning,"Unfortunately, the client that exists today is still pretty much the prototype design."
Shawn Fanning,"There really was nothing like it at the time. We had good ideas for implementation, so we proceeded. I think it was an excellent solution to the reliability issues with existing search engines."
Shawn Fanning,"That's why I ended up leaving school - because it required so much time, and it was such an excellent idea. I figured I would regret not going full force with this idea. It seemed we could make something of it."
Shawn Fanning,So the bandwidth issue is definitely a big concern of ours.
Shawn Fanning,"Nobody has ever built a reliable peer-to-peer service, where people can really access all the music they want in one location,... Once I got it into my head, I couldn't imagine the media space without one."
Shawn Fanning,Napster works because people who love music share and participate.
Shawn Fanning,"It's been all over the press, and schools are deciding to shut it down. We released a public announcement saying that we had some potential solutions that we were working with, and once we had something concrete we would start implementing it and approach schools."
Shawn Fanning,"It was very early, and we were still like beta or alpha stage, and so we started receiving a ton of download. The server became overloaded, and that's when I realized that this had a huge market."
Shawn Fanning,Independent artists and labels have always been the trend setters in music and the music business.
Shawn Fanning,"If you're a musician or actor, you know that if you're successful, some level of fame goes along with that. You're prepared. But how often does that happen to a programmer?"
Shawn Fanning,"If you think about computer programming, it's as antisocial as it gets."
Shawn Fanning,"I was at Northeastern University playing with the idea and getting feedback from my roommates, and then started drafting a really basic design idea."
Shawn Fanning,"I understood an idea like this could become popular, but at the same time I didn't think it was my implementation that would be so widely used."
Shawn Fanning,"I think then, when we started receiving the first of the user feedback, feedback from people that I had not specifically told about it, but had spread from friend to friend and then they were giving us feedback."
Shawn Fanning,Bertelsmann understood our vision when they first invested in us... They still believe in that vision.
Shawn Fanning,"I wasn't really sure that my implementation of it would be what really took off, but fortunately I was able to get a prototype done."
Shawn Fanning,I think the most difficult thing had been scaling the infrastructure. Trying to support the response we had received from our users and the number of people that were interested in using the software.
Shawn Fanning,"I think it's pretty obvious to most people that Napster is not media specific, but I could see a system like Napster evolving into something that allows users to locate and retrieve different types of data other than just MP3s or audio files."
Shawn Fanning,I think in terms of the work we're doing now a lot of the UI cleanup... I see it getting much prettier.
Shawn Fanning,I had to actually purchase a book to learn the API and write the client. It was pretty frustrating trying to learn the API and develop a product quickly.
Shawn Fanning,"He said this has the potential to be the first broadband killer application, and it has sort of become the truth because obviously it's so bandwidth intensive. I mean, it has been an issue."
Shawn Fanning,But I just really think there is a natural extension into other types of media because it's an excellent system for reliably locating and retrieving content.
Shawn Fanning,We're close to moving into a new phase of Napster and this agreement is an important step along the way.
Frantz Fanon,"I made up my mind to laugh myself to tears, but laughter had become impossible."
Frantz Fanon,"The life of the nation is shot through with a certain falseness and hypocrisy, which are all the more tragic because they are so often subconscious rather than deliberate ... The soul of the people is putrescent, and until that becomes regenerate and clean, no good work can be done."
Frantz Fanon,"When a bachelor of philosophy from the Antilles refuses to apply for certification as a teacher on the grounds of his color I say that philosophy has never saved anyone. When someone else strives and strains to prove to me that black men are as intelligent as white men I say that intelligence has never saved anyone: and that is true, for, if philosophy and intelligence are invoked to proclaim the equality of men, they have also been employed to justify the extermination of men."
Nigel Farage,Should we continue to run our economic affairs or be managed by people in Brussels?
Nigel Farage,"This job is an unpaid job. It costs a fortune to do. You are on call seven days a week and all you get is aggravation,"
Nigel Farage,"This is a one-sided debate, with no opposition voice allowed. It's an absolute."
Nigel Farage,"Right now the Constitution is mere paper, with no bearing upon the British people, although they might find it good for doorstops, good for real fires and good for fish and chips."
Anais Faraj,"The regulatory changes will squeeze margins, there's no doubt about that. But a sense of normality has returned to the telecoms sector -- investors are no longer worried about asset deflation and are trying to pick the winners."
Anais Faraj,"All I am hearing is that they are getting cooperation from Iraq,"
Anais Faraj,"It's hard to be enthusiastic about the consumer goods sector in Europe, which is being squeezed by global competition and flagging consumer demand."
Chris Farley,We couldn't register everybody. I'm thrilled by just the number of people here. The running community has really come together.
Chris Farley,"Everyone is treating it like a Hollywood story. In Madison, it's a neighborhood story."
Chris Farley,"The point is, how do you know the Guarantee Fairy isn't a crazy glue sniffer."
Chris Farley,In the land of the skunks he who has half a nose is king.
Jordan Farmar,"We don't take a lot of bad shots. We just value the ball and try to take good shots. If that results in low scoring, then we'll take it."
Jordan Farmar,He's done so much but you guys haven't seen anything yet. I see talent and I told him early in the year that he was going to be so good. I could see just by watching him practice. Some of the things he would do were amazing. The scary part is he doesn't even know how good he is yet. He's not even close to his potential.
Jordan Farmar,"I was tired, exhausted. It wasn't too hard to calm down and go to sleep."
Jordan Farmar,"We see it every night. They do things they don't normally do, looking at each other and pointing fingers. Their eyes get big, like a deer in the headlights and really don't know what hit them. That's just from us playing hard and playing together. It's not any special recipe. It's just, really, you know, sucking up, defending and playing hard on that side of the ball."
Jordan Farmar,It really makes you feel like you're part of a family.
Jordan Farmar,"They don't do things normally. They look at each other. They point fingers. Their eyes get big, like deer in the headlights, like they don't know what hit them."
Jordan Farmar,"They're looking at each other, pointing fingers. Sometimes [their] eyes got real big like a deer in the headlights, like they don't know what hit them. That's just from us playing hard and playing together. It's not any special recipe. It's just really sucking up, defending and playing hard on that end of the ball."
Jordan Farmar,"They don't do the things they normally do, they are looking at each other, pointing fingers, sometimes eyes get real big, like a deer in the headlights, like they don't know what hit them."
Jordan Farmar,I think Coach wanted to establish a sense of urgency. We need to remember to take it one game at a time. We've been doing a great job of that lately. I don't think that's going to be a problem.
Jordan Farmar,"I told (everyone) in the beginning of the year how good he was going to be, that he doesn't even know that. That's the scary part. He has no clue. He's just out there playing as hard as he possibly can and trying to get better."
Jordan Farmar,"I told him in the beginning of the year how good he was going to be. He doesn't even know that. That's the scary part. He has no clue. Anytime you focus on trying your best and not worrying about the result or thinking of failure, good things happen."
Jordan Farmar,"I always knew Ryan was a great basketball player. It was just a matter of him believing in himself, and us believing in him, and that's all come together."
Jordan Farmar,"We don't have to defend it. Whatever it takes. We have smart basketball players that distinguish good from bad, and that's why we're still playing."
Jordan Farmar,"He does a good job staying on the ground, not going for shot fakes, using his length to his advantage. He does change a lot of shots if he doesn't block them."
Jordan Farmar,He changes shots with his height and his athletic ability. He's long with good timing. He does a good job of staying on the ground until it's time to go up and bother the shot. He definitely was a factor tonight.
Paul Farmer,"Well, we've worked with our friends in Haiti to establish nothing short of a modern medical center in one of the poorest parts of that country."
Paul Farmer,"Well, I don't think that the role of the pharmaceutical industry is any different from that of other transnational corporations."
Paul Farmer,"We've taken on the major health problems of the poorest - tuberculosis, maternal mortality, AIDS, malaria - in four countries. We've scored some victories in the sense that we've cured or treated thousands and changed the discourse about what is possible."
Paul Farmer,The thing about rights is that in the end you can't prove what should be considered a right.
Paul Farmer,The poorest parts of the world are by and large the places in which one can best view the worst of medicine and not because doctors in these countries have different ideas about what constitutes modern medicine. It's the system and its limitations that are to blame.
Paul Farmer,The only way to do the human rights thing is to do the right thing medically.
Paul Farmer,"So I can't show you how, exactly, health care is a basic human right. But what I can argue is that no one should have to die of a disease that is treatable."
Paul Farmer,"Since I do not believe that there should be different recommendations for people living in the Bronx and people living in Manhattan, I am uncomfortable making different recommendations for my patients in Boston and in Haiti."
Paul Farmer,Shuttling back and forth between what is possible and what is likely to occur is instructive and a lot of what shapes our sentiment.
Paul Farmer,It was apparent from the early 80s that in order to do something lasting and significant in Haiti we would need a springboard in the States.
Paul Farmer,"It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is not, by any stretch of the imagination, doing enough to ensure that the poor have access to adequate medical care."
Paul Farmer,"I'm one of six kids, and the eight of us lived for over a decade in either a bus or a boat."
Paul Farmer,I'm not an austere person.
Paul Farmer,"I think we will see better vaccines within the next 15 years, but I'm not a scientist and am focused on the short-term - what will happen in the interim."
Paul Farmer,I mean we grew up in a TB bus and I became a TB doctor.
Paul Farmer,I critique market-based medicine not because I haven't seen its heights but because I've seen its depths.
Paul Farmer,"For me, an area of moral clarity is: you're in front of someone who's suffering and you have the tools at your disposal to alleviate that suffering or even eradicate it, and you act."
Paul Farmer,"But if you're asking my opinion, I would argue that a social justice approach should be central to medicine and utilized to be central to public health. This could be very simple: the well should take care of the sick."
Paul Farmer,"But as for activism, my parents did what they could, given the constraints, but were never involved in the causes I think of when I think of activists."
Paul Farmer,"At the same time, the fact the world's poor are calling upon us to help is a marker, in my view, of the limitless potential of human solidarity."
Paul Farmer,"Anywhere you have extreme poverty and no national health insurance, no promise of health care regardless of social standing, that's where you see the sharp limitations of market-based health care."
Paul Farmer,"And I can also show you that people from all walks of life agree that someone who is sick deserves, in principle, compassion and care."
Paul Farmer,"I've been impressed, over the last 15 years, with how often the somewhat conspiratorial comments of Haitian villagers have been proven to be correct when the historical record is probed carefully."
Paul Farmer,Even die-hard fans of the market acknowledge that TB care should be free. Why? Because it's an airborne disease and treatment equals prevention.
George Farquhar,"Observe this, that tho a woman swear, forswear, lie, dissemble, back-bite, be proud, vain, malicious, anything, if she secures the main chance, she's still virtuous; that's a maxim."
George Farquhar,"Necessity, the mother of invention"
George Farquhar,"There is no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful as poverty."
George Farquhar,"Crimes, like virtues, are their own rewards."
George Farquhar,"Charming women can true converts make, We love the precepts for the teacher's sake."
George Farquhar,"When the blind lead the blind, no wonder they both fall into - matrimony."
George Farquhar,"There's no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful as poverty."
George Farquhar,"Spare all I have, and take my life."
George Farquhar,Captain is a good travelling name and so I take it.
George Farquhar,"I believe they talked of me, for they laughed consumedly."
George Farquhar,"Poetry is a mere drug, Sir."
George Farquhar,"Grant me some wild expressions, Heavens, or I shall burst."
George Farquhar,Those who know the least obey the best.
George Farquhar,"We are the men of intrinsic value, who can strike our fortunes out of ourselves, whose worth is independent of accidents in life, or revolutions in government: we have heads to get money, and hearts to spend it."
George Farquhar,"I have fed purely upon ale; I have eat my ale, drank my ale, and I always sleep upon ale."
George Farquhar,"Says little, thinks less, and does - nothing at all, faith."
George Farquhar,"Crimes, like virtues, are their own rewards"
Louis Farrakhan,"I regret anything that I may have written or said that could have triggered or helped to create an atmosphere that caused the loss of life of any human being, Malcolm in particular."
Louis Farrakhan,Our communities don't have peace because they are not safe; they are not secure.
Louis Farrakhan,"I, myself, have said things that have offended others, ... But if we're going to reverse the pain that we give each other, rather than look at the bigger picture which is the pain and suffering of our people, then we will not be able to create a movement that can ... heal the horrific condition of our people in America."
Louis Farrakhan,"If it is a virus, several doctors that were working on me have not found that."
Louis Farrakhan,"She denied herself comfort,"
Louis Farrakhan,"America will always side with those whom she can direct, give orders to and have those orders obeyed."
Louis Farrakhan,"If we don't make earnest moves toward real solutions, then each day we move one day closer to revolution and anarchy in this country. This is the sad, and yet potentially joyous, state of America."
Louis Farrakhan,Because as a youngster I longed to see the Black man free and I longed to see anyone stand up for us.
Louis Farrakhan,"Not that I regret saying what I believed to be the truth, but I regret anything that I might have written or spoken that could have been used in a way to help to foster that atmosphere out of which came the loss of life of Brother Malcolm."
Louis Farrakhan,"However, those who have used those words use half the sentence to fit their purpose, which, of course, I believe is to discredit me and the new Nation of Islam that has come up around me."
Louis Farrakhan,"And I hope that five years and 10 years from now, I'll be a better man, a more mature man, a wiser man, a more humble man and a more spirited man to serve the good of my people and the good of humanity."
Louis Farrakhan,There is no one right now in my judgment that can unite the Black electorate in such a way to present our agenda to a nominee to have them forthrightly address our concerns.
Louis Farrakhan,"But if I thought on it, I would like to be remembered as a brother who loved his people and did everything that I knew to fight for them, the liberation of our people."
Louis Farrakhan,It appears that there is a genocidal plan against Black people.
Louis Farrakhan,I think that ego-driven leaders will be a thing of the past because the masses are tired.
Louis Farrakhan,"Because wherever I am today, I still owe it to God and I owe it to two men - the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and of course, two very special women, my mother and my wife."
Louis Farrakhan,"A brother who recognizes that we have shortcomings, we, in the struggle, have faults, and that he wanted to reconcile differences."
Louis Farrakhan,I loved Elijah Muhammad with a love that I can't adequately describe.
Louis Farrakhan,"There really can be no peace without justice. There can be no justice without truth. And there can be no truth, unless someone rises up to tell you the truth."
Louis Farrakhan,Everything that I'm attempting to do is based on my understanding of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and what he wanted for his people.
Louis Farrakhan,"But when I reintroduced the Nation of Islam, and began to host meetings in cities and thousands and thousands of people come out."
Louis Farrakhan,"Qaddafi is hated because he is the leader of a small country that is rich, but he uses his money to finance liberation struggles."
Louis Farrakhan,"Naturally, when one makes progressive steps, there may be some who see it as a betrayal of their goals and interests."
Louis Farrakhan,"They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters."
Louis Farrakhan,"Overall, the challenge of leadership is both moral and one of developing the characteristics that make us respected by one another."
Louis Farrakhan,"I think that rather than condemning Islam, Islam needs to be studied by those who are sincere."
Louis Farrakhan,I am hoping that in this year of the family we will go into our families and reconcile differences.
Louis Farrakhan,"As a result of that, America desires a moderate Islam; an Islam that America can control; an Islam that America can give direction to and give orders to its leaders."
Louis Farrakhan,They should regard me as what I am. I am a spiritual leader and teacher.
Louis Farrakhan,The Bush administration does not desire to see Islam practiced in its pristine purity.
Louis Farrakhan,You must recognize that the way to get the good out of your brother and your sister is not to return evil for evil.
Louis Farrakhan,Could it be that my circle is largely black and that it is why I am influential in black circles but not in white circles?
Louis Farrakhan,"We are all gifted, but we have to discover the gift, uncover the gift, nurture and develop the gift and use it for the Glory of God and for the liberation struggle of our people."
Louis Farrakhan,"Black leadership has to recognize that principles more than speech, character more than a claim, is greater in advancing the cause of our liberation than what has transpired thus far."
Louis Farrakhan,"I don't think about my legacy, if indeed, I have one."
Louis Farrakhan,"Anarchy may await America, due to the daily injustices suffered by the people."
Louis Farrakhan,"Without an advocate for the poor, without a new state of mind in America, the country lies on the brink of anarchy."
John Farrell,"We feel he still can benefit from innings at the Triple-A level. Whether that's 10 starts or 15 starts, it's not a predetermined number. We were fortunate last year in that a sixth starter was only needed [in the big leagues] on a few occasions. At some point, provided the opportunity arises and the need is there, I think Jeremy Sowers will be ready."
John Farrell,His range has been solid in the field; he's running and moving well. And his at-bats have been very consistent. He looks like he did when we first signed him. He's back on track.
John Farrell,Bear has three quality pitches and a real feel for pitching. What really stands out is that he can execute under pressure situations. He has a composure on the mound and a competitive edge that sets him apart.
John Farrell,"We just don't want dangerous, psychiatric people."
John Farrell,"When we get Jason Stanford stretched out and build up his pitch count and durability, he'll have an opportunity to pitch his way into a depth starter job. He'll need two to two-and-a-half months to get back to that level."
John Farrell,"In Arizona (last fall), he was facing better competition, and that required him to use all of his pitches more. That's helped him this spring, and he's looked very good down here."
Joseph Farrell,If we only knew the real value of a day
Joseph Farrell,"Literature and Society in the First Modern Period, 321 B.C. - A.D. 235,"
Joseph Farrell,"As experience widens, one begins to see how much upon a level all human things are."
Perry Farrell,"Here's my system. Music that's five years old should be a nickel. Music's that's three to four years old, you should pay a dime. If it's two years old, it's 50 cents and for new singles, 75 cents."
Perry Farrell,"Our plight, ... is a true indication of the general health of the touring industry and it is across musical genres."
Perry Farrell,"Lollapalooza is a place where young upstarts become legends, and legends return to claim their fame."
Perry Farrell,"Without game, men prey on each other."
Perry Farrell,"Sometimes to realize you were well, someone must come along and hurt you."
Jim Fassel,"It takes a little while to build, ... It doesn't happen overnight, but I didn't think we'd struggle this badly now."
Jim Fassel,"[Former Giants general manager] George Young told me a long time ago, 'Don't be voting for rules that put you one more foot on the hot seat. You got enough [stuff] to worry about.'"
Jim Fassel,"The thing about it is the officials have a hard job. The game is so quick. I think what has really affected officiating is there are so many television angles slow-motion, all that stuff. The fan has the ability to make the perfect observation where for the official it's bang-bang-bang."
Jim Fassel,We never lost that will to win -- the guys just kept on fighting.
Jim Fassel,"If you don't have a lot of time to prepare, it can really be a problem with all their dogs and blitzes. They give you a lot of looks; it all can be very disruptive. It forces you to be very solid in your protections."
Minnesota Fats,Gleason used to rack balls for me when he was a kid in Brooklyn and in Long Island.
Minnesota Fats,The women all want to dance. I dance all night every night.
Minnesota Fats,Paul Newman is not a very good pool player.
Minnesota Fats,No one on this Earth knows how old I am.
Minnesota Fats,I'm known clean around the Earth.
Marshall Faulk,"Is it hard? It's hard. I mean, it's not easy. There's some work that's involved. But it's just like everything else -- you work for it, you get it. And if you sit down and you talk about it and you make it like, 'Oh, it was rough. It was tough.' There are kids at home scratching their heads like, 'Oh, boy, I don't have what it takes to make it because I can't run the football like he does.' That has nothing to do with it. When I talk to kids, I let them know it's not about that. You can do it. You don't have to be a football player to do it."
Marshall Faulk,"I was probably being a little paranoid, ... In past years I would've worked through something like that and kept right on pushing ahead. But I'm just so excited about this season -- I just want everything to be perfect, because I think it can be a special year for us -- and I want to make extra sure that nothing slows me down."
Marshall Faulk,"I try to tell the kids, I'm not trying to run away from where I came from,"
Marshall Faulk,"In my mind and my heart, I feel like I'm the better player. But I feel like I'm better than anybody who ever played the game, but that's just how it is, that's the only way you can succeed. And in his mind, he (Jackson) feels like he's the better player and the best player who has ever played the position. You have to have that attitude to succeed, but you can't have the ego to the point where you don't understand how him starting and me playing the role helps the team."
Marshall Faulk,"There's a lot of football to be played, but we can't let this snowball. We've got to correct some things now."
Marshall Faulk,What's a store with food in it if you don't have food? What's a store with fresh water if you don't have water? What are you supposed to do?
Marshall Faulk,Without a doubt. It's just weird when you hear the ones called out and I still take that step to go because it's always been like that for me. Now I have to hear formations and personnel that dictate when I'm in the game. But it's fine. It's a process.
Marshall Faulk,"Once it's in you to being a starter, you always want to be that. But you understand the circumstances and you understand what you can and can't do. And that's the reality of it."
Marshall Faulk,"I'd not only be cheating myself, but I'd be cheating my teammates if I continued to make the money that I was making and wasn't producing or putting out to the level of payment that I was receiving. That's just me."
Marshall Faulk,This is a business and you've got to understand that. I always speak in business terms in this game and I learned that when I was young.
Robert Faulkner,I think it's very wise for him to stay on as a consultant. Dane is the face and soul of that company.
Robert Faulkner,"The deal's not a deal until the FTC rules, ... [Wednesday] was the first punch."
Robert Faulkner,They're being careful not to lower the investment rating for their credit. Paying this price doesn't jeopardize the company in any way.
William Faulkner,"The writer's only responsibility is to his art. He will be completely ruthless if he is a good one. He has a dream. Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency, security, happiness, all, to get the book written. If a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the Ode on a Grecian Urn is worth any number of old ladies."
William Faulkner,He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary
William Faulkner,I've got to feel the pencil and see the words at the end of the pencil.
William Faulkner,The most beautiful description of a woman is by understatement
William Faulkner,"To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi"
William Faulkner,The salvation of the world is in man's suffering
William Faulkner,"I have found that the greatest help in meeting any problem with decency and selfrespect and whatever courage is demanded, is to know where you yourself stand. That is, to have in words what you believe and are acting from."
William Faulkner,"I'm a failed poet. Maybe every novelist wants to write poetry first, finds he can't and then tries the short story which is the most demanding form after poetry. And failing at that, only then does he take up novel writing."
William Faulkner,The past is never forgotten; it's never even past
William Faulkner,"Between pain and nothing, I choose pain"
William Faulkner,I believe that man will not merely endure; he will prevail.
William Faulkner,Tomorrow night is nothing but one long sleepless wrestle with yesterday's omissions and regrets
William Faulkner,Purity is a negative state and therefore contrary to nature.
William Faulkner,"I would say that music is the easiest means in which to express . . . but since words are my talent, I must try to express clumsily in words what the pure must would have done better."
William Faulkner,My mother is a fish.
William Faulkner,"If a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the Ode on a Grecian Urn is worth any number of old ladies"
William Faulkner,"I believe that man will not merely endure. He will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance."
William Faulkner,I could just remember how my father used to say that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead a long time.
William Faulkner,"The artist is of no importance. Only what he creates is important, since there is nothing new to be said. Shakespeare, Balzac, Homer have all written about the same things, and if they had lived one thousand or two thousand years longer, the publishers wouldn't have needed anyone since."
William Faulkner,"In my time I have seen truth that was anything under the sun but just, and I have seen justice using tools and instruments I wouldn't want to touch with a 10-foot fence rail."
William Faulkner,"Every man has a different idea of what's beautiful, and it's best to take the gesture, the shadow of the branch, and let the mind create the tree"
William Faulkner,"Home again, his native land; he was born of it and his bones will sleep in it . . ."
William Faulkner,"Loving all of it even while he had to hate some of it because he knows now that you don't love because: you love despite; not for the virtues, but despite the faults."
William Faulkner,Only vegetables are happy
William Faulkner,Between grief and nothing I will take grief.
William Faulkner,No man can cause more grief than that one clinging blindly to the vices of his ancestors.
William Faulkner,Pointless. . . . Like giving caviar to an elephant.
William Faulkner,A writer is congenitally unable to tell the truth and that is why we call what he writes fiction.
William Faulkner,We have to start teaching ourselves not to be afraid
William Faulkner,. . . and that sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forgot the words . . .
William Faulkner,"We cannot choose freedom established on a hierarchy of degrees of freedom, on a caste system of equality like military rank. We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it."
William Faulkner,"To live anywhere in the world today and be against equality because of race or color, is like living in Alaska and being against snow"
William Faulkner,Gratitude is a quality similar to electricity: it must be produced and discharged and used up in order to exist at all.
William Faulkner,I'm glad I haven't got the sort of conscience I've got to nurse like a sick puppy all the time.
William Faulkner,"The young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat."
William Faulkner,"Given the choice between the experience of pain and nothing, I would choose pain"
William Faulkner,"Read, read, read. Read everything-- trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it is good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out the window."
William Faulkner,We have to start teaching ourselves not to be afraid.
William Faulkner,Tomorrow night is nothing but one long sleepless wrestle with yesterday's omissions and regrets.
William Faulkner,"To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi."
William Faulkner,"The tools I need for my work are paper, tobacco, food, and a little whiskey."
William Faulkner,The salvation of the world is in man's suffering.
William Faulkner,Pointless... like giving caviar to an elephant.
William Faulkner,Perhaps they were right in putting love into books... Perhaps it could not live anywhere else.
William Faulkner,"If a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate: The Ode on a Grecian Urn is worth any number of old ladies."
William Faulkner,The best job that was ever offered to me was to become a landlord in a brothel. In my opinion it's the perfect milieu for an artist to work in.
William Faulkner,"Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency to get the book written."
William Faulkner,Hollywood is a place where a man can get stabbed in the back while climbing a ladder.
William Faulkner,"If I had not existed, someone else would have written me, Hemingway, Dostoevski, all of us."
William Faulkner,"It is my aim, and every effort bent, that the sum and history of my life, which in the same sentence is my obit and epitaph too, shall be them both: He made the books and he died."
William Faulkner,The last sound on the worthless earth will be two human beings trying to launch a homemade spaceship and already quarreling about where they are going next.
William Faulkner,Our tragedy is a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it... the basest of all things is to be afraid.
William Faulkner,I'm inclined to think that a military background wouldn't hurt anyone.
William Faulkner,Maybe the only thing worse than having to give gratitude constantly is having to accept it.
William Faulkner,"There is something about jumping a horse over a fence, something that makes you feel good. Perhaps it's the risk, the gamble. In any event it's a thing I need."
William Faulkner,An artist is a creature driven by demons. He doesn't know why they choose him and he's usually too busy to wonder why.
William Faulkner,Man will not merely endure; he will prevail.
William Faulkner,"The past is not dead. In fact, it's not even past."
William Faulkner,Man performs and engenders so much more than he can or should have to bear. That's how he finds that he can bear anything.
William Faulkner,"Given a choice between grief and nothing, I'd choose grief."
William Faulkner,I decline to accept the end of man.
William Faulkner,"I have found that the greatest help in meeting any problem is to know where you yourself stand. That is, to have in words what you believe and are acting from."
William Faulkner,The scattered tea goes with the leaves and every day a sunset dies.
William Faulkner,Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.
William Faulkner,A writer must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid.
William Faulkner,Facts and truth really don't have much to do with each other.
William Faulkner,I never know what I think about something until I read what I've written on it.
William Faulkner,"If I were reincarnated, I'd want to come back a buzzard. Nothing hates him or envies him or wants him or needs him. He is never bothered or in danger, and he can eat anything."
William Faulkner,"Memory believes before knowing remembers. Believes longer than recollects, longer than knowing even wonders."
William Faulkner,I feel like a wet seed wild in the hot blind earth.
William Faulkner,Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.
William Faulkner,"A mule will labor ten years willingly and patiently for you, for the privilege of kicking you once."
William Faulkner,"This is a free country. Folks have a right to send me letters, and I have a right not to read them."
William Faulkner,A man's moral conscience is the curse he had to accept from the gods in order to gain from them the right to dream.
William Faulkner,"The artist doesn't have time to listen to the critics. The ones who want to be writers read the reviews, the ones who want to write don't have the time to read reviews."
William Faulkner,"Given the choice between the experience of pain and nothing, I would choose pain."
William Faulkner,A gentleman can live through anything.
William Faulkner,"My own experience has been that the tools I need for my trade are paper, tobacco, food, and a little whisky."
William Faulkner,"I would say that music is the easiest means in which to express, but since words are my talent, I must try to express clumsily in words what the pure music would have done better."
William Faulkner,"Unless you're ashamed of yourself now and then, you're not honest."
William Faulkner,"Well, between Scotch and nothin', I suppose I'd take Scotch. It's the nearest thing to good moonshine I can find."
William Faulkner,"The writer in America isn't part of the culture of this country. He's like a fine dog. People like him around, but he's of no use. . . ."
William Faulkner,"People between twenty and forty are not sympathetic. The child has the capacity to do but it can't know. It only knows when it is no longer able to do --after forty. Between twenty and forty the will of the child to do gets stronger, more dangerous, but it has not begun to learn to know yet. Since his capacity to do is forced into channels of evil through environment and pressures, man is strong before he is moral. The world's anguish is caused by people between twenty and forty."
William Faulkner,"Others have done it before me. I can, too."
William Faulkner,It's a shame that the only thing a man can do for eight hours a day is work. He can't eat for eight hours; he can't drink for eight hours; he can't make love for eight hours. The only thing a man can do for eight hours is work.
William Faulkner,The end of wisdom is to dream high enough to lose the dream in the seeking of it.
William Faulkner,Clocks slay time... time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.
William Faulkner,To live anywhere in the world today and be against equality because of race or color is like living in Alaska and being against snow.
William Faulkner,All of us failed to match our dreams of perfection. So I rate us on the basis of our splendid failure to do the impossible.
William Faulkner,"The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life."
Brett Favre,"I know 15 years have gone by, but I know for a fact I had no clue what was going on and I relied solely on being able to throw the ball harder and farther than anyone else out there,"
Brett Favre,"It's hard to express in words how disappointed I am. I left it all on the field. I've never been 0-4, but it's a hand we've been dealt."
Brett Favre,I think the Covington-Fontainebleau game is one of those rivalries that as a coach you don't have any trouble getting your players up for. We know they will be a focused group.
Brett Favre,"It's not like I'm delaying this on purpose. There are some reasons, and we still have 160 days before the opening of the regular season. So I don't know if the decision will be made by Saturday."
Brett Favre,"Terry Glenn has the potential to dominate year in and year out, but now it's up to him,"
Brett Favre,"I don't know when that point comes when you go, 'We've given guys plenty of chances.' I'm sure everyone's patience is wearing thin,"
Brett Favre,"It makes me start (wondering), do I still have that magic?"
Brett Favre,"I think it comes down to a couple draft picks and luck, obviously, good luck, and very easily we could be sitting here and be totally different"
Brett Favre,"I said to myself, 'This is way too difficult week-in and week-out.' It's hard to make a living that way each week."
Brett Favre,"I'm not sure who all the guys are. I'm still learning them,"
Brett Favre,"It was better than last week, so it's good to show some improvement. But we still have a long way to go."
Brett Favre,"I hate to compare this to the tsunami. But in a small area, it was like that."
Brett Favre,"I think sometimes you rely too much on one guy, on one phase of the game,"
Brett Favre,maybe I say that was of all the seasons I played professional football the most challenging and the most fun.
Brett Favre,"It's not like Mom, Scott and Jeff can drive up with food and they can all have a cookout, ... Pretty much everybody is better off staying put. I'm not just talking about my family."
Brett Favre,"You have to learn to deal with fame, ... It can be a difficult process. What I've discovered is lack of privacy sometimes comes with the job."
Brett Favre,"I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I didn't expect this kind of performance, but I know he was watching tonight."
Brett Favre,"I believe he's his own worst enemy at times, ... I don't know if there's a guy on this team who works as hard or wants to be as good as he does and sometimes that can work against you. He's got tremendous talent and he's got great work ethic. He just has to let it go."
Brett Favre,"Well, I think we believe they can handle it."
Brett Favre,I know people are getting impatient. But enjoy baseball right now.
Brett Favre,"[Taking the argument one step further, Sharper said Favre sounded suspiciously like he was a de facto member of the Packers' front office.] You're siding with management, ... It makes me wonder, 'Who's in your ear? Who's standing behind you telling you what to say?'"
Brett Favre,Well I would say that we're regular people first of all and we're normal and it's obvious by some of the things that have happened just because our name is famous we're not immune to tragedy.
Brett Favre,Well family is obviously the most important. There was a time when I thought football was the most important.
Brett Favre,"Well even before she was diagnosed with the cancer, I would have said that she was a lot tougher than me and most guys would probably say that about their wives and it's probably true in most cases."
Brett Favre,"The town, the team, it's a family. That has helped. For some people who have had to deal with some of the problems I have had to deal with don't have football as an out."
Brett Favre,The party now is having my kids laugh and my wife laugh and my teammates. I want them to see me have fun and put it in a different way.
Brett Favre,That's kind of how I approach life and football; why dwell on something that's hasn't happened.
Brett Favre,"Sometimes you get caught up in what's going on around you. The reality is that you are just a regular person. At some point, the career will be over, the bright lights turn off. That can come back to haunt you if you're not just a regular guy."
Brett Favre,"So much of a professional athlete's success depends upon not necessarily the play itself but how he deals with... always saying how you deal with good, is just as important as how you deal with bad."
Brett Favre,"Obviously talent gets you to a certain point, but it's what you do with it, how you handle."
Brett Favre,"My wife, she still gives me a hard time, and says I hunt too much or I like to play golf too much. And she's probably right, but it sure beats some of the things I used to do."
Brett Favre,"Life deals you a lot lessons, some people learn from it, some people don't."
Brett Favre,"Just, you never know what the next day is going to bring. That goes for football, goes for off the field, and I gave up a long time ago trying to predict the future and trying to deal with things I couldn't deal with."
Brett Favre,"It's been six years since I have had a drink and I have two girls, and my priorities are a lot different now and I just can't believe I was that guy. And I would not go back, I would not trade the way I am now for anything."
Brett Favre,"It's a difficult job to do, but that is why we do it. Only so many people can do it. But it, it enables you to... for a brief period of time to kind of get away. You have to go back and deal with, but it's a good escape."
Brett Favre,"Initially, I know that I handled it worse than she did and I think partly because I've always been... every bit of adversity I've faced up until the last year and a half is adversity I brought upon myself - or the opposing teams have given me."
Brett Favre,"In this case, I realize that, unlike when I was 22 years old, I realize now that football will not go on forever, it is a small part of your life."
Brett Favre,If I can change than anyone can change. I promise you that.
Brett Favre,"I'm thankful for all the things that this job has given me and my family. But probably the thing that I am most proud of throughout my career is that, not only myself, but my family and the people around me have just been regular people, which we are."
Brett Favre,I'm pretty boring really.
Brett Favre,I'm not perfect.
Brett Favre,"I, most talented players don't always succeed. Some don't even make the team. It's more what's inside."
Brett Favre,I know it's not a one man team win or lose.
Brett Favre,"I don't worry anymore about where's the big hangout Tuesday night, Friday. Couldn't tell you and no one comes to me for advice anymore in those areas anymore, so real boring I would say."
Brett Favre,I don't really care what's going on I just care about getting my job done the best that I can possibly do and deal with the other things in my life that take a lot of time and a lot of thought.
Brett Favre,"I consider myself more of a loner now and I think when you get older, especially in this game, and just talking with other players who have come and gone, I see what they were saying when I was a young guy in the locker room."
Brett Favre,I consider adversity being good sometimes you know.
Brett Favre,"I can't believe I survived, not only my life, but I am still playing football 'cause half of those eight or nine years I don't even remember."
Brett Favre,"God, he deals you blows that at sometimes you think you can't handle and in the last year there have been things that we thought we couldn't handle but we've dealt with it up until this point."
Brett Favre,"But when you lose a family member or something tragic happens, that stays with you forever. You never get over it. Knowing that you have to deal with that for the rest of your life... Football is important, but not as important as you once thought it was."
Brett Favre,"Because after my first year I had a lot of success, took everybody by storm, came back the next year thought it was easy and didn't have near the season I had the previous year. It was kind of a wake-up call. And so, life goes on."
Brett Favre,"As you get older, you look at things differently."

Brett Favre,"With each game I play, each season I play, everyone would agree with me, I'm running out of chances."
Brett Favre,"You're never guaranteed about next year. People ask what you think of next season, you have to seize the opportunities when they're in front of you."
Brett Favre,It's fun leading this offense. I don't think we've hit our peak.
Brett Favre,"Well, I've made that play before, ... (But) the workouts didn't hurt my ability to make it. The defense had played it well, that's for sure."
Jon Favreau,"I looked at the top 10 films every year, and half of them were made for families. That's a safety zone. There is more opportunity for pure storytelling when you're dealing with the family audience and more creative freedom to explore different genres without being held to the same standard as movies geared toward an adult audience."
Jon Favreau,I don't think I'm egotistical as much as I'm taking responsibility for what I'm putting out there.
Jon Favreau,You don't get to steer the ship the way you want it to go. You're a deckhand. It's fun if the movie turns out well.
Nick Fazekas,It feels good. It's something I've worked hard to get. It's something that's an accomplishment.
Nick Fazekas,"It definitely feels good. It's a great accomplishment to win because the regular season is such a grind, and we did that."
Nick Fazekas,That's big because these guys really shoot well. They're not easy to guard. That's a great accomplishment. It's a big step forward for us defensively.

William Feather,No man is a failure who enjoys life
William Feather,"An education isn't how much you have committed to memory, or even how much you know. It's being able to differentiate between what you do know and what you don't. It's knowing where to go to find out what you need to know; and it's knowing how to use the information you get."

William Feather,The philosophy behind much advertising is based on the old observation that every man is really two men - the man he is and the man he wants to be.
William Feather,One way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure
William Feather,"Too many of us wait to do the perfect thing, with the result we do nothing. The way to get ahead is to start now. While many of us are waiting until conditions are just right before we go ahead, others are stumbling along, fortunately ignorant of the dangers that beset them. By the time we are, in our superior wisdom, decided to make a start, we discover that those who have gone fearlessly on before, have, in their blundering way, traveled a considerable distance. If you start now, you will know a lot next year that you don't know now, and that you will not know next year, if you wait."
William Feather,Almost any idea is good if a man has ability and is willing to work hard.

Roger Federer,"This is a great comeback for me, ... I'm really pleased that I could beat such a quality player like this in the finals. These are the big moments. This is how it's going to be at the US Open basically every match. It would be nice to win as many Masters Series as possible because they are for me very prestigious."
Roger Federer,"He beat quality players and he totally deserves to be in the final, you know. Maybe he's changed something in his game. In two weeks he's improved incredibly."
Roger Federer,I think we are all surprised he got so far. He proved us all wrong. He beat quality players and he deserves to be in the final.
Roger Federer,"I guess if it's better for the game, I have no problems playing with it. We really only can tell how it is once we've used it."
Roger Federer,"You always get surprised after being away for five or six weeks. The balls come back so quick. In practice, you can let balls go by. In a match, every point really counts. You kind of have the feeling that everything is going much quicker than you're used to."
Roger Federer,I expect him to play a good match. I just have to make sure my performance is good and make it as hard as possible for him to win.
Roger Federer,"I'm happy with my performance. My movements were good, considering it was the first match of the season."
Roger Federer,Today was a solid performance.
Roger Federer,"It was a solid performance. It's always a test playing against a Spanish player on clay, and you could see the difference from yesterday (against Greg Rusedski)."
Roger Federer,"I've got another opportunity to play him. It's going to give me an indication, you know, if I will play him at the French (Open)."

Roger Federer,"Once you're down a set, you're not allowed to make any more mistakes. I'm relieved I'm through."

Roger Federer,I definitely feel there's room for improvement.
Roger Federer,"It was a great start. I am very happy the way I played. I really had the sense I was returning very well, hardly giving him any points there, holding easy on my serve and from the baseline. I didn't have the feeling I was in any rush at all."
Roger Federer,"It's special. Obviously I like records once in a while. I'm happy I've made one here. He really got the better of me in the beginning, so I had to react and not panic. I did a good job there."

Roger Federer,"In my eyes, James gave it away. For the first time, he was in this position (playing in a featured night match at the Open), but I think James had him and let it go."
Roger Federer,"We'll really see after these two events, Indian Wells and Miami, how I'm really shaping up, if I'm still number one in the race."
Roger Federer,The danger is there of not knowing him and I have got to find out how he plays and what his preferences are. To be honest I don't even know his ranking but for me it is a challenge to get that first point for Switzerland.
Roger Federer,"I think criticism is allowed at this point,"
Roger Federer,"Consistency is what's missing in his game, and he's not 100 per cent sure of his game."

Roger Federer,"I'm always late, I can't cook, I can't get out of bed."
Roger Federer,You always get surprised after being away for five or six weeks. The balls come back so quick.
Roger Federer,"Perhaps it's not quite as loud as somewhere like Italy or South America,"
Roger Federer,"At a young age like this, it is extraordinary, really. I'm a big fan of his game. It's something I haven't seen in - basically never."
Roger Federer,I know there is no need to panic when I'm behind. I have confidence in my ability.
Jay Feely,"When you have the opportunity to win a game for your team and the game is on the line and you don't come through, you feel like you let your team down. And to now get a chance to somewhat redeem myself and come back and help us win a tough game that we needed is important."
Jay Feely,"I'm not going to stop being aggressive, ... I was very frustrated with our kick coverage Sunday night. That was a big play. I spent time with the coaches to see how we can be better and part of it is being down there to help out. If I'm back there on the 50, I don't see how that's going to help us get better. It might make matters worse."
Jay Feely,"This was a night when the special teams had to come through. It doesn't mean a whole lot, but it gives our team confidence in their kicker - and maybe it moves me up in some fantasy league drafts."
Jay Feely,I didn't look up. I had a feeling they were doing something like that because I heard the music and it was kind of eerie. I couldn't subject myself to that.
Jay Feely,"The music was eerie, so I figured they were playing something like that. I tried to visualize what I needed to do."
Jay Feely,"This is what being a man is all about. Being able to accept when you don't come through. When I make a mistake with my kids at home, I sit them down and say I am sorry I made a mistake and I am going to be a better dad. And you do the same thing with your job."
Jules Feiffer,"I used to think I was poor. Then they told me I wasn't poor, I was needy. Then they told me it was self-defeating to think of myself as needy. I was deprived. (Oh not deprived but rather underprivileged.) Then they told me that underprivileged was overused. I was disadvantaged. I still don't have a dime. But I have a great vocabulary."
Jules Feiffer,"The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women. Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean you like women any more at twenty-one than you did at ten."
Jules Feiffer,Getting out of bed in the morning is an act of false confidence.
Jules Feiffer,"I grew up to have my father's looks, my father's speech patterns, my father's posture, my father's opinions, and my mother's contempt for my father."

John Feinstein,Next Man Up: A Year Behind the Lines in Today's NFL
John Feinstein,"Obviously, it was inexcusable. I just felt under the circumstances that if they didn't want me to come back, then I would have understood."
John Feinstein,"I think what George Mason has done is the greater accomplishment. Once Penn was by North Carolina, because of the other upsets they were playing teams that were comparable to them and teams they knew they could beat."

Jack Feldman,"As we lose them, we grow more prone to central sleep apnea."
Jack Feldman,We're facing a serious crisis that may end up culling some of the very best people out of the biomedical research enterprise. There will be people who lose all funding or have gaps in funding so they can't maintain the infrastructure they've built.

Jack Feldman,Our research suggests that the pre-Boetzinger complex contains a fixed number of neurons that we lose as we age.

Gloria Feldt,"Today's ruling is a landmark victory for medical privacy rights and women's health,"
Gloria Feldt,To offer them money in a situation where it could be just feeding their habit -- it really smacks of coercion.
Gloria Feldt,"This dangerous ban prevents women, in consultation with their families and doctors, from making decisions about their own health, ... We hope the court will recognize the unconstitutionality of this ban and strike it down."
Gloria Feldt,"This ruling is a critical step toward ensuring that women and doctors -- not politicians -- can make private, personal health care decisions,"
Gloria Feldt,The Ashcroft Department of Justice can no longer threaten Planned Parenthood doctors with the daunting specter of criminal prosecution for putting their patients first.
Gloria Feldt,"This unconstitutional law denies women, in consultation with their doctors and families, the right to make decisions about their own health,"
Gloria Feldt,I think that this Administration and Congress are weaving a pernicious web of anti-choice initiatives that taken together strangle reproductive rights.
Bob Feller,"You figure they cheat at the ballpark, they'll cheat on the golf course, they'll cheat in business, and anything else in life. Players may laugh about it and say it's funny, but right down in their heart, they don't think it's funny at all, and they have no respect for a person who cheats."
Bob Feller,Baseball in the Navy always was much more fun than it had been in the major leagues.
Bob Feller,"Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterday's success or put its failures behind and start over again. That's the way life is, with a new game every day, and that's the way baseball is."

Federico Fellini,It's easier to be faithful to a restaurant than it is to a woman.
Federico Fellini,Censorship is advertising paid by the government.
Federico Fellini,"Talking about dreams is like talking about movies, since the cinema uses the language of dreams; years can pass in a second and you can hop from one place to another.

Federico Fellini,"Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole, it would be about me."

Ron Fellows,"I won there once, and I would like to do it again with Team Cadillac. The Long Beach race has a great atmosphere, a fun event with big crowds. It's an event that has a rich history, held on a track that became the first successful street circuit in the U.S. It's become a fixture in international racing."
Ron Fellows,"Obviously, you want to win the pole. There's pride on the line. They beat us here last year and we don't want to give up anything to them."
Ron Fellows,"It's special for me. This is home, ... I don't know a lot of the other drivers have this kind of luxury. It's an hour from home, and this is where I did most of my growing up. My first car racing experience was here, and I've just had a number of great memories of Mosport."

Edna Ferber,I am not belittling the brave pioneer men but the sunbonnet as well as the sombrero has helped to settle this glorious land of ours.
Edna Ferber,"Wasn't marriage, like life, unstimulating and unprofitable and somewhat empty when too well ordered and protected and guarded? Wasn't it finer, more splendid, more nourishing, when it was, like life itself, a mixture of the sordid and the magnificent; of mud and stars; of earth and flowers; of love and hate and laughter and tears and ugliness and beauty and hurt?"

Edna Ferber,"Roast Beef, medium, is not only a food. It is a philosophy. Seated at Life's Dining Table, with the menu of Morals before you, your eye wanders a bit over the entrTes, the hors d'oeuvres, and the things a la though you know that Roast Beef, medium, is safe and sane, and sure."

Edna Ferber,"Any garment which is cut to fit you is much more becoming, even if it is not so splendid as a garment which has been cut to fit somebody not of your stature."
Edna Ferber,"A stricken tree, a living thing, so beautiful, so dignified, so admirable in its potential longevity, is, next to man, perhaps the most touching of wounded objects."
Edna Ferber,A closed mind is a dying mind.
Edna Ferber,A woman can look both moral and exciting... if she also looks as if it was quite a struggle.
Edna Ferber,Big doesn't necessarily mean better. Sunflowers aren't better than violets.
Edna Ferber,Writers should be read but not seen. Rarely are they a winsome sight.
Edna Ferber,Christmas isn't a season. It's a feeling.
Rio Ferdinand,"He's a quality player,"
Rio Ferdinand,That just proves the quality we have here with some of the young players.
Rio Ferdinand,"If any player has a bad game it's there in the back of your mind in the next game. There's always a hangover.Ã¡It is like a wounded animal in a way, as you want to get out there as quick as possible and rectify it."
Rio Ferdinand,"In my mind, and in a lot of the lads' minds, we are still concentrating all our efforts on finishing second."
Rio Ferdinand,"You get a bad result one week and it's a natural reaction to go out in the next game and put it behind you and do well,"
Rio Ferdinand,"At times, European football can be very slow but it speeds up in the final third,"
Rio Ferdinand,I want a new contract. I'm happy at United and I see my future here.
Rio Ferdinand,"There is a hangover from a defeat like Denmark - ask any player about when they've had a bad game, it's still in there somewhere in the back of your mind,"
Andrew Ference,"Getting Dion this year made up for losing a lot of other people. Of course he has a learning curve, but he doesn't have big holes in his game. He just has tiny details he has to work out, and the coaches love working with a guy with that much talent."
Andrew Ference,"We're not the team that is on the highlights every night with the pretty goals. But we're also not on the highlights giving up the pretty goals. We didn't change much this year. With this team, the emphasis is always going to be on our end."
Andrew Ference,"After we had a successful (2004) playoff run. I think that's when the priorities changed. It's the environment everybody wanted to be a part of, with higher expectations and setting our sights higher. That's what good teams do."
Andrew Ference,"We just haven't had that consistency. We've thrown some good periods together, but from game to game that consistency hasn't been there. It's something we've got to look back to getting back on track (Wednesday)."
Andrew Ference,"There's strong character in our dressing room. Right now, it's just a matter of execution. If everybody shows up and does their job, I think there's a ton of confidence."
Andrew Ference,"I was happy, going from Pittsburgh to here. I was pumped. Coming back to Alberta, coming back to Canada, coming to a good team. But now, if it happened again, I'd be really disappointed. Everyone likes it here -- we win, good atmosphere, good town."
Andrew Ference,We also share in the belief we do have what it takes in this locker-room and there's no great piece of the puzzle out there we're missing.
Kirk Ferentz,"We've already failed one challenge. Not so much on the scoreboard, but the way we performed that day."
Kirk Ferentz,"The main thing is he's not polished. But the thing is, he's a guy the coaches can trust to do the right things, make the right decisions."
Kirk Ferentz,"That's one of the things that caught our eye watching him in high school,"
Kirk Ferentz,"Like any great player, you can't simulate them in practice,"
Kirk Ferentz,We showed some improvement. I think we also showed the need for more improvement.
Kirk Ferentz,"I'm sure nobody in their locker room is happy, because you're never happy when you come up short on the scoreboard. I know they came in here intending to win. They sure played like it."
Kirk Ferentz,"Marcus isn't full speed yet, so there's some guys fighting for some time and positions there."
Kirk Ferentz,"We're real pleased with Albert's start to the season, certainly, and we've had good feelings about him for three years now, ... It's exciting to have him out there on the field, but all it does is enable us to have a better chance to be more balanced. We certainly weren't able to get that done last year for obvious reasons, and I think this year, all of our running backs have really done a good job. They've been practicing well and it's probably been a bright spot on our football team."
Kirk Ferentz,"After what they saw (last week), I'm sure that'll give them more encouragement, and rightfully so."
Kirk Ferentz,It's improving but the danger there is we can't fool ourselves and think our percentage (of signing top recruits) is going to be as good as some of the other schools. We have to keep recruiting the way we have been recruiting and looking for the same traits and attributes.
Kirk Ferentz,"Hey, coach, you're back in the mix. Talk about being back in the hunt - what do you say to your young guys ..."
Kirk Ferentz,"I think the consensus was and continues to be they'd rather be together on Christmas. That was our thought; get down here, it gives us a chance to get our feet on the ground and, most importantly, we're all here together."
Kirk Ferentz,I don't know if you could write a better script. Nobody would believe it if you did.
Kirk Ferentz,He was probably the only guy in America who could get that job done.
Kirk Ferentz,"We faced some adversity, and to respond in a positive way, that's good for everybody. Hopefully we learned something about ourselves."
John Ferguson,"We value his services,"
John Ferguson,"They want their trade-chain partners, including their carriers, to be C-TPAT certified."
John Ferguson,"Because we're involved with both the U.S. and Canadian security initiatives, we're able to take advantage of the latest expedited customs release programs, which often include electronic data transmission of trade document information."
John Ferguson,We have built network context on top of vulnerability management.
John Ferguson,"From the first moment he laid eyes on this horse, ... he felt it was very, very important that this horse race for his brothers."
John Ferguson,"I have to hand it to Raul. This is one of the best organized, most well-run events I've been to. He really did it right."
John Ferguson,We're going to be quicker. We're going to rely on players who continue to improve. We'll have a new coach to lead us in that direction.
John Ferguson,One U.S./Canada border crossing alone may conduct more than $400 million a day in trade. A significant volume of goods flow between the countries.
John Ferguson,"This was a horse Sheikh Mohammed felt was the best Storm Cat he had seen. He was an outstanding athlete from a very good family and has the same (genetic) cross as (sire) Giant's Causeway . From the moment Sheikh Mohammed laid eyes on this horse, he felt it was very important that he and his brothers race him in the Godolphin name. (We were) very keen to get him."
John Ferguson,If some common sense comes out of the next collective bargaining agreement I don't see why Winnipeg shouldn't have a team. Hockey is the only game in town during the winter there -- you don't watch NASCAR and you're not that interested in basketball.
Matt Ferguson,"After the United States created more than 2 million jobs in 2005, economists are predicting 2 million more will be added in 2006. Faced with increased competition for talent with specialized skills, companies are planning to shorten the hiring cycle, offer better compensation packages and implement more flexible work arrangements in the coming year."
Matt Ferguson,There is no way we can script what they're going to experience. But hopefully we can give them some tools to use when they assist a military family in their darkest hour.
Matt Ferguson,"Recruitment trends are tied to confidence in the economy and 56 percent of hiring managers expect the economy to improve in 2004. While more than half of hiring managers will be focused on employee turnover in the coming year, what is encouraging is that almost one-third will recruit to expand their business, introduce new products and services or enhance customer relations. After two years of a relatively flat job recovery, this is a positive indicator that job creation is on the rebound."
Matt Ferguson,I believe giving businesses a massive tax break without considering our state's most vulnerable residents is an immoral action.
Roger Ferguson,"You can't have a crummy game and win like you could in other sports, because it's all up to you. There is a saying in wrestling, ' If it is to be, it's up to me'. It takes a lot of guts to take on that responsibility and scrutiny."
Roger Ferguson,"Clearly, the immediate impact of the events of Sept. 11 was negative -- from disrupted sales, air travel and production, not to mention the effect on the attitudes and expectations of consumers and businesses,"
Roger Ferguson,"Inflation expectations that are well anchored provide policy-makers much greater flexibility to respond as unexpected events unfold in financial markets,"
Roger Ferguson,Coach Johnson has been very supportive.
Alejandro Fernandez,It has made it possible for Human Resources to provide quality service in all of our locations.
Alejandro Fernandez,"I feel very proud to be an ambassador of Mexican music. Wherever I go, I will always bring my mariachi. It's what I grew up with. It's what I love the most,"
Alejandro Fernandez,"[During Hispanic Heritage Month, Fernandez will host the special four-hour miniseries on the history of Mexico featuring the story of the Aztecs, once the world's mightiest civilization and the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the first massive people's revolt of the 20th century. The programs will air on September 17 & 18th at 8 PM, ET (Repeats, Oct. 8 & 9) Additionally, Fernandez will host the biography of Pancho Villa airing September 15th at 7 PM ET.] I'm pleased to honor our heritage by joining The History Channel en espanol to bring the history and culture of our people to the U.S. Hispanic market and to America, ... Our history defines and strengthens us. It is important that our children know our roots and that we celebrate our heroes not just during this month, but throughout the year."
Alejandro Fernandez,A Corazon Abierto (An Open Heart).
Alejandro Fernandez,"[His father wasn't thrilled with his venture into pop,] but now he understands because he's seen the results among the people, ... It's not completely to his liking, but what else can he do now that he sees I was right?"
Alejandro Fernandez,"Without a doubt that song has special meaning for me because it created so many things for me that might have never been there otherwise, ... You know there are certain songs I could never leave out of the mix, and that one is certainly at the top of the list."
Alejandro Fernandez,"I'm pleased to honor our heritage by joining The History Channel en espanol to bring the history and culture of our people to the U.S. Hispanic market and to America, ... Our history defines and strengthens us. It is important that our children know our roots and that we celebrate our heroes not just during this month, but throughout the year."
Alejandro Fernandez,"I try to stay current with what's being listened to in the market, because (there is) competition when I put out a pop album. Obviously, I love Mexican music (too), because it's so much more passionate, and I'm like that. ... But I love music in general."
Jose Fernandez,"She had a great game tonight. She had a good bounce to her, running up and down the court, defending as well. She was assertive and looked good until the fall."
Jose Fernandez,"She was questionable going in and played with a great deal of pain. For a jump shooter, that's tough coming off the floor with that bounce, and I think that's why she struggled a little bit."
Jose Fernandez,"We've got to win at home. If you can take care of your home court and get some splits on the road, you'll be in good shape. But you have to protect your home floor."
Jose Fernandez,"It's a tough way to lose. I told our players that games aren't won or lost in the last 30-40 seconds. We shot 50 percent from the free-throw line in the second half, and that's not going to get it done against the type of teams we're playing in this league."
Jose Fernandez,It definitely hurts in the locker room. We're an NCAA (Tournament) team. We've just got to win these games. These are the type of games that you need to win to put you over the top.
Jose Fernandez,It's going to be fun to watch.
Jose Fernandez,Getting to the NCAA Tournament is so special. It's like our football team getting to their first bowl game. It opens a lot of doors. And there's nothing like the first time.
Jose Fernandez,"It's like the build-up to Christmas, waiting to open the big present under the tree. You don't know what you're going to get. Hopefully the NCAA selection committee is like a whole big Santa Claus."
Jose Fernandez,"I want to join the U.S. Army or Air Force, but because of the language, I can't."
Geraldine Ferraro,"You people married to Italian men, you know what it's like."
Geraldine Ferraro,"It was not so very long ago that people thought that semiconductors were part-time orchestra leaders and microchips were very, very small snack foods."
Geraldine Ferraro,"I look forward to the months ahead as a vigorous contest of issues and ideas,"
Geraldine Ferraro,"We've chosen the path to equality, don't let them turn us around."
Geraldine Ferraro,"I'd call it a new version of voodoo economics, but I'm afraid that would give witch doctors a bad name."
Geraldine Ferraro,"I went from being a kid who lost her father [at age 8] and who lived in the South Bronx to almost going in to live in the White House, ... That just tells you what this country is all about."
Will Ferrell,"giggling, 'You're so cute!'"
Will Ferrell,"One of the challenges you will face is finding a job in our depressed economy, ... In fact, the chances of finding a job are about as good as finding weapons of mass destruction in the Iraqi desert -- slim and none, and slim just left the building."
Will Ferrell,"It's important that this character is played real, or straight, the whole way through and not winking at the audience. It was approached from a dramatic side as much as a comedic side."
Will Ferrell,"Saturday Night Live is such a comedy boot camp in a way, because you get to work with so many different people who come in to host the show and you get thrown into so many situations and learn how to think on your feet, so filmmaking actually feels slow, in a good way."
Will Ferrell,"I think a lot of the instincts you have doing comedy are really the same for doing drama, in that it's essentially about listening. The way I approach comedy, is you have to commit to everything as if it's a dramatic role, meaning you play it straight."
Will Ferrell,"A lot of people have gotten into comedy because of certain influences in their lives or events that were painful, and I really have wracked my brain to figure it out. I pretty much have had a normal childhood. Maybe it was too normal."
Will Ferrell,"All you have in comedy, in general, is just going with your instincts. You can only hope that other people think that what you think is funny is funny. I don't have an answer but I just try to plough straight ahead."
Will Ferrell,"Often times I'm confronted with a quote that I don't remember saying. So, on one hand it's very flattering, it is just so surreal."
Will Ferrell,I have only been funny about seventy four per cent of the time. Yes I think that is right. Seventy-four per cent of the time.
Will Ferrell,James Caan told me at the end of filming 'Elf' that he had been waiting through the whole film for me to be funny - and I never was.
Bryan Ferry,Wonderful! All these trashy women wandering around done up to the nines. I love it.
Bryan Ferry,Women! I have no idea. I don't know anything about women at all. They're a complete mystery to me.
Bryan Ferry,"You can never get silence anywhere nowadays, have you noticed?"
Bryan Ferry,"Secretly, I wanted to look like Jimi Hendrix, but I could never quite pull it off."
Bryan Ferry,"But when you get music and words together, that can be a very powerful thing."
Jeff Fettig,"The combined companies will create substantial benefits for consumers, trade customers and shareholders through continued development of innovative products, improved quality and service, and cost efficiencies."
Jeff Fettig,We appreciate the work of the Department of Justice staff to date and will continue to work with them cooperatively as they complete their review.
Jeff Fettig,"Our first-quarter results reflect solid performance by all regional businesses, strong earnings momentum generated from innovation, productivity, and leverage from our global operating platform. These results reflect the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales improvement and each of our four regional businesses delivered higher operating income during the quarter."
Jeff Fettig,We welcome the determination by the Maytag board of directors that ours is a superior proposal and look forward to the signing of a definitive agreement with Maytag.
Jeff Fettig,"We welcome the determination by the Maytag board of directors that ours is a superior proposal and look forward to the signing of a definitive agreement with Maytag,"
Mark Few,"We get a lot of requests for scheduling. We see what fits the dates and what we're trying to accomplish. We have had discussions about doing some home-and-homes with Xavier, but we have a lot of people that are interested in doing that."
Mark Few,We did a nice job out there. Our zone was great tonight but it's been good all year. The strength of this team is it's got great versatility.
Mark Few,Society always wants to pick a winner. I don't know how you can choose between the two of them.
Mark Few,"He's a heck of a defender. He's a guy who takes a lot of pride in that. He's a guy who has a lot of power, he's strong, he's athletic and he's long. It's a team game, and you have to take what they give you. Adam does a pretty good job of taking what others give him."
Mark Few,"It's been neat watching him run up and down, banging our guys [at practice] and playing with a lot of enthusiasm,"
Mark Few,That was a performance tonight against the other best big on the West Coast.
Mark Few,I don't know what else to say about Adam's performance that hasn't already been said. I think it's sad that we have come to expect those types of games from him every night and wonder what's wrong when he doesn't deliver.
Mark Few,We had the ball in the hands of the people we wanted to have it in.
Mark Few,"He's struggled this year, but he's showing signs of helping us more than he has in the past on the defensive end."
Mark Few,"Absolutely not. I'd suggest that we're getting the absolute best shots from every team in our conference every night. We've got the Superman logo on our chests. The teams in our conference know us, they know what we do. It's not easy."
Mark Few,The unsung guy is Batista. He keeps delivering and delivering and delivering every night out.
Mark Few,He's not going to hit eight of 10 3s every night. We fought through it.
Mark Few,He's probably the least politically correct of any of our guys and he doesn't seem to mind inciting a riot in opposing gyms.
Mark Few,"It's something we really, really would love to do because we just want to keep playing."
Mark Few,"I don't know how important it is. It's something we'd really love to do, because we just want to keep playing. Certainly we know that we've had an incredible year. We've accomplished amazing things this year. I want them to feel good about that. But yet, we want them hungry. I feel they are hungry going into this thing."
Mark Few,Sometimes this thing becomes bigger than life itself. It isn't.
Mark Few,"That's a great program, there's no question about that. I try not to think about that kind of stuff. At the same, I would never say never, either."
Mark Few,I'm not going to get into any job stuff.
Mark Few,"This is a great honor for Adam and for our program. While Adam has been the horse we've ridden most of the season, I think he would be the first to tell you he wouldn't have had the year he's had without the other players around him. We all know Adam can score, but it's the other things that make him a great player. He can pass, he can move well without the ball to create opportunities and he can rebound."
Mark Few,"We hate to lose Adam, but we wish him well. He leaves as the most decorated player in Gonzaga history. He's been an integral force behind what we've been able to keep going the past three years."
Mark Few,Teams have been coming at us all year. We get everyone's best shot and the last (few) games were no different. We had to battle to win them.
Mark Few,"When teams go out and try to physically take him (Morrison) off his game, he's going to shoot a lot of free throws. People say the same thing about Duke. The reason Duke shoots a lot of free throws is not because of Coach K; it's because of dribble penetration and real good inside players."
Mark Few,He has matured. He's recognizing there are other parts that are somewhat as important to his game as scoring.
Mark Few,"They do such a great job with that show. I get up and watch the football one all the time. This is a neat thing, something to get excited about."
Mark Few,The reason we win games is not typical of a top 5 team. 'We're winning on execution and heart and guts and playing smart.
Mark Few,We were stagnant. We had no energy. It was time to see somebody else.
Mark Few,The energy just seems to radiate from him. We just seem to raise our level.
Mark Few,There was no doubt when it left his hands it was going in.
Mark Few,There is not a doubt in my mind that any team in this league can beat us. But we have shown we can beat every team in this league.
Mark Few,"It's far and away the toughest schedule we've undertaken, ... and it's by design. We have a veteran team, and with the addition of those guys, it's really the year to go out and play that kind of schedule."
Mark Few,"This is a great honor for Adam. I've always said it is a great honor to play for your country, but to have a chance to play in the Olympics takes that honor to a higher level."
Mark Few,"He was a good, big low post scorer in junior college. There aren't many of those out there. Everybody is looking for them."
Mark Few,"I'll never coach another kid like that. I mean, he's a warrior. He is such an incredible competitor that it can't help but be contagious. He's literally willed us all year to wins."
Mark Few,I told him I was sorry for him. I told him he was a great coach and even a better person.
Mark Few,I have really tough guys with a ton of character. They're winners.
Mark Few,You saw two good teams going at it tonight on the floor. Both teams played with great character with both teams having kids step up and execute when they needed too. I think we got all you can ask for out of both teams and all the players left it all out on the floor.
Mark Few,"The business has changed and the landscape has changed since those legendary days. There are a lot more really, really good teams and a lot more getting into the NCAA tournament now."
Mark Few,"It's his decision and it's his time frame. He loves basketball, he loves his teammates. I have to do the best job I can of giving him proper facts about it."
Mark Few,They do a good job of taking care of the basketball. They milk the clock on offense.
Mark Few,"That was a heck of a college basketball game. That was two teams that were slugging it out to stay alive. A team (Xavier) that athletic and that skilled and that well coached and that tough on the defensive side of the ball looked like a five, a four or a three."
Mark Few,"I don't think guys should ever say that. They are questioning the integrity of the game of basketball, questioning the integrity of officials."
Mark Few,The poorest descriptor of a basketball program is whether their school has football or not. It's how good the players are and how well they execute on offense and how hard they play defense and how well they play together.
Mark Few,"Coaching college basketball is a high-pressure endeavor, and I think maybe people say things based on emotion. I don't think guys should ever say that. It's questioning the integrity of the game of college basketball, and it's questioning the integrity of the officials."
Mark Few,"This truly is a great day. A great day for Adam, a great day for our basketball program and me personally."
Mark Few,"This truly is a great day. A great day for Adam, a great day for our basketball program and me personally. It's the right decision because he and his family went about it the right way. ... It's what he wants to do and he is ready for it. He's going to be a great player at the next level."
Mark Few,"No game is over with the three-point shot, the ability to lengthen the game, foul, make plays down the stretch. I think that's the big thing."
Richard P. Feynman,"It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man."
Richard P. Feynman,"Scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged as a stage for God to watch man's struggle for good and evil seems inadequate."
Richard P. Feynman,There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them!
Richard P. Feynman,"We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on."
Richard P. Feynman,"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"What sort of philosophy one chooses depends, therefore, on what sort of man one is; for a philosophical system is not a dead piece of furniture that we can reject or accept as we wish; it is rather a thing animated by the soul of the person who holds it."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,What sort of philosophy one chooses depends on what sort of person one is.
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"To those who do not love God, all things must work together immediately for pain and torment, until, by means of the tribulation, they are led to salvation at last."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"Pure thought is itself the divine existence; and conversely, the divine existence, in its immediate essence, is nothing else than pure thought."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"God is not the mere dead conception to which we have thus given utterance, but he is in himself pure Life."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"Full surely there is a blessedness beyond the grave for those who have already entered on it here, and in no other form than that wherein they know it here, at any moment."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"By philosophy the mind of man comes to itself, and from henceforth rests on itself without foreign aid, and is completely master of itself, as the dancer of his feet, or the boxer of his hands."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"A man can do what he ought to do; and when he says he cannot, it is because he will not."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,"By mere burial man arrives not at bliss; and in the future life, throughout its whole infinite range, they will seek for happiness as vainly as they sought it here, who seek it in aught else than that which so closely surrounds them here - the Infinite."
Johann Gottlieb Fichte,Humanity may endure the loss of everything; all its possessions may be turned away without infringing its true dignity - all but the possibility of improvement.
Geoffrey Fieger,She probably never will progress beyond nine years old.
Geoffrey Fieger,Our schools must never again become a shooting gallery. As a result of this suit we will gain subpoena power to assist in the continuing investigations.
Geoffrey Fieger,"All that happened was that Robert was threatened and, really, intimidated from doing what his mother had taught him to do, which was to make an emergency call in an emergency situation."
Geoffrey Fieger,"This lawsuit is about duty, this lawsuit is about accountability, this lawsuit is about responsibility."
Geoffrey Fieger,He may very well see this as the high noon. I think he's actually under the belief that he's not simply a doctor now. I think he wants to be a jailhouse lawyer.
Marshall Field,"I have tried to make all my acts and commercial moves the result of definite consideration and sound judgment. There were never any great ventures or risks. I practiced honest, slow-growing business methods, and tried to back them with energy and good system."
Marshall Field,More things to remember: 7) The value of time; 8) The pleasure of working; 9) The obligation of duty; 10) The power of kindness; 11) The wisdom of economy; 12) The virtue of patience.
Marshall Field,Good will is the one and only asset that competition cannot undersell or destroy.
Marshall Field,Things to remember: 1) The worth of character; 2) The improvement of talent; 3) The influence of example; 4) The joy of origination; 5) The dignity of simplicity; 6) The success of perseverance.
Marshall Field,Goodwill is the only asset that competition cannot undersell or destroy.
Marshall Field,Give the lady what she wants!
Marshall Field,"Right or wrong, the customer is always right."
Debbi Fields,You do not have to be superhuman to do what you believe in.
Debbi Fields,I use nothing but the best ingredients. My cookies are always baked fresh. I price cookies so that you cannot make them at home for any less. And I still give cookies away.
Debbi Fields,"Number one, I absolutely love making chocolate chip cookies. I mean, it's fun. It's exciting. Beyond the fact that I love making them, I love eating them."
Debbi Fields,"If you're going to be at a job environment, you should love it. You shouldn't do it just for money. You should do it because you love it. And the money comes naturally."
Debbi Fields,Good enough never is.
Debbi Fields,I've never felt like I was in the cookie business. I've always been in a feel good feeling business. My job is to sell joy. My job is to sell happiness. My job is to sell an experience.
Dorothy Fields,Write what you feel. Write because of that need for expression.
Dorothy Fields,"We're confined to a framework of music, and I feel that the words can be poetic, but I wouldn't say poetry in the strictest sense."
Dorothy Fields,"The songwriter mustn't fall in love with his own song. If it doesn't belong, he can't push it into a show. Let him save it; maybe it'll fit in another show."
Dorothy Fields,"The audience, going along with the story, knows when the song is stuck in, feels it, resents it and can't enjoy it, and the song fails."
Dorothy Fields,"No thesaurus can give you those words, no rhyming dictionary. They must happen out of you."
Dorothy Fields,"My father assigned me to keep his scrapbooks. At first I was interested in reading only his rave notices, but I got interested in reading what the critics were saying about whether the play was good or not."
Dorothy Fields,Love is the reason you were born.
Dorothy Fields,"Keep it in tune with the times, but don't write with the specific purpose of trying to create a hit. If you're doing it strictly to make money, you're crazy. There are easier ways to make money."
Dorothy Fields,"In a show or a movie, one must work with many people. Many women just don't have the time for it."
Dorothy Fields,"If you don't have a story that will hold the audience, you won't have a successful show."
Dorothy Fields,"I don't care how good a song is - if it holds back the storyline, stalls the plot, your audience will reject it."
Dorothy Fields,"I do think song writing is a man's game. It requires push, energy, movement, mixing; it is a field that is and has been dominated by men."
Dorothy Fields,"I do not think men have more talent. There are a great many women in the arts; novelists, painters, sculptors, poets-but the proportion is far lower in the field of song writing."
Dorothy Fields,"I began to be impressed by what made a good book-how you needed to have a sensible story, a plot that developed, with a beginning, a middle, and an end that would tie everything together."
Dorothy Fields,Elizabeth Barrett Browning could write a poem two pages long. Could she have brought it to a music publisher?
Dorothy Fields,A songwriter should have friends who are similarly interested; should move about in the milieu of work he has chosen for himself.
Dorothy Fields,"A song must move the story ahead. A song must take the place of dialogue. If a song halts the show, pushes it back, stalls it, the audience won't buy it; they'll be unhappy."
Dorothy Fields,"A song just doesn't come on. I've always had to tease it out, squeeze it out."
Dorothy Fields,A rhyme doesn't make a song.
Dorothy Fields,"We've accumulated a lot of things over the years and many things from our grandmother. Hopefully it'll be all right. I really don't want to cry, but I can't help it."

Mark Fields,"With more focused brands, new product investment and innovation, Ford will slow the rate of loss and then stabilize our U.S. market share in the near term, even as competitors add new models. From there, we can set our sights on the future."
Mark Fields,"Somewhat slower (economic) growth, higher interest rates and volatile gas prices all add up to auto sales that probably won't outshine last year's selling rate in this new year."
Mark Fields,We were making significant progress to realize the goals set some 20 years ago for an arts center that promoted the region's cultural groups and served a diverse community.

Mark Fields,"Edge underscores the bold, American design direction for all Ford vehicles going forward. Edge also is packed with Ford innovation  from its panoramic glass roof and laptop-friendly center console to fuel-saving engine and advanced safety features. We expect Edge to make waves in the hot crossover market this year just like the Fusion did for midsize cars last year."
Mark Fields,"It's starting the process of being on the mend, but we've got a long way to go, ... My expectation was that Jaguar would show sequential improvement in its business results, and so far it has. At the same time, the Jag situation does not lend itself to a quick fix."
Mark Fields,"What you will see is very original in execution, but very Ford at its heart. It starts to fulfill the promise we made in January, as part of our Way Forward plan, to think like our customers and see the world through their eyes."

Mark Fields,Lincoln customers don't need to shout about success. They are self-made people with enough confidence to be elegant and understated. That understanding of the Lincoln customers will drive our brand and product decisions going forward.
Mark Fields,"The hard but simple reality is that Ford has the costs, capacity and staffing of a company that is much larger than our sales and market share can support."
Mark Fields,"The hard reality is that Ford has the costs, capacity and staffing of a company that is much larger than our sales and market share can support -- even under the best conditions."
Mark Fields,In terms of economic and social influence there is no other company that's had a greater impact on the lives of people in this country and in the 20th century than Ford.
Mark Fields,Ford is a stronger company with all three brands but if -- and only if -- each appeals to a different set of customers.
Mark Fields,We know that the painful choices we are making to idle plants and reduce our staffing create anxiety about the long-term viability of the auto industry itself. But I do not for a moment share the pessimism you're reading about in the press.
Mark Fields,Small is big in America.
Mark Fields,We'll see how the B-car market matures in North America.

Robert Fink,"By bringing these indictments, the government is attempting to criminalize the type of tax planning that tax professionals engage in on a daily basis."
Robert Fink,I have heard from reliable sources that the government intends to indict eight former partners of KPMG in relation to their involvement in alleged tax shelters.
Robert Fink,"If the government wants to put an end to these types of transactions, the proper response is for Congress to change the law, not to scare professionals away with indictments. It is a misuse of prosecutorial discretion to use criminal prosecutions to change accepted and legitimate standards of conduct,"

Brian Finneran,"We have made a few more plays this year but we've also left some out there so there's work to be done. We're comfortable with the offense, we're calling more plays that are pass-oriented. We're making more plays, getting more opportunities to make plays. That's the biggest thing, getting more chances to make plays downfield."
Brian Finneran,"Chris McAlister is probably the toughest defensive back for a wide receiver. It's a combination of his size and strength. He's the whole package. Troy Vincent , Champ Bailey and Charles Woodson are up there, too, but McAlister is the whole package."
Brian Finneran,"It was pretty quiet at times. The potential to fill the place was always there, but it just took the right kind of owner and a good team to change the experience for everyone."
Brian Finneran,"That's the nature of the offense. We have such good running backs and offensive linemen, I'm sure we'll go with that until we struggle. But I'd like to see us up around 30 passes a game so people will stop asking the receivers about it."
Brian Finneran,Matt's been confident since he showed up here. He's had control of the huddle in practice and training camp and in the games he's been in. When his contract's up (after next season) it's going to be interesting to see what happens with that guy.

Larry Finnicum,She's doing well with her goals. She wants to go to Pacific University next year in Forest Grove and wrestle on its all-female wrestling team. She works hard. She's working hard so she can keep her goals. She's definitely improved over the years.
Larry Finnicum,I've enjoyed being around her. She's fun to be around. We have a good time around her. She jokes around with the coaches and everyone on the team. We just have a good time.
Larry Finnicum,"I was pleased. The kids are coming along and we're headed in the right direction. We still have a little ways to go, but we're getting there."

Carly Fiorina,"We've reached a natural transition point. Michael made a commitment to see the merger through, and now thanks to the hard work of the entire team, we are meeting or exceeding all of our integration targets,"
Carly Fiorina,"We've made the tough decisions, the portfolio choices and the necessary investments. We enter the new fiscal year with strong momentum. I have never been more confident in HP's competitive position,"
Carly Fiorina,more choice and lower cost.
Carly Fiorina,The state is facing a unique and extraordinary set of challenges and opportunities that demand the involvement of all of us to address them. It's time for everyone to pull together to improve California's competitiveness.

Carly Fiorina,"The truth is, I'm proud of the life I've lived so far, and although I've made my share of mistakes, I have no regrets."
Carly Fiorina,Most of the media... is positioning the merger with Compaq and the recent actions by Walter Hewlett and David Packard as a fight between the past and the future.
Carly Fiorina,We have looked very carefully at antitrust aspects of this. We're comfortable we can reach an agreement in this kind of time frame.

Stanley Fischer,"We are mindful of the potential tragic consequences of events taking place in Indonesia,"
Stanley Fischer,"The aggressive action by the Fed was extremely welcome,"

Adam Fisher,"I thought I had my first year of college paid for, so I was pretty excited."
Amy Fisher,"[In the story, called] Judging Amy, ... In the deli, at the movies, at the mall, I don't mind people recognizing me. But it is at the workplace where I hit a brick wall. ... They would think I was rich, and applying for the job as a publicity stunt. They didn't understand that I was destitute."
Amy Fisher,It was very emotional. It was a wave of gratitude. How do you express thanks?
Amy Fisher,"Unfortunately, ovarian failure was the grimmest diagnoses we could have received,"
Amy Fisher,"I say use Arts Walk as a goal, ... Create a body of work. It's a great way to discipline yourself, seeing if you can put together a show."
Brian Fisher,Understanding what's out there is essential for us to cherish itâ€¦ We know so little about this life on this planet. Life on this planet is essential for its long-term sustainability.
Brian Fisher,"Humans seem more interested in discovering life on Mars than we are on this planet. Yet understanding life on this planet is critical. It is said that modern medicine didn't begin until the completion of the Human Genome Project . Likewise, we can say that modern biology won't begin until we understand who we share this planet with."
Brian Fisher,"This strong performance reflects higher export prices across almost 80 per cent of all minerals and energy commodities exported, along with increased export volumes for over two thirds."
F. Fisher,"When I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and it is all one."
F. Fisher,"There are many of us who cannot but feel dismal about the future of various cultures. Often it is hard not to agree that we are becoming culinary nitwits, dependent upon fast foods and mass kitchens and megavitamins for our basically rotten nourishment."
F. Fisher,"When a man is small, he loves and hates food with a ferocity which soon dims. But at six years old his very bowels will heave when such a dish as creamed carrots or cold tapioca appears before him. His throat will close, and spots of nausea and rage swim in his vision."

F. Fisher,"Dictionaries are always fun, but not always reassuring."

George Fisher,"Although our cost reduction efforts will position Kodak for an improved 1998, the growing strength of the U.S. dollar, continuing competitive pressures and the phased implementation of the cost reduction program will make it likely that results during the first quarter of 1998 will be below those of 1997,"
George Fisher,Much of the science we need to know and turn to for wisdom on environmental issues is precisely the same science that underlies evolution. That's posed a difficulty for some churches.
George Fisher,"This transaction, along with other progress GM has been making on its turnaround plan, is an important milestone."
George Fisher,"It is unacceptable from the viewpoint of the principles of free trade and open markets, ... The U.S. market is open and Japan's is closed. The world financial markets recognized this. It's too bad the WTO does not."
George Fisher,"If the weak operating performance in July and August were to continue through September, earnings would be significantly lower than the 1996 third quarter.

George Fisher,"We've made a few mistakes along the way, which have cost us some money."

George Fisher,You can't coach that. You either have it or not.
George Fisher,The joint development and cross-licensing agreement ... let's us avoid quibbling about technical details and move forward quickly.
Jeff Fisher,"I believe he's doing a nice job as a returner, he's understanding the subtleties of receiving a kickoff, ... He caught everything moving forward, hit the crease and did everything you are supposed to do."
Jeff Fisher,Arm strength isn't a problem; he had one 65 yards in the air to Reggie Bush. What got him to this point was accuracy and anticipation.
Jeff Fisher,"He is building strength and quickness and he is doing a nice job. We are already starting to see some results, some early results from just being here for three weeks, which is good."
Jeff Fisher,"Totally, totally unnecessary, the kind of thing we showed on the tape from a rules standpoint on player safety, ... Blatant intent to hurt one of our defensive linemen, yet somehow the official on the spot got it wrong and he penalized us."
Jeff Fisher,"It's important he get quality reps in the preseason,"
Jeff Fisher,"He took one, then he delivered one on purpose. He assured me had it been anybody other than a DB, he would've gone down."
Jeff Fisher,"He has a sore back with mild back spasms and tightness, so we held him out of practice. We feel it was just muscle spasms."
Jeff Fisher,I think both of them will practice tomorrow.
Jeff Fisher,I haven't seen a guy like this in years. I've seen impact players but nobody that has the potential to impact a defense like him.
Jeff Fisher,We're going to look around and see if there are some other possibilities.
Jeff Fisher,"Our philosophy has changed primarily because we are so young, ... We're coming back off of injuries and we need to build some momentum. We didn't have a particularly good outing last week. We need to put something together. Regardless of what the Packers would like to do, we are going to play and we're going to play hard."
Jeff Fisher,"He has done great, just since we started in February, just his perspective and respect for the game. That's what it's all about is preserving this game."
Jeff Fisher,"I'm going to look past this one from this standpoint. Right now I think the team that's in that locker room is a much better team than we put on the field in the opener, and that's the most important thing right now."
Jeff Fisher,"He's got to kick it between the uprights. He did a great job kicking off ... He's been told. He understands that. If he can do what he does on the practice field in a game, we won't have any problems,"
Jeff Fisher,What we wanted was to just shut him down. He did a great job getting back last week. We kept him out of change-of-direction things and got some conditioning and shut him down.
Jeff Fisher,"He's completely different here now. He was surviving (Monday) on instinct. We'll settle him down and use technique and those things, and he'll be fine."
Jeff Fisher,"My hope is that Travis Henry will be in the best football shape of his life in four weeks,"
Jeff Fisher,"No one has an excuse,"
Jeff Fisher,"If you want to dance, get up."
Jeff Fisher,"It was a good day from a field position standpoint. I think everybody left with a great deal of confidence in Rob, making three good kicks."
Jeff Fisher,"We anticipated it based on like circumstances over the last few years. Wish we would've been made aware of it sooner. Be that as it may, we're going to deal with it."
Jeff Fisher,"I don't have an opinion on (the other candidates). But this is America, and one of the great things about this country is that they can do that and say what they want."
Jeff Fisher,"You've got to look at football. The bottom line is his ability to play football. You're going to go back to look at his football skills, then of course, everything here becomes a plus."
Jeff Fisher,"You assume that their arm strength and ability to throw a football is there. But it's decision-making and mobility. There are a lot of quarterbacks beyond the top three that have arm strength, but it's the ability to make decisions and win games."
Larry Fisher,"No matter where I go, any form of violence against women is serious,"
Larry Fisher,This is an exploration of both the design and the cost. We are not committed to doing it. It'll depend upon the feasibility.
Larry Fisher,"It's made up of good members; there was a personality conflict, ... I can step in and take the station equipment and create a new fire department."
Mike Fisher,I just need to get the strength back because I can barely shoot the puck.
Mike Fisher,"The strength is just not there and I don't really have anything on my shot,"
Mike Fisher,"We're going to be a different team ... There's no question about it. Jacques was a great coach, but after eight years there was a good chance there was going to be a change. Things have been different around here."
Richard Fisher,"It is not unreasonable to think the [housing market] situation is manageable, albeit worth watching closely."
Richard Fisher,He had three false starts in a game and I was ready to throw something at the television.
Richard Fisher,This is why I think so many economists have been so baffled by the length and strength of the current expansion and the non-inflationary prosperity we have enjoyed over the past two decades.
Richard Fisher,"I do dread that (the injuries). Truth of the matter being, if the Air Force had been the end of Bryce's career I think I would have been a happy man because I wouldn't have to worry about him getting hurt. But since that's his profession, he chose it, I'm glad for him."
Richard Fisher,"We actually ponder the depths and resilience of Chinese capacity, for example, when we sit around the table of the FOMC."
Richard Fisher,"We have to watch things very carefully here because there are inflationary pressures and ... (the Fed's) duty is to be especially vigilant on that front,"
Richard Fisher,shows little inclination to go in the other direction.
Richard Fisher,In our modern age it is very difficult to distinguish between absolute economic and absolute security issues.
Richard Fisher,I think that the advantage of having an 'all clear' is that you have a factor which you can use in the scheduling of EVAs. This allows you to avoid times that are less fortunate. I believe this will be important as we return to the Moon.
Sarah Fisher,"Six years ago when I started this whole fiasco, there were not this many women in these positions to get the attention,"
Sarah Fisher,"We've been running in the top 10 now, and that was our goal; just get solid runs. I think Richard's goal in sending me out here was to get laps and learn how to drive a heavy race car."
Sarah Fisher,"Richard and I have talked about running the Busch Series, but he wants to be 110 percent ready when we do unfold a Busch program,"
Sarah Fisher,With every race we get better and better. I've learned so much about the car and how it handles on the different track configurations. I really like the short tracks and feel we have a good shot at putting the No. 20 NAPA Filters Chevrolet on the podium.
Scott Fisher,There are hardly any words that you can say. ... The whole nation mourns with them.
Scott Fisher,"Churches believe prayer can make a difference, and we've been doing that individually and collectively."
Scott Fisher,"I learned a lot from State, but I learned a lot more out here, ... Farming is a good example of having to listen to your elders."
Scott Fisher,"You have to consider building codes, fixtures and overall design."
Scott Fisher,"Shawn stands out at training as the guy hustling for loose balls, getting up and down the court hard and come game time he's showing how to get the job done."
Steve Fisher,Good players make coaches smile and that's what they did today. They made plays.
Steve Fisher,"He has a wonderful reputation. This is truly a tragic event ... Wherever the result of the injury came from, it's truly tragic."
Steve Fisher,"These are hard, hard losses."
Steve Fisher,"I have been on the other side of a game like this when playing BYU. It can happen. If it happens, it usually happens in your home territory. We guarded. We guarded very, very efficiently. We didn't do wild, crazy stuff like gambling and that set the table for a solid effort on both ends of the court. We were pretty good."
Steve Fisher,"It's not going to be a strange environment for our kids, and I think that's an advantage to us."
Steve Fisher,"We're optimistic that will be the case. His injury was fairly severe, but the doctors feel good about his progress, which makes me feel good."
Steve Fisher,"Slaughter has been spectacular on the glass and we need that to continue. He has a God-given ability to rebound. He is long and athletic. He is not overly explosive or an exceptional jumper, but he just knows where the ball is going to be and is always close to it. That's something you can't teach."
Carlton Fisk,The '70s were a time of turmoil and turnover. But I grew up here. I always wanted to play here.
Carlton Fisk,"It's not what you achieve, it's what you overcome. That's what defines your career."
Carlton Fisk,"It's funny. Some people remember that a lot more than I do. I remember certain parts of it, and if everybody who mentioned that to me had been to the game who said they were at the game, there'd be 800,000 people at that game, I think."
Carlton Fisk,It was just one of those moments in the universe that was mine.
Carlton Fisk,I knew it was gonna go out. It was just a question of it being fair or foul. The wind must have carried it 15 feet toward the foul pole. I just stood there and watched. I didn't want to miss seeing it go out.
Carlton Fisk,"I always looked up there, because I remember a time when the only things on the walls in Fenway were the Jimmy Fund sign and the retired numbers. Never in a million years did you think you'd ever be up there with those guys."
Carlton Fisk,"And then after that, running around the bases, it was just one of those things. You couldn't believe what happened to you. And I look back on it, it's almost like it happened to somebody else."
Carlton Fisk,A million years went by quick.
Emerson Fittipaldi,"He is a driver with talent, ability and maturity, he manages to finish all his races. My record is going to be in good hands. Everything happened very quickly in my career. It was a very great honour for me to break Jim Clark's record (as youngest champion),"
Emerson Fittipaldi,"You are going in one second the length of a football field. That means you brain is receiving information from your body what the car is doing physically, bumping, balance, performance."
Emerson Fittipaldi,"I have a lot of admiration for Fernando Alonso, our careers are fairly similar because he also came very quickly into Formula One,"
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,All good writing is swimming under water and holding your breath.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,The Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe
F. Scott Fitzgerald,The truth was that Jay Gatsbyâ€¦sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement -- discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Her voice is full of money.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Nothing is as obnoxious as other people's luck.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,No such thing as a man willing to be honest --that would be like a blind man willing to see.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,A big man has no time really to do anything but just sit and be big.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Young people do not perceive at once that the giver of wounds is the enemy and the quoted tattle merely the arrow.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,It takes a genius to whine appealingly.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Genius goes around the world in its youth incessantly apologizing for having large feet. What wonder that later in life it should be inclined to raise those feet too swiftly to fools and bores.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"It is in the thirties that we want friends. In the forties, we know they won't save us any more than love did."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Either you think, or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it's these things I'd believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn't all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"If all your clothes are worn to the same state, it means you go out too much."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"â€™Civilizationâ€™s going to pieces,â€™ broke out Tom violently. â€˜Iâ€™ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Colored Empires by this man Goddard?â€™"
F. Scott Fitzgerald,The rich get richer and the poor get â€” children.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"The rhythm of the weekend, with its birth, its planned gaieties, and its announced end, followed the rhythm of life and was a substitute for it."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,There are no second acts in American lives.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Though the Jazz Age continued, it became less and less of an affair of youth. The sequel was like a children's party taken over by the elders."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Advertising is a racket, like the movies and the brokerage business. You cannot be honest without admitting that its constructive contribution to humanity is exactly minus zero."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Genius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Men get to be a mixture of the charming mannerisms of the women they have known.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.
F. Scott Fitzgerald,Forgotten is forgiven.
James Fitzgerald,"As soon as the chief found out about it, he put a stop to it. The chief does not support quotas. He did the right thing."
James Fitzgerald,He offered to testify against himself for the government.
James Fitzgerald,It is not good enough that a measure of this magnitude is signed into law while the government department responsible adopts a policy of silence and allows panic and confusion to run rampant.
James Fitzgerald,I was amazed at what [God] showed me. I prayed that I would devote my life to it.
James Fitzgerald,This is always a great time of year for a food drive to get through the summer months.
James Fitzgerald,"No, not in my experience."
James Fitzgerald,"He said, he wanted to cooperate with the US government only under the circumstances that he would testify against himself at his trial."
Larry Fitzgerald,The struggle was very short-lived. It probably was only a minute or so. We were able to put the restraints on him. He was then carried to the van ... We did not actually use an extraction team because he never really got into the cell.
Larry Fitzgerald,"Both of them are eight-catch receivers. If we do that, it'll take care of a lot of problems we're having on offense."
Larry Fitzgerald,We do not know if the man suffered a bullet wound.
Larry Fitzgerald,"He's a great person to be around, ... He's a great influence on not only me, but the whole receiving corps and this whole football team. He's going to help us out in the locker room and he's definitely going to help us out on the field."
Larry Fitzgerald,"He just told me to hit that hard, work hard on the rehab and ice, ice, ice, ... Don't be on your feet if you don't have to be. He really helped me out. I used his tips and I'm back in three weeks."
Larry Fitzgerald,"We want everybody to sleep on us, think that we're not capable of winning any games this year. No, we'll be fine, man. All three of us are capable of making plays. Kurt's confident in all three of us and our abilities to make plays. We're going to execute when it's time to execute."
Larry Fitzgerald,"We want everybody to sleep on us, think that we're not capable of winning any games this year. That's what we want you guys (media) to think. No, we'll be fine, man. We got a lot of talent. All three of us are capable of making plays. Kurt's confident in all three of us and our abilities to make plays. We're going to execute when it's time to execute."
Larry Fitzgerald,It's kind of a big flashback. It's funny being on the other side.
Larry Fitzgerald,I think the locker room is a huge part of the football team and often is a part that's overlooked. The chemistry in your locker room has a lot to do with how you're going to go out there and perform.
Larry Fitzgerald,"The longer he's out there the more desperate he becomes. He's out there without food, out there without water. We suspect he will start moving."
Larry Fitzgerald,"He wasn't dancing or anything like that, but he was obviously very happy."
Larry Fitzgerald,Coach Goebbel expects me to be a leader of this group even though I'm just a sophomore. At 20 years old I've got a lot of playing experience from last year. I know the offense like the back of my hand so he expects me to help out these younger guys.
Larry Fitzgerald,You have only one body. You have to take care of it.
Larry Fitzgerald,"He'd wrapped his chest in cardboard, sort of like body armor, and that was what enabled him to get across the fence."
Larry Fitzgerald,I couldn't believe he said he'd keep it. I told him how much the gas cost. But he was so appreciative he wants to hang onto it.
Larry Fitzgerald,"Nothing can sneak up on me now, ... Things that I had a lot of anxiety about last year, I expect."
Larry Fitzgerald,We are certainly aware of the crowd we're going to have and we've taken appropriate action.
Larry Fitzgerald,"That's what we practiced all week, working on red-zone plays. We know we have the ability to do it."
Larry Fitzgerald,"In college, most of the time you can get by on your athletic ability, ... Sometimes last year, I got by on athletic ability. But it only takes you so far. To be an upper-echelon receiver in the league ? to be Isaac Bruce or Torry Holt and those type of guys ? you've got to be consistent on a daily basis in route running."
Mark Fitzgerald,"It is a great new service, a bit overdue, in fact."
Mark Fitzgerald,"The gap has been closing from both directions on performance (CCD) benefits vs. cost (CMOS), so the automotive market will remain split between the two technologies for now â€” depending upon application requirements for image quality vs. compactness and cost."
Mark Fitzgerald,"We believe fallout from the Asian currency crisis will lead to steep cuts in capital spending programs at many of the leading Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese firms."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"We need to know the truth. Anyone who would go into a grand jury and lie, obstruct and impede the investigation has committed a serious crime."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"When citizens testify before grand juries, they are required to tell the truth,"
Patrick Fitzgerald,"When citizens testify before grand juries, they are required to tell the truth. The requirement to tell the truth applies equally to all citizens including persons who hold high positions in government."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"The guy who's installing it has ensured me it's going to be hospital-quality air, ... There's no place like it in Columbus. We're going to have six-night-a-week live entertainment, something that someone over 35 can enjoy. It would be more like a jazz club with some '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and maybe some '80s music."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"[Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas derided any potential perjury charge as a] technicality, ... two years' of investigation was not a waste of time and dollars."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"You need to understand the pain, the horror, the agony that the bombing put so many families through."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"When a vice president's chief of staff is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, it does show the world that this is a country that takes its law seriously; that all citizens are bound by the law."
Patrick Fitzgerald,"A CIA employee assigned to provide daily intelligence briefs to the Vice President and Libby has handwritten notes indicating that Libby referred to 'Joe Wilson' and 'Valerie Wilson' by those names in conversation with the briefer on June 14, 2003."
Patrick Fitzgerald,It would be viewed as cooperation with the investigation.
Patrick Fitzgerald,"The truth is the engine of our judicial system, and if you compromise the truth, the whole process is lost."
Patrick Fitzgerald,I would welcome such a communication reaffirming Mr. Libby's waiver.

John Fitzgibbon,Technology companies have snuck in and been profitable.
John Fitzgibbon,"This week's IPO calendar is quality all the way,"
John Fitzgibbon,This week's IPO calendar is quality all the way.
John Fitzgibbon,"It's got the magic going for them. It makes products for fiber optic, broadband cable and wireless."
John Fitzgibbon,"It's living up to the script, ... In light of a down market, an IPO market in ashes, a $10 billion deal, [the fact] that the stock is able to sell at a premium bodes well for major corporations."
John Fitzgibbon,"If you live on the East Coast and have kids 11-to-20 (years old), you've heard of them, ... And there's not a lot else for the IPO market to feast on."
John Fitzgibbon,"ON Semiconductor is going to do very, very well. It has income, it has a p/e ratio."
John Fitzgibbon,"It was like the 1812 Overture, with the cannon fire in the background,"
John Fitzgibbon,"There's an expression I use in these instances: If you increase the price of an IPO, double my order - and if you cut it, cancel my order."
John Fitzgibbon,"[AOL Latin America] is standing at the station with its bags on the platform, but the train has already gone, ... If this deal had gone six months ago it would have shot the moon."
John Fitzgibbon,"The interest and the magic of the word IPO will attract people, ... But after market, it's up to Renaissance's ability to not research the stocks which it's been paid for, but to pick the right stock."
John Fitzpatrick,"Oh man, that would not be good. I think it would be a dangerous thing for anyone to jeopardize the integrity of our court system like that, or to even joke about it. It would belittle the whole essence and core of our integrity."
John Fitzpatrick,"Our dealers were telling us, 'We can sell a luxury truck, you just have to work on your execution,' ... We went back to the customers to research it further, and it turned out the dealers were spot on."
John Fitzpatrick,This project has become a major source of scientific information about North American bird populations. It is a classic example of the vital role citizens and the Internet now play in understanding our planet.
John Fitzpatrick,"Typically, on-line, there is no way to verify age. You have a credit card being offered or a check card that doesn't have a birth date. You're not looking at the person. There's no way to verify who you're dealing with. The only way to deal with that is at the point of delivery in the case of on-line sales."
Ryan Fitzpatrick,"It's not really a surprise. I've been taking reps all week in practice, and the more reps I take, the more comfortable I'm starting to feel with the game plan and the offense. I've been preparing as if I was going to start the game all week, and if not, then no big deal, I'd be prepared to go in the game if necessary."
Ryan Fitzpatrick,"Going in and not being the starter, you kind of get thrown into the situation so you don't have too much time to think about it, ... Once I got that first ball out of my hands, I was fine."
Ryan Fitzpatrick,"I said the horse. He's got a metal shoe on, doesn't he?"
Fannie Flagg,"Being an only child and losing both my parents at an early age, I have found that the friends I have made over the years are the people who help me get through life, good times and bad."
Fannie Flagg,"Strangely enough, the first character in Fried Green Tomatoes was the cafe, and the town. I think a place can be as much a character in a novel as the people."
Fannie Flagg,"Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you're two steps ahead!"
John Flaherty,"I think it's a tremendous service, particularly the online access to minutes. I think it's a tremendous increase in the public access to state agencies."
John Flaherty,"He's a very detail-oriented guy. For this job, he's got a great combination of old-school work ethic - knowing how to put the time in - and the new generation that uses computers and video to get as much information as possible."
John Flaherty,"[Johnson did not stick around after the game to discuss what happened, but catcher John Flaherty said the two men were jawing throughout much of the first two innings.] In the first inning they went back and forth and Fieldin told him, to his credit, that he had had enough, and to calm it down, ... When Randy gets excited, he says a lot to the umpires about pitches he thinks are strikes. It's nothing new."
John Flaherty,"You'd think you were taking good swings off him, but his ball had a little extra life on it, and you'd foul it off. He steps up on the big stage, and he did it today."
John Flaherty,"It is with mixed emotions that I am announcing my retirement. Thank you to all of my teammates, coaches, managers and fans for making the ride so much fun."
John Flaherty,"He controlled his emotions. I'd like to see him get a little more excited out there, but I think he was guarded after what happened the last start in Toronto, and that's only natural."
John Flaherty,"We want Randy to show some emotion out there, so when he does it, you like him to channel it in the right way. Unfortunately, tonight it was directed towards the umpire."
John Flaherty,"Mariano tried to go in on him, which is the book: try and tie him up inside. But he got us again."
John Flaherty,"There may be some blame on both sides. Randy may have stepped over the line, and Fieldin may have gotten carried away too quickly. But when you see the umpire take off his mask, you know you have to be careful."
John Flaherty,"Obviously, the stuff is better. I think the aggressiveness out on the mound is a little bit different. And I think, in terms of game day, you can see the intensity in his eyes. He really understands where he's at with these games down the stretch."
John Flaherty,I think he's a perfect blend of old-school work ethic and new age with the computers and stats.
John Flaherty,"With him, it was never a question of ability, it was whether he could get it over the plate."
Ric Flair,"Girls, you can't be the first, but you can be next."
Ric Flair,"When somebody has convinced you that you're not worth anything to anybody anymore, and they spend a lot of time doing it, you start believing it yourself."
Ric Flair,"To be the man, you gotta beat the man!"
Ric Flair,"Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it still has the longest line!"
Ric Flair,None of this was written to hurt anybody's feelings.
Ric Flair,I'm every woman's dream and every man's nightmare.
Ric Flair,I can take more punishment than anyone in the business.
Ric Flair,"All the women want to be with me, all the men want to be like me."
Ric Flair,"Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it has the longest line."
Jeff Flake,I encouraged him to get in the race as a way to draw the others out.
Jeff Flake,$50 billion is simply too much to give FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) all at once and ensure proper oversight.
Jeff Flake,"[Since then Mr. Hastert and his fellow GOP leaders have skillfully used their narrow majority to win an amazing number of close votes without having to negotiate much with Democrats. But gradually the fear of losing their majority has also begun leading them to behave more and more like the big-spending Democrats they unseated.] Holding the majority used to be viewed as a means to an end--the end being promoting freedom and limited government, ... Now, holding the majority seems to be an end in itself--holding onto power for the sake of holding onto power."
Jeff Flake,"It's unconscionable to pass this burden on to our kids,"
Jeff Flake,"There just is no vision for limited government,"
Jeff Flake,It's more than likely there will be leadership elections in January. We don't want to go into an election year without a permanent majority leader.
Jeff Flake,I have to be a little pessimistic. There is no real stomach for fiscal discipline right now.
Jeff Flake,"The victims of this disaster deserve the swiftest and most efficient response that the federal government can provide,"
Jeff Flake,"Three hundred thousand manufactured homes? People are screaming about that, ... I tell you, FEMA is a disaster."
Jeff Flake,Our real leverage has come from the fear that DeLay will not have a post to come back to. They are deathly afraid of a leadership election in January.
Jeff Flake,There's a lot of fat to trim. ... I wonder if we've been serving in the same Congress.
Jeff Flake,"There was virtually no control at the border. They would go back for birthdays, for Christmas, for holidays, because they could always come back across the border easily."
Jeff Flake,They want to keep the ability to hide earmarks. They don't want the scrutiny.
Jeff Flake,"My guess is that most states would gladly forgo 10 percent of their funding for the ability to make funding decisions,"
Mike Flanagan,"Pattern modeling is very useful and a major step, but users don't always conform to those patterns. For example, when there is a specific event like a traffic jam or a big rugby game there is a big spike in mobile phone calls in a concentrated area. Traditional network design can't cope with those changes in network usage very well."
Mike Flanagan,We felt comfortable moving in this direction. It was just a matter of getting there.
Mike Flanagan,We'll see where we get with it. He's a terrific pitching coach. His track record has spoken.
Mike Flanagan,We liked the way he guided the Orioles the second half of the year under some very difficult circumstances.
Mike Flanagan,"We're excited to be able to partner with the Naval Academy and play host tithe Army-Navy doubleheader. We think it will be fun for fans of both the Midshipmen and the Black Knights, and it will be especially rewarding for players on both teams to experience playing at Camden Yards."
Mike Flanagan,But I'm not going to dwell on it or feel sorry for myself and build up anxiety. You take it for what it is.
Grandmaster Flash,What has happened is that to some degree they have taken an attitude where they don't listen to demos of diverse subject matters. They're looking for demos like the record the guy on the left just did.
Grandmaster Flash,We gotta stop fighting amongst each other. I think the only rift should be when take it the stage and try to out perform each other.
Grandmaster Flash,"We can even sing off key, but if it's produced properly it can be a hit."
Grandmaster Flash,We can come from our own particular point of view and lay it down. We should not be throwing verbal rocks at each other. We're all responsible to continue the growth of Hip Hop.
Grandmaster Flash,Unfortunately we are arguing amongst each other so much when the bottom line is we don't own anything. We are offspring to a record label owner.
Grandmaster Flash,The type of mixing that was out then was blending from one record to the next or waiting for the record to go off and wait for the jock to put the needle back on.
Grandmaster Flash,"So what the owners see is that we are fighting amongst each other and causing controversy, but as long as it's selling records they don't care."
Grandmaster Flash,"So what I'm trying to say is from a musical aspect for anybody to say that whatever they're doing in Florida is not Hip Hop or whatever they're doing in LA is not Hip Hop, who are these people to say that?"
Grandmaster Flash,"Normal kids in their teens want to go and date girls and do mischievous things, your hormones are jumping around, but I stayed in my bedroom in search of something."
Grandmaster Flash,"I think what's happening here is, there's a group or maybe one person who is saying this is gonna be the definition and this is what we want to get the kids to do now."
Grandmaster Flash,I had to go into a studio and compose and write and press up 12 songs in 14 hours. When you're recording a song from scratch it takes you 14 hours to do just one song.
Grandmaster Flash,I had love for Breakout; I had love for Bambaataa. I had love for Kool Herc.
Grandmaster Flash,Hip Hop has become real constrained. The creative juices and creative flows have been diminished.
Grandmaster Flash,For us to keep claiming this isn't Hip Hop and that isn't Hip Hop doesn't make sense to me.
Grandmaster Flash,"For instance, if you're playing a record with drums - horns would sound nice to enhance it so you get a record with horns and slip it in at certain times."
Grandmaster Flash,"For anybody to say well this is not Hip Hop and that's not Hip Hop, that is not the way the formula was laid down. It was for the people who were going to continue take anything musically and string it along."
Grandmaster Flash,"Exactly, especially when you're talking about a music where you can do just about anything. We can talk about just about anything lyrically."
Grandmaster Flash,Do not let any record company disturb your creative flow. You are not writing for the record company. You're writing for the public.
Grandmaster Flash,Disco was brand new then and there were a few jocks that had monstrous sound systems but they wouldn't dare play this kind of music. They would never play a record where only two minutes of the song was all it was worth. They wouldn't buy those types of records.
Grandmaster Flash,Disco B still rolls with me now. He's still doing his thing. He does clubs in different places. He was very instrumental in helping me perfect my craft.
Grandmaster Flash,As an individual I was known as the DJ or the mixer.
Grandmaster Flash,All you have to know is mathematically how many times to scratch it and when to let it go - when certain things will enhance the record you're listening to.
Grandmaster Flash,A scratch is nothing but the back-cueing that you hear in your ear before you push it out to the crowd.
Grandmaster Flash,If you think about the history of Hip Hop we've had artist who can talk about from socially significant ideas to something as cool as sneakers.
Grandmaster Flash,"But I had two very special people who helped to take my style to the next level. Thank God for my first MC Cowboy and my first student Grand Wizard Theodore, and to go out after creating this art form and finding everyone jamming to it - that too was pretty scary."
Bobby Flay,"Wolfgang Puck because he helped make a career in food possible for somebody like me. He made food that was really good, but also fun and whimsical."
Bobby Flay,There are so many great things about this business. Almost everybody is on the same team. It is all for one-friendly competitiveness. No one is out to hurt anyone.
Bobby Flay,The process and the great smells it produces make everyone hungry and get everyone's mouth watering. And it gives men a chance to cook.
Bobby Flay,"The other person who inspired me was Jonathan Waxman, who used to own Jam's in New York City. He was the first person to show me what good food was."
Bobby Flay,"It is very important that when you put something on the grill, you leave it in place to cook. If you move it around too quickly, chances are it is going to stick."
Bobby Flay,"If my daughter wants to get into this business, I would support that decision. She's going to have a hard time not being in it. She loves food and she's around it all the time."
Bobby Flay,I still love making hamburgers on the grill. I guess whenever I eat them childhood memories come up for me.
Bobby Flay,I love using gas grills because they are easier to heat and it's much easier to control the flames with a gas grill than with a charcoal fire. Grilling is not just about lighting a fire.
Bobby Flay,I love the culture of grilling. It creates an atmosphere that is festive but casual.
Bobby Flay,I guess I fell into cooking.
Bobby Flay,Heat is more even on a gas grill. On a charcoal grill the flame varies so much that it takes a very skilled hand to grill things properly.
Bobby Flay,Grilling takes the formality out of entertaining. Everyone wants to get involved.
Bobby Flay,Grilling outside with my parents at the Jersey shore. We would grill lobster and corn in the summer.
Bobby Flay,Everyone does it with a smile. And cooking is a subject you can never know enough about. There is always something new to discover.
Bobby Flay,"Cook ingredients that you are used to cooking by other techniques, such as fish, chicken, or hamburgers. In other words be comfortable with the ingredients you are using."
Bobby Flay,My partner and I are looking at several locations on Park Avenue South and Midtown for a new restaurant space.
Ari Fleischer,"In other words, [some small businesses] would be taxed at the 39.6 percent rate or the 36 percent rate, and when the president talks about cutting tax rates for all Americans, one of the biggest beneficiaries would be small businesses who are taxed as if they are individuals."
Ari Fleischer,"This statement is appropriate, but words are not enough,"

Ari Fleischer,takes into account the views that we heard from our allies on the Security Council.
Ari Fleischer,"strengthen and save Social Security and Medicare, provide a prescription drug benefit and work in a bipartisan manner to enact much-needed reforms."
Ari Fleischer,"The audio and quality are not good. And as a result, to be thorough, to be accurate, before anything is released to the world, the Defense Department has brought in four translators from outside the government to listen to every word and to make certain there is agreement on what is said on the tape."
Ari Fleischer,"[Specificity can serve a larger purpose as well, indicating what voters might expect from a prospective Bush or Gore administration.] That way, ... if you get elected, you've got a mandate to govern."
Ari Fleischer,The president does believe that the path to peace does go through Chairman Arafat.
Ari Fleischer,"The president told Prime Minister-elect Sharon he looked forward to working with him, especially with regard to advancing peace and stability in the region,"
Ari Fleischer,It's another reminder of how it's so important for peace to be pursued and for terror to be stopped.
Ari Fleischer,wait and see to be certain that [Taylor] does indeed go. That is a vital first step for peace to be maintained.
Ari Fleischer,tax the patience of the most interested voter.
Ari Fleischer,"Yes. As I indicated, the State Department made a phone call to express our opinions."
Ari Fleischer,if the leaders in the region believe that would be a helpful step.
Ari Fleischer,"He told these leaders that he valued their opinion. The president stressed that Saddam Hussein is a threat and that the United States was going to work together with the world to make the world more peaceful, and we welcome their role and their involvement."
Ari Fleischer,"The President has said that he wants the inspectors to be able to do their jobs, to continue their efforts."
Ari Fleischer,"A working-level group ... an interagency group, (is) reviewing a number of ideas, ... gone to the deputies level yet."
Ari Fleischer,"This is an idea that has been shared with the administration, one of many ideas and many ideas are under consideration."
Ari Fleischer,"If there are those who differ with the president on this, the president respects their opinion and respects their ideas and respects their thoughts. He listens. He listens carefully. In the end, the president will make the judgment that he thinks is best needed to protect our country."
Ari Fleischer,because the situation in Iraq involves somebody who has used force in the past to attack and invade his neighbors.
Ari Fleischer,"They are receiving medical care, they are receiving food, they are receiving far better treatment than in the life they were living previously."
Ari Fleischer,"Chavez supporters, on orders, fired on unarmed, peaceful demonstrators, ... Venezuelan military and police refused to fire ... and refused to support the government's role in human rights violations."
Ari Fleischer,"Chavez supporters, on orders, fired on unarmed, peaceful demonstrators. Venezuelan military and police refused to fire ... and refused to support the government's role in human rights violations."
Ari Fleischer,"The president believes the legislation, while far from perfect, will improve our current finance system,"
Ari Fleischer,"The president will stand strong on principle, fighting for his right and the right of all future presidents to receive advice without it being turned into a virtual news release."
Ari Fleischer,I know that Mrs. Pearl has very strong feelings about the damage that can be done as a result of showing that video. The administration has great sympathies for what Mrs. Pearl has said.
Ari Fleischer,"The president has faith in the plan, accepts the plan. The plan is working, and that's the president's approach, ... Undoubtedly, you're going to have others who are going to chime in, but that doesn't change how the president approaches it."
Ari Fleischer,"Unlike some chiefs of staff, he's made few enemies because he's such a nice guy. John Sununu (chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush) couldn't let anyone see the president unless he was in the room. Andy will bring everybody into the room to air their thoughts to the president. He doesn't keep people out for the sake of keeping people out."
Ari Fleischer,"We're very encouraged by the direction of the bankruptcy legislation. However, we continue to work with leaders on the Hill. The president is looking forward to the presentation of the bill that he can sign."
Ari Fleischer,"The SPR is, by design, to be used for severe disruptions of the market. That is a type that has not occurred."
Ari Fleischer,"The SPR is, by design, to be used for severe disruptions of the market. That is a type that has not occurred,"
Ari Fleischer,"If you're an unemployed American, the debt that you want to have reduced is your debt for not being able to work -- the debt that you worry about in terms of paying your electrical bills, your gas bills and your rent and your food, the health care for your family."
Ari Fleischer,The president said he understood he was never in any danger. He kept up what he was in the middle of.
Ari Fleischer,The president was never in any danger.
Ari Fleischer,"The local law enforcement officials will tell you they think the cooperation they've got has been very helpful and that the entire endeavor is operating as best as it can under what's obviously very trying circumstances for all,"
Ari Fleischer,"People will see what a man of integrity (Ashcroft) is, a man of strength, a man of conviction. They have concerns, and will raise them in a partisan manner, but we are very confident he will be in good shape. Sen. Ashcroft is going to receive a fair hearing in the Senate."
Ari Fleischer,very expressive in the conversation.
Ari Fleischer,"So this is a wake-up call to the Congress not to spend tax dollars. Because if they spend and go back on a spending spree, the Congress risks tapping Social Security's money, and Congress should take no step that would put Social Security within reach."
Ari Fleischer,"From the president's point-of-view, it simply remains too important an issue for Congress not to get the job done and complete. The president believes that there are too many in America who are unemployed, and too many people who risk being unemployed if Congress doesn't take action."
Ari Fleischer,The president's focus will be the bottom line: He wants tax cuts. He'll work with Congress on whatever procedure best gets that job done.
Ari Fleischer,We of course do not ask all our nominees to talk about the many acts of compassion they have carried out on behalf of a number of people. There is a whole series of questions about matters that need to be brought to the attention of the president.
Ari Fleischer,"Hopefully, Saddam Hussein will get the message that the world community, through the United Nations, has called on [him] to disarm. And as the president said, he will either disarm or the United States will lead a coalition to disarm him."
Ari Fleischer,The three-year commitment has been kept.
Ari Fleischer,"The Department of Defense will be unable to meet the last two military pay dates in September, breaking our commitment to the men in women in uniform, unless action is taken."
Ari Fleischer,"There are acceptable standards of behavior that the world and certainly the free Iraqi people hope will be followed by its neighbors, including Syria, ... and part of that is not to harbor Iraqi leaders."
Ari Fleischer,"To avoid a military conflict, Saddam Hussein has no other choice than to leave the country."
Ari Fleischer,"Across America every community is looking to pitch in, Hollywood included, and this White House is pleased"
Ari Fleischer,"The working families of America will not be well-served by more fighting in Washington, yet Vice President Gore tonight offers more of the same old language of class warfare, partisanship and division."
Ari Fleischer,"they need to make certain as part of a becoming a state that they take action to have transparency, the rule of law and fight corruption."
Ari Fleischer,"As I indicated yesterday, the Saudis have a long-standing policy, which we have seen carried out in action in addition to rhetoric, about not using oil as a weapon."
Ari Fleischer,"The president is worried about whether or not the Senate will take action to help get the economy out of recession. And the president just cannot imagine that the Senate would leave town without getting the people's business complete,"
Ari Fleischer,"The president calls on the Congress to take action in the Senate today, to take action now so that tax relief can be enacted into law."
Alexander Fleming,One sometimes finds what one is not looking for.
Alexander Fleming,"It is the lone worker who makes the first advance in a subject; the details may be worked out by a team, but the prime idea is due to enterprise, thought, and perception of an individual."
Alexander Fleming,"I have been trying to point out that in our lives chance may have an astonishing influence and, if I may offer advice to the young laboratory worker, it would be this - never to neglect an extraordinary appearance or happening."
Renee Fleming,No voice teacher can be all things to all people. You have to gain information from whatever sources you can. You have to listen.
Renee Fleming,"I want to keep my voice young, with nothing heavy."
Renee Fleming,I listen to archival and historic recordings. I love watching singers. I learned a lot from watching videos.
Renee Fleming,My parents discussed singing every night over the dinner table; I had a tremendous music education.
Renee Fleming,I don't want to be somebody who stands still and sings pretty. Each song is a world. Each song is a story. I don't achieve nearly what I want.
Stephen Fleming,"I am more concerned about how my team is doing rather than worry about the opposition,"
Stephen Fleming,We are very keen to know about ourselves and understanding our own players rather than worry about the opponents. This is a thing which a lot other teams ignore.
Stephen Fleming,"It's been a bit of a struggle over the last month to get across the line, so I am pleased to have converted."
Stephen Fleming,"We may have been a bit too aggressive but once again we have found ourselves in a position of strength. A 140-run lead, and if we put another 60 on, a 200-run lead is very handy and a good position to be."
Stephen Fleming,I don't function 100% because i sleep too much
Stephen Fleming,"It's an inflammation injury that will settle down with a period of rest, we haven't been able to get him enough rest. I don't think it's a career-threatening injury, just annoying."
Stephen Fleming,There's been a dependency on Shane with his strike power and the guys have been following up rather than taking the lead.
Stephen Fleming,"We're pretty happy, it was a good performance."
Stephen Fleming,"We need an improvement in the third Test (against the West Indies), and if we finish playing six Tests still improving, then it's going to be a good series in the Republic."
Stephen Fleming,"We haven't got one eye on South Africa, we've got both eyes firmly on the next Test and if we can keep improving in each area then we'll go to the Republic in good shape."
Stephen Fleming,I did it in the last series against Smith because we saw an emotion that we could tap into ... I won't be doing it to Marcus.
Stephen Fleming,"They've been playing a level of cricket which makes you hard because Australia push you to the limit. South Africa had some good performances in isolation, but they needed a bit more."
Stephen Fleming,I don't think they think too much of our cricket from the comments that have come out. I guess they don't see too much of us on TV. It always seems to be the case with teams that tour here - they don't really rate us... we've got to prove to them we're a pretty good side at home.
Stephen Fleming,We'll try to play on that little lack of confidence at the top of their batting order and Shane will be a threat even on a flat pitch because he's fast and he swings the ball.
Stephen Fleming,"We won't compromise the game. Certainly from my point of view we can't afford to, we're not that good."
Stephen Fleming,"That we have been here for 10 days is an advantage. This is a place which takes getting used to. The day may start mildly, but the afternoon can cause burn in the lungs."
Stephen Fleming,The substitute also means that the team that wins the toss starts the match with a distinct advantage.
Stephen Fleming,"We're now determined to win 5-0, which we would rate very highly as an achievement."
London Fletcher,"After a victory like that it's great, but it's also sad because you think this is the team we could have been all season long and we could have played like this in other games."
London Fletcher,"It's amazing what one victory can do, ... I think we can build on this. But we still have a lot of work to do."
London Fletcher,"It's amazing what one victory can do,"
London Fletcher,"You may dream about turning it around as quickly as we did, but you wouldn't expect it to become reality. But we jelled quickly and got it done. We're a whole new defense compared to last year."
London Fletcher,"You may dream about turning it around as quickly as we did, but you wouldn't expect it to become reality, ... But we jelled quickly and got it done. We're a whole new defense compared to last year."
Robert Fletcher,Jerry is really hitting ball well for us right now. Some of his home runs have to be seen to be believed.
Robert Fletcher,"Playing five games in two days was a little tough, but our players got the job done."
Robert Fletcher,This is a great experience. It's especially a great experience for our players.
Robert Fletcher,"Most Black kids are more interested in playing the game of basketball and that is really unfortunate. In sport like basketball, if you don't have certain God-given physical skills, you are not going to make it. In baseball there is time to develop skills."
Robert Fletcher,"We're playing good baseball, but most importantly are learning about the game of baseball."
Funkmaster Flex,I'm excited to announce the release of the 'Funkmaster Flex Car Show Tour.' This is the first time that great music and cars come together in an outstanding package.
Funkmaster Flex,"He reminds me a lot of myself when I was young, ... Chris has a passion for cars and I think he'll fit right in with my guys at Team Baurtwell."
Funkmaster Flex,Chris has a passion for cars and I think he'll fit right in with my guys at Team Baurtwell.
Andrew Flintoff,"The trouble with that idea was that when I tried bowling off-spin in the nets, I wasn't very good."
Andrew Flintoff,"I don't dislike the bloke, but it's a struggle with him."
Andrew Flintoff,"Obviously last summer (Ashes victory) was huge. With the problems we had before the tour started and the lads who came in, we thought we played some good stuff out here."
Andrew Flintoff,There is pride at stake and throughout this trip I have been getting better.
Andrew Flintoff,There is pride at stake and throughout this trip I have been getting better; bowling is not the sort of thing where you can just click your fingers and it all comes back.
Andrew Flintoff,"The way we played last week, we can take lots of encouragement, but we can't get ahead of ourselves. We can't get clever. If we have the same attitude as last week, we won't go far wrong."
Andrew Flintoff,"It has been an incredible rollercoaster ride of emotions,"
Andrew Flintoff,It has been an incredible rollercoaster ride of emotions.
Andrew Flintoff,"I don't think it is any accident that I have played some of my best cricket under Michael,"
Andrew Flintoff,"It is a fine group of players coming together and in some way probably playing Test cricket might be slightly easier than the one-day game,"
Andrew Flintoff,"I struggled coming into international cricket at first,"
Andrew Flintoff,"It's probably my best day of cricket to date, ... the highest point so far."
Andrew Flintoff,"We've been learning throughout the Test match and understanding a bit more about how people play their cricket, ... Obviously, Steve and I know the best way for each other to perform, but the other lads are a bit of a mix and match."
Andrew Flintoff,"Getting home for three days, getting away from the cricket was great."
Andrew Flintoff,"There are times when I have felt the pressure, but at the moment I play cricket the only way I can."
Andrew Flintoff,It's something I wanted to do ... I'd hoped I would but in different circumstances.
Andrew Flintoff,"It was hard work for our young side, which wants to take on India. With the character the players showed, I can't commend the team enough."
Andrew Flintoff,"The character is fantastic and the lads in the room can be very, very proud."
Andrew Flintoff,"It was hard work. We've got a young side, not a player over 30, and with the character they showed over the Test, I can't commend the team enough."
Andrew Flintoff,"Despite coming up short today, it sounds like the boys have had an amazing week."
Andrew Flintoff,"If we manage to square the series here, which we believe we can do, it would be a fantastic achievement."
Curt Flood,"Whatever I contributed to the unique morale of the Cardinals was part of this growth, and so, of course, was my decision to have it out in public with the owners of organized baseball."
Curt Flood,The baseball establishment is permissive about revelry.
Curt Flood,"Remember when I told you about the American dream? That if you worked hard enough and tried hard enough and kicked yourself in the butt, you'd succeed? Well, I think I did, I think I did."
Curt Flood,"People try to make a Greek tragedy of my life, and they can't do it. I'm too happy."
Curt Flood,It was so difficult for the fans to understand my problems with baseball.
Curt Flood,"If you destroyed the underpinnings of this great American sport, you are a hated, ugly, detestable person."
Curt Flood,I'm a human being I'm not a piece of property. I am not a consignment of goods.
Curt Flood,"I'm a child of the sixties, I'm a man of the sixties. During that period of time this country was coming apart at the seams. We were in Southeast Asia. Good men were dying for America and for the Constitution."
Curt Flood,"I'll also say, yes, I think the change in black consciuosness in recent years has made me more sensitive to injustice in every area of my life."
Curt Flood,"I'd often wondered what would I do if I were ever traded, because it happened many, many times."
Curt Flood,I was told by the general manager that a white player had received a higher raise than me. Because white people required more money to live than black people. That is why I wasn't going to get a raise.
Curt Flood,"I was telling my story to deaf ears, because I was telling my story to a person who would give their first-born child to be doing what I was doing."
Curt Flood,"I was leaving probably one of the greatest organizations in hte world at that time for what was probably one of the least like, and, by God, this is America."
Curt Flood,"I lost money, coaching jobs, a shot at the Hall of Fame."
Curt Flood,"Customary though it may be to write about that institutionalized pastime as though it existed apart from the general environment, my story does not lend itself to such treatment."
Curt Flood,"But when you weigh that against all the things that are really and truly important, things that are deep inside you, then I think I've succeeded."
Curt Flood,"But I want you to know that what I'm doing here I'm doing as a ballplayer, a major league ballplayer."
Curt Flood,"Baseball was socially relevant, and so was my rebellion against it."
Curt Flood,Baseball regards us as sheep.
Curt Flood,And I'd be lying if I told you that as a black man in baseball I hadn't gone through worse times than my teammates.
Curt Flood,"All the grand work was laid for people who came after me. The Supreme Court decided not to give it to me, so they gave it to two white guys. I think that's what they were waiting for."
Richard Florida,"If the foreign talent cannot get into the United States or faces considerable delays in doing so, companies are in effect forced to go overseas to get it."
Richard Florida,"If an employer is serious about attracting and retaining talent, about making Wisconsin the kind of place they can do business over the long haul, they've got to understand that the ability for all people to feel welcome is absolutely critical."
Richard Florida,Minneapolis-St. Paul is competing for a very mobile group of people who have the world for their choices.
Charles Flowers,He's always been determined. It's harder to give up when you work as hard as he has.
Charles Flowers,Coach Pitts takes those guys who were former fullbacks and skill position players and gives them their own identity. We have a history of good defensive linemen here. Kids realize they can get in school somewhere if they give it a try.
Charles Flowers,The impulse to form independent authorities is profoundly undemocratic.
Larry Flowers,"No one knows what the cost of gas or coal is going to be in the future. But once past the capital costs, we can figure what wind-produced electricity will be cost."
Larry Flowers,The wind that blows across the Central Plains can produce more than five times the energy we are using.
Larry Flowers,Wind energy is inexhaustible and infinitely renewable. It's simple but it's true.
Pink Floyd,"How could you treat me this way?Running away.I need you, Babe.Why are you running away?"
Pink Floyd,"There is no pain you are receding A distant ship, smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was a child I had a fever My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've got that feeling once again I can't explain you would not understand This is not how I am. I have become comfortably numb."
Pink Floyd,"And I can feel one of my turns coming on. I feel cold as a razor blade, Tight as a tourniquet, Dry as a funeral drum."
Pink Floyd,There's someone in my head but it's not me.
Pink Floyd,"Money, it's a gas,"
Pink Floyd,Was it love? Or was it the idea of being in love?
Pink Floyd,"Hey you, out there in the coldGetting lonely, getting old Can you feel me?Hey you, standing in the aislesWith itchy feet and fading smiles Can you feel me?Hey you, dont help them to bury the lightDon't give in without a fight."
Pink Floyd,If you should go skating On the thin ice of modern life Dragging behind you the silent reproach Of a million tear-stained eyes Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice Appears under your feet. You slip out of your depth and out of your mind With your fear flowing out behind you As you claw the thin ice.
Pink Floyd,Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun
Pink Floyd,"I will always be here...I will always look out from behind these eyes...It's only a lifetime, It's only a lifetime, It's only a lifetime"

Ray Floyd,"With every passing hour, our solar system comes forty-three thousand miles closer to globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules, and still there are some misfits who continue to insist that there is no such thing as progress."
Ray Floyd,They call it golf because all the other four-letter words were taken
Ray Floyd,They call it golf because all the other four-letter words were taken.
Ray Floyd,"If I play my best, I can win anywhere in the world against anybody."
Ray Floyd,"If you travel first class, you think first class and you are more likely to play first class."
Raymond Floyd,"The weather was as passive as we're going to see it here, ever. The golf course would yield if you played well. Jay Haas played beautifully and had an incredible round."
Raymond Floyd,"So I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I've put myself in position, and that's all I can ask. I hope I can go out there and enjoy it."
Raymond Floyd,"It's going to you know, I can't go out there and shoot par and win. Everybody is playing well, and I think you'll have to go out tomorrow and have 4 , 5 , 6 under par probably."
Raymond Floyd,"I'm used to the golf course playing soft, so tomorrow I'm going to have to pay attention a little bit more."
Raymond Floyd,I guess what was going to come back came back on Monday. Of course now I've played a different golf course. I've played two practice rounds and two tournament rounds all kind of the same and now today I've played a different golf course.
Raymond Floyd,How can you get tired of playing golf?
Doug Flutie,It has gone way beyond our wildest dreams.
Doug Flutie,The day I retire is the day I'll feel old. I'm not there yet.
Doug Flutie,"My arm feels great. I can make all the throws. I've never done anything different, and I still feel like I can play like I always have."
Doug Flutie,"But I'll tell you this: When I lose my athleticism, it's time to go."

Doug Flutie,It's nice to have a situation where you can make it fun.

Errol Flynn,My father was never anti-anything in our house.
Henry Flynt,"Another point I made was that black American music was a new language, and I don't feel this was ever really acknowledged."
Henry Flynt,"The stuff being promoted as serious culture and performed in the Lincoln Centre was absolutely worthless. There was no real emotion in it, the possibility of ingenuous experience had been replaced by an ideology of science and scientism."
Henry Flynt,"Around 1967 I began backing away from dogmatic Leninism, not so much because I thought it was false, I just decided there was nothing utopian about it."
Henry Flynt,"The whole drive of western culture, the part of it which is serious, is towards an extreme objectification. It's carried to the point where the human subject is treated almost as if it's dirt in the works of a watch."
Henry Flynt,"When somebody says that all statements are false, the obvious problem is that as an assertion it's self-defeating."
Henry Flynt,I'm trying to assemble materials for a different mode of life.
Henry Flynt,"In classical oil painting, there seemed to be a radical turn to seeing things as the camera sees them, with that technological modification. I began to have a tremendous problem with all of this."
Henry Flynt,"I began demonstrating against serious culture. In hindsight, the actual course of events has been very humiliating for me, because no one picked up on the intellectual critique I made."
Henry Flynt,I have a picture of an ideal consciousness.
Henry Flynt,"Rock became an incredible commercial success, people just became bored with serious music, and it was forgotten."
Henry Flynt,I began composing works which were imitative of the music I was being told about. I was also very interested in translating the music into visual terms.
Henry Flynt,"I was a student at Harvard, and that's where I learned about so-called avant-garde music. Jackson Pollock, abstract expressionism and painting were well known at this time."
Henry Flynt,"Basically, I viewed any work of art as an imposition of another person's taste, and saw the individual making this imposition as a kind of dictator."
Henry Flynt,"When I began competing with the other artists in New York, I discovered classical North Indian music."
Henry Flynt,I'm actually a great fan of lucidity.
Henry Flynt,"At the same time, I was listening to black music, and I began to think that the best musicians were receiving the worst treatment. The people who were doing the greatest work were despised as lower class, with no dignity accorded to what they did."
Henry Flynt,"When I came to New York, I began to meet the people who became the most famous artists of our time. I was insecure about my own level of ability, I didn't know whether I could compete with these people and, at the same time. I was wondering what is this anyway?"
Dario Fo,It is hard for power to enjoy or incorporate humour and satire in its system of control.
Dario Fo,"It is not just a question of experience, nor is it a question of age ... There are some people who live only 20 years, but many, many people remember them because they knew how to live the time that was given to them. I'm not suggesting that you should live only 20 years. Live as long as you can, but from time to time, think '20 years, 20 years, 20 years', and put them together."
Dario Fo,Know how to live the time that is given you.
Dan Fogelberg,"In our first 14 months of treatment, we have succeeded in slowing the progression of my prostate cancer down to an almost negligible level, ... (My wife) Jean and I are thrilled and incredibly relieved and finally feel like we can at last take a breath."
Dan Fogelberg,"You're successful if you can get one person to pick it up and put it on the turntable and go, Wow, thanks for writing that!"
Dan Fogelberg,"Strats are my favorite electric guitars, and I've got quite a collection."
Dan Fogelberg,Now is the only thing that exists.
Dan Fogelberg,"My upbringing made me think that real legitimate music is written, not heard."
Dan Fogelberg,"My grandfather gave me my first guitar, an old acoustic with palm trees and dancing girls painted on it."
Dan Fogelberg,My dad was vehemently opposed to electric guitars. He did not look on that kind of music as legitimate in any way.
Dan Fogelberg,MTV didn't call. I guess I wasn't hip and groovy enough.
Dan Fogelberg,It was so much fun playing simple American bluegrass. I got to meet Doc Watson.
Dan Fogelberg,It was quite a shot in the head to do the album and then have it shot down by nonmusical idiots.
Dan Fogelberg,It seems like bluegrass people have more great stories to tell than other musicians.
Dan Fogelberg,I wish I was a little more gregarious and outgoing.
Dan Fogelberg,I was blessed with a gift. It's a gift and a curse. It never ends.
Dan Fogelberg,"I wanted to pay tribute to my musical influences: Buffalo Springfield, Lightfoot, the Beatles, the Hollies."
Dan Fogelberg,"I never going to satisfy everybody, so I decided to satisfy myself."
Dan Fogelberg,"I may quit the music business someday, but never the music."
Dan Fogelberg,"I love to rock 'n roll. But my finest suit, of all the things I do, is as a songwriter."

Dan Fogelberg,I love the subtlety and tonal range of the acoustic guitar.
Dan Fogelberg,"I love home. I'll stay up there for days on end, I won't even go down the driveway to look for the mail."
Dan Fogelberg,"I had never done TV. I think it's a foolish medium for, most rock 'n roll music. Nobody ever comes off well on TV."
Dan Fogelberg,I had gone full-on folkie; I'd had it with bands.
Dan Fogelberg,I choose to express myself.
Dan Fogelberg,I always try to give my songs as gifts.
Dan Fogelberg,Coming out of college with a degree in fine arts and painting isn't worth much any more.
Dan Fogelberg,"My life is as an artist, not an entertainer. I don't consider myself an entertainer, but I can do that thing when I want to."
John Fogerty,"I always assumed I would meet him. I never got to touch base from my heart to his heart, and I'm sure that millions of us felt the same way."
John Fogerty,"I'm very happy to be back in touch with a part of myself,"
John Fogerty,"I'm very happy to be back in touch with a part of myself, ... It's surreal. For 35 years, I never thought I'd be reunited with the music I wrote during the Creedence Clearwater Revival years."
John Fogerty,"I'm very happy to be back in touch with a part of myself. It's surreal. For 35 years, I never thought I'd be reunited with the music I wrote during the Creedence Clearwater Revival years. After meeting with Norman Lear, Hal Gaba, and Glen Barros (President of Concord), I'm happy to say that the new Fantasy is very enthusiastic about my body of work. All the people there have been delightful. They are honoring my songs that hold an important place in the history of American music. And, they are honoring me."
John Fogerty,You should play with real musicians; the best music comes from real people interacting with each other.
John Fogerty,"When I made Blue Moon Swamp, there was a lot of trial and error; I was trying to find people who would be simpatico with my style, and with what I had in mind for the album."
John Fogerty,"Washburn's an old American name, but this one was assembled overseas."
John Fogerty,"There's just not a lot of guys around playing like that these days; a lot of steel players are plugging into stomp boxes, trying to sound like Jeff Beck on a steel guitar."
John Fogerty,The Telecaster doesn't really sound that good for the kind of rock and roll that a lot of people played.
John Fogerty,The only sliding I did was on the kind of instrument that you put on your lap; no Spanish electrics.
John Fogerty,"The ones I have got great necks; of course, all of the Fenders from that era are incredible."
John Fogerty,That song has the full extent of my mandolin abilities; I'm not a good mandolin player at all.
John Fogerty,"On Eye of the Zombie, I just got some studio musicians who were competent, but some of them weren't right for what I was trying to do."
John Fogerty,"On Eye of the Zombie, I had so-called studio musicians."
John Fogerty,"Now that I'm older, I like almost anything that's done well, even surf music and instrumentals; I really enjoyed the interviews with the Ventures in your magazine."
John Fogerty,"No, but I've always felt that with true talent, and a commitment to hard work, it is possible to achieve an enduring respect and appreciation. In other words, I don't take my fans for granted."
John Fogerty,"In the last two years or so, I've made a conscious decision to play American guitars; I don't know of a more subtle way to say it."
John Fogerty,"I've studied a lot of great people over the years - Pete Seeger, James Brown - and tried to incorporate elements that I've admired, though I can't say I dance like James."
John Fogerty,I've also become much more the musician I've always wanted to be.
John Fogerty,"I'm now comfortable playing a lot of the old songs, and I've gotten out a lot of the old equipment."
John Fogerty,I'm much more energetic now; you might say live performance is my mission.
John Fogerty,"I'm like a twenty-two-year-old kid in a new band trying to get noticed and break through, because the vast majority of people have never seen me play live."
John Fogerty,"I wrote that song for my wife, and it's what some guy who's sitting under a tree would be singing to the woman of his life, telling her how wonderful she is. To me, that's more lasting than something that sounds like it belongs on a movie soundtrack."
John Fogerty,"I work hard at that, but the fact that there are a lot of good songs means there are also a lot of really bad songs I've written that you never hear."
John Fogerty,"I went pretty much for one tone, and I knew at that time that I wanted to play a Rickenbacker."
John Fogerty,I usually destroy unreleased material. It has a way of coming back to haunt you.
John Fogerty,"I thought what I was good at doing was playing real simple guitar licks, since I'd cut my teeth on what Duane Eddy was doing; licks that were simple but had staying power."
John Fogerty,"I stuck with that size because I could bend the strings so well, and somewhere along the line I must have gotten it into my mind that I had small hands, so I was thinking I'd never be able to play a full-scale guitar, but I also felt like I was cheating or cutting corners."
John Fogerty,"I loved Western Swing and Hank Williams' music, and I now know that it's a 6th tuning that gives you all of those classic licks."
John Fogerty,"I don't know that all the demons have been beaten, but I'm very, very proud of those songs."
John Fogerty,"Even though James Burton was my idol, I didn't think I could carry his shoes back then."
John Fogerty,"Even though I have often recorded alone, I still feel the best music is made by musicians playing off each other."
John Fogerty,"But I think beautiful is simple and elegant, like a ballad with simple harmony."
John Fogerty,And I now think that Stratocasters and Telecasters are way cool.
Ben Folds,"People rush around in the summer to try and find like-minded musicians to put together. Packages are all the rage. I prefer keeping it smaller, having a tour that's manageable -- both for me and the audience -- and Rufus and I go together in certain ways. We're both out of step with any kind of music scene. We don't really fit in anywhere. I think we feel similarly disenfranchised -- in a good way. Also, I can listen to Rufus every night. That's important."
Ben Folds,"Now that I have found someone, I'm feeling more alone... than I ever have before."
Ben Folds,Everybody knows it hurts to grow up... and we're still fighting it.
Ben Folds,"The clock never stops, never stops, never waits. We're growing old. It's getting late."
Ben Folds,"I had to play a George Harrison song at a benefit a couple nights ago, and it was really hard for me. Obviously it wasn't my world."
Ben Folds,"I'm older than I was, and I'm still washed-up, and I haven't changed my music one iota. It's just much easier to do this when people are being nice to you."
Ben Folds,A lot of 18-year-olds are like old men. They think they've seen everything.
Ben Folds,"Next door, there's an old man who lived to his nineties and one day passed away in his sleep. And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days and passed away. I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong."
Ben Folds,Rock and roll is - and should be - a kid's place.
Ben Folds,"White people don't sing together very often, and when they do, it's about the celebrity of the song. The singing at my shows is all about harmony."
Ben Folds,"I used to do this big rant at the end of some gigs with Ben Folds Five. The band broke into this big heavy metal thing and I started as a joke to scream in a heavy metal falsetto. I found myself saying things like: Feel my pain, I am white, feel my pain."
Ben Folds,You never know when you put out an album that's unique whether it'll get beat up for it or not.
Ben Folds,"It's a tough thing to know that when you're making your album, you're going to end up collaborating with, say, Wal-Mart, on your artwork. That just sucks. And the pressure behind getting the numbers real fast is, to me, dizzying."
James Foley,"[Castro has demanded the boy's return by Tuesday night, but the U.S. State Department has flatly refused.] We do not accept the ultimatum issued by Fidel Castro, ... This is not conducive to resolving this case in the appropriate humanitarian way."
James Foley,"In many ways, the flight of refugees from Kosovo is increasingly a flight from hunger."

James Foley,"They have the rights of refugees for a year. Our first priority is ... the refugees who have family members in the United States who want to take them in. Second, there may be Kosovar Albanian-Americans willing to take them in even if they're not family members."
James Foley,"As Cambodia moves to fully regain its place in the community of nations, we hope it will insist on accountability for the crimes of the 1975-1979 period."

James Foley,"Given the state of insecurity in this country, the attempts to create chaos, we had to do our best to protect the people from the forces of insecurity and criminality,"
James Foley,We are urging them to exercise maximum restraint and to take swift action to calm the situation.
Jeremy Foley,"That way when it's time to hit the ground once the season is over, you're already off and running. The timing is never ideal in a coaching change. I talked to former coaches, NFL GMs, television folks. I picked people's brains and checked out the Internet to find out as much as I could. Indiana has time to do that. I didn't talk to any school or coaches but did hire a consultant to gauge the interest for us."
Jeremy Foley,"The passion is what makes him special. I tell our [athletic] staff members all the time, you need to have passion. That's what separates great people from average people."
Jeremy Foley,Nothing wrong with showing your emotions.
Jeremy Foley,We appreciate the support of the Jacksonville community to keep this traditional rivalry in Jacksonville through 2010. The week-long festivities in the community and the pageantry surrounding the game are unmatched in college football.
Jeremy Foley,We've got to talk about it. It seems to be the league has made a commitment to it and everyone has to make the same commitment.
Jeremy Foley,"I learned a long time ago, when it comes to discipline you don't get 100 percent acceptance of what you do."
John Foley,"real movement toward better funding and toward smaller service, smaller supports and more employment, more real employment, rather than meaningless day activities."
John Foley,"We have high quality merchandise, anything from high end diamonds to quality clothing. We carry the best of the best and I think that's what makes us pretty unique."
John Foley,"A bookstore to me is ike a candy store, ... There is not a book I would not want to read at some point. My son is learning to read right now. Watching him get excited how he can discover things through books is pretty phenomenal."
Michael Foley,"Moody's affiliation with NCRA is an additional step in extending our credit rating, research and analysis services in Europe."
Michael Foley,"It was not a power issue but one of positioning. Steve just needed to get in the right positions to showcase what he has to offer. Believe me, he is an asset to any team."
Michael Foley,"It's a great recognition to be asked to come back and do something like this. I hope to give it a little greener flavor than it might have without me, right?"
Michael Foley,We've got the worst teeth in the nation and we're paying a fortune for it. We spend far more than other states on Government dental services.
Michael Foley,I've worked with John as a player and recently as a coach and we complement each other well.
Michael Foley,"They would love to get their children back. They miss them tremendously and they love their children. What happened was an unfortunate situation and one that got worse over time, but they never intended to harm their children. They realize now that their actions were not in the children's best interest, regardless of what they thought at the time."
Michael Foley,He wants an update on how the children are.
Michael Foley,"They don't brush and they have too much sugar. At that age (4, 5 and 6) diet is probably more important than brushing,"
Phil Fontaine,"We have conquered our own cynicism,"
Phil Fontaine,"It highlighted the extreme circumstances that many of our communities live in - poor drinking water, poor health care, poor housing, poor schools, no recreational facilities, high unemployment."
Phil Fontaine,"It is an agreement for the ages,"
Phil Fontaine,Our position is that it must be implemented as is. It's a very complex agreement. A lot of detail. Very delicate proposition and any tinkering with the proposed compensation package would cause it to unravel. And that's a view held very clearly by our experts who were involved in the negotiations.
Dr. Fontana,Diet and exercise are key factors in preventing chronic diseases and delaying aging.
Dr. Fontana,This paper is important because it is the first study in humans that strongly suggests that calorie restriction may delay primary aging.
Dr. Fontana,"These studies strongly support the need to educate people to make sensible choices when they eat and that they need to exercise and walk more, instead of going by car everywhere."
Dr. Fontana,"If you put animals on a 30- or 40-percent calorie-restricted diet, they live 30 to 40 percent longer, and they have much less chronic disease."
Michael Foot,Men of power have no time to read; yet the men who do not read are unfit for power
Michael Foot,He was the only man I knew who could make a curse sound like a caress.
Michael Foot,"A speech from Ernest Bevin on a major occasion had all the horrific fascination of a public execution. If the mind was left immune, eyes and ears and emotions were riveted."
Shelby Foote,"When you grow up in a totally segregated society, where everybody around you believes that segregation is proper, you have a hard time. You can't believe how much it's a part of your thinking."
Shelby Foote,"My second book, Follow Me Down had some success, got good critical notices, went into a second printing and things like that, but Shiloh was by far the most successful of those first five novels."

Shelby Foote,I've never shown anybody a draft of anything.
Shelby Foote,"I'm crazy about Grant: his character, his nature, his science in fighting and everything else. But I don't like the idea that he never accepted the blame for anything, always found someone else to blame for any mistake that was ever made, including blaming Prentiss for Shiloh."
Shelby Foote,"I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose."
Shelby Foote,"I took five years on the first volume, five years on the second volume, and ten years on the third volume."
Shelby Foote,"I think that everything you do helps you to write if you're a writer. Adversity and success both contribute largely to making you what you are. If you don't experience either one of those, you're being deprived of something."
Shelby Foote,"I think making mistakes and discovering them for yourself is of great value, but to have someone else to point out your mistakes is a shortcut of the process."
Shelby Foote,"I ran into Ku Klux Klan and the threat of hurricanes, and those two things made me decide not to build on the Alabama coast, so we came back to Memphis."
Shelby Foote,"I prize the Depression, for instance, because I learned the value of things in the Depression that a way people who don't have to worry about such things never learned to prize it really, I believe."
Shelby Foote,I never cared what kind of grade I got.
Shelby Foote,"I don't want anything to do with anything mechanical between me and the paper, including a typewriter, and I don't even want a fountain pen between me and the paper."
Shelby Foote,"I began the way nearly everybody I ever heard of - I began writing poetry. And I find that to be quite usual with writers, their trying their hand at poetry."
Shelby Foote,"Getting close to books, and spending time by myself, I was obliged to think about things I would never have thought about if I was busy romping around with a brother and sister."
Shelby Foote,"During that year while we were waiting to be inducted into federal service, I wrote the first draft of my first novel, Tournament."
Shelby Foote,"But the same thing was true in the army. You slept in a barracks with all kinds of people of every nationality, every trade, every character and quality you can imagine, and that was a good experience."
Shelby Foote,And I really do think that the difficulty of research makes it more real to you than punching a thing to find out how many men were killed at this particular action.
Shelby Foote,"Most of my inspiration, if that's the word, came from books themselves."
Shelby Foote,"Of all the passions of mankind, the love of novelty most rules the mind. In search of this, from realm to realm we roam. Our fleets come loaded with every folly home."
Shelby Foote,"Shiloh is a wonderfully dramatic battle. The leader of one side is killed, and the other one is going on to glory, and it was the first great battle. It lasted two days."
Steve Forbes,"The current system is beyond redemption. It was amended in 1986 to 6 million words. It has been amended 14,000 times since then and is now 9 million words. There is no special interest or lobbyist left behind."
Steve Forbes,"As the American people are learning and will learn, he is a good man. He has been tested -- I tried to test him -- and he emerged the stronger for it."

Steve Forbes,"I couldn't be happier and more excited, ... It demonstrates that ideas matter."
Steve Forbes,"My campaign, then and today, is a campaign about issues and ideas, never gone in for personalities. It is principles and policies, and that's what I am doing and will continue to do. That's what the people of America want,"

Steve Forbes,"Our failure to properly deal with Germany and Japan early cost the world dearly later on, ... We dare not make the same mistake with China."

Steve Forbes,"By not bringing the American people along, everyone thought it was just an unmitigated bloody disaster."
Steve Forbes,"Personalities, no, principles and policies, yes. We must have a fulsome debate."
Steve Forbes,"That quote was written 20 some-odd years ago, when the system was in crisis,"
Steve Forbes,"He knew Russia well. It was a country he loved deeply,"
Steve Forbes,"My wife, Sabina and I, along with the rest of the nation, pray for the families of the children who died yesterday. Their loss and misery is unfathomable, ... My five daughters mean the world to me. Each day our girls go to work and school -- to places where I believe they are safe -- just like those children in Littleton went to school yesterday morning. The children who witnessed this rampage are also in our prayers."
Steve Forbes,"The ground is shifting in our favor, you see it on partial birth (and) parental consent. You enact these into law and use that as the foundation for the next step."
Steve Forbes,"We've seen in this century the bloody consequences of not realizing there's a higher authority, that there is God, and that life emanates from God and God only."
Steve Forbes,"There is something fundamentally unfair about a government that takes away so much of people's money, power, and personal control while telling them that life will be better as a result."
Steve Forbes,The rise of China as a new power is another great challenge for the US. Our failure to properly handle Germany and Japan earlier in the 20th century cost us and the world dearly. We must not make this same mistake with China.
Steve Forbes,We must guard against the overreaching hand of big government trying to take away our freedom. And we must always protect the environment in a manner consistent with our values.

Steve Forbes,A promise made should be a promise kept.
Steve Forbes,"If a man breaks a pledge, the public ought to know it."
Steve Forbes,"The phenomenon of home schooling is a wonderful example of the American can-do attitude. Growing numbers of parents have become disenchanted with government-run public schools. Many parents have simply taken matters into their own hands, literally."
Steve Forbes,"As our federal government has grown too large and too powerful, the real loss has been the freedom of people to govern their own lives and participate fully in the American dream."
Steve Forbes,No more turning a blind eye to Chinese spies in our nuclear labs. No more keeping silent about Chinese slave labor camps.
Steve Forbes,You don't change minds in Washington with sweet reason. You do it to the white light of public opinion.

Steve Forbes,"The Chinese government is quickly losing its ideological legitimacy, maintain its rule with force, but cannot draw strength from the ideology of Marx and Mao."

Steve Forbes,"Let me be blunt: No mother in the United States of America should be forced to send her child to a lousy school,"
Steve Forbes,What are you going to raise the retirement age to? ... It's already been raised to 67. This consideration is a form of betrayal. 'Consideration' is code for 'we're going to do it.'
Steve Forbes,"This is going to be a new, information-age campaign about great ideas and enduring values,"
Steve Forbes,"Anyone who can guide young women through the treacherous, dangerous teen-age and adolescent years is ready for the adolescent politicians in Washington,"

Steve Forbes,"You and I are entering the information age, and Washington politicians are stuck in the Stone Age."
John Force,"I'm excited, as any father would be. I always believed she could do it, but as a parent you worry."
John Force,"We've had some trouble this year, but there's nothing wrong with me and nothing wrong with this team that a win wouldn't fix,"
John Force,"It's kinda exciting, ... after you get over the gut ache you have every morning. But everybody's running out of races now. You can't make a mistake because two or three guys might pass you."
John Force,"The car is running good. When you run good, you're always happy. We'll just go from here and see if we can win this race. We have a shot at winning. So do 15 other guys."
John Force,"I don't know if anyone has noticed, but there are a lot of good race cars out here, ... This is the best field (of Funny Cars) I've ever seen and that goes back to the days of 'Snake' and 'Mongoose,' Bernstein and the 'Blue Max' (references to Don Prudhomme, Tom McEwen, Kenny Bernstein and the car driven by three-time champion Raymond Beadle). I raced against all of them and I got spanked regular. But, bottom line, it's tougher now. There are no easy rounds."
John Force,"You win with heart,"
John Force,"They're on their game,"
John Force,"It's all kind of mental. When you win, you have that confidence. If you can win the Skoal Showdown, then you feel positive on race day because you've been there, you've done that, and you know that your car is running the numbers and your driver's doing the job. But also for this championship, it was tough to get there. There are guys that aren't in this show that should have been there. When other cars just come from behind. The bottom line, anytime that you go in there, you know you did your job, but there's two other kids that are not in it that could've been (Whit Bazemore and Capps), and we're all trying to get in. Those kids could still be shooting toward that championship. You don't get too cocky just because you're in the Showdown or if you win it. You've got to go to sleep at night and get ready for the next morning."
John Force,"Nothing gets old. It's always exciting, especially with the competition that we've put together this year. The guys that have made this Showdown, it was tough to make it. Robert Hight coming from behind made our program look real good, but I'm really looking forward to Indy, and I really want to thank Skoal for putting up the money to make this possible."
John Force,"The only thing that could ruin it, ... is if one of these cars doesn't win the championship."
Betty Ford,"Not my power, but the power of the position, a power which could be used to help."
Betty Ford,"My makeup wasn't smeared, I wasn't disheveled, I behaved politely, and I never finished off a bottle, so how could I be alcoholic?"
Betty Ford,"It's my feeling that God lends you your children until they're about eighteen years old. If you haven't made your points with them by then, it's too late."
Betty Ford,"It's always been my feeling that God lends you your children until they're about eighteen years old. If you haven't made your points with them by then, it's too late."

Bill Ford,"When we're in a peak, we make a ton of money, and as soon as we make a ton of money, we're desperately looking for a way to spend it. And we diversify into areas that, frankly, we don't know how to run very well."
Bill Ford,We took our eye off the ball as a company.
Bill Ford,"One of the things I've had the advantage of, growing up and being close to the top management of this company and other companies for most of my life, is seeing how CEOs start to believe in their own infallibility. And that really scares me."
Bill Ford,"Nobody's irreplaceable, including me. I think for too long we've had a cult of personality in this company and in this industry, and frankly, I'd like to see that diminish."

Bill Ford,"I don't ever want to believe my own press clippings, good or bad."
Bill Ford,We have said we intend to restore automotive profitability in North America by no later than 2008 and we remain committed to deliver on our promise.
Bill Ford,"The automotive market in North America is rapidly becoming as crowded and fragmented as other global markets. To meet this challenge, we are acting with speed to strengthen the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands, deliver the innovation customers demand and create a business structure for us to compete, and win, in this era of global competition."
Bill Ford,"While we are not satisfied with our performance, particularly a loss in North America automotive, we are encouraged by the success in our global operations and at the Ford Motor Credit Company. We have said we intend to restore automotive profitability in North America by no later than 2008 and we remain committed to deliver on our promise."
Bill Ford,"Steve's ability to drive results throughout an organization will be missed. His knowledge of our business undoubtedly will serve him well as our newest Ford dealer. This new endeavor, which he has chosen to pursue, demonstrates his confidence in the Company and its future."
Harrison Ford,"Luck certainly has a lot to do with any kind of success. But on the other hand, this is a business in which relationships are very important.

Henry Ford,"If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability."
Henry Ford,You take all of the experience and judgment of men over 50 out of the world and there wouldn't be enough left to run it.
Henry Ford,Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.
Henry Ford,"Many people think that by hoarding money they are gaining safety for themselves. if money is your ONLY hope for independence, you will never have it.

Henry Ford,"Competition is the keen cutting edge of business, always shaving away at costs."
Henry Ford,It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages.
Henry Ford,"I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesn't need any advice from me. With God in charge, I believe everything will work out for the best in the end. So what is there to worry about."
Henry Ford,It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.
Henry Ford,Capital punishment is as fundamentally wrong as a cure for crime as charity is wrong as a cure for poverty.
Henry Ford,"Enthusiasm is the yeast that makes your hopes shine to the stars. Enthusiasm is the sparkle in your eyes, the swing in your gait. The grip of your hand, the irresistible surge of will and energy to execute your ideas."
Henry Ford,"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."

Henry Ford,"Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're right!"
Henry Ford,"Women do not win formula one races, because they simply are not strong enough to resist the G-forces. In the boardroom, it is different. I believe women are better able to marshal their thoughts than men and because they are less egotistical they make fewer assumptions."

Jim Ford,"I've set goals, including for fundraising, but also to support with our spirit, being the 12th member of the team."
Jim Ford,"There are a lot of factors for injuries. The evolution of the size and speed of players, the amount of training, the types of field can all be factors. The No. 1 think we're looking for is whether there are any red flags?"
Jim Ford,I'd be hopeful we can score in three or four events at the state level and do better in our dual meets.
Lew Ford,"We were having trouble getting things started all night. It was just a little ground ball that I was able to hit in the right place to get on. Then a passed ball and Ruben Sierra deserves a lot of credit. After sitting on the bench, he rips that ball out there into left field. He did his job."
Lew Ford,They really wanted to take me out as you don't want to hurt it any worse than what it is.
Lew Ford,"That was a lot of fun, but also a really good workout. It's definitely hard on the legs."
Lew Ford,No. That's not fun that way. That can raise your blood pressure doing that all the time. We have a type of team able to do that. We're not going to give up and quit. We keep coming at them. We were able to put something together.
Lew Ford,"That's not fun that way. That can raise your blood pressure doing that all the time, but we have the type of team that's able to do that."
Linda Ford,Kelly is our defensive player and our offensive player. It was key because we switched her in the last 10 minutes.
Linda Ford,"In the space of a year, we have significantly increased our efforts to make a real impact on the national problem of medical student debt, ... This is a priority for us and we plan to continue to be very proactive in trying to help."

Rick Ford,"The overriding consideration on everyone's mind was to get the Certificate of Occupancy.

Rick Ford,"The stations have two buttons. One is for information where you can ask for directions and the other is emergency. They are designed not only to protect the infrastructure from a security point of view, but many of the call boxes focus the nearest cameras on the area during an emergency."

Tom Ford,It's really (about) putting that sort of quality and beauty back into our life.
Tom Ford,"She's tough, she's confident. It's funny, our beauty standard has become harder and tougher because we live in a tough age. I don't think anyone wants to walk down the street and feel vulnerable. You want to walk down the street and feel like you're in control."
Tom Ford,Once upon a time we did not focus on a president's private life.

Travis Ford,The first thing he said was no question you can do the job. But would you like living there?
Travis Ford,These are some pretty nasty cases. It's unusual to see this many complaints against one person.
Travis Ford,"You never forget games like that. When you lose like that, you always remember it. We know they're going to be ready for us. Temple's a great basketball team, and they're coming off of two huge wins, so we know they're going to be prepared."
Travis Ford,"Twenty-nine turnovers didn't help us at all. Shooting 1-for-9 in 3-pointers in the first half didn't help us. But, man, they're a scrappy basketball team. They play in those spurts and that's what makes them good. They can afford not to play well in 2- or 3-minute spans. We can't. We're not good enough of a basketball team to do that."
Travis Ford,"We've been able to win at home, and that's been a key for us. Now we go on a tough three-game road stretch that will really test our basketball team. We still have a long way to go. There's really small room for error on this basketball team."
Whitey Ford,"When Mel came up in 1964 in the middle of the season, I was his pitching coach, but I was also pitching every fourth day besides. Yogi Berra was our manager. That's why it was all screwed up."

Whitey Ford,"I never threw the spitter, well maybe once or twice when I really needed to get a guy out real bad."
Whitey Ford,There's no easier pitch to hit than a splitter that doesn't do anything.
Whitey Ford,You kind of took it for granted around the Yankees that there was always going to be baseball in October.
Whitey Ford,The way to make coaches think you're in shape in the spring is to get a tan.
Whitey Ford,I know Koufax' weakness. He can't hit.
Whitey Ford,"You would be amazed how many important outs you can get by working the count down to where the hitter is sure you're going to throw to his weakness, and then throw to his power instead."
Whitey Ford,"Army life was rough. Would you believe it, they actually wanted me to pitch three times a week."
Willa Ford,You know a lot of times you'll find girls in a club are jaded to the other girls in the club. There's a nasty vibe between the chicks in the club. It's like a pretty girl can't look at another pretty girl and say Wow she's pretty.
Willa Ford,I do house things. I paint. I do portraits. I also paint my house.
Willa Ford,"I believe honesty comes across in music because for people that music isn't just something to dance to. For people for whom music is something that they feel, they understand what I'm talking about."
Willa Ford,My major influence was my ten years older sister.
Willa Ford,They're hit writers. They're gonna write me a hit whether I wanted it or not you know? I could have put out a single a year ago with the Neptunes and maybe been writing now on top but that was not the path that I chose.
Willa Ford,There's a million new people in the studio every day creating new stuff so I really had to be on my toes with this one so I could get it out before somebody else could.
Willa Ford,The thing that I like about being me is that everybody gets a different feeling from me.
Willa Ford,I tried not to make a format because you know they never really have a format for their songs. It's very loose. I tried not to have a format.
Willa Ford,I mean there are tons of reasons. Well first of all. I write my own record. I don't take other people's materials. And I have a job which is being Willa Ford on top of getting back in the studio and writing and recording.
Willa Ford,"I mean a song that's specifically for the girls. It's saying you know we talk about them night and day, we're constantly pondering on men and what they've done good and what they've done bad and all these things in our lives."
Willa Ford,I like the idea that people have formed their own opinions. And of course once people meet me or talk to me their opinion totally changes because I'm much more that girl that you hang out with than you think.
Willa Ford,"I believe we have all this image stuff and blah, blah, blah but at the end of the day it all boils down to music don't you think?"
Willa Ford,I'm not a cheerleader. I'm not trying to pretend to be sweet and then come out and be bad. This is who I am.
William Ford,It appears that same-store retail sales have continued to do reasonably well.
William Ford,"Despite this mini-surge in spending, the modest gain in same-store sales did not meet early projections."
William Ford,"A welcomed relief from severe mid-December weather precipitated sales surges in the Midwest and Northeast. However, other parts of the country experienced just the opposite trend because of the ice storm which paralyzed parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas."
William Ford,"This is not a sacrifice we will ask only the UAW and its members to share. There will be sacrifices throughout the company, top to bottom."
William Ford,"With both Christmas and Hanukkah coming late in the week, and considering that two of last year's top four shopping days fell immediately before Christmas, it is still possible that we will see a boost in spending."
William Ford,"A long pre-Christmas shopping weekend helped buoy December retail sales by 2.1 percent, just edging out November's 1.9 percent gain. As a result, the year ended on a positive note, albeit modest; and consumer confidence is on the rise again - a good sign moving into the New Year."
George Foreman,"Wit's an unruly engine, wildly striking/ Sometimes a friend, sometimes the engineer."
George Foreman,"The Congress will push me to raise taxes and I'll say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again. And I'll say to them, read my lips, no new taxes."

George Foreman,"It's funny. I remember calling Ali and telling him, 'If we have this fight, you and I will get $5 million,' and he said, 'Are you in? Then I'll promote it.' Then the fight was on. What could I do?"
George Foreman,"health, fitness, quality, and of course, comfort."
George Foreman,"He lent a lot more (to the Houston sports scene) than you could imagine, ... because he was always so 'class' to all of us. Although he used to be with Muhammad Ali, the last fight I had in Japan, I took him along. So we got a chance to re-bond."
George Foreman,"They'll take everything, even your tears."
George Foreman,"Put your name on something, it better be the best... you only get one shot."

George Foreman,Sure the fight was fixed. I fixed it with a right hand.
George Foreman,Everybody wants to be somebody. The thing you have to do is give them confidence they can. You have to give a kid a dream.
George Foreman,"I want to keep fighting because it is the only thing that keeps me out of the hamburger joints. If I don't fight, I'll eat this planet."
George Foreman,A hero is someone right who doesn't change.
George Foreman,"That's my gift. I let that negativity roll off me like water off a duck's back. If it's not positive, I didn't hear it. If you can overcome that, fights are easy."
George Foreman,George Foreman. A miracle. A mystery to myself. Who am I? The mirror says back. The George you was always meant to be. Wasn't always like that. Used to look in the mirror and cried a river.
George Foreman,"When I was a kid in Houston, we were so poor we couldn't afford the last 2 letters, so we called ourselves po'."
George Foreman,"The question isn't at what age I want to retire, it's at what income."
George Foreman,That was my greatest achievement because I was just a 19-year-old boy who thought dreams could never come true.
George Foreman,My kids idea of a hard life is to live in a house with only one phone.
Jay Foreman,"We've got time, but if we continue to make the same mistakes night in and night out, we will not be prepared as a team come playoff time. We want to be playing well now and clicking now. We have to get out of this immediately."
Jay Foreman,Technology is getting better and is more affordable for families. It's a great location in an area where our consumers will benefit. We're very excited.
Jay Foreman,"There are less buyers today, less sellers and therefore less reasons to pay big money for expensive showrooms and trade shows, ... That's why the building's occupancy has been at about 60 percent over the past few years versus a 100 percent earlier."
Jay Foreman,"We estimate that we can make as many as 17 to 18 million unique Cabbage Patch Kids before we run out of options,"
Paul Formica,"The end of the season is very tough. The biggest thing is we had a real disappointing game against Baker, so you want to bounce back after a loss."
Paul Formica,It was a huge win for us. We had a really rough week. We played without a couple of players tonight.
Paul Formica,"It's been a lot of fun working with the Navy, we're [my wife and I] happy to have them here and support the Sailors since they're out there supporting us. I think it's good for the Sailors to be in a commercial restaurant environment so they can see how different culinary communities operate."
James Forni,"Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe. If you believe, clap your hands!"
James Forni,"It was nice that we could get everybody in the game, and it was a good way for our seniors to play their last (regular-season) game at home."
James Forni,"Our defense saved us. After the first quarter, we weren't scoring, but we weren't allowing them to score either."
Nathan Forrest,"Comrades, through the years of bloodshed and many marches you were tried and true soldiers. So through years of peace you have been good citizens, and now that we are again united under the old flag, I love it as I did in the days of my youth, and I feel sure that you love it also."
Nathan Forrest,Get there first with the most.
Nathan Forrest,Never stand and take a charge... charge them too.
Nathan Forrest,I've got no respect for any young man who won't join the colors.

Ian Forrester,We auction anything you can think of.
Ian Forrester,The absence of access is seriously prejudicing Microsoft's right of defense.
Ian Forrester,The absence of access is seriously prejudicing Microsoft's right of defense. The position taken by the commission is particularly troubling because it contradicts the commission's stated commitment to increased transparency and due process in antitrust investigations.
Gary Forsee,This is a major milestone for our companies and our industries. We are going to combine the best of our companies' capabilities to give our customers what they expect and what they've been demanding.

Gary Forsee,"Sprint Nextel shares with Nextel Partners a commitment of excellence to our customers, employees and shareholders.

Steve Fortuna,"Also, and very importantly, we think there is a high likelihood that management significantly lowers its earnings per share outlook during its analyst meeting this week, well below the current $1.28 Street consensus."
Dick Fosbury,I adapted an antiquated style and modernized it to something that was efficient. I didn't know anyone else in the world would be able to use it and I never imagined it would revolutionize the event.
Dick Fosbury,I didn't train to make the Olympic team until 1968. I simply trained for the moment. I never even imagined I would be an Olympic athlete. It always seemed to evolve.
Dick Fosbury,"When you reach that elite level, 90 percent is mental and 10 percent is physical. You are competing against yourself. Not against the other athlete."

Steve Fossett,"If I have engine trouble, there will be no trouble with gliding,"
Steve Fossett,There is a risk in the takeoff. There is a risk during the flight of running out of fuel or other mechanical failure in an experimental aircraft.
Steve Fossett,"Good, apparently there are no problems."
Steve Fossett,"So far there have been few problems. A broken winch was readily repaired by the crew, as was a batten problem in the mainsail. Sailing winds have been excellent and at one point we were flying a hull."
Steve Fossett,"So far there have been few problems. A broken winch was readily repaired by the crew, as was a batten problem in the mainsail. Sailing winds have been excellent and at one point we were flying a hull,"
Steve Fossett,"They see that as part of their future. We're a discovery project for them, to discover new uses for the shuttle landing facility. As far as Kennedy is concerned, it's a great runway, a runway in perfect condition, equal to the longest available in the United States."
Steve Fossett,"Frankly, I do them for the satisfaction of those achievements. I have a feeling of contentment and a satisfaction that I've done something faster or farther than anyone before."
Steve Fossett,I do this as a matter of personal satisfaction. To achieve something that is difficult and that stretches my ability to do it.
Bud Foster,"He's a guy that really took a step forward as far as what our safety position demands. I just see him playing at another speed, taking his game to another level."
Bud Foster,"Jimmy has grown up tremendously, probably as much as any young man I've ever been around. Four years ago we didn't see eye-to-eye very often, but he's matured as a person and as a player. He came back for all the right reasons."
Bud Foster,"It's been a great relationship, and the consistency helps out. He's a mentor, father figure, a friend and extremely loyal guy. He's loyal to his coaches, and in turn we work hard and are loyal to him also."
Bud Foster,"At this time in their careers, compared to those other guys, they're more talented. Hopefully that athletic ability, the speed, will make up for some of that lack of experience."
George Foster,It wasn't the talent out there. They protected Peyton all year. It was just Pittsburgh had a good scheme.
George Foster,It just shows what type of guy he is. He didn't go into the tank. Every running back naturally wants to get the ball all the time. But those guys are real good about the way the carries are distributed. And I think they understand it's team first.
George Foster,"Here we'd like to think they can start to think about the ideas we're teaching, but their main job is to perform on the field."
George Foster,"It doesn't hurt to have good players. If you run a 3-4 with (lousy) players, it's not going to work. Most teams that run it have good players."
George Foster,"It takes a lot of communication and talking amongst the different positions, but if you can communicate, you'll be OK."
George Foster,"They're using his athletic ability where they see him fit to be most productive. He's still going to be the same Jason Taylor, the All- Pro pass rusher he's been over the years. So you can't overlook that. We have to just go out and play our game and take care of it the best way possible. He's going to line up where he's going to line up."
George Foster,"He has the athletic ability, so why not?"
Ian Foster,There were some quality things in the game but we just didn't do any of it for long enough.
Ian Foster,"They fed off our mistakes in the first half, and all credit to them for the way they dug it out in the second half."
Ian Foster,This week there are a couple of changes to our tight five. The overall desire is to make sure we have heaps of energy in that area and to show a bit more enthusiasm this week.
Jim Foster,"I have the very same feeling. Once they have their components back, they have the talent to be a very good team. But when you lose a player like Banks, it has a profound effect on everybody starting."
Jim Foster,"It's been an answer to a prayer. It's the sunshine house. It's beautiful outside, but even more beautiful inside because of the people."
Jim Foster,"I'm bitterly opposed to mountaintop removal, because it takes jobs away from coal miners."
Jim Foster,There?s marked difference in them. But that?s what experiences are about and accomplishing some tangible goals. I think it all falls into place as that kind of stuff happens. Play it. Think it. They do both.
Jim Foster,"They packed it in and took away the inside game, and we had to make outside shots."
Jim Foster,"It speaks to her consistency and her growth as a player. Every time you go through a league, people do what they can to make it more difficult the next time you go through. Jess spent the summer adding some dimensions to her game that made that a little harder."
Jim Foster,"Over the past several months at the board meetings, we're getting an increasing number of citizen complaints. Some were valid, some were not."
Jim Foster,She's always been an advocate for giving parents more choices within the public school system.
Jim Foster,Absent this action it would be possible for a teacher who resigned in one school district or who was where fired in one school district to go the district next door and get a job there because they still have their certificate to teach.
Mark Foster,"The course is tough because if you miss a fairway or a green, you are in trouble and we have done a lot of work on that over the past two days trying to save shots and it worked. This is my first outing of the year so you are never really sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised."
Mark Foster,"The last five weeks have been a worry and the card has played on my mind off the course, and my big effort in Madrid last week to make sure of the card has left me very tired,"
Mark Foster,"You could see double-digit market growth in '06. My guess is there's some bumps along the way, but I'm more optimistic about '06 than I was about '05."
Mark Foster,"The sales numbers looked pretty good. Cost control continues to be a key component in their performance, so they've done a good job there."
Mark Foster,"We have no complaints with bottom-line earnings growth in what we've seen so far. The economy is going to hold together, earnings growth is going to hold together, the Fed's going to stop raising rates and that will give the market an opportunity to move forward."
Mark Foster,"For them, that's an achievement. To the extent that they still can generate some traffic and higher price points, they are generating better sales figures. They seem to be doing better in terms of their merchandising efforts and the basics of just running the business."
Michel Foucault,"Psychoanalysis can unravel some of the forms of madness; it remains a stranger to the sovereign enterprise of unreason. It can neither limit nor transcribe, nor most certainly explain, what is essential in this enterprise."
Michel Foucault,"Chance does not speak essentially through words nor can it be seen in their convolution. It is the eruption of language, its sudden appearance. It's not a night twinkle with stars, an illuminated sleep, nor a drowsy vigil. It is the very edge of consciousness."
Michel Foucault,"The judges of normality are present everywhere. We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the ''social worker'' -judge."
Michel Foucault,"Justice must always question itself, just as society can exist only by means of the work it does on itself and on its institutions."
Michel Foucault,"As the archeology of our thought easily shows, man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end."
Michel Foucault,"Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the truth of the work of art."
Michel Foucault,"What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life."
Michel Foucault,"Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society."
Michel Foucault,"As the archaeology of our thought easily shows, man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end."
Michel Foucault,"In its function, the power to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or educating."
Michel Foucault,"There are more ideas on earth than intellectuals imagine. And these ideas are more active, stronger, more resistant, more passionate than ''politicians'' think. We have to be there at the birth of ideas, the bursting outward of their force: not in books expressing them, but in events manifesting this force, in struggles carried on around ideas, for or against them. Ideas do not rule the world. But it is because the world has ideas... that it is not passively ruled by those who are its leaders or those who would like to teach it, once and for all, what it must think."
Michel Foucault,"The lyricism of marginality may find inspiration in the image of the ''outlaw,'' the great social nomad, who prowls on the confines of a docile, frightened order."
Michel Foucault,"The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us."
Michel Foucault,Freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism.
Michel Foucault,"If repression has indeed been the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost."
Julie Foudy,"I first met her in probably 1994, ... The [national] team was going through this transition of getting more support, yet contractually we didn't have a lot of say. ... I had this incredible meeting with Billie Jean King, this all-day roundtable discussion, and the theme of the day was, look, if you want things to change, you've got to do it yourself."

George Foulkes,"Not only were we top of the Scottish Premier League, our season tickets had doubled and we were planning ground expansion, ... Vladimir Romanov is behaving like a dictator and if he continues to do that there will be a revolution against him."
George Foulkes,"There will be no undue delay, but we have to take the necessary time to find the manager that makes this club the top club in Scotland,"
George Foulkes,"We are not going to rush it but we're also not going to have undue delay. I can say the club will go from strength to strength,"
George Foulkes,"Craig Gordon is worth many millions of pounds. He is the established first-choice 'keeper for his country, has done brilliantly for Hearts and we are not in the business of selling our best players. He is a big part of our plans as we try to keep progressing and it would take a substantial offer, of the order of around Â£5million, to even make us consider selling."
George Foulkes,Acceptance of this offer will see the club move from strength to strength under the same management and with a simplification of ownership and increased commitment.
Dan Fouts,"People ask me who he reminds me of. The way he's playing, I'd say he doesn't remind me of anybody. I've never seen anybody - running back, quarterback, wide receiver - make the plays that Vince Young made today."
Dan Fouts,One of the great things personally coming to Hawai'i is my friendship of Jim Nicholson.
Dan Fouts,I remember Terry being exhausted from his latest Super Bowl win and all the things that go with it.
Dan Fouts,"I always loved going to Hawai'i; it was very, very special."
Dan Fouts,"First of all, it was such an honor to be chosen. You had to be voted in by players and coaches that time. But having it in Hawai'i was a brilliant idea."
Dan Fouts,"I'm over it. You strive to win a Super Bowl and you do everything you can to get there. But being in the Hall of Fame, you never play for that honor. It's incredible."
Dan Fouts,"When you work with a legend as I do, it's wonderful. There's so many things I've learned working with Keith. He's so patient, not only with me, but with everyone in our crew and with the audience and with the game. He has a style that is so easy and will never be copied."

Gene Fowler,Perhaps no mightier conflict of mind occurs ever again in a lifetime than that first decision to unseat one's own tooth

Robbie Fowler,"It sounds mercenary and it smacks of rats leaving the sinking ship, ... But get real, when everyone is bailing out, you don't want to be the last man standing."
Robbie Fowler,"Honest to God, I'm so happy it's frightening! I'm just so chuffed - that's all I can say."

Robbie Fowler,For me to get anywhere near him is a fantastic achievement and to surpass him by one - I'm delighted. I grew up an Everton fan but Kenny is a proper Liverpool legend and to get anywhere near him is fantastic.
Robbie Fowler,"I've made plenty of mistakes, I know I have, and during my time as a footballer things have changed so that the spotlight is now even more intense."
John Fowles,"So I felt this burning summer. In form I mightbelong to humankind; in reality I seemed one of aravenous self-destroying horde of rats.I am glad there is no God. If there were,I cannot imagine that we rampant, myopic, andinsatiably self-centred creatures shouldbe allowed to survive a single day more"

John Fowles,There comes a time in each life like a point of fulcrum. At that time you must accept yourself. It is not anymore what you will become. It is what you are and always will be.
John Fowles,The most important questions in life can never be answered by anyone except oneself.

John Fowles,The supposed great misery of our century is the lack of time.
John Fowles,Duty largely consists of pretending that the trivial is critical.

John Fowles,We all write poems; it is simply that poets are the ones who write in words.
John Fowles,"In some mysterious way woods have never seemed to me to be static things. In physical terms, I move through them; yet in metaphysical ones, they seem to move through me."
John Fox,"[Davis won't have to worry about opportunities. The Panthers had the NFL's second-worst offense (267.5 yards a game) and ranked 25th in the league in rushing yards (99.1Â per game) last season, and coach John Fox plans to rely heavily on Davis this year. Before taking over Carolina in January 2002, Fox spent five years as the Giants' defensive coordinator, so he knows from firsthand experience in the NFL East what Davis is capable of doing.] Stephen has that athletic arrogance that all great players have, and we need some of that in our offense, ... We knew his lack of production in Washington didn't result from a decline in his skills. It came from not playing or running as much. But he's our kind of back. There may be faster runners, but there aren't many who are as productive [in terms of carries]."
John Fox,"I'd like to congratulate Arizona for their victory over San Francisco in the 'Burrito Bowl' last week. But now that their run to the border and back is complete, they've got the Carolina Panthers to answer to. I don't know if Dennis Green and his crew are aware of this, but the cardinal in the state bird of North Carolina, and we don't appreciate the evil-looking cardinal painted on the side of their helmets."
John Fox,Ricky's a good locker-room guy. He knows the skills of the trade. I think he's helped some of our young receivers and he's helped our football team on the field.

John Fox,The top-end talent just isn't there.
John Fox,"The only way an industry can show strength against a union is by forming a united front, ... Nothing unusual there. But I do think the union's going to take a tough stance. Where this shakes out, I don't know. We're still in the early posturing stages."
John Fox,"We're going to be there until the whistle blows and the game is over,'' Panthers strong safety Mike Minter said."
John Fox,"So rather than risk any kind of a prolonged situation with his foot, we just rested him. I'd feel a lot better if he had played the last few weeks, but on the other hand, I feel good about where he is right now."
John Fox,"You'd like to keep everybody. The reality, though, with free agency and the salary cap, is that you're not able to,"
John Fox,"I think they try to keep more in perspective of what is in this room than outside,"
John Fox,"There are players there that I've been in the trenches with in the past and guys that are having big seasons for them and have had big seasons since my tenure there. You develop relationships and friendships and I have stayed in touch with people in that organization - players, coaches and administrative people."
John Fox,"Because of what's happened in the past, I'm not going to sit here and doomsday our chances."
John Fox,"He's got a lot of passion,"
John Fox,"It's not how big the wand is. It's how much magic is inside, and he's got a lot of magic. He's a guy that gets it done."
John Fox,"A lot of that stuff doesn't always get seen, it's kind of like playing offensive line - until there's a penalty on you it's almost like nobody knows you are there. Karl makes a lot of big plays and brings an attitude to that phase of our football team."
John Fox,"He's got competitive greatness. That's what separates guys. That's what drives him, I think that's the key to him. I think he's just a very, very strong-willed competitor."
John Fox,"At halftime, I kind of knew what kind of a game it was going to be for them offensively ... they were going to throw it a lot. You give them a little momentum, and he's pretty special."
John Fox,"Like I told the football team, I thought we had a tremendous season. We accomplished a lot with some of the things we went through."
John Fox,"I wouldn't call a 10-5 football team inconsistent. Eight and eight is what I call inconsistent, about half out is good and half out is bad. I would like to be 15-0, too, and I think every coach in the league would. But the reality is nobody is."
John Fox,"I don't think there are any ill feelings about it. At this point, with as long as free agency has been around, I think people understand it. You can't fault the player. They're doing what is best for themselves and their family. It's just part of the business."
John Fox,"Any time you can come on the road in a hostile environment on a short week and win, it's a challenge. All the guys in this locker room were challenged and I thought they responded."
John Fox,They play better defense than what their statistics showed. I felt that coming in.
John Fox,"In situations such as this, the level of public debate is often not as high as one would like it to be. But I think we can have a public process that represents everyone's values."
John Fox,"He has the confidence of his coaches and his team, I think that's the key. We had a couple of guys in front of him. Those couple of guys got hurt a year ago and those couple of guys have gotten hurt this year. We've been down this road before."
John Fox,We've been in this spot (clinching) for the past month. I think the pride and character in this locker room stepped up today and I'm very proud of them.
John Fox,"That loss to Dallas last week hurt very, very badly. The pride and character in that locker room stepped up."
John Fox,"Contrary to popular belief, technically Scott is more in personnel now. We couldn't make that move here because of where we are in our personnel department, so I think it was a great move."
John Fox,"Stephen has that athletic arrogance that all great players have, and we need some of that in our offense. We knew his lack of production in Washington didn't result from a decline in his skills. It came from not playing or running as much. But he's our kind of back. There may be faster runners, but there aren't many who are as productive [in terms of carries]."
John Fox,"You always have some anxiety there. Players try to protect each other the best they can, but the important thing is we made it through unscathed. A lot of it's because these guys know how to practice smart."
Peter Fox,It's astonishing to realize the Legislature exempted themselves and are not bound to the same policies as the rest of state government.
Peter Fox,It's a heart-rending situation any time a child is a victim. But to have essentially an information blackout about the victim is simply not good public policy.
Peter Fox,"I like the movie going experience. I like the big screen, going out. I think for me and a lot of people its still a valuable experience."
Rick Fox,The wins and losses don't matter this year. We're concentrating on improving. We're in trouble when we give up. They didn't roll over tonight. They kept on taking the ball strong to the hole. I'm proud of the way they played.
Rick Fox,"We wouldn't be as good without [the triangle]. It involves all five people. It gives everybody the opportunity to read the defense, touch the ball and make plays."
Rick Fox,The best part of having a sorority living here was that it stayed clean.
Rick Fox,"The best part of having a sorority living here was that it stayed clean,"
Rick Fox,You don't want to get me started about apple martinis and the affect they have on my lovemaking. I might just throw you down and make some love to you right here and now.
Rick Fox,That's what it's going to take to win these last four games. Not an individual effort by any one person-a collective group going out and surviving.
Rick Fox,"Since I left basketball, and my wife, it's been a glorious feast of lovemaking."
Rick Fox,Rita got the best of us. We took quite a beating. It's going to take a while to come back from this.
Rick Fox,Let me read you some of my poetry. My poetry just takes me to another level.
Rick Fox,I've traveled around the world and made love with many satisfied women. So I decided to share my story.
Rick Fox,"Everything I've always done has been for the sole purpose of increasing my lovemaking output. A lot of guys won't admit that, but I do. I just want to make love."

Anatole France,"I would define a book as a work of magic whence escape, all kinds of images to trouble the souls and change the hearts of men"

Anatole France,"America, where thanks to Congress, there are forty million laws to enforce the Ten Commandments"
Anatole France,It was one of the liest and heaviest feelings of my life to feel that I was no longer a boy. From that moment I began to grow old in my own esteem -and in my esteem age is not estimable.

Anatole France,"To imagine is everything, to know is nothing at all."
Anatole France,Lovers who love truly do not write down their happiness.

Anatole France,"To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe."
Anatole France,"All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another."
Anatole France,"In art as in love, instinct is enough."
Brian France,You've got a lot of new platforms that are clamoring for high-end sports content.
Brian France,Toyota has proven in the truck series it can be a great partner. They have proven they can build relationships with team owners and enhance the competition.
Brian France,"It would be OK (for a champion not to win a race), although I think it's very unlikely. I would be shocked if the winner goes through the final 10 and doesn't win a race."
Brian France,"We have to be, and we will be, a performance-based series. You have to perform. You know what, the drivers ... don't want to limp in on a fan vote. They want to earn their way in or not earn their way in."
Brian France,More teams should have the opportunity to show their stuff and not be victims of how much money [big teams] have.
Brian France,We hear ideas all the time that we could consider.
Brian France,I think it's going to go down as an important point in our history. And I know they're (BEGIN BRACKET) Toyota (END BRACKET) looking at it from a long-term view.
Brian France,"Baseball's Hall of Fame wasn't located in a major metropolitan area, and they've struggled."
Brian France,They took their time understanding NASCAR's culture and goals and objectives of how we operated.
Brian France,"Wins are wins, and they're certainly looked at. Would we do something a little more for the wins  five, 10 more points? I don't know. You've got to have consistency, too."
Brian France,"I am going to spend a lot more time on our competition side, so I am going to be here a lot more. It's just an easier place for me to spend time."
Brian France,"This move provides for even more intense competition on the track between drivers and manufacturers, which will provide more excitement and fan interest."
Brian France,"Many of the cars are made here in the U.S., and they're very much in the fabric of the culture here today, Any American make ....."
Brian France,We just need to find a market in Canada that works. We know we have a tremendous fan base up there.
Brian France,"The Busch Series is quietly doing NBA or regular season baseball numbers. It's wearing out other sports. Busch will never be the Cup series, but we would like the new agreement for that to be a franchise of its own, treated with promotion and announcers that differentiate that series a little better as we go down the road."
Brian France,"We are going to have a greater urban impact. Anytime you can create awareness, it stands to create interest."
Dennis Franchione,"He has experience as both a defensive coordinator and head coach, and I have known Gary for many years. I know he has great passion for his players and he has a high energy level. I have the utmost confidence in his ability to put together an outstanding defense."
Dennis Franchione,That's a loss for our football team.
Dennis Franchione,"I don't think anybody should have any doubt about the way he throws the football, his potential as a quarterback. It's time for him to take the next step in his career."
Dennis Franchione,I don't think Reggie has made a bad decision yet. He hasn't forced any balls. He is really comfortable here. He's doing his thing and is really sharp.
Dennis Franchione,"I like it a lot better coaching him than facing him. He's a good athlete that can catch the ball, run with it and make things happen."
Steve Francis,"When you get a victory, it's always good. Guys are in a good mood. Hopefully, we continue to have these type of times."
Steve Francis,"I really enjoyed the win. It was a great victory, especially against the Rockets."
Steve Francis,You know I was mad [about the trade]. But now I'm cool. I'm cool about everything.
Steve Francis,"With all the talent we have on this team, it's just a matter of getting it all together."
Steve Francis,I support what he's trying to do. The thing that's missing is being more aggressive from the get-go.
Steve Francis,"If we have to sacrifice more to be better, that's what we have to do."
Steve Francis,I say my patience is exhausted.
Steve Francis,We made some crucial mistakes and they have got a group of veteran guys who stepped up.
Steve Francis,(Magic head coach Brian Hill) just basically told me before the game that (the trade rumors are) something that I can't control. He just told me to play for myself and the team.
Steve Francis,"I swear to goodness. Patience is something I've learned the last month,"
Steve Francis,"He was calling me all summer, making sure I was working on my shooting, ... It was funny having my rookie telling me that. But I tried to put a lot of things into my arsenal for this year."
Steve Francis,"It's healthy in a democracy to have several candidates in a primary. We're promoting democracy abroad, and we should be practicing it here."
Steve Francis,"I know we're not going to run the table, I just hope we can get some type of consistency going. Guys are tired and banged up right now, but we've got to pay attention and lock in mentally."
Steve Francis,"I just said the heck with it. I talked with Coach and it's like he said, it's something I can't control and I have to play for myself and my team."
Steve Francis,"People go through those things in regular life and basketball. I'm not the first person who's had a span of games where they didn't play particularly well. ... It's just my turn to go through it. It's the first time in my seven-year career that I played probably four or five games that weren't really, really good consistently."
Julio Franco,What nature makes is good for you.
Julio Franco,There are no magic pills.
Julio Franco,"Anytime you get hit by a 95 mph fastball, it's going to hurt for 12 hours."

Jeff Francoeur,"I can't worry about that kind of stuff. I'm not going to. You can't just say you're going to be patient. The way I see it, you figure that stuff out."
Jeff Francoeur,"I think she's in a tough situation with what she's trying to do. I don't think she was worse than the others, I don't think she was better."
Jeff Francoeur,They're not going to let Chipper and Andruw beat them [in the postseason]. They're going to make the rest of the lineup beat them. So it was big for us to be able to come through like that and get some hits like that. Hopefully we can continue to do that up to the playoffs and through the playoffs.
Jeff Francoeur,I was talking to Chipper [Jones] last night about how we've faced some pretty good pitchers and how it's been good for me to see them.
Jeff Francoeur,You can't worry about that and let it put pressure on you. That's not the right mind-set. We know what we've got to do this year.
Jeff Francoeur,"It's even more of an honor now that I've met him, ... You can just tell what a great guy he is."
Jeff Francoeur,"It's an honor playing for Bobby Cox, ... Bobby makes it so much easier for young players. He never doubts you or questions you. He doesn't have you looking over your shoulder. He just lets you play your game. I think that's why you've seen so many young players play so well in Atlanta. It's because of Bobby. I'd love to win another World Series for that man."
Jeff Francoeur,"I tried to run it off, but after running from second to home you could feel it. If felt good to get in here and get some ice on it."
Jeff Francoeur,"I think we all probably dreamed about it. If you don't have dreams, you're in it for the wrong reasons. But, honestly, nobody could have expected what happened to happen."
Jeff Francoeur,"We joke on our morning show because he's so perfect, ... He's a great athlete, a hometown guy, good looking. I wouldn't be surprised if he was running a foster puppy shelter out of his basement and helping sick children in his spare time."
Terry Francona,I wouldn't trade it for the world. Trying to be a little bit better than somebody else at what you love is a great feeling.
Terry Francona,"We're doing it now for obvious reasons, rest. We're trying to take whatever happens and make it to our advantage."
Terry Francona,"It sounds kind of weird, but I?m kind of happy for him. He?s going out on his own terms. I think he?s comfortable with what he?s doing."
Terry Francona,"When the season is over, we want to be on top regardless of how we get there. A tough game tonight. Our job now is to show up tomorrow and be one run better instead of one run worse."
Terry Francona,"Yeah, maybe that's part of the reason I have some feelings or sympathy for people because of what they go through. At the same time, we're still playing them and trying to do right by everybody. We'll continue to do that as well as we can. We ask guys to show up and be professional and try to do that back to them, regardless of the situation."
Terry Francona,"I've talked to him two or three times. I know he's really enjoying himself, [so] whatever those guys need. If they feel the need to get right back in there, we'll do it. If they feel like maybe they need a day or two to separate themselves and take a little blow with all the travel and excitement ... whatever they need."
Terry Francona,We all love Johnny. We don't want him to get hits against us. The fans were just showing their emotions. I think every player out there would rather be in that situation than having fans that don't care. I've been on both sides. That's not good. It's not the end of the world. It's just some very passionate fans having some fun at somebody else's expense.
Terry Francona,"That?s real good news. If anybody can play with pain, it?s Johnny Damon. I don?t doubt it?ll be a few games, but that?s a heck of a lot better than the rest of the year."
Terry Francona,"I don't doubt he'll miss a few games, ... but that's a heck of a lot better than the rest of the year."
Terry Francona,I thought it was another step in the right direction. He came in and got outs and gave us the chance to win.
Terry Francona,He wanted to go and have a little catch and get the blood flowing.
Terry Francona,"It's (only) been one week, but we're trying to play winning baseball."
Terry Francona,"It's hard to win doubleheaders. The idea is to make this into our advantage somehow. Because of the importance of these games, we're going to probably have a lot of guys play 18 innings. Maybe it'll be 20, maybe 22. Who knows? Whatever we're asked to do, we'll try to make it to our advantage."
Terry Francona,"It swelled up so quickly that it makes you uneasy. I don't doubt it (a Damon absence) will be for a few days, but that's better than the rest of the year. If anybody can play with pain, it's Johnny."
Terry Francona,"The comfort I have is our ability to play. I know that we will show up and play the next game, and that's what gives us the most comfort."
Anne Frank,"The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles."
Anne Frank,"I keep my ideals, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart."
Anne Frank,Who would ever think that so much can go on in the soul of a young girl?
Anne Frank,I soothe my conscience now with the thought that it is better for hard words to be on paper than that Mummy should carry them in her heart.
Anne Frank,The final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands
Anne Frank,Boys will be boys. And even that wouldn't matter if only we could prevent girls from being girls.
Anne Frank,"Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands."
Anne Frank,"I have often been downcast, but never in despair; I regard our hiding as a dangerous adventure, romantic and interesting at the same time. In my diary I treat all the privations as amusing. I have made up my mind now to lead a different life from other girls and, later on, different from ordinary housewives. My start has been so very full of interest, and that is the sole reason why I have to laugh at the humorous side of the most dangerous moments."
Anne Frank,"Laziness may appear attractive, but work gives satisfaction."
Anne Frank,Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy.
Anne Frank,I don't think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains.
Thomas Frank,"People are born in a certain place, and in a certain society. I don't mean to sound like a determinist, but to think we're entirely free to do whatever we want betrays a certain class perspective. For most people who have to work for a living, and work at jobs under conditions they may not like, it's just not simple when it comes to freedom."
Thomas Frank,I was in a bad mood when I wrote that.
Thomas Frank,"What becomes fascinating is the way the culture industry doesn't deny it and doesn't try to mitigate it, but tries to sell its products as a way of liberating oneself."
Thomas Frank,"In America, we no longer have an institutionalized, organized way of calling business to task - of taking them to account for what they've done - and this is especially true in the cultural realm."
Thomas Frank,"These days, of course, the focus of talk about popular liberation through products is mostly associated with the Internet. I've been collecting computer ads and ads dealing with Internet industries."
Thomas Frank,"In the last James Bond movie, the villain was a culture captain, a tycoon of culture, a Murdoch figure. It's not as if people don't know what is going on."
Thomas Frank,"I think there's great potential for autonomy, but we have to remember that we live in a world where people may have free will but have not invented their circumstances."
Thomas Frank,"Iraqis are being targeted at an unprecedented rate. Wary of the ability of police and soldiers to provide protection, civilians are attempting to provide their own security, relying on neighbors and family or hiring armed guards."
Bobby Frankel,"He can track, like the [Grade 1 Man o' War] last year in New York, where he was 10 lengths off."
Bobby Frankel,"He's a big asset. Horses are running great for him. I don't know if it's Patrick or the horse, but I'm not going to experiment."
Bobby Frankel,What's great about Bailey is he rode like he was still 25. He wasn't scared. I was impressed the way he'd go through holes with no fear. And he came into the paddock before the race well prepared. He knew exactly what was going on -- he'd handicap the horses and the jockeys.
Bobby Frankel,"He's a real nice horse, and he tries hard. When he gets competition, he tries even harder. When horses come to him, he'll go on."
Al Franken,"I heard versions of the speech before and I thought it was great. You go with your 'A' material. As an old comic, that's what I say. Go with your 'A' material."
Al Franken,"Lies, and The Lying Liars who Tell Them"
Al Franken,"A brief digression on whether that suspicious-looking mole is actually cancer. ... Take this simple test called the ABC test. 'A' is for age. What is your age? Is it over thirteen? If so, it's cancer. That's how the ABC test works."
Al Franken,"Yeah, we shot ourselves in the foot right out of the gate. The guy who ran it at first misled pretty much everybody about how much capital we had. He said we had enough to go three years without making money, and we had enough to go three weeks."
Al Franken,"Yeah, but you need an experienced radio veteran who is a liberal advocate. And there just hadn't been any radio that did that. And so they weren't trained - they had developed all these bad habits of being objective and balanced and stuff like that."
Al Franken,"Well, I think that there's a value to comedy in and of itself."
Al Franken,We need to be pro-science; we have to go back to science.
Al Franken,"The thing that interests me least about the radio business is the radio business. But I've had to learn a little bit about it. It's not rocket science: You get ratings, that's good."
Al Franken,"The right wing has had a radio apparatus for years and years, so they've had minor leagues - they've had local rightwing guys who've become national rightwing guys, and who build slowly, and that's how it goes. We haven't had that. It isn't like we have a farm team."
Al Franken,"I'm neutral in this race but I'm for freedom of speech, which means people should be able to assemble and speak without being shouted down."
Al Franken,I do personal attacks only on people who specialize in personal attacks.
Al Franken,"And I think that being able to make people laugh and write a book that's funny makes the information go down a lot easier and it makes it a lot more fun to read, easier to understand, and often stronger. So there's all kinds of advantages to it."
Al Franken,"When the president during the campaign said he was against nation building, I didn't realize he meant our nation."
Al Franken,"If you hear, day after day, liberals are rooting against armed forces, that is eventually going to have an effect on soldiers and troops who are actually going to believe that and it's wrong. It's just wrong."
Al Franken,It's easier to put on slippers than to carpet the whole world.
Al Franken,"Mistakes are a part of being human. Appreciate your mistakes for what they are: precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way. Unless it's a fatal mistake, which, at least, others can learn from."
Al Franken,There's no liberal echo chamber in this country. There's a right-wing echo chamber. I want to create a countervailing echo chamber.
Al Franken,"It's the Power of the Almighty, the Splendor of Nature, and then you."
Al Franken,"I also focus on Bush and his administration - who do a lot of lying - and how a right-wing media has allowed them to get away with a lot of stuff that, in a different media environment, they probably wouldn't be able to get away with."
Al Franken,"I once asked the most fabulous couple I know, Madonna and Guy Ritchie, how they kept things fresh despite having been married for almost seven months. 'It's a job, Al,' Guy told me. 'We work at it every day.'"
Al Franken,"Hi, James. I have a radio show on Air America Radio, and something we do is check stuff that doesn't sound right to us."
Al Franken,"Unfortunately, America wasn't paying attention when he was giving his stump speech."
Al Franken,"I'll be warning them against bad advice,"
Al Franken,"When you encounter seemingly good advice that contradicts other seemingly good advice, ignore them both."
Viktor E. Frankl,I recommend that the Statue of Liberty be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the west coast.

Viktor E. Frankl,"Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for."
Viktor E. Frankl,Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives.
Viktor E. Frankl,"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
Viktor E. Frankl,Man's last freedom is his freedom to choose how he will react in any given situation
Viktor E. Frankl,Just as a small fire is extinguished by the storm whereas a large fire is enhanced by it-likewise a weak faith is weakened by predicament and catastrophes whereas a strong faith is strengthened by them.
Viktor E. Frankl,"Only to the extent that someone is living out this self transcendence of human existence is he truly human or does he become his true self. He becomes so, not by concerning himself with his self's actualization, but by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward."
Viktor E. Frankl,A human being is a deciding being.
Viktor E. Frankl,"Everything can be taken away from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedom -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
Viktor E. Frankl,"Being tolerant does not mean that I share another oneâ€™s belief. But it does mean that I acknowledge another oneâ€™s right to believe, and obey, his own conscience."
Viktor E. Frankl,The last of the human freedoms is to choose one's attitudes
Viktor E. Frankl,"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way"
Viktor E. Frankl,The last of human freedoms - the ability to chose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances.

Aretha Franklin,I'm the lady next door when I'm not on stage.
Aretha Franklin,Being a singer is a natural gift. It means I'm using to the highest degree possible the gift that God gave me to use. I'm happy with that.
Aretha Franklin,I think the hardest thing is losing weight. That's the hardest thing more than anything else.
Aretha Franklin,"Don't say Aretha is making a comeback, because I've never been away!"
Benjamin Franklin,"Be studious in your profession, and you will be learned. Be industrious and frugal, and you will be rich. Be sober and temperate, and you will be healthy.

Benjamin Franklin,"When I reflect, as I frequently do, upon the felicity I have enjoyed, I sometimes say to myself, that were the offer made me, I would engage to run again, from beginning to end, the same career of life.

George Freeman,"In some ways, he has the same kind of personality that [Supreme Court Justice] Hugo Black did: people perceive him as being that kind of driving personality, ... He's like a bloodhound, because once he finds the scent, he doesn't lick his nose, he just runs hard after it."
George Freeman,"He does have, underneath a sort of serious exterior, a really wonderful sense of humor, ... It rarely shows itself in the trial lawyer mode, but it certainly does in personal relationships."
George Freeman,"That's why I am worried about my job everyday. Because as soon as I lose one, they'll probably fire me."
George Freeman,"[George Freeman, the Times Co.'s assistant general counsel, met with the Washington bureau last week to address staff complaints.] There was so much rumor and untruth and speculation going around, ... I wouldn't characterize it as people being unhappy. People had a lot of questions and concerns. I hope to some degree I assuaged the concerns."
Mark Freeman,"It looks like this year we've got to stop the passing game, ... They've got some good looking running backs, too, but they look harder to stop this year because they throw the ball so much better."
Mark Freeman,It's quite an honor to host it. I think it's great for Pittsburgh.
Mark Freeman,It's electric. It's really fun to watch.
Mark Freeman,"She's probably maybe a football field and a half in front of us. She's right off in that scrub, some of the thicker stuff maybe."
Mark Freeman,"The competition was just so good in Under 18. It was obvious by the results that both teams deserved to be there. From the Predators' end of things, our teams were very successful."
Michael Freeman,"If you're a student, you take one step into the digital learning center, and you can do all your research, all your packaging, all your copying. When you step out of the library, you're ready to take the next step right into the classroom with a finished product."
Michael Freeman,"The fairest thing to do would be to call those kids back. I want to be assured that not just my school champion, but that all the kids have a fair shake."
Michael Freeman,"There are two issues here. The heart of the settlement is the $14-21 million the city has agreed to pay to stop future problems along the highway. There's an additional $300,000 expenditure in the settlement to clean up areas already harmed by the sediment drainage. We think the Forest Service should help cover these costs."
Michael Freeman,"If it was left solely to the devices of the government, that wouldn't have happened."
Michael Freeman,The whole point is to not to unduly delay travelers coming into country. We're trying to ... deter threats to our country.
Michael Freeman,"Up to now, I've been able to avoid Windows NT because the computers that control the power system are for the most part VAXes. But as more things we use, such as time sheets and discrepancy reports, migrate to the NT network, I'll need to do NT. I don't know what will happen; all I can do is try."
Morgan Freeman,"I always tell my kids if you lay down, people will step over you. But if you keep scrambling, if you keep going, someone will always, always give you a hand. Always. But you gotta keep dancing, you gotta keep your feet moving."
Morgan Freeman,[On a double win for black actors:] It means that Hollywood is continuing to make history. We're evolving with the rest of the world.
Morgan Freeman,We call on anybody who has even the thought (of giving) to get beyond the thought and help these people.
Morgan Freeman,"In my country, we talk to our women, not drug them with plants."

Robert Freeman,Rubber Soul.
Robert Freeman,"An uninformed public can do no good. Only with information can we contribute and improve the way we live. Ignorance really is not bliss. The more secrecy we have within our government, the less accountability."
Robert Freeman,Character is not made in a crisis it is only exhibited.
Dwight Freeney,"I thought the guy did a pretty good job, considering we'd heard he was playing hurt (sore shoulder),"
Dwight Freeney,"It's kind of funny out here, actually hearing some buzz about us. Being here for so many years, and before I got here, it was always about the big three on offense, and rightfully so. But, you know, it is good to hear a little about us, and we're playing a lot better."
Dwight Freeney,"Consistency on their protection and pass set -- the best linemen don't waver from it, regardless of what I do."
Dwight Freeney,"I think a 10-3 score is a thing of beauty. I know a lot of people don't like it, but to me, it's beautiful."

Ace Frehley,"People, y'know, they either love us or they hate us; there's no middle ground."
Ace Frehley,"One thing I love to do is produce. I've produced a couple of bands. I mean, nothing ever really happened with 'em, but I enjoy getting a young band into the studio and guiding them, and making them feel at ease."
Ace Frehley,One of the greatest gifts I've ever gotten is my daughter.
Ace Frehley,"Once you come and see Kiss, you either love us or you hate us."
Ace Frehley,"I've recorded 25 or 30 albums. I know that sometimes when you work with producers who are kinda dictators, it doesn't help you make a better record."
Ace Frehley,"I've never read anything about heroin where, yeah, it's a good experience, and you can do it for 20 years and enjoy it, like having a cold beer. It doesn't work that way with heroin."
Ace Frehley,"I'm the kinda person, you gotta fight for everything you get. You gotta believe in yourself."
Ace Frehley,I'm not here to perform. I'm here to sign autographs. You have to wait till I come back with my own hand.
Ace Frehley,I'm just a kid from Bronx who got lucky.
Ace Frehley,I'll get up there and I'll do my guitar solos in one of those space outfits.
Ace Frehley,"I went to my friend's house one day, and he had an electric guitar he had just bought with a tiny little amp. I turned the volume up to 10 and I hit one chord, and I said, I'm in love."
Ace Frehley,I think the fans really wanna hear the songs the way they sound on the record.
Ace Frehley,"I think most of the people, once you see a Kiss show, you kinda get spoiled because I don't think there's anybody out there that's doing a bigger or a better show than us."
Ace Frehley,I just didn't expect an acoustic version of Rock'n'Roll All Nite.
Ace Frehley,"I had a feeling it was gonna work out because not only did I enjoy the music and hit it off with the guys, but I was into theatrical rock and was willing to wear makeup and do anything to make it."
Ace Frehley,"I don't see this planet being... they're talking about how they're turning around the environmental problems here, but I think it's already too late."

Ace Frehley,Finding a good band is Iike finding a good wife. You got to keep trying till you find the right one.
Ace Frehley,"Every time Paul and Gene use my makeup, they have to pay me a royalty check. I think they changed the makeup so they didn't have to pay me."
Ace Frehley,"As long as I know what key the solo is in, I try to kind of empty my mind and not think about anything. I just play without thinking."
Ace Frehley,America is huge.
Ace Frehley,"A lot of times, I played bass on songs. Gene plays guitar on some songs."
Ace Frehley,The guys in my band are good friends on and off the stage. The band members that I have now is probably the best band that I have ever had.
Ace Frehley,"I asked my daughter when she was 16, What's the buzz on the street with the kids? She's going, to be honest, Dad, most of my friends aren't into Kiss. But they've all been told that it's the greatest show on Earth."
Laura Freid,"The music is very beautiful, but when people hear it they experience emotions and a meaning that goes beyond the performance. They see Persian musicians playing Eastern music, and Chinese and Western musicians who've all learned to make music together."
Laura Freid,Silk Road embodies the spirit of discovery and exchange. We want to encourage people to look for what unites them instead of what divides them.
Laura Freid,"We see the Silk Road as a symbol of cultural discovery and exchange, and the project uses artistic expression to nurture creativity similar to what was found on the road in ancient times. We're trying to serve as a common resource for musicians drawing on both ancient and current civilizations along the road."
Paulo Freire,The trust of the people in the leaders reflects the confidence of the leaders in the people.
Paulo Freire,"Washing one's hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral."

David French,transform the culture of education into one that respects free speech for everybody.
David French,"It's not a perfect budget in the least, but it's one we can support. We're encouraging people to go out and vote yes."

David French,"We hold all of our cadets to the highest standards of professional and personal behavior. As future leaders, they must set the example and conduct themselves in a manner befitting those standards."
David French,"We've been having amicable discussions with Pocopson Township authorities, and look forward to reaching an agreement soon."
Dawn French,"The person I have admired the most in comedy terms would be Eric Morecambe, who is my total hero."
Dawn French,"We have to do a film parody for Comic Relief. We can't decide which film to parody at the moment. Any ideas welcome, but not Spiderman owing to costume being too tight."
Dawn French,Turn up your radio. Watch lots of telly and eat loads of choc. Feel guilty. Stay up all night. Learn everything in six hours that has taken you two years to compile. That's how I did it.
Dawn French,It was fantastic to work in Cornwall partly because my family live there so I was able to do lots of visiting and eat lots of cake. They live all over Cornwall and all over Devon.
Dawn French,In actual life I am a grumpy old bag.
Dawn French,"I'd like to play a horse, many people think I already have. Either end of the horse would be fine."

Dawn French,I keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it.
Dawn French,"I have had the unfortunate experience of having someone write an unauthorised biography of me. Half of it is lies and the other half is badly written. My feeling is that if I'm going to write my life story, I ought to have my life first."
Dawn French,"If I had been around when Rubens was painting, I would have been revered as a fabulous model. Kate Moss? Well, she would have been the paintbrush."
Dawn French,I never do any television without chocolate. That's my motto and I live by it. Quite often I write the scripts and I make sure there are chocolate scenes. Actually I'm a bit of a chocolate tart and will eat anything. It's amazing I'm so slim.
Dawn French,It was my father who taught me to value myself. He told me that I was uncommonly beautiful and that I was the most precious thing in his life.
Steve French,"This being the longest sports season of the year and having to train indoors, you have to admire any kid for sticking with it and doing as well as they do. It's the only co-ed situation of the team sports and there's a lot of camaraderie and support of the underclassman. I think the athletes had a fun season. It was fun for me to be a part of."
Steve French,We have senior leaders on boths squads that set a nice tone.
Steve French,Don't advertise to Boomers as though they're seniors. Talk to them about their interests but not their age.
Steve French,"Above all, don't advertise to them as though they're seniors. Talk to them about their interests but not their age."
Gus Frerotte,"There's been a lot said about Chris (and Ronnie). I told those guys not to worry. If you are the guy, the ball is coming. I'm not afraid to throw it to those guys. I have all the confidence in the world that they're going to make those plays."
Gus Frerotte,"No, you never get to that point, ... If you're a competitor and you have a lot of pride in what you do, those things will eat you up. Now, you come into Wednesday and you've got to let it go, but those things will eat you up for days."
Gus Frerotte,"Randy was there so long, and he was put up on such a pedestal. When he does that kind of thing he lets the other leaders down."
Gus Frerotte,"We came out fast, ... (Then) we missed some execution, had some penalties, missed a few deep balls. Maybe I'm throwing it a hair too early. I don't want to take a sack."
Gus Frerotte,"It is going to be the same ol' coach Saban. If you watched him at the end of the game with the defense, he was yelling and screaming. That is coach."
Gus Frerotte,"I haven't heard anything. Scott is a players' coach with a good side to him, but he could also be very strict. He has a feel for it, and if the Rams hired him they made a good call."
Gus Frerotte,"I wouldn't want to say the organization was in chaos, but there was some turmoil and [I] just never felt comfortable in Cincinnati,"
Gus Frerotte,"We just missed some deep balls,"
Brenda Frese,"Obviously to get that kind of quality rest is huge, especially with the turnaround."
Brenda Frese,Their traps kind of gave us some problems.
Brenda Frese,"I think it is totally amazing and it shows the power of our conference. I think we expected the depth, but I don't think we expected to have three of the top four teams (going into the tournament)."
Brenda Frese,"I am pleased to announce Jeff to the title of Associate Head Coach. Over the past five years of working with him, he has proven to be valuable member of our staff. Our players have benefited so much from his teachings and his knowledge of the game. Jeff continues to represent our program with the utmost professionalism and his tireless work ethic continues to make our team be the best it can be. I look forward to working with him as we defend our National Championship."
Brenda Frese,"That was a big key for us, getting past that hurdle of getting to the Sweet 16 since this team has never done that. Now I feel like the pressure is completely off of us."
Brenda Frese,"I did a scientific poll last night in the [hotel] lobby, and I discovered that this team has arrived. We have some great stuff going on here."
Brenda Frese,"I think the thing that makes her so special, as you witnessed her having a tough night with the turnovers, but she kept her head in the game. And how many freshmen do you know who would, or any player, let's not tab her as a freshman, make that many mistakes and still be able to keep their head in the game and stay poised and knock down some really key shots?"
Brenda Frese,On any given night. Someone's gonna step up.
Brenda Frese,She's practiced that shot a million times in her mind...in her back yard.
Brenda Frese,He's my right-hand man. There's numerous times where I leave him in charge to run practice. He's just done a tremendous job working with the players in our program over the last four years.
Brenda Frese,I love it. I think the ultimate is when you disrespect this program.
Brenda Frese,"Our leadership and our veterans kept us in the game, but once our two young players settled down, they played with so much confidence."
Brenda Frese,We've got kids that believe in each other that got it done together. It was just a great win as a team.
Brenda Frese,You hope that we're building a dynasty here. I don't even want to look ahead to next year because I want to enjoy this year.
Brenda Frese,You hope that we're building a dynasty here.
Brenda Frese,"You know on the outside, you say, absolutely, yes. You hope that we're building a dynasty here. But each and every season defines itself, the players define it with their character and really how they come together, and so you really have to take each team as its own."
Brenda Frese,"You hope that we're building a dynasty here, but each and every season defines its own. The players define it with their character and really how they come together. Never have I had a team go through a season and play for each other the way they played tonight."
Brenda Frese,I think these players could give you the scouting report by heart at this point.
Brenda Frese,They have the heart of a lion. They believe in each other ... I'm really proud of them.
Brenda Frese,"I was thinking, 'Thanks goodness we had a cushion,' because we did have some breakdowns. All the credit goes to Duke."
Brenda Frese,"I was thinking, 'Thank goodness we have a cushion here."
Brenda Frese,"I've been telling my husband I wanted to see 'Glory Road' for the last month, and I still can't get to a theater to see it."
Brenda Frese,"That's what was working. That's what makes this team special. Whatever's working in terms of a game plan, we're going to ride it and go with it."
Brenda Frese,"I'm living out a dream. The thing that's so special is just looking into the eyes of each and every person, player, staff member, fan. Just how much joy is out there because they understand how much hard work went into this game."
Brenda Frese,It's definitely a new environment. You've got to get used to the background and I think a lot of time there is an advantage with the team who played the night before. It's just great to be able to get that first game under our belt. It's nice to get those jitters out.
Brenda Frese,We wanted to come out and bring some energy on the defensive end by coming out in the press. We were able to get some turnovers early. We also had the size advantage inside.
Brenda Frese,"The thing I enjoy the most is taking in everybody else's emotions right now. It's pretty surreal. Looking into the eyes of every player, staff member, fan and how much joy is out there because they understand how much hard work was required."
Brenda Frese,That play jump-started us. It got us our emotion and our energy. Our defensive intensity really picked up after that.
Brenda Frese,"I think that really got us jump-started to get some emotion and get some energy. I think after that play, our defensive intensity really stepped up."
Brenda Frese,Who would have ever thought in my wildest dreams I would have gotten two rings this year? One getting married and the other a national championship.
Brenda Frese,We saw them getting into the paint more. Our defense was really breaking down.
Brenda Frese,"We need to win. We can control what we can control. That's what we've done up to this point, going 26-3 in the No. 1 conference in the country."
Brenda Frese,Everyone's playing their best and playing with confidence. We're really looking forward to what's next. We're not satisfied where we're at. We hope to be playing in three games back-to-back-to-back.
Brenda Frese,"I like where we're at. We're playing with a ton of confidence and just moving the ball, being so unselfish. And as long as we can continue to do that on the offensive end and defend them on the defensive end, great things are going to continue to happen for this team."
Brenda Frese,"We really challenged them in terms of our communication and our focus. We reduced our turnovers in this game, but I think we still need to be a little bit more efficient in what we're doing."
Brenda Frese,"I'm excited we're heading up to Penn State and I really like our bracket. State College is close for our fans, so it will be great to have so much support in the first couple rounds of the tournament."
Brenda Frese,She's just going to bring so much leadership. She said 'yes' back when Maryland was not a popular choice. She took a huge leap of faith. For her to be able to believe in herself and believe in this program just shows you what an outstanding young lady she is to be able to have that kind of confidence.
Brenda Frese,They loved reading all the books they got to read this summer with Coach G.
Brenda Frese,I definitely think we're at full strength now. I definitely think we're playing our best basketball. (Winning at) North Carolina was probably the big turning point and validated that we were for real. There's definitely a confidence and a swagger to us now. We know how good a team we are.
Brenda Frese,I thought we really played one of our highest levels of basketball. We need to find a way to keep the flow we had in the first.
Brenda Frese,"We're really playing some of our best basketball, our most confident basketball right now. But we've got to compete this week. That's all we can control."
Brenda Frese,"There is no pressure. We're going out there to play basketball and play hard for 40 minutes. The great thing with this team and these players is that they are so hungry, so focused and motivated. They really want to keep going. It's a lot of fun to coach a team like this."
Brenda Frese,"Age is just a number. When you have kids who have confidence and believe in each other, you can accomplish anything."
Brenda Frese,"Age is just a number. When you got kids that believe and they believe in each other and they got that kind of confidence, you can accomplish anything as a team."
Brenda Frese,"That's a tremendous accomplishment for Crystal and this team, and those kinds of awards don't happen without teammates getting you the ball."
Sigmund Freud,"The great question … which I have not been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is What does a woman want?"

Sigmund Freud,"The goal towards which the pleasure principle impels us / of becoming happy / is not attainable: yet we may not / nay, cannot / give up the efforts to come nearer to realization of it by some means or other."
Sigmund Freud,I do not think our successes can compete with those of Lourdes. There are so many more people who believe in the miracles of the Blessed Virgin than in the existence of the unconscious.
Sigmund Freud,"The analytic psychotherapist thus has a threefold battle to wage -- in his own mind against the forces which seek to drag him down from the analytic level; outside the analysis, against opponents who dispute the importance he attaches to the sexual instinctual forces and hinder him from making use of them in his scientific technique; and inside the analysis, against his patients, who at first behave like opponents but later on reveal the overvaluation of sexual life which dominates them, and who try to make him captive to their socially untamed passion."
Sigmund Freud,Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another
Sigmund Freud,"Psychoanalysis is for hysterical pathological cases, not for silly rich American women who should be learning how to darn socks"
Sigmund Freud,One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of Creation. . . We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from a state of things.
Sigmund Freud,One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be 'happy'' is not included in the plan of ''Creation.''
Sigmund Freud,"Sublimation of instinct is an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an important part in civilized life. If one were to yield to a first impression, one would say that sublimation is a vicissitude which has been forced upon the instincts entirely by civilization. But it would be wiser to reflect upon this a little longer. In the third place, finally, and this seems the most important of all, it is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built up upon a renunciation of instinct, how much it presupposes precisely the non-satisfaction (by suppression, repression or some other means?) of powerful instincts. This â€˜cultural frustrationâ€™ dominates the large field of social relationships between human beings;we know already that it is the cause of the antagonism against which all civilization has to fight."
Sigmund Freud,"The impression forces itself upon one that men measure by false standards, that everyone seeks power, success, riches for himself, and admires others who attain them, while undervaluing the truly precious thing in life."
Sigmund Freud,"It is always possible to bind together a considerable number of people in love, so long as there are other people left over to receive the manifestations of their aggression."
Sigmund Freud,"It would be one of the greatest triumphs of humanity, one of the most tangible liberations from the constraints of nature to which mankind is subject, if we could succeed in raising the responsible act of procreating children to the level of a deliberate and intentional activity and in freeing it from its entanglement with the necessary satisfaction of a natural need."
Sigmund Freud,One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be ''happy'' is not included in the plan of ''Creation.''
Sigmund Freud,A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity
Sigmund Freud,Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise
Sigmund Freud,"No one who, like me, conjures up the most evil of those half-tamed demons that inhabit the human beast, and seeks to wrestle with them, can expect to come through the struggle unscathed."
Sigmund Freud,"Where id was, there shall ego be."
Sigmund Freud,"Love and work...work and love, that's all there is."
Sigmund Freud,The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.
Sigmund Freud,"Dogs love their friends and bite their enemies, quite unlike people, who are incapable of pure love and always have to mix love and hate in their object-relations"
Sigmund Freud,"From error to error, one discovers the entire truth."
Sigmund Freud,The most complicated achievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness.
Sigmund Freud,Conscience is the internal perception of the rejection of a particular wish operating within us.
Sigmund Freud,Conscience is the internal perception of the reaction of a particular wish operating within us
Sigmund Freud,the first man to use abusive language instead of his fists was the founder of civilization.
Sigmund Freud,"One... gets an impression that civilization is something which was imposed on a resisting majority by a minority which understood how to obtain possession of the means to power and coercion. It is, of course, natural to assume that these difficulties are not inherent in the nature of civilization itself but are determined by the imperfections of the cultural forms which have so far been developed."
Sigmund Freud,"No matter how much restriction civilization imposes on the individual, he nevertheless finds some way to circumvent it. Wit is the best safety valve modern man has evolved; the more civilization, the more repression, the more need there is for wit."
Sigmund Freud,...the first man to use abusive language instead of his fists was the founder of civilization.
Sigmund Freud,"One... gets an impression that civilization is something which was imposed on a resisting majority by a minority which understood how to obtain possession of the means to power and coercion.  It is, of course, natural to assume that these difficulties are not inherent in the nature of civilization itself but are determined by the imperfections of the cultural forms which have so far been developed."
Sigmund Freud,The first human being who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.
Sigmund Freud,"Civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind. Why this has to happen, we do not know; the work of Eros is precisely this."
Sigmund Freud,"When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature"
Sigmund Freud,"We know less about the sexual life of little girls than of boys. But we need not feel ashamed of this distinction; after all, the sexual life of adult women is a ''dark continent'' for psychology."
Sigmund Freud,"We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our own body, which is doomed to decay and dissolution and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety as warning signals; from the external world, which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless forces of destruction; and finally from our relations to other men. The suffering which comes from this last source is perhaps more painful than any other."
Sigmund Freud,"Just as no one can be forced into belief, so no one can be forced into unbelief"
Sigmund Freud,"Demons do not exist any more than gods do, being only the products of the psychic activity of man"
Sigmund Freud,"The expectation that every neurotic phenomenon can be cured may, I suspect, be derived from the layman's belief that the neuroses are something quite unnecessary which have no right whatever to exist. Whereas in fact they are severe, constitutionally fixed illnesses, which rarely restrict themselves to only a few attacks but persist as a rule over long periods throughout life."
Sigmund Freud,No one who has seen a baby sinking back satiated from the breast and falling asleep with flushed cheeks and a blissful smile can escape the reflection that this picture persists as a prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life.
Sigmund Freud,Civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock.
Sigmund Freud,What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the (preferably sudden) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree.
Sigmund Freud,"Analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible, but to give the patient's ego freedom to decide one way or another."
Sigmund Freud,"Every normal person, in fact, is only normal on the average. His ego approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent."
Sigmund Freud,The ego is not master in its own house.
Sigmund Freud,What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books.
Sigmund Freud,Men are strong only so long as they represent a strong idea. They become powerless when they oppose it.
Sigmund Freud,The liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization.
Sigmund Freud,Dreams are often most profound when they seem the most crazy.
Sigmund Freud,The conscious mind may be compared to a fountain playing in the sun and falling back into the great subterranean pool of subconscious from which it rises.
Sigmund Freud,The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.
Sigmund Freud,Flowers are restful to look at. They have neither emotions nor conflicts.
Sigmund Freud,Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead. We must therefore accept it without complaint when they sometimes collide with a bit of reality against which they are dashed to pieces.
Sigmund Freud,It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct.
Sigmund Freud,"He that has eyes to see and ears to hear may convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore."
Sigmund Freud,"Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one's dreams. In what other way can one deal with them? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being."
Sigmund Freud,"Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility."

Sigmund Freud,"The tendency of aggression is an innate, independent, instinctual disposition in man... it constitutes the most powerful obstacle to culture."
Sigmund Freud,One must not be mean with the affections; what is spent of the fund is renewed in the spending itself.
Sigmund Freud,Time spent with cats is never wasted.
Sigmund Freud,What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.
Sigmund Freud,"America is a mistake, a giant mistake."
Glenn Frey,"Without a reunion, the Eagles are forever young, like James Dean."
Glenn Frey,There are only those certain people where things click - at least for me.
Glenn Frey,That's what I miss out of all this synthesized music - it starts to lose dynamics.
Glenn Frey,"Somebody asked my friend Bob Seger, Why do you think the Eagles broke up? He said, Hotel California."
Glenn Frey,"Some people, they just don't get a joke."
Glenn Frey,"Nobody told Don Henley or me that we were going to make it as solo artists, but I can speak for Don when I say that we are both really happy now that the band is not together."
Glenn Frey,My songs grow on people - like warts.
Glenn Frey,"It seems when I put together records, as Henley used to say, they're just like movies. They should have action, tension, love scenes, places to relax."
Glenn Frey,"If you get a chance to be in a film, that's great. One of my goals is to make a record as good as Don Henley's album, Building the Perfect Beast."
Glenn Frey,"If the Eagles were to get back together, it would have to be for the right reasons. I think it would look awful if it were just for the money."
Glenn Frey,"I've read somewhere that when you're writing, you should stop while you're doing well so you always want to go back to work."
Glenn Frey,"I'm just as insufferable and useless as every other dad is. The dynamic never changes, no matter what you do for a living."
Glenn Frey,I'm just a bleeping maniac in straight clothing. There's no reason to dress my monster up.
Glenn Frey,"I won't apologize for ticket prices. I think we're well worth it. We consider ourselves in the elite touring acts, like the Stones, Elton John, Paul McCartney."
Glenn Frey,I think musicians and artists are the most philanthropic people I know. Their charity record of the music business would hold up to the work of anybody.
Glenn Frey,"I think it would be nice to sell 15 million albums as a solo artist. I'd have to deal with all the repercussions of that, but that wouldn't be too bad."
Glenn Frey,I read the Life magazine articles about free love and free dope in California. At age 20 I drove to Los Angeles.
Glenn Frey,"Hey, I didn't make a big deal out of Hotel California. The 18 million people that bought it did."
Glenn Frey,"Hey, a woman changed her mind - what else is new?"
Glenn Frey,"Except for a few guitar chords, everything I've learned in my life that is of any value I've learned from women."
Glenn Frey,The last two years with the Eagles were pretty intense times. There was a lot of drinking and we were all getting high a lot. My parents were relieved when I got off the Eagles treadmill.
James Frey,Sometimes skulls are thick.Sometimes hearts are vacant.Sometimes words don't work.
James Frey,"Good words to be reminded of,"
James Frey,"With this merger, PacifiCare members will have the benefit of this technology years ahead of when we would have had it were to remain,"
James Frey,This program provides critical resources to new parents experiencing not only the joys but also the challenges of a new baby.
James Frey,I think I made a lot of mistakes in writing the book and promoting the book.
James Frey,"It finally validated, in his mind, that he had a story to be told."
James Frey,"Everyone's memory is subjective. If in three weeks we were both interviewed about what went on here tonight, we would both probably have very, very different stories."
James Frey,"I don't care what level you're on. To go from being the star to being the eighth, ninth man on the team, it's very humbling. But he's handled it very well. He's a very humble young man."
James Frey,"You've never been in love?Not even close.And no ones ever in love with you?Men always want to f**k me, but no one has ever loved me.I don't Believe that.It's True.I stare back.If it makes a difference, I' dont want to f*ck you.She laughs.Thanks.I think you're beautiful, but I wouldn't f*ck you because when we were done, i wouldnt want you to feel f*cked. I would try to make love to you, and I would probably be clumsy and awkward, but when it was over, I would want you to feel loved.She smiles.Thank you, James.I smile. Thank you,Lilly."
James Frey,"My mistake, and it is one I deeply regret, is writing about the person I created in my mind to help me cope, and not the person who went through the experience."
James Frey,"The first thing I said was, 'Oh my God,'"
James Frey,He's got a very good offensive game. He can make plays.
James Frey,"When one lives without fear, one cannot be broken."
James Frey,I think writing a book about this experience would be trying to capitalize on it in some way and that's not something I want to do at all.
James Frey,"So let the haters hate, let the doubters doubt, I stand by my book, and my life, and I won't dignify this bullshit with any sort of further response."
James Frey,"I was a bad guy. If I was gonna write a book that was true, and I was gonna write a book that was honest, then I was gonna have to write about myself in very, very negative ways."
Ford Frick,"Take pride in your work at all times. Remember, respect for an umpire is created off the field as well as on."
Ford Frick,"Review your work. You will find, if you are honest, that 90% of the trouble is traceable to loafing."
Ford Frick,"Never charge a player and, above all, no pointing your finger or yelling."
Ford Frick,Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound.
Ford Frick,Keep your eye on the ball.
Ford Frick,Keep all your personalities out of your work. Forget and forgive.
Ford Frick,Hear only the things you should hear - be deaf to others.
Ford Frick,Avoid sarcasm. Don't insist on the last word.
Ford Frick,I'd hate this to get out but I really like opera.
Nancy Friday,"When I stopped seeing my mother with the eyes of a child, I saw the woman who helped me give birth to myself."
Nancy Friday,The older I get the more of my mother I see in myself.
Nancy Friday,Inside every adult male is a denied little boy.
Nancy Friday,"To say something nice about yourself, this is the hardest thing in the world for people to do. They'd rather take their clothes off."
Nancy Friday,"Because society would rather we always wore a pretty face, women have been trained to cut off anger."
Nancy Friday,"When I stopped seeing my mother through the eyes of a child, I saw the woman who helped me give birth to myself."
Nancy Friday,Blaming mother is just a negative way of clinging to her still.
Nancy Friday,"The debt of gratitude we owe our mother and father goes forward, not backward. What we owe our parents is the bill presented to us by our children."
Daniel Fried,It is hard to imagine a free and fair election emerging from current circumstances.
Daniel Fried,"Whatever our differences, Europe, America and the nations of the Middle East must support Iraqis as they build their institutions of freedom. And those of us who are willing must stay by their side to provide security until Iraqis themselves can meet those needs."
Daniel Fried,"[No one outside the government seems to know.] Azerbaijan has made a state, which is no small achievement, ... But what sort?"
Edgar Friedenberg,"What we must decide is perhaps how we are valuable, rather than how valuable we are."
Edgar Friedenberg,"Not only do most people accept violence if it is perpetrated by legitimate authority, they also regard violence against certain kinds of people as inherently legitimate, no matter who commits it."
Edgar Friedenberg,"It takes a kind of shabby arrogance to survive in our time, and a fairly romantic nature to want to."
Edgar Friedenberg,An old man loved is winter with flowers.
Ralph Friedgen,"If we don't get more physical at the line of scrimmage, we're going to struggle running the ball. They're just starting to learn what it takes to really run the ball against a good defense."
Ralph Friedgen,"The running game wasn't there. If we could have run the ball, we would have won."
Ralph Friedgen,"I have a young team that I'm trying to bring along, not only for this game, but for the rest of the season. We tried to spend a couple of those days on areas we thought we could improve on."
Ralph Friedgen,A lot of it is good coaching and fundamentals. A little bit of it is luck.
Ralph Friedgen,It wasn't one of the better days in my life.
Ralph Friedgen,Obviously I would like to have more kids from the state. It's getting tougher because of the success we've had - there are more schools in here recruiting.
Ralph Friedgen,I think we had an excellent game plan and our kids executed it well. I thought we were very unpredictable.
Ralph Friedgen,We'll just have to see how much missing spring practice has hurt him. I think we've got to be careful. I'm anxious to see where he's at from a mental and physical standpoint.
Ralph Friedgen,"Do I have to? You really know how to hurt a guy, don't you? It wasn't one of the better days of my life."
Ralph Friedgen,"He struggled to make kicks from the 15-yard line at first. Through a lot of hard work in the weight room, he's really improved."
Ralph Friedgen,I think there's definitely some correlation to us winning those games.
Ralph Friedgen,"I don't think I have a lot of close friends in life, but I include coach Beamer as one of them. That relationship won't change. Business is business. I think we have enough respect for each other . . . we've all been through days like that. It's not fun for either one of us."
Ralph Friedgen,"They're a big, strong, fast, talented football team."
Ralph Friedgen,"[It's] just his presence. He's the leader on this football team, and having him there makes a difference."
Ralph Friedgen,"I expect him to be a great player and nothing less. When he doesn't live up to that expectation, I'm not a happy person. I'm not happy when he throws interceptions like he did today in the red zone. That has to stop if we're going to win. It doesn't matter how good he plays, if he keeps turning the ball over we're not going to win."
Ralph Friedgen,Our defense was on the field too long.
Ralph Friedgen,"Our defense was on the field too long, and they began to wear down as the game went on."
Ralph Friedgen,"I was really pleased with the way our defense responded. We had a very very good game against a very good rushing offense. And we got some turnovers, which isn't something we have been doing lately."
Ralph Friedgen,He's got to make better decisions.
Ralph Friedgen,"Frank probably gave the team off. If I had the third-ranked team in the country, I might do the same thing."
Ralph Friedgen,I'm hoping this gives us the confidence we need to get better.
Ralph Friedgen,"I think this class filled some needs. We got some tall, athletic receivers and four big, strong corners. Hopefully, some of those guys can help us right away."
Ralph Friedgen,"I think we played hard and we had the opportunities, but we didn't take advantage of them. When we had the ball with good field position after turning them over, we weren't able to come away with any points. That was really the difference in the game."
Ralph Friedgen,"I think we played hard and had the opportunities, but we didn't take advantage of them."
Ralph Friedgen,I've seen him run with close to the same ability he had before the injury.
Robert Friedland,"Not too long ago, people, particularly men, worked until they were physically unable to work. Now, people have a period of time to which they are looking forward."
Robert Friedland,Our ongoing work with Air Products and the South Coast Air Quality Management District continues to show how electrolysis technology can work in real world vehicle fueling applications. We are helping to demonstrate how using hydrogen as a motor fuel is becoming more and more practical for our nation's transportation needs.
Robert Friedland,"If you leave the labor force thinking you have plenty, and then realize that you don't, then you are stuck."
Robert Friedland,"In President Reagan's case, it's possible that the disease would have had an earlier onset if he had not had such an active lifestyle,"
Robert Friedland,"We found that patients with Alzheimer's disease had lower levels of physical activity earlier in life,"
Andrew Friedman,"It doesn't make sense for us to make a trade unless we get a piece or two back to add to our collection of young talent. If we don't get that piece or two, it behooves us to keep the momentum we built in the second half with our young players and build off that."
Andrew Friedman,He's a tremendous talent and I would never bet against him.
Andrew Friedman,We're getting really close to obtaining the support we need.
Andrew Friedman,We are very committed to helping his assimilation to the American society. We feel that the less of that stuff he can worry about the more he can concentrate on his pitching. We're trying to put him in the best position to succeed at the major-league level.
Andrew Friedman,"Convoys are the scariest and most high-risk activity a soldier can participate in. You never know when there is going to be a bomb alongside you or even under your vehicle, ... Also, the guns used in combat in Iraq don't create the kind of wounds a street gun might in America. These guns fire at a much higher velocity, creating a lot more damage."
Andrew Friedman,"He's been invaluable in our discussions and our planning going forward, and the working relationship has been outstanding."
Andrew Friedman,"We think that we're going to become intimately involved with the arbitration process given the nature of how young our roster is. The intent of the hearing is to solve differences that can't be resolved through negotiations. It's not ideal for the team or the player, but sometimes it's necessary."
Andrew Friedman,"With hamstring injuries, it's hard to predict. We talked to Rocco this morning and what we said is, 'Let's not set a firm date. Let's do it when you feel good.' We don't want him to keep targeting some specific date."
Andrew Friedman,We'll continue talks with [them]. This doesn't necessarily shut the door on their future with the Rays.
Andrew Friedman,"It's better to go with one closer. But you can't force the situation one way or the other. It all depends on your personnel. Looking at our bullpen, it appears that we have a deeper, more diversified bullpen this year."
Andrew Friedman,"We're trying to create a competitive environment in spring training. We think Russ adds to that. We're excited to get him into camp, and we'll see how it develops."
Andrew Friedman,"It's hard to say. I think we've created a competitive environment, and we'll go into camp and see who can help us win the most games."
Andrew Friedman,We're obviously trying to create a competitive environment. We'll continue to explore moves that make sense for us now and going forward.
Andrew Friedman,We're confident we'll see him pitch in a Devil Rays uniform.
Andrew Friedman,"We think this transaction addresses our desire to add starting pitching depth to our organization. We're going to be patient with the development of (Jackson and Tiffany). Both of them are quality arms that we've identified and talked about for a while now. As far as assignments, we'll get them into camp and let them compete, and see what's the best place to continue their development. It's a little early for us to comment on that."
Andrew Friedman,Basically his desire now is to make the best of the rest of his life.
Andrew Friedman,We think this transaction addresses our desire to add starting pitching depth to our organization.
Andrew Friedman,Decisions have not been made.
Andrew Friedman,"People forget how young he is. Had he gone to college, he would have been drafted last June and played for only three months. He's healthy and he has the arsenal. We are confident."
Kinky Friedman,We'll be on the ballot. I think the soul of Texas is riding on this campaign.
Kinky Friedman,Every 150 years we have a revolution in Texas and this is it.
Kinky Friedman,I'd felt that a man without a woman was like a neck without a pain
Kinky Friedman,"Many of us feel that the soul of Texas may be riding on this campaign. I would dearly love to be number one in something other than executions, toll roads and property tax."
Kinky Friedman,"If you elect me the first Jewish justice of the peace, I'll reduce the speed limits to 54.95!"
Kinky Friedman,"I've always said that this campaign is running on the coin of the spirit. I've also said a journey of a thousand miles begins with a cash advance. This spiritual journey to the Governor's mansion is a long one, and we are going to need some help."
Kinky Friedman,"This is a true moment in history. When we get on the ballot, we'll be making history."
Kinky Friedman,"She has a lot of money, I think. We don't. Of course, the governor does. We have a government of the money, by the money and for the money. ... That's not the American dream."
Kinky Friedman,"Whatever we're going to do, we're going to make it fun."
Kinky Friedman,Jesse is a virtual gold mine of information. He's been through the fire. He knows what works and doesn't work.
Kinky Friedman,The good teachers are bailing out. Education is very important ... this should be the centerpiece on the table of Texas.
Kinky Friedman,"But believe me, we can win this thing with a big turnout. And Rick Perry knows it. That's what the Jesse Ventura guys are telling us."
Kinky Friedman,Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder
Kinky Friedman,You struggle with your demons and you conquer them.
Kinky Friedman,"William Bennett is my patron saint, one of them. Redd Foxx is another."
Kinky Friedman,When I'm governor... I'll be the first governor with a listed telephone number.
Kinky Friedman,"We've got to clear some of the room out of the prisons so we can put the bad guys in there, like the pedophiles and the politicians."
Kinky Friedman,"We're first on executions. We're 49th in funding public education. We're in a race with Mississippi for the bottom, and we're winning."
Kinky Friedman,We were a country band with a social conscience.
Kinky Friedman,"These days, there are many people around the world who listen to the songs that made me infamous and read the books that made me respectable."
Kinky Friedman,"The teachers are getting screwed, blued, and tattooed by the system."
Kinky Friedman,The only currency I value is the coin of the spirit. That's very important in my life.
Kinky Friedman,Remember: Y'all is singular. All y'all is plural. All y'all's is plural possessive.
Kinky Friedman,"No, nothing has changed in my life at all, and nothing would change if I had millions."
Kinky Friedman,"Musicians can run this state better than politicians. We won't get a lot done in the mornings, but we'll work late and be honest."
Kinky Friedman,May the God of your choice bless and keep you. I respect Him as long as He does not circumcise me anymore.
Kinky Friedman,"I've always said money may buy you a fine dog, but only love can make it wag its tail."
Kinky Friedman,I'm too young for Medicare and too old for women to care.
Kinky Friedman,I'll tell you right now. I'm for prayer in school.
Kinky Friedman,I'll sign anything except bad legislation.
Kinky Friedman,"I see an issue I like, and I support it."
Kinky Friedman,I have a better head of hair than Rick Perry; it's just not in a place I can show you.
Kinky Friedman,I don't remember the first half of my life. All I say is a happy childhood is the worst possible preparation for life.
Kinky Friedman,"I admit to drinking it, but I did not swallow."
Kinky Friedman,I admit I was drinking a Guinness... but I did not swallow.
Kinky Friedman,Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder.
Kinky Friedman,The first thing I'll do if elected is demand a recount.
Kinky Friedman,"If you ain't Texan, I ain't got time for you."
Kinky Friedman,Young people are the key to this election.
Kinky Friedman,How can you look at the Texas legislature and still believe in intelligent design?
Kinky Friedman,A happy childhood... is the worst possible preparation for life.
Kinky Friedman,Students don't know who Mark Twain was because he wasn't on the test.
Kinky Friedman,"The folks in Mississippi are saying, 'Thank God for Texas.'"
Kinky Friedman,We've had to be creative to get on the ballot.
Kinky Friedman,"If Willie Nelson had been Rosa Parks, there never would have been a civil rights movement in this country, because he refuses to leave the back of the bus."
Kinky Friedman,"I just want Texas to be number one in something other than executions, toll roads and property taxes."
Kinky Friedman,You have to pretend that your life is a financial pleasure even when your autographs are bouncing.
Kinky Friedman,This is a bad idea. It's like having Dubai run the ports of America. It means we'll be paying tolls to a cowardly Spanish company for 70 years.
Kinky Friedman,"People are drooling for the truth. They want honesty from politicians, and they're not getting it."
Kinky Friedman,"Money can buy you a fine dog, but only love can make him wag his tail."
Mark Friedman,It's certainly overkill. But I have to admit the last three months of sales have been phenomenal.
Mark Friedman,"My practice is limited to jaw disorders, ... so as a result I poked around a lot and I found tenderness occurred often, and when I looked at the history, these were always headache patients."
Mark Friedman,"I fell in love with the buildings, which looking at them in their current condition, might be hard to believe, ... They have character that I couldn't reproduce or fake, and I think I can turn it into something that will be interesting and fun."
Mark Friedman,"If the only way we judged hunger was how full the stomach is, no one would ever have dessert."
Mark Friedman,"They're trying to add more of a faster fashion turn so the store has more freshness to it, ... Certainly the size of the brand is definitely more mature than its competitors out there, but the Gap management team works hard to try and find ways to reinvigorate the brand."
Mark Friedman,"They're trying to add more of a faster fashion turn so the store has more freshness to it. Certainly the size of the brand is definitely more mature than its competitors out there, but the Gap management team works hard to try and find ways to reinvigorate the brand."
Mark Friedman,We believe the increased promotional environment will continue to cause concerns about earnings strength in the quarter.
Mark Friedman,"What is impacting the consumer is the cooler weather in several key regions, the increasing energy costs which take cash flow from the mall to the tank and a lack of exciting new fashion, ... We would also point out that a flattish market performance and news of layoffs are probably in the back of consumers' minds and causing a tightening of purse strings."
Mark Friedman,"What is ailing Abercrombie? Is it Hollister cannibalization? Is it competition? Is it saturation? We believe it is a combination of all of these things,"
Mark Friedman,What is ailing Abercrombie? Is it Hollister cannibalization? Is it competition? Is it saturation? We believe it is a combination of all of these things.
Mark Friedman,"I think the company went through an aggressive analysis of where they needed to be on staffing, and the final tally was little bit lower,"
Mark Friedman,"I think the company went through an aggressive analysis of where they needed to be on staffing, and the final tally was little bit lower."
Milton Friedman,"So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear. That there is no alternative way, so far discovered, of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system."
Milton Friedman,"[Minimum Wage. In] Free to Choose, ... . . . the minimum wage law to be one of the most, if not the most anti-black law on the statute books."
Milton Friedman,The only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of prediction with experience
Milton Friedman,"If, for example, existing government intervention is minor, we shall attach a smaller weight to the negative effect of additional government intervention. This is an important reason why many earlier liberals, like Henry Simons, writing at a time when government was small by today's standards, were willing to have government undertake activities that today's liberals would not accept now that government has become so overgrown."
Milton Friedman,Universities exist to transmit knowledge and understanding of ideas and values to students ... not to provide entertainment for spectators or employment for athletes.
Milton Friedman,The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit.
Milton Friedman,Many people want the government to protect the consumer. A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.
Milton Friedman,A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.
Milton Friedman,The power to do good is also the power to do harm.
Milton Friedman,"Every friend of freedom must be as revolted as I am by the prospect of turning the United States into an armed camp, by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence."
Milton Friedman,Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good intentions of those who create it.
Milton Friedman,"I strongly urge the voters of Colorado to reject Referendum C, or any action that would suspend Colorado's Taxpayers Bill of Rights. I strongly favor the continued and uninterrupted use of TABOR, including it's so called ratchet mechanism. The ratchet is one of the best features of TABOR. It is the only thing that will reduce out-of-control government spending."
Milton Friedman,We have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes nonwork.
Milton Friedman,The government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem.
Milton Friedman,Inflation is taxation without legislation.
Milton Friedman,"I am favor of cutting taxes under any circumstances and for any excuse, for any reason, whenever it's possible."
Richard Friedman,He was a good kid. I never had any problems with him. He wasn't aggressive at all.
Richard Friedman,"I think if the president picked two Anglo-Saxon men, he would lose the potential of some support. If he picks a Latino, there are clearly going to be some people who may be ideologically predisposed against that nominee who are going to be turned around by the prospect for the first Hispanic chief justice."
Richard Friedman,"The sheer number of things making us feel remorseful is so great that if we don't seek forgiveness, we could end up psychologically disabled. So people go around asking to be forgiven just so that they don't continue to go on suffering. But often its too facile."
Stephen Friedman,"We're in a society where an awful lot of the institutions we have were built for a different era, an era where we had 16 workers for every retiree."
Stephen Friedman,"Just a few years after he would have graduated, Kanye West is at the epicenter of new music, at the top of his game as an artist and producer,  ... Who better than Kanye to inspire and educate the next generation of student talent."
Stephen Friedman,"I'm not sure this does terribly much except discredit the politicians in the eyes of the voting public. It has created a great deal of public fuss, but at the end of the day not much has really changed."
Stephen Friedman,"What we want to focus on long-term is how to make America the most productive economy in the world. That's what lifts income, enables workers to be paid more and makes foreign investors want to invest here."
Anna Friel,"Going back to the stage to do Lulu was really terrifying as it was such a hard part,"
Anna Friel,"You can see when an actor gets bored: Their eyes go dead. I promised myself I'd never let that happen. If it does, I'll go and live on a desert island for a year."
Anna Friel,"Well it's hard to bracket it like that because everyone always thinks you either go to America and you come back, fail or succeed, but it doesn't work like that."
Anna Friel,"Well ironically my last three roles have all been a mother. One was a Canadian film where the baby was taken away because she is a drug addict, in Irish Jam I play a mother to a four year old. I think in the future I'll be able to handle the role with a lot more depth."
Anna Friel,"We will spend more time in America, we're going to get a place in LA as hotels aren't great for the baby."
Anna Friel,"People became more interested in my love life than in me, and that has a certain effect. You start to feel very empty and worth nothing, you start to become a piece in a board game you never wanted to play."
Anna Friel,"Onstage, there's no hiding; you either can or can't act. There's no second take."
Anna Friel,"Now learning a bit more about footballers I think what they need to do well, is someone who really wants to stay in the background and just be a strong support."
Anna Friel,"Last month I spent six months in New York working with Barry Levinson but I didn't want to stay there, I could have but I wanted to come home."
Anna Friel,It's really important to draw the line on what we do as actors.
Anna Friel,"It's placing your words carefully, and keeping everything nice, kind of hidden behind a smile. People don't want to see your insecurities here."
Anna Friel,"I've only just started to think that I can make a career out of this. At the end of my time in Brookside, I wondered if I'd ever work again."
Anna Friel,I've never been to a live match but now having made this film I'm going to - I'm going to Real Madrid so it'll be done with a bang!
Anna Friel,I've never been onstage in my life.
Anna Friel,I've been onstage once for one performance with four days' rehearsal.
Anna Friel,I've always chosen incredibly different roles and things that are quite offbeat. That way you're not limited.
Anna Friel,I want more children but for the next three years I want to act.
Anna Friel,"I play a character every day of my life, and I don't want to play a character as myself. They can judge me as an actress, not as a person. I'm not a spokeswoman for Anna."
Anna Friel,I look at being an actress as being like a mummy: You're bandaged up and preserved as soon as you start making other people money.
Anna Friel,"I have the most lovely, healthy bouncing baby, she was all very compact and the right size."
Anna Friel,"I also like the fact that the character isn't a typical footballer's wife, she doesn't need the bling and being at the forefront of everything."
Anna Friel,"For me personally, everything is on a kiss."
Anna Friel,"For Closer, we've had five weeks. You go into every single word because it's very, very concentrated dialogue."
Anna Friel,David is 13 years my senior and has much more experience.
Anna Friel,"Being a mother gives you an incredible feeling of empowerment, you think if I can go through such pain and that level of sleep and still operate and not be grumpy you can do anything. It can be quite scary, you can't function your brain, forget your vocabulary."
Anna Friel,As long as she is talented enough and passionate about doing it herself then I will be happy and support her. I think I will be sensible - my parents said I could only do it if I got my education and so I had something to fall back on.
Anna Friel,"It's fantastic, she's so cute, ... And David and I have talked about what roles to take so that one of us is always with her. It's great to be breastfeeding at the moment because I can take her anywhere. She's very portable - and very portly. She loves her grub - like her mum!"
Ellen Frohnmayer,How do you get parents to pay for their child to come study in a city that was so badly damaged?
Ellen Frohnmayer,"By the end of our time here, saying goodbye, Lynn and I were clinging together, crying. It was a horrible thing that happened, this hurricane, but something good came out of it. We got to spend time with a near-and-dear family."
Ellen Frohnmayer,"The predominant emotion here, I think, is one of great sadness. The city is never going to be the same."
David Frost,"Well, people would be put off by his appearance."
David Frost,Without supporting action by the Bank of England and the Chancellor there is danger of renewed relapse.
David Frost,We are disappointed that the MPC felt unable to take action to counter the adverse pressures affecting the economy.
David Frost,"This whole area is a potential legal minefield, with employers being left open to the risk of court action over an employee's skin condition, regardless of whether the condition developed from sun exposure at work or during personal time."
David Frost,"Don't aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally."
David Frost,Love is staying up all night with a sick child - or a healthy adult.
Robert Frost,Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper.
Robert Frost,I often say of George Washington that he was one of the few in the whole history of the world who was not carried away by power.
Robert Frost,I always entertain great hopes.
Robert Frost,"The world is full of willing people; some willing to work, the rest willing to let them."

Margaret Fuller,We need to hear the excuses men make to themselves for their worthlessness.
Margaret Fuller,"The use of criticism, in periodical writing, is to sift, not to stamp a work."
Margaret Fuller,"It seems that it is madder never to abandon one's self than often to be infatuated; better to be wounded, a captive and a slave, than always to walk in armor."
Margaret Fuller,"Drudgery is as necessary to call out the treasures of the mind, as harrowing and planting those of the earth."

Margaret Fuller,"Male and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism. But in fact they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman."
Margaret Fuller,"The character and history of each child may be a new and poetic experience to the parent, if he will let it."
Margaret Fuller,A house is no home unless it contain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body.
Margaret Fuller,"It should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better understood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in behalf of women. As men become aware that few have had a fair chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance."
Margaret Fuller,Two persons love in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold.
Margaret Fuller,"Essays, entitled critical, are epistles addressed to the public, through which the mind of the recluse relieves itself of its impressions."
Margaret Fuller,"Very early, I knew that the only object in life was to grow."
Margaret Fuller,"It does not follow because many books are written by persons born in America that there exists an American literature. Books which imitate or represent the thoughts and life of Europe do not constitute an American literature. Before such can exist, an original idea must animate this nation and fresh currents of life must call into life fresh thoughts along the shore."
Margaret Fuller,"I now know all the people worth knowing in America, and I find no intellect comparable to my own"
Margaret Fuller,"It is not because the touch of genius has roused genius to production, but because the admiration of genius has made talent ambitious, that the harvest is still so abundant."

Phillip Fulmer,I think we've done everything we can to make this work.
Phillip Fulmer,"Really, it feels like (Cutcliffe) has never been gone. We have great trust as a staff, and we're improving our effort and our execution."
Phillip Fulmer,"I'm not going to make excuses, but I do feel we have the talent to be a very good offense. There are just a couple of areas where we have to do things better."
Phillip Fulmer,"Offensively, it's a struggle to get any kind of continuity. We're not nearly where we need to be offensively, to say the least."
Phillip Fulmer,"I told them to be careful, behave themselves and go by and see their (high school) coaches while they are home. And don't come back sunburned."
Phillip Fulmer,"You know, those guys all rode school buses, those Bluebird school buses to the game when they were in high school and played, ... They got off the bus, put on the pads and played. Maybe we're making too big a deal out of it."
Phillip Fulmer,"One of the things I pride myself on is being resilient,"
Phillip Fulmer,Ideally. Ideally you'd like to know at all the positions. I'd like to come out of spring practice with an established starter.
Phillip Fulmer,"Jerod is a guy that you'll see out here working by himself for 10, 15 minutes after practice. He's out there working to get better, and it's paying off for us and him."
Phillip Fulmer,So it's like Auburn and Georgia last year. That's the exact kind of performance we're going to need and we're going to look for.
Phillip Fulmer,"I don't remember this many mistakes in a single game,"
Phillip Fulmer,"It's a mind-set, and truly each team and each game stands on its own. It takes a certain amount of really outstanding leadership and maturity on the team. I think we have that. We'll find out a lot about ourselves this week and next. This is a tremendous challenge."
Phillip Fulmer,"Randy has dedicated his adult life to this program,"
Phillip Fulmer,"I don't know that we've done anybody justice as to where we're going, but with what we've got, we've done the best that we can."
Phillip Fulmer,Their quarterback played outstanding. I hugged his neck after the game.
Phillip Fulmer,"Monday night football, they've been watching that since they've been watching football, ... Some people will choose instead of the pro game, they'll flip over to our game, so really we've got the attention of the nation to see what we're doing."
Phillip Fulmer,"Getting done what he got done, coming back here to win this football game at a place where he had been, I don't know if there is a better story in the world than what this guy has done."
Phillip Fulmer,"First of all, I'd like to congratulate Coach Weis and the Notre Dame football team. They did a heck of a job this evening. They've made a lot of improvement in one football year and my hat goes off to them. I thought our team battled. When we got it back to 21-21, I thought we had us a football game. Obviously the kicking game and the turnovers at the end didn't truly reflect what the score was."
Phillip Fulmer,"That's not what we expect as a football team. What you saw out there was unacceptable. We're going to go back to work next week and get it turned around. It seems like we can't make a play. It starts with me, goes through the staff and then through the players and everybody associated with Tennessee football."
Phillip Fulmer,He's as dominating a football player as we've had when he's playing at his best.
Phillip Fulmer,"Obviously we're disappointed with the results of the last game, ... But as I told our football team, there's still much to play for, our pride and respect. Who knows what's going to happen down the road with the conference race and everything."
Phillip Fulmer,"I am so thrilled with this win. I can't tell you how proud I am of this football team and this staff, and the fight they had. There was absolutely no panic at halftime."
Phillip Fulmer,That is certainly no reflection on Rick because he can help our football team win.
Phillip Fulmer,"Unacceptable. It starts with me, goes through the staff and then through the players and everybody associated with Tennessee football."
Phillip Fulmer,"I would like to be a balanced football team, ... I would like to rush the ball well. I know how much better it is on everybody when you can rush the football."
Phillip Fulmer,Shockley is just a really great football player. I hated to see him come in the game when he came in (off the bench) before when he was playing sparingly. Now we're going to have to face him every play.
Phillip Fulmer,"This year was a disappointing season for everyone in the Tennessee family,"
Phillip Fulmer,"Our defense has played consistently,"
Phillip Fulmer,"I think Rick Clausen is absolutely one of the greatest stories in college football last year and he brings leadership, a calm demeanor, an intellect of knowing our offense and using the personnel around him very effectively, ... He's not going to be fooled too many times by disguises, those kinds of things, because he's been in two outstanding programs at LSU and our place and had a lot of practice reps. And he has enough ability to get the ball out to where he wants to get it out to."
Phillip Fulmer,They are very special. I don't know of any college program now with the numbers as they are that could do without them. Occasionally you have a youngster come up and earn a scholarship and really contribute to your football team. They are special.
Phillip Fulmer,"This has been an extremely difficult season for everyone, especially Coach Sanders. I want it to be understood that by no means (are) the results of the season any one person's fault."
Phillip Fulmer,I was miserable during Christmas. I haven't had that as a head coach. I probably made everybody around me miserable.
Phillip Fulmer,You can't blame this on one person. Everybody wants to say it's this person or that person. It's a combination of a lot of things and some you can fix hopefully in the short term and some it may take longer to get fixed.
Phillip Fulmer,There is a sense of anxiety to hurry up and get started and get back on track.
Inez Fung,"I'm excited about this project because it ties in all the pieces of knowledge about water into one package. It's not that we don't know anything about water-we just have a lot of bits and pieces of information on it. We have no observations to tell us what's right or wrong, but hopefully this project will change that and have an impact globally."
Inez Fung,"I'm not a policy maker, but I think my research could influence policy decisions, and personal decisions, about the kind of future we want."

Allen Funt,When people are smiling they are most receptive to almost anything you want to teach them.
Allen Funt,"I learned the power of radio watching Eleanor Roosevelt do her show. I used to go up to Hyde Park and hold her papers. I was just a messenger, but it planted the bug of radio in me."

Edward Furlong,I have a little brother. He's actually living at my house right now. He's going to be 18.
Edward Furlong,"I'm a real lazy, slow kind of person."
Edward Furlong,My biggest fear was the I'd be a one-time guy.
Edward Furlong,A lot of people my age are so hyper. I like hyper people.
Edward Furlong,There's the art house movies and the action movies and the chick films. I think the same thing's happening with actors.
Edward Furlong,I don't think anyone has a normal family.
Nelly Furtado,I say it's a girls' world.
Nelly Furtado,"I remember really bonding with the first generation kids, the Chinese Canadian kids, and in high school bonding with the Latin kids and the East Indian kids. It was very interesting because it made me open to lots of musical sounds."
Nelly Furtado,"Because of my Portuguese heritage, I have an interest in all of the instrumentation that comes from Portugal and Brazil as well."
Jim Furyk,"She's got a great talent. I can't think of a 16-year-old girl who can hit it like that. I'll go beyond that. I don't know too many 16-year-old boys that can go out there and play in a tour event, have that much composure, hit the ball that well. She's definitely one in a million, or one in a billion. That's going to attract attention."
Jim Furyk,"Strength of field tends to be important to me, too. Everything else, purses or extra perks or a particular town, those things are not really an issue for me."
Jim Furyk,"Do I wish I was longer? Sure. I'll get longer, but everybody else will, too. It was a power game last year, and I finished fourth on the money list, so it can be done."
Jim Furyk,"He's not going to lose his job, ... Come on. Everybody makes mistakes."
Jim Furyk,"You can take it high in the air and have it land really soft. The ball will stop easier on the green, instead of having it hit and roll off the back of the green, which is what happens with long irons."
Jim Furyk,"I understand that it's your job to report,"
Jim Furyk,"Aggressive golf. I felt like I played relatively aggressive. But you have to pick and choose your spots around this golf course. You can't go out there firing at the flag, because there's a lot of places it will jump up and bite you. ."
Jim Furyk,"Whoever goes out there and fires the best score has the opportunity to win the golf tournament. I know that not only with Aaron there, but some good players at 11 under and 10 under, I have to play well."
Jim Furyk,"Coming here, I felt okay about my golf game but I wouldn't say I felt great about it."
Jim Furyk,"The golf course was definitely tougher the first few days, even though it was longer after the rain. The greens were relatively soft, a little slower, and you could attack more pins. You had a chance to be aggressive."
Jim Furyk,"When this golf course plays firm and fast, I don't think length is an issue for the average guys. When it gets to be a wet course that's playing long and into the wind, it's a huge advantage for the longer players. They're going to have a big distance advantage. On a course that's 7,450 [yards], that's a huge advantage."
Jim Furyk,"When this golf course plays firm and fast, I don't think that length is an issue for most of the field. When it gets wet and soft, I think it's a huge advantage for the longer players. They're not going to get to some of those tighter areas off the tee. They'll have a big distance advantage. We'll see how well it dries up and drains overnight."
Jim Furyk,If you force it and try and make those things happen. I think that's when the course jumps up and bites you.
Jim Furyk,I think he just lost concentration.
Jim Furyk,"I think playing the Mercedes last week in all that wind is a little bit of a benefit for me to come over. The golf courses are totally different, but you still have to hit those low, piercing shots and you have to be able to work the ball into the wind."
Jim Furyk,"There (are) some positives and negatives (to playing at home). You get to sleep in your own bed, but you might have more responsibilities... . Your family is right there and you've got all those people rooting for you and supporting you."
Jim Furyk,"They tend to give themselves more opportunities, both players, because of their dominating length, good ball-striking ability. And as good as they are, they have more opportunities than most players."
Rob Fyfe,"Selection of the staff travel system was crucial since it would be one of the few applications to be used by every single employee of the airline around the globe. We are impressed with the high level of professionalism, knowledge and adaptability of IBS."
Rob Fyfe,"The issue for me is making sure whoever chooses to fly here actually, genuinely comes here to support our national interests."
Rob Fyfe,I'm certainly very excited and very proud to be given this opportunity.
Rob Fyfe,If we can't make money on the Tasman something has to give. We have to reduce services or withdraw. We can't just sit in a market losing money for ever.
