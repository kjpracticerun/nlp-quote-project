Jay Haas,"I'm a little surprised, to tell you the truth. I hadn't been playing that well lately."
Jay Haas,"I think Curtis is finally getting his drive back, his passion for the game, ... I think he's starting to enjoy that competition again. That's what drives us all out here that feeling of being able to hit a good shot in a tough situation."
Jay Haas,"I wasn't flawless out there, ... I was just fortunate that Dana made a couple of mistakes and paid for them."
Jay Haas,"All of us feel he can do whatever he wants, ... He can play no events; he can play every event. We all love to see him. We owe so much to him. I guess I don't think, 'This could be the last time Arnold Palmer plays golf,' because I don't think that's all Arnold is about. I don't think he's just about golf. He's Arnold Palmer. He's a great man."
Jay Haas,"I think I lost my golf energy. You can't come out here and go through the motions. These guys are too good. I guess I'm at a crossroads. Right now, I would say I'll play more on the Champions Tour. But if I start to play a little better at the end of the year ... I still like to do this."
Richard Haass,"I do think there's been progress in some areas. In the last four years, for example, I think the world has become a tougher place for terrorists to operate in."
Richard Haass,The biggest thing these appointments tell you about the direction of U.S. foreign policy is that there is no direction.
Richard Haass,The most dangerous delusion is that a conflict would be either small or quick.
James Hacker,"I think at this point we're waiting for the National Transportation Safety Board report. After that, there's an issue I think regarding the pump on the boat. That may lead to additional defendants."
James Hacker,The government has to update its regulations.

Marilyn Hacker,"When I edited Thirteenth Moon, a feminist literary magazine, I basically supported it myself with an essential grant here and there."
Marilyn Hacker,"We sometimes received - and I would read - 200 manuscripts a week. Some of them were wonderful, some were terrible; most were mediocre. It was like the gifts of the good and bad fairies."
Marilyn Hacker,Various on-line discussion groups are ways to find out about books and writers that one might have remained ignorant of otherwise.
Marilyn Hacker,Translation is an interestingly different way to be involved both with poetry and with the language that I've found myself living in much of the time. I think the two feed each other.
Marilyn Hacker,There is something very satisfactory about being in the middle of something.

Marilyn Hacker,"Given the devaluation of literature and of the study of foreign languages per se in the United States, as well as the preponderance of theory over text in graduate literature studies, creative writing programs keep literature courses populated."
Marilyn Hacker,"Community means people spending time together here, and I don't think there's really that."
Marilyn Hacker,"Clearly, once the student is no longer a student the possibilities of relationship are enlarged."
Marilyn Hacker,Everyone thinks they're going to write one book of poems or one novel.

Buddy Hackett,I've had a good day when I don't fall out of the cart.

Buddy Hackett,As a child my family's menu consisted of two choices: take it or leave it.
David Hackworth,Writing with you is the only thing that keeps me alive.
David Hackworth,That's what supporting the troops is really all about - making sure American grunts get the right stuff!
David Hackworth,"Our generals talk a good game about taking care of their grunts, and the majority of our Beltway politicians bay with moralistic fervor about how they, too, support the troops."
David Hackworth,"Of course, it's imperative that we stabilize Iraq and quickly reduce our armed role there."
David Hackworth,It's human nature to start taking things for granted again when danger isn't banging loudly on the door.

David Hackworth,"If a policy is wrongheaded, feckless and corrupt, I take it personally and consider it a moral obligation to sound off and not shut up until it's fixed."
David Hackworth,"Grunts on the line, where the enemy wants them dead, still goof off - even knowing that by letting their guard down they might die."
David Hackworth,"Fortunately, it's still not too late to develop a comprehensive global strategy to eliminate our real enemy."

Mark Haddon,"Most adults, unlike most children, understand the difference between a book that will hold them spellbound for a rainy Sunday afternoon and a book that will put them in touch with a part of themselves they didn't even know existed."
Mark Haddon,Young readers have to be entertained. No child reads fiction because they think it's going to make them a better person.
Mark Haddon,"Writing for children is bloody difficult; books for children are as complex as their adult counterparts, and they should therefore be accorded the same respect."
Mark Haddon,"When I was writing for children, I was writing genre fiction. It was like making a good chair. It needed four legs of the same length, it had to be the right height and it had to be comfortable."
Mark Haddon,"Use your imagination, and you'll see that even the most narrow, humdrum lives are infinite in scope if you examine them with enough care."
Mark Haddon,There's something with the physical size of America... American writers can write about America and it can still feel like a foreign country.
Mark Haddon,The one thing you have to do if you write a book is put yourself in someone else's shoes. The reader's shoes. You've got to entertain them.
Mark Haddon,"That's important to me, to find the extraordinary inside the ordinary."
Mark Haddon,Reading is a conversation. All books talk. But a good book listens as well.
Mark Haddon,"No one wants to know how clever you are. They don't want an insight into your mind, thrilling as it might be. They want an insight into their own."
Mark Haddon,"My book has a very simple surface, but there are layers of irony and paradox all the way through it."
Mark Haddon,Most of my work consisted of crossing out. Crossing out was the secret of all good writing.
Mark Haddon,Many children's writers don't have children of their own.
Mark Haddon,Jane Austen was writing about boring people with desperately limited lives. We forget this because we've seen too many of her books on screen.
Mark Haddon,"If you enjoy math and you write novels, it's very rare that you'll get a chance to put your math into a novel. I leapt at the chance."
Mark Haddon,"If one book's done this well, you want to write another one that does just as well. There's that horror of the second novel that doesn't match up."
Mark Haddon,"If kids like a picture book, they're going to read it at least 50 times. Read anything that often, and even minor imperfections start to feel like gravel in the bed."
Mark Haddon,I've written 16 children's books and five unpublished novels. Some of the latter were breathtakingly bad.
Mark Haddon,I've worked in television long enough to know that when you stop enjoying that type of thing you go home and do something else.
Mark Haddon,I was born too late for steam trains and a lazy eye meant I'd never be an astronaut.
Mark Haddon,I think the U.K. is too small to write about from within it and still make it seem foreign and exotic and interesting.
Mark Haddon,"I think most writers feel like they're on the outside looking in much of the time. All of us feel, to a certain extent, alienated from the stuff going on around us."
Mark Haddon,"I started writing books for children because I could illustrate them myself and because, in my innocence, I thought they'd be easier."
Mark Haddon,"I don't mean that literary fiction is better than genre fiction, On the contrary; novels can perform two functions and most perform only one."
Mark Haddon,"I better make the plot good. I wanted to make it grip people on the first page and have a big turning point in the middle, as there is, and construct the whole thing like a roller coaster ride."
Mark Haddon,"From a good book, I want to be taken to the very edge. I want a glimpse into that outer darkness."
Mark Haddon,"For me, disability is a way of getting some extremity, some kind of very difficult situation, that throws an interesting light on people."
Mark Haddon,"Every life is narrow. Our only escape is not to run away, but to learn to love the people we are and the world in which we find ourselves."
Mark Haddon,"Children simply don't make the distinction; a book is either good or bad. And some of the books they think are good are very, very bad indeed."
Mark Haddon,"Bore children, and they stop reading. There's no room for self-indulgence or showing off or setting the scene."
Mark Haddon,B is for bestseller.
Mark Haddon,"At 20, 25, 30, we begin to realise that the possibilities of escape are getting fewer. We have jobs, children, partners, debts. This is the part of us to which literary fiction speaks."
Mark Haddon,"As a kid, I didn't read a great deal of fiction, and I've forgotten most of what I did read."
Mark Haddon,Science and literature give me answers. And they ask me questions I will never be able to answer.
Pat Haden,"He is so efficient. He seems to be playing smarter, more confidently. I think they have given him more responsibility. He's very, very accurate and doesn't make many mistakes. The statistics show he has three interceptions, but in reality it's only one. The others were deflected passes by receivers who should have caught balls."
Pat Haden,"He's a tough New Jersey guy. Those words mean something to him and people around him. By his force of will he has these guys playing much smarter. They are making fewer mistakes. And the offense has been completely different from a year ago with basically the same personnel. All of a sudden, guys who were invisible a year ago are making incredible plays."
Pat Haden,"This is one of the great intersectional rivalries in college football, and for the first time in quite some time it's a game of national significance, ... I expect a very high-scoring game with three or four plays making the difference."

Pat Haden,"Somebody told me USC had dropped and I didn't believe them, ... How can you be the No. 1 team in the country, win five road games, three against ranked opponents, and lose ground? How does that happen?"
Stephen Hadley,The violence seems to be diminishing. They've stared into the abyss a bit. I think they've all concluded that further violence . . . is not in their interests.
Stephen Hadley,The violence seems to be diminishing.
Stephen Hadley,Next week the president and Mrs. Bush will depart for South Asia. They will travel to India and Pakistan. This is the first trip of the president and Mrs. Bush to either country. They are very much looking forward to it.
Stephen Hadley,"China would do well to implement policies to correct its global trade imbalances, through expanding domestic demand, increasing market access for foreign goods and services, and adopting a flexible, market-based exchange rate for its currency."
Stephen Hadley,"What this means is that India, which has had a good record in safeguarding technology, but has largely stood out â€” from outside the global nonproliferation arrangements, is moving inside those arrangements. It is adopting practices and procedures, export controls and other safeguards that are much more in line with the international community's efforts to police proliferation and avoid proliferation."
Stephen Hadley,We are winning that ideological struggle.
Stephen Hadley,But this is not a risk-free undertaking.
Stephen Hadley,Our relationships are in good shape. This is not a trip where the president has to come with a deliverable or an initiative.
Stephen Hadley,"Our relationships are in good shape. This is not a trip where the president has to come with a deliverable or an initiative,"
Stephen Hadley,I would say that is some real progress.
Stephen Hadley,We think we're going to make progress on three of them.
Stephen Hadley,"We're making progress, but we're not yet there."
Stephen Hadley,in a way that is consistent with our values and principles.
Stephen Hadley,"It's also an opportunity to pay tribute to the people of the Slovak Republic, and also other countries in the region, for the right choices they made in pursuing democracy and freedom."
Stephen Hadley,The purpose of the summit is for the democratically elected leaders to get together and reaffirm the fact that there is really a shared vision for the hemisphere that is based on democracy and free markets and free trade.
Stephen Hadley,"There are more serious leaders who are outstanding and not in custody than the three you described and I am sure that a number of those will not be part of the reconciliation process but again that is a decision that the Afghan government has the lead on,"
Stephen Hadley,"I think the point that we need to emphasize here was, allegations now that the president somehow manipulated intelligence, somehow misled the American people are flat wrong."
Stephen Hadley,"an issue of our intelligence, and obviously we need to do a better job of our intelligence."
Stephen Hadley,roughly the same intelligence that the Clinton administration saw.
Stephen Hadley,"We all looked at the same intelligence, and most people -- on the intelligence -- reached the same conclusion."
Stephen Hadley,Our statements about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein were based on the aggregation of intelligence from a number of sources and represented the collective view of the intelligence community.
Stephen Hadley,"Our statements about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein were based on the aggregation of intelligence from a number of sources and represented the collective view of the intelligence community,"
Stephen Hadley,"Obviously, we didn't have the intelligence we needed in that particular instance. In some sense, those countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction in secret also learned an important lesson - that there are risks of that kind of behavior and that kind of activity."
Stephen Hadley,"We do not rule out the use of force before attacks occur, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack."
Stephen Hadley,"As part of that cooperation for our part, we comply with U.S. law. We respect the sovereignty of the countries with which we deal. And we do not move people around the world so that they can be tortured."
Stephen Hadley,The relationship with China is extremely complex. We have areas of very positive cooperation with China.
Stephen Hadley,The language is agreed. The vehicle by which it is going to get enacted by the Congress is still being worked.
Stephen Hadley,"What the Congress and the companies are able to work out, we'll support and cooperate with so long as it does not involve a summary decision by the Congress that blocks this transaction."
Stephen Hadley,"We're confident, the president is confident, when Congress really understands the transaction they will conclude as he did, it's the right thing to do."
Stephen Hadley,"There are questions raised in the Congress, and what this delay allows is for those questions to be addressed on the Hill. There's nothing to reopen."
Stephen Hadley,"In terms of the Taiwan Straits [sic], obviously a conflict in the Taiwan Straits [sic], everybody loses. China loses, Taiwan loses, we lose, the area loses."
Stephen Hadley,"will focus on his vision of a united trans-Atlantic community, working together to promote freedom and democracy, particularly in the broader Middle East."
Stephen Hadley,"The Pentagon is looking into them. To the extent that kind of behavior is inconsistent with our policy, it will be stopped."
Stephen Hadley,The president believes that we must remember the clearest lesson of Sept. 11: that the United States of America must confront threats before they fully materialize.
Stephen Hadley,"There's an issue of finalizing the relevant agreement and then signing it. The framework basically allows access to facilities so as to facilitate cooperation between the forces of the United States and Romania,"
Stephen Hadley,"We would obviously like, and the Indians would like, to use the occasion of this [Bush] visit to reach agreement on this separation agreement, so-called. We think that would be a good thing, but it's important to have a good agreement that works for the Indians, works for the United States, will be acceptable to our Congress and to the nuclear suppliers group, and that's our objective. We'd like to get it before the trip [by Bush to India]. If we can, great. If we can't, we'll continue to negotiate it after the trip."
Stephen Hadley,"Action would have to be taken, ... Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer."
Stephen Hadley,"One cannot let dangers grow to the point of imminent threat to the United States without taking action. And if other measures fail, obviously we retain to right to use force."
Rosemary Haefner,"IT is one of the top areas hiring managers say they will be recruiting for in 2006. With the labor market becoming more competitive, hiring managers may need to rethink their recruitment and retention strategies."
Rosemary Haefner,"It may seem clichÃ©, but honesty is the best policy. Eighty-five percent of hiring mangers say they are less likely to promote an employee who has lied to them or other members of the organization."
Rosemary Haefner,"It may seem cliche, but honesty is the best policy. Even if you are motivated by the best of intentions, being deceitful can seriously compromise your credibility with colleagues and negatively impact your career progress. The vast majority of hiring managers -- 85 percent -- say they are less likely to promote an employee who has lied to them or other members of the organization."
Gordon Haff,"AMD has made some gains in mobile technology, but has been only marginally successful. There is a higher level of integration with notebooks than with desktop PCs, which gives Intel an edge since they are focused on a complete mobile platform."
Gordon Haff,I don't think anybody knows exactly what the end result of open sourcing the chip technology is.
Gordon Haff,This is about reducing administrative costs more than about security.
Gordon Haff,"Dell has had a very focused strategy: Don't spend a lot on research and development, leverage the work of others, and deliver cookie-cutter servers and desktops cheaply. That lined up well with the market when saving money was in. But IT managers have to consider more than price now in making buying decisions."
Gordon Haff,Dell has had a really good run selling essentially cookie-cutter rack-mount servers. But the era of solving problems by just buying more boxes is coming to a close.
Gordon Haff,"This is a bigger story for Apple than for Intel. Apple liked Intel's roadmap better than that of Power PC, and the idea is that they will now sell a higher percentage of notebook computers."
Gordon Haff,"Certainly Power Everywhere, to some level, includes OEMing systems, though for the most part it's more focused on the use of the Power architecture by various partners in client devices, game consoles, whatever, than it is in computer systems, ... Power Everywhere and OpenPower are really about using collaborators ? to get Power into new types of devices."
Gordon Haff,"They are all comparable in performance for high-end, non-X86 architectures."
Gordon Haff,"Basically, no one ever used hardware-based IA-32 execution, so better to use the silicon for something else. Of course, basically no one uses software-based emulation either, but at least that doesn't cost chip real estate."
Gordon Haff,Intel has inconsistently put energy into storage. It hasn't had a real comprehensive strategy in the past.
Gordon Haff,"I see this as fine-tuning more than changing direction. Obviously, they're struggling financially, but in general this is a small number of people in the scope of things at Sun."
Gordon Haff,It is a question of the devil you know.
Gordon Haff,"Intel let a competitor sneak into a market where they weren't before. Still, it was hard to believe that AMD would be able to maintain the kind of performance lead that they have enjoyed over the past one to two years."
Gordon Haff,"In the sense of having this ongoing awareness of and feedback mechanism, it does mirror certain elements of open source development. If not openness of code and standards, there is greater visibility into what's going on. Customers have visibility more than an ability to necessarily influence Microsoft greatly."
Gordon Haff,"It's hard to see the Itanium Solutions Alliance accomplishing anything major that the billions already spent by HP, Intel, and the rest haven't. You don't see an x86 Solutions Alliance."
Chuck Hagel,"We should start figuring out how we get out of there. But with this understanding, we cannot leave a vacuum that further destabilizes the Middle East,"
Chuck Hagel,nominees are always the responsibility of the president and his team.
Chuck Hagel,"Trade barriers do not address competitiveness problems. Barriers do not create incentives to restructure, consolidate, reform, and innovate. (Tariffs will) increase the likelihood of a prolonged economic recession through inflationary prices."
Chuck Hagel,"The president should be, in my opinion, reviewing and analyzing and putting some deep perspective into who's around him at the White House,"
Chuck Hagel,"The law says you can do this and not do this, and so you just technically interpret every dynamic of that, and everything between going to jail and staying out of jail is free game, ... I don't think that's the answer."
Chuck Hagel,"The second question here is: Who is doing all of the fighting? This is also a societal issue. Should we continue to burden the middle class, who represents most all of our soldiers, and the lower-middle class?"
Chuck Hagel,"The time for healing has arrived, and Congressman Peterson is the one to lead us in that direction."
Chuck Hagel,"The United Nations has a critical role to play in promoting stability, security, democracy, human rights, and economic development. The UN is as relevant today as at any time in its history, but it needs reform."
Chuck Hagel,"Democracy is messy, ... We're going to hear a number of examples of how messy and unfair democracy is over the next two weeks. The answer to reforming our system is not to shut people out or diminish the ability of our people or institutions to participate in the process."
Chuck Hagel,"This will be the defining race for the future of our state, ... We will elect a new senator and a new congressman. There are 20 seats open in the state legislature. This is serious business."
Chuck Hagel,"during a time when in fact we had a policy that was losing. And the members of Congress were interestingly silent and absent in asking tough questions. As long as I'm a United States senator, I will do everything I can to ensure that we have a policy worthy of these brave young men and women who are sacrificing their lives and doing the things that they do for this country. I don't think that policy is there today."
Chuck Hagel,"It's in the best interests of this country that we continue to keep some common sense and sanity in the process here, and we've got to remember that not only is all of America looking and hoping and wondering about the future of this country and our ability to govern, but so is the world."
Chuck Hagel,"I believe this can be done peacefully through diplomacy,"
Chuck Hagel,"I don't know where he's going to get these troops, ... There won't be any National Guard left ... no Army Reserve left ... there is no way America is going to have 100,000 troops in Iraq, nor should it, in four years."
Chuck Hagel,"I think the wise course of action, the compassionate course of action, the better course of action would have been to immediately invite her in to the ranch,"
Walter Hagen,"Miss a putt for $2,000? Not likely!"
Walter Hagen,"You don't have the game you played last year or last week. You only have today's game. It may be far from your best, but that's all you've got. Harden your heart and make the best of it."
Walter Hagen,No one remembers who came in second.
Walter Hagen,"My dear, did you ever stop to think what a wonderful bunker you would make?"
Walter Hagen,"You're only here for a short visit. Don't hurry, don't worry. And be sure to smell the flowers along the way."
Walter Hagen,"There is no tragedy in missing a putt, no matter how short. All have erred in this respect."
Walter Hagen,Make the hard ones look easy and the easy ones look hard.
Walter Hagen,It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art.
Walter Hagen,Don 't hurry. Don't worry. You're only here for a short visit. So don't forget to stop and smell the roses.
John Hagerty,"Customers [in this space] want to buy large sets of products that integrate well together. Pundits have suggested for some time that IBM needed more presence in BI and analytics, so this is a step in the right direction."
John Hagerty,It truly allows you to analyze information in whatever (tool) makes the most sense to you. You're no longer hampered by going from product to product.
John Hagerty,Spending on Sarbanes-Oxley is only the visible tip of the compliance iceberg. Any expectation that compliance spending might moderate is just wishful thinking.
John Hagerty,Spending on Sarbanes-Oxley is only the visible tip of the compliance iceberg. Any expectation that compliance spending might moderate is just wishful thinking as companies in all industries grapple with increased regulatory concerns and stricter governance and risk policies within their own firms.
John Hagerty,"You may have misappropriation of government dollars or theft by deception or something of that nature. But the way the contracts were, the way the monies were provided to the day cares, it didn't place limitations on the dollars per se. Therefore, we can't charge a crime."
John Haggai,"The leader seeks to communicate his vision to his followers. He captures their attention with his optimistic intuition of possible solutions to their needs. He influences them by the dynamism of his faith. He demonstrates confidence that the challenge can be met, the need resolved, the crisis overcome."
John Haggai,"Attempt something so impossible that unless God is in it, it's doomed to failure."
John Haggai,"Gather in your resources, rally all your faculties, marshal all your energies, focus all your capacities upon mastery of at least one field of endeavor."
Merle Haggard,"When I grew up there wasn't air-conditioning or anything of that nature, and this old car had a wall thickness of about ten inches. So we had a little warmer house in the winter and a little cooler in the summer."
Merle Haggard,"They shaved a little piece of bone off my small toe. You see, you balance yourself a certain way and this toe had grown under the other ones. So he cut it loose, where I could balance myself and it makes me walk straight."
Merle Haggard,"There's been periods of broadcasts in the past where you could see all ages of entertainers, ranging from George Burns to Shirley Temple. That's not the condition now."
Merle Haggard,"There's a rumor that there may be an attempt at organizing a possible script for a series on my life, which, when you look at my police record, you'd have to have more than one hour to tell the story."
Merle Haggard,The only thing that I miss lately in all music is somebody that will put out a melody that you can whistle. It doesn't seem like there's anything happening like that.
Merle Haggard,"Sometimes if you get 'em too drunk they don't pay no attention to what you're doin' anyways, so you might as well just do old songs. But if you get one that's paying attention, sometimes we'll do some new material."
Merle Haggard,"Oh, I think I'm most proud of my music and my children, and my current wife. She's been very supportive and probably responsible for me being here."
Merle Haggard,"No, I had a back injury early on in my life."
Merle Haggard,My second wife Bonnie Owens and I worked together after we divorced for a period of maybe 20 years. And I managed to stay friends with another wife. And then there's one that I don't mess with. Everybody's got one of those.
Merle Haggard,My 10 year old son likes it. He's trying to play guitar and everything. He likes that kind of music.
Merle Haggard,It's been said that Bill Gates has come up with something that'll be released in December that's gonna put a lid on counterfeiting. If that's a fact then it's really interesting to own your own product - with all the potential methods of downloading.
Merle Haggard,"It sounds like something from a Woody Guthrie song, but it's true; I was raised in a freight car."
Merle Haggard,"It makes my wife mad, you know, she wants me to stay home all the time. But its what I've done all my life and I think when I quit doing it I'll probably go away pretty quick."
Merle Haggard,"I've smoked Camels for more years than I care to mention, but I haven't had a cigarette since '91. I haven't had a joint since '95."
Merle Haggard,I've got two families.
Merle Haggard,"I've got one young family by the first wife, with four children."
Merle Haggard,I'm just writin' about my little ol' love affair.
Merle Haggard,I think I'm most proud of my family right now. I'm more into that then I've ever been. It also gives a new area to draw from in creativity with my songs.
Merle Haggard,"I refer to her as my current wife. No, her and I have been together almost 15 years, and married about 10 years. Looks like it may be a steady deal."
Merle Haggard,I haven't had any problems with my back since I got the foot surgery.
Merle Haggard,"I had some surgery on my feet, which has helped my back some."
Merle Haggard,"I enjoy the videos with the sound off, where you can look at the belly buttons and everything. Really some pretty girls, but I don't know about the music."
Merle Haggard,"HAG Records, is a company that I've owned. I've had a couple of gospel releases on it. We developed a pretty good distribution setup there and we do have something to use in case they don't want to sign us."
Merle Haggard,Everybody likes Johnny Cash. I think the sad part of it is his health is givin' him problems.
Merle Haggard,Diana Krall knocks me out. I like jazz and I like her simple approach.
Merle Haggard,"'Cause I was already a smoker, it was easy to get addicted. The one thing that they don't teach you about marijuana is how addictive it is."
Merle Haggard,"At my age, I don't buy but a half a loaf of bread, you know?"
Merle Haggard,"And there's some Latino music I like, and some reggae music."

Merle Haggard,"When you get to readin' about where the music and John Steinbeck and all those people like that come from, the further you go the more interesting it becomes."
Merle Haggard,It's easier to force feed people than it is to give 'em what they want. It makes more money.
Paul Haggis,"[Still, who will complain, since in both real life and cinematic fantasy everyone agrees that what is needed all round is a change of image. MI6 offers disguised profiles of its latest recruits, which are replete with red-brick universities, second-class degrees, and operatives with Asian names. The movie men are looking for something new too.] We're trying to reinvent Bond, ... It's very difficult to think of new ways of blowing things up. It's the journey that's the thing - finding a new journey for the character."
Paul Haggis,This is the year that Hollywood rewarded rule-breakers.
Paul Haggis,"[September 16, 2005 - In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter , newly hired Casino Royale re-write scribe Paul Haggis dropped some brief but revealing tidbits about the next James Bond installment.] It's going to be good, ... We're trying to reinvent Bond. He's 28: no Q, no gadgets."

Paul Haggis,I just want to thank people who take big risks in their daily lives when there aren't cameras rolling. I want to dedicate this award to people who stand up for peace and against injustice and intolerance.
Paul Haggis,"I'd only seen him as the hero or the foppish best friend - so I felt predisposed to like him. On the other hand, Granger's character is not particularly attractive at all - 1950s film heroes were supposed to be strong and confident, yet here is this rather tediously weak man, who allows himself to be pushed around by women."
Paul Haggis,"They managed the campaign very well, getting the DVDs into the hands of the viewers, believing that the picture would sell itself. I thought that we had absolutely no shot at the Oscar, though I hoped that some of the actors would be remembered."
Paul Haggis,"Of course I feel guilty about manipulating the audience, playing on their preconceptions in that way, ... But that's my job."
William Hague,"The Deputy Prime Minister will present a bill that is rambling, over-inflated, illogical and ridiculously cumbersome - funny coincidence, that."
William Hague,It would have been a major disaster if the bag had fallen open.
William Hague,We think a great crisis is coming for Europe. The last thing Britain should do is associate ourselves with the fastest shrinking part of the world economy.

William Hague,"Wouldn't it be better to have a watertight law designed to catch the guilty, rather than a press release law designed to catch the headlines?"
William Hague,We have to face the reality of climate change. It is arguably the biggest threat we are facing today.

Corey Haim,"Well, my favorite roles so far are Lucas and Lost Boys."
Corey Haim,"Um, you know, they have every right to feel the way they do and things are great with me, as you see, I'm very, good shape now and on the ball. Things are happening."
Corey Haim,It basically comes down to that word: Love. I guess that's what it's all about.
Corey Haim,I've goten to work with some great people. I've been really lucky.
Corey Haim,"I'm trying to get in the habit of, you know, picking up a book and learning how to write my feelings down, not my feelings but my thoughts, about things, and hopefully I'll moving toward the writing and directing thing soon."
Corey Haim,"I'd love to see the rushes but it's just not allowed because directors and also a lot of actors feel that if they see their work, and the director likes what they're doing, the actor might try to correct their mistakes."
Corey Haim,"I think maybe ten years from now, I'm hopefully going to be, in like, Tahiti or something. Kicking back like in my huge mansion, if everything goes right, it's all up to me."

Corey Haim,"But one led to two, two led to four, four led to eight, until at the end it was about 85 a day - the doctors could not believe I was taking that much. And that was just the valium - I'm not talking about the other pills I went through."
Corey Haim,"But a year before that, I was starting to drink beer on the set of the film Lucas (1986)."

Peter Hain,"The closeness of our friendship meant we could understand what needed to be done in a way other countries would not have done so,"
Peter Hain,"Freedom of the press is a basic principle of international human rights, ... I urge the Liberian government to drop all charges and release the journalists immediately."
Peter Hain,I can't imagine anybody wanting to stand against him because it is quite likely they would face a crushing defeat.
Peter Hain,the collapse in external and internal confidence would lead to a more serious situation.
Peter Hain,Those responsible must be brought to justice. I will support the police in any action they take to do that and in the meantime I think everybody from unionist communities will be absolutely appalled at the way paramilitary groups are really acting in a gangster type way.
Frank Haith,I'm happy at Miami. I've agreed to a deal and I'm not interested in other jobs.
Frank Haith,"We did a good job with their post guys until the last 5 minutes of the game. We had some breakdowns, and in a high-level game like this, you can't have [mistakes] and expect to win."
Frank Haith,I'm really proud of how our kids competed under those circumstances. We just didn't finish.
Frank Haith,We just gotta take baby steps. Hopefully we'll be playing in the NCAA next year.

Dave Hakstol,"I think he stuck with it and has continued to work extremely hard, and now we're starting to see some of the results for Jonathan coming on the ice. He's a guy that does an awful lot for us. ... He's really starting to come on and be a dynamic force for us offensively."
Dave Hakstol,"Guys that have got it done in the past, they know how to elevate their game at the right time. There is a connection there. Guys have that attitude and expectation of themselves to win."

Dave Hakstol,"We fought real hard to get this opportunity, but we're certainly not happy just getting there."
Dave Hakstol,"No. 1, we knew we didn't come out of the dressing room Friday night the way we needed to. We didn't match Mankato's intensity Friday. I thought we did that tonight."
Dave Hakstol,He's a dynamic force for us right now offensively.
Dave Hakstol,They should be offensive leaders for us and throughout the country.
Dave Hakstol,You've got four very competitive regions. It's a great sign for where college hockey is at. All 16 teams are competitive.
Dave Hakstol,"At the beginning of the year, one of the things we talked about was how we needed to gain some experience. There's only one way to do that. That's to go through the wear and tear of a season. We have gotten a little bit better. Our consistency has gotten a little bit better and that doesn't end. We want to keep getting a little bit better. Hopefully we have a few weeks left to do that."
Dave Hakstol,"The second half of their season, they've been as good as anybody. We fought hard to get home-ice advantage. Now we have to take advantage of it."
Dave Hakstol,"Those are things we'll turn to next week. We've got an awful lot of ability, an awful lot of character in our locker room that will be returning. And the one thing that sticks out in my mind is we have some unfinished business."
Dave Hakstol,We've got some guys back there who can bring some offensive ability and make some offensive plays. That's part of being a good offensive team. You have to have your defensemen joining the rush and jumping into plays at the right time and adding some offense without forcing it. That's something young guys grow into.
George Halas,"Taylor, we've run out of timeouts. Go in there and get hurt."
George Halas,"San Francisco has always been my favorite booing city. I don't mean the people boo louder or longer, but there is a very special intimacy. When they boo you, you know they mean you. Music, that's what it is to me. One time in Kezar Stadium they gave me a standing boo."

David Halberstam,"If you're a reporter, the easiest thing in the world is to get a story. The hardest thing is to verify. The old sins were about getting something wrong, that was a cardinal sin. The new sin is to be boring."

Alex Haley,Racism is taught in our society... it is not automatic. It is learned behavior toward persons with dissimilar physical characteristics.
Alex Haley,Beginning writers must appreciate the prerequisites if they hope to become writers. You pay your dues - which takes years.
Alex Haley,"Anytime you see a turtle up on top of a fence post, you know he had some help"
Alex Haley,"Racism is taught in our society, it is not automatic. It is learned behavior toward persons with dissimilar physical characteristics."
Alex Haley,"My fondest hope is that 'Roots' may start black, white, brown, red, yellow people digging back for their own roots. Man, that would make me feel 90 feet tall."

Alex Haley,Roots is not just a saga of my family. It is the symbolic saga of a people.

Alex Haley,"In every conceivable manner, the family is link to our past, bridge to our future."

Chris Hall,Lacrosse seems to be a sport of the future. Maybe it's even become the sport of the now.
Chris Hall,Those guys are really fighting to get down there to make great plays. I thought my hang time has been a lot better - sometimes in the 4.8s and 4.9s. Any time above 4.4 or 4.5 is probably going to be fair caught just because you give them more time to run down there.

Chris Hall,"We're giving trial customers three months of next-generation services free, and after the first month presenting them with a total of their costs and asking, 'Is that value for your money?'"
Chris Hall,I hope to keep him busy and get him plenty of action in the coming months to help build up his experience in the professional code.
Conrad Hall,You have to understand the nature of light.
Conrad Hall,"You are always a student, never a master. You have to keep moving forward."
Conrad Hall,"With today's fast films, you can light the way your eye sees the scene. You can abuse the film and create subtleties in contrast with light and exposure, diffusion and filters. That's what makes it an art."
Conrad Hall,There are infinite shadings of light and shadows and colors... it's an extraordinarily subtle language. Figuring out how to speak that language is a lifetime job.
Conrad Hall,"There are a lot of directors who are knowledgeable about images, and others who aren't."
Conrad Hall,"The truth is that every experience, every feeling, every film you see, becomes part of the sensibilities you apply to making a movie."

Conrad Hall,"The closer the source of light is to a subject, the broader the beams are."
Conrad Hall,"The audience has to understand that if the film is going to have any meaning for them. If they are going to empathize with the characters, they have to visualize the process of concentration involved in making every move."

Conrad Hall,Photography is a very important part of my life.

Conrad Hall,"I was very happy sitting alone at a dining room table, writing a script."

Conrad Hall,"I suppose I would still be a communicator, maybe a musician."
Conrad Hall,"I saw Tequila Sunrise as a romantic picture with complex, bigger than life characters."
Conrad Hall,I realize that every picture isn't a work of art.
Conrad Hall,"I knew exactly how I wanted it to play, but you are never sure until you watch the projected images reflect off the screen. That's when you know it worked."
Conrad Hall,"I just wanted to try directing, and the best way was to write the material, so I was imbued with its origins when I was dealing with the actors."

Conrad Hall,"But you still have an awesome responsibility, because you are helping to create something which might influence the thinking of millions of people."
Conrad Hall,But you know you haven't done it all because you know everything keeps evolving and changing; and you know you can evolve with it if you grow and develop as a human being.
Conrad Hall,"But at heart, I am more than a cinematographer."
Conrad Hall,Billions of people have seen and been influenced by movies in the short history of this industry.
Conrad Hall,"Dad, wherever you are, you are gone but you will never be forgotten."
Conrad Hall,There is a kind of beauty in imperfection.
Dante Hall,Defensive and offensive lineman control the game and true sports fans know that.

Galen Hall,"Anyone that?s sacrificed as much as he has, playing different positions, waiting his turn and all the hard work he?s done, I think our players respect him very much.

Galen Hall,"Michael Robinson is one of those rare persons who steps in the huddle and people believe in him and believe he's going to get the job done. Anyone who's sacrificed as much as he has, playing different positions, and all the hard work that he's done, I think our players respect him very much. ... I know he has the confidence of this offensive football team and probably the defensive football team also, that when he steps on the football field he is our true leader."
Galen Hall,"I think Michael Robinson is one of those rare persons that steps in the huddle and people believe in him and believe he's going to get the job done no matter what it takes. It might be with a play, it might be with his mind, it might be throwing the football. But I think everyone on that football team, whenever Mike says, 'Hey, we're going to go score,' I think they truly believe in him. He's just that type of person."
Galen Hall,"If it goes the other way, you don't know what happens. Say we lose that football game. We don't get the confidence that we have now ? that we can go get that done when it's called for offensively."
Galen Hall,We looked around at college football teams who had a similar-style quarterback that we thought Michael could be.
Jim Hall,Stay plugged in. Maintain the strength of the Chamber.
Jim Hall,We think it's incumbent on airports that don't have the room for these safety areas to at least put in one of these systems.

Jim Hall,"Right now we're just trying to gather information and get as many people as we need in place there,"
Jim Hall,"I think from what he used to tell us, he always wanted to be on the police force. We saw each other quite often (when Hyder was young), and it was kind of a strange happenstance that I ended up kind of being his employer when I became a trustee."
Jim Hall,"All and all, even though it was considered to be a disaster, I think it was a great thing to happen."
Jim Hall,"I'm glad they got it done, and I don't think the price is unreasonable, given the circumstances around the assets."
Jim Hall,We cannot at this time explain the circumstances that were occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in the flight profile I just described.
Jim Hall,"We cannot at this time explain the circumstances that were occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in the flight profile I just described,"
Jim Hall,"Kyle was swinging the bat with authority all day. He had a good cut early in the game, but struck out. Actually, he looked good up there during all three of his trips to the plate. He got a fastball he could handle, low and in, and he didn't miss it."

Kevin Hall,At least the House has indicated an unwillingness to adopt policy through the budget. It's the governor's belief that the executive order he signed minutes after taking his oath will continue to be the policy of this administration.
Kevin Hall,"It appears the governor has the legal authority to impose a cap only when the legislature isn't in session, so we cannot impose a cap unilaterally at this time."

Leon Hall,It's a great opportunity for us to bounce back. It's a big game for us.
Leon Hall,"It's been an honor to coach the kids and break this record two years in a row. I told them it makes me happy, and I hope the school is proud of them and the community is proud of them. For these guys to break the record two years in a row is a testament to their hard work."

Mark Hall,"We use a key formula: Threat x Vulnerability = Risk,"

Mark Hall,been a different level (of criminal investigation) than Clarion has seen in the past.
Mark Hall,there is more to it than just information. After receiving the information you must know what to do with it.
Mark Hall,"A lot of riders think of something like a football helmet, but over the past four or five years, they've become very lightweight, ventilated and comfortable. The important thing is a good fit â€” you have to try models from different manufacturers."
Mark Hall,"The infrastructure of today's computing environment is for good or ill structured around the Windows operating system. Can you get around that? Yes you can, but you have to work harder to do that and most individuals and most corporations are not going to make that extra effort."
Mark Hall,"Our advice -- carry only essential credit and ATM cards. If you do not plan to use them during your trip, leave them at home."
Matt Hall,There is a problem in San Marcos with some proprietors not enforcing the rules. I also know the city officials know there is a problem.
Matt Hall,"After each of our first two games were over, we tried to get it out of our system and get ready for our next game. You're always sour when you come off a loss and now we're going on our third week off. We want to get these losses out of our heads and the only way we can do that is by playing."

Robert Hall,"He's a threat to society, he's a menace. We have a very serious situation here."

Steve Hall,I'd still be in the hole. We know we're going to have trouble paying those heating bills.
Steve Hall,I have two legal opinions that say that it's unconstitutional.
Steve Hall,"This is obviously a breakage. It's not my intention to have anybody cold, and we certainly regret any interruption of service."
Steve Hall,Mandatory hunter education is really having an impact.
Steve Hall,"Texas has no system in place, and what you have is chaos."
Steve Hall,All it does is raise awareness and awareness prevents a few incidents.
Steve Hall,The Peripheral Canal automatically throws you into a heated argument that doesn't solve the problem.
Steve Hall,"She's one of the best shooting kids we have. She's also one of our post players. But with her ability to shoot the ball, it's contagious. She's had some success and it's rubbing off on other kids."
Tony Hall,malicious attempt to tarnish the reputation of me and my staff.
Tony Hall,"This is absolutely a phenomenal project, and it still can be if it's done right, ... And I don't know if the mayor's got that kind of intelligence around him to get this done right. I was here to help him do it. I was probably the only one who spoke the truth."
Tony Hall,"It took a lot of effort and dedication, but we started playing as a team."
Brian Halla,Due to the low bookings in the fourth quarter we now expect a further decline in sales for the first quarter.
Brian Halla,"Sales continued soft during the summer quarter. We think, however, we may have touched bottom as bookings in the first quarter improved for the first time in a year."
Brian Halla,"We will immediately cease slugging it out in the PC processor market, which has been dragging down our financial performance for several quarters."
Brian Halla,"While we are encouraged by the recent seasonal improvement in bookings, we still feel it is too early to call the turn, and we remain cautious on the near-term outlook."
Brian Halla,"Led by robust analog and wireless sales, we had an outstanding quarter. Focus on execution drove our gross margins to 51 percent, up from 48 percent in the previous quarter."
Brian Halla,"But the overall economy is still sluggish. As a result, our near-term outlook remains cautious."
Brian Halla,We are ahead of our gross margin goals and we are continuing in the same direction.
Brian Halla,The devil is in the details.
Brian Halla,Business conditions were stronger than we had originally anticipated. We reached our interim goal of 60 percent gross margin earlier than we expected and at the same time continued to gain market share in the analog standard linear market.
Brian Halla,It's one thing to put this business on the books. It's far more important to maximize the profit from it.
Brian Halla,"What's needed is more funding for basic research, a desire to compete globally and an awareness of the role technology plays in our security and quality of life."
Brian Halla,"This was a tough action for us to take, especially because it impacts many people who have served National well. However, given the continuing weakness in the marketplace, it is necessary to conform our resources to the market in order to maximize National's opportunity for long-term success."
Roy Halladay,"When I first came up I was just pitching on talent alone,"
Roy Halladay,"After three weeks in a cast he was back running stairs and after 10 weeks he was back in a cast,"
Roy Halladay,"In his case, when they do that Tommy John, a lot of the risk of [the ligament tearing] again has kind of gone away. I think from the standpoint of it being something major like that, I didn't really [think the injury would be serious]. You just didn't want him out for an extended period."
Roy Halladay,"It gave A.J. and the rest of us a better idea where he stands physically. It's left him feeling a little more comfortable about his rehabilitation. And it was good for us, because now we kind of feel that, okay, we can get things done until he gets back."
Roy Halladay,"For now, my biggest emphasis was on location, making sure they were quality pitches."
Roy Halladay,"Right now my biggest emphasis is on location, making sure they're quality pitches and I feel good. (Velocity) is something that comes, get a couple of more times out and that will take care of itself."
Roy Halladay,"I threw 90 pitches and felt good the whole time. I felt great, there were no problems out there today at all, and I feel good about the arm and should be able to go longer next time out."
Roy Halladay,I had some time off to rest and haven't had any problems ever since then. It's kind of disappeared this winter so that's nice.
Roy Halladay,"They hung in there, they played well and the mistakes I made, they hit. Some days you get away with it. Today wasn't one of those days."
Roy Halladay,With every player there's a certain point where it all starts to click. A lot of it is just learning yourself and what works for you.
Roy Halladay,"They had some good ideas to start the whole thing, so we had to come back with something. I think we've put an end to it."
Roy Halladay,"Physically, I felt good. So that's always a good thing early on -- having the health there. The cutter was kind of hit or miss today, so there's still a couple things to work on. Obviously, you would like to start better, but I got my work in."
Roy Halladay,"Physically I felt good. That's always a good thing early on, having the health there. Then you got to work on executing."
Roy Halladay,That's always been a question for debate. I think pitchers never like to go back-to-back facing teams but that hitters sometimes feel like they have a better idea of what they're going to see.
Roy Halladay,"Even in the spring when they had so many pitchers at an advanced age I wondered about how they would do,"
Geri Halliwell,"In school nativity plays I was always the bloody little donkey, I was never Mary."
Geri Halliwell,Competition is for dogs and horses.
Geri Halliwell,"We're all just trying to fit in and find ourselves, particularly when we're growing up."
Geri Halliwell,We are obsessed with image. I don't think we should take it that seriously.
Geri Halliwell,There's always going to be that pressure when you're in front of the camera. When you're famous it's just an extreme version of reality and there's a pressure to look a certain way.
Geri Halliwell,There will always be a few people who just want to knock you down or are jealous or just want to be horrible for the sake of it. I don't know what drives someone to be nasty.
Geri Halliwell,"The truth sets you free. It's a very liberating thing, when you say this is who I am warts and all and then you can just get on with life. It's amazing."
Geri Halliwell,Someone taught me how to eat properly. Learning from others is important when it's not working for yourself.
Geri Halliwell,"Some people are naturally thin and some people are naturally heavier. It doesn't mean that bigger is healthier, or much thinner is healthier, it's on an individual basis."
Geri Halliwell,Obviously Victoria and Mel B have become mothers and there is a part of me that wants to be a mum.
Geri Halliwell,It's really important to remember that most people in the public eye are human for a start and a lot of things that you read in the media get slightly misconstrued and manipulated.
Geri Halliwell,"I'm never getting too lonely because it's the kind of disease where you might sit in front of the TV with three bags of biscuits, rather than communicate with the world."
Geri Halliwell,I'd never choose to turn the clock back.
Geri Halliwell,I won't mention the word tired. This is the 20th century and I can go around a little faster.
Geri Halliwell,I want to communicate through my music. If you want to know Geri Halliwell listen to my album: it tells you more about me than a documentary ever could.
Geri Halliwell,"I want everything I do to be special and fun. Everything I have done I have always done passionately, with all my heart and soul."
Geri Halliwell,I still cry a lot. I cry about the Spice Girls and I cry about my dad. He died just before I joined the band. I was always Daddy's little girl.
Geri Halliwell,I know that I've overfed myself trying to prop myself up because I'm exhausted.
Geri Halliwell,"I have never sung a whole song on my own before and I am not the best dancer in the world, but I would rather try and fall than not not try at all."
Geri Halliwell,"I have got one of those faces that change every day: you can dress me up, make me look vampy and then make me look 12 years old. But don't all women do this thing? We all take on these roles."
Geri Halliwell,"I have always wanted a solo career, deep in the darkest pit of myself, but I didn't dare admit it to myself even. It took me a long time to confront my fears."
Geri Halliwell,"I didn't want to leave the Spice Girls and immediately have a record on the back of that fame, so I waited to find out who I am and what I want."
Geri Halliwell,"I am happy but a piece of me is still really sad. It runs like from my shoulder across my breast, across my heart. I've had growing pains in my brain."
Geri Halliwell,I am absolutely blessed and I'm very grateful for where I am today.
Geri Halliwell,Everyone has a mad half-hour once a month.
Geri Halliwell,Being mean about other people isn't on my radar.
Geri Halliwell,Becoming a solo singer is like going from an eau de toilette to a perfume. It's much more intense.
Lawrence Halprin,"Without question, he had more effect on people's interest in architecture and design in the Bay Area than anybody else."
Lawrence Halprin,"Then I sit down, work at it, because now I have a convincing feeling about what that place wants to be, you see? And it's not just me. Me and my talent comes in taking that consensus and then making something wonderful out of it - a work of art."
Lawrence Halprin,"The whole memorial is for different senses... seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling. I probably would have come up with something different if I had not lived through it."
Lawrence Halprin,"One of the things I thought a lot about was how can we get the views, for instance, the main plaza, you look up to Telegraph Hill from there and therefore it would be a disaster to close that view off."
Lawrence Halprin,"One is, that they will feel about you that you're going to make something wonderful for them. And they help you by expressing themselves. Not telling you how to do it, but encouraging you and accepting your vision and working with you on that kind of a level."
Lawrence Halprin,"Of all the Jedis I saw in the film, Yoda's the only one I like."
Lawrence Halprin,"Let me just say something that I forgot, I also hoped and this was very true in the beginning - that this would also be a place that people would be able to walk in to the fountain and use it in a nice way of reading and examining the quotations on the blocks."
Lawrence Halprin,I suppose and I hope that the young guys who are out there losing their lives at least feel the same way I did. I shouldn't think about this very much because I'm almost weeping when I think about it.
Lawrence Halprin,"I always say to young people when they ask me how I work, I always say to them, the only time you've ever going to do something good is if you have a good client. And by good I mean all kinds of things."
Lawrence Halprin,"Because the quality of living with nature and allowing it to manifest itself is different than the quality of living in a city, especially a dense city."
Lawrence Halprin,"Because over and over again, the times that I've done really good things is because I've had a wonderful client of some kind, and a lot of it depended on me to induce them to be creative."
Lawrence Halprin,"Because one of the benefits of getting older, I guess-there are very few benefits, really - most of them are a pain in the butt. People depend on me more; they believe in me more, they think I'm good."
Lawrence Halprin,"And you finally get to a consensus, where you get a sense of what really ought to be done, and then they give it to me and then I draw it. I mean draw it in the sense, the philosophical sense."
Lawrence Halprin,"And I think one of the tasks that I always feel is how to get that vision out of them. Not exactly what they want, but what they want to accomplish for themselves or their community or their family."
Ken Ham,Evolutionary Darwinists need to understand we are taking the dinosaurs back. This is a battle cry to recognize the science in the revealed truth of God.
Ken Ham,We just can't get comfortable with the stability of the situation for this particular opportunity. So we're going to officially wave you off for 24 hours.
Ken Ham,"All right, Eileen. How do you feel about a beautiful, clear night with a breeze down the runway in the high desert of California?"
Ken Ham,"The real purpose is to say the Bibles true, and its history. Genesis is true."
Ken Ham,"In other words, they decided right from the start that there's no God, and they're setting out to try to prove that there's no God, ... That's their bias to start with."
Ken Ham,Congratulations on a truly spectacular test flight. Welcome home friends.
Ken Ham,"Welcome home, Discovery,"
Ken Ham,"[Regardless, Ham says he is not surprised that such a large number of people believe in creationist views.] The creation movement has over the years put out a lot of information, ... I think a lot more people are becoming aware of the arguments and the information in books and DVDs and through websites like Answers In Genesis and so on -- and I believe a lot more people are educated on this issue."
Ken Ham,"The grass-roots movement you see across America right now, with the school board battles, with the students questioning evolution in colleges, all of that is really in a big part due to the work of Dr. Henry Morris. All of us in the modern creationism movement today would say we stand on his shoulders."
Noriko Hama,"Lifestyles became much more modest, looking for cheap bargains. Deflation penetrated society."
Noriko Hama,The Japanese economy was suffering from the Luciano Pavarotti syndrome.
Noriko Hama,"It is a very inefficient working economy, in that respect, that the pool of talents is there but the antiquated system refuses to tap into it."
Noriko Hama,I think it's a pretty disastrous situation for them although it has been a disaster waiting to happen. At least they foresaw the problem this time but the fact that the system was about to crash is a problem.
Ghazi Hamad,The new force respects the law (and) the national interest.
Ghazi Hamad,We reject the use of force or weapons against citizens or on the street.
Ghazi Hamad,"The prime minister said that dialogue was still open, even for the creation of a national unity cabinet."
Ghazi Hamad,All of the Palestinians are standing together. The government has repeatedly affirmed that we are not going to compromise.
Ghazi Hamad,"The decision of the Interior Minister conformed with the law ... which gives the minister the authority to take the necessary decisions to guarantee security. The aim of the decision was to support and strengthen the efforts of the police, and not to replace the police."
Ghazi Hamad,Any attempt to reduce the authorities of the government will harm its performance and its ability to carry out its duties.
Mark Hamill,"[griping about Tatooine] If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from."
Mark Hamill,"Luke: Uncle Owen, this R2 unit has a bad motivator."
Mark Hamill,"I can't tell you how much we laughed on the set to have Alec Guinness in a scene with a big, furry dog that's flying a space ship."
Pete Hamill,"He was a very quiet guy, unlike the rest of the rabble, ... He had a low-key, wicked sense of humor. I had no idea that he was writing anything until someone called me up and said, 'Frank McCourt's written this amazing book,' which turned out to be 'Angela's Ashes.'"
Pete Hamill,"One great example of the way Tweed really helped the Irish was when the water started to overflow from the Croton Reservoir, it went to certain parts of Manhattan but not to where the poor lived. The mythology of the dirty Irish developed because they had no water, not until Tweed, through aggravation or bribery, got the water to flow through poor neighborhoods."
Pete Hamill,"He became out of step with the basic audience, because they didn't believe it. And I think that was the beginning of the end of Winchell. I think it was a self-inflicted wound."
Pete Hamill,"He steps on stage and draws the sword of rhetoric, and when he is through, someone is lying wounded and thousands of others are either angry or consoled."
Pete Hamill,"I don't ask for the meaning of the song of a bird or the rising of the sun on a misty morning. There they are, and they are beautiful."
Pete Hamill,Say what you will about him Ed Koch is still the best show in town.
Pete Hamill,"There is a growing feeling that perhaps Texas is really another country, a place where the skies, the disasters, the diamonds, the politicians, the women, the fortunes, the football players and the murders are all bigger than anywhere else."
Alexander Hamilton,I have learned to hold popular opinion of no value
Alexander Hamilton,"who behave amiss, or betray their public trust."
Alexander Hamilton,Power over a man's subsistence is power over his will.
Alexander Hamilton,In the main it will be found that a power over a man's support (salary) is a power over his will
Alexander Hamilton,"When the sword is once drawn, the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation"
Alexander Hamilton,"Men often oppose a thing merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike."
Alexander Hamilton,"In many cases, it will connect itself with preexisting factions and will enlist all the animosities, the partialities, the influence and the interest in one side or the other. And in such cases, it will always be dangerous that the decision will be regulated more by a comparison of strength of the parties, rather than the demonstration of innocence or guilt."
Alexander Hamilton,"In the general course of human nature, A power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will."
Alexander Hamilton,Men give me credit for some genius. All the genius I have is this. When I have a subject in mind. I study it profoundly. Day and night it is before me. My mind becomes pervaded with it... the effort which I have made is what people are pleased to call the fruit of genius. It is the fruit of labor and thought.
Alexander Hamilton,"In the usual progress of things, the necessities of a nation in every stage of its existence will be found at least equal to its resources"
Alexander Hamilton,"The courts must declare the sense of the law and if they should be disposed exercise will, instead of judgment, the consequences would be the substitution of their pleasure for that of the legislative body."
Alexander Hamilton,I think the first duty of society is justice
Alexander Hamilton,"It's not tyranny we desire; it's a just, limited, federal government."
Alexander Hamilton,"A national debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing."
Alexander Hamilton,"But as the plan of the convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation, the State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, EXCLUSIVELY delegated to the United States."
Alexander Hamilton,"When you assemble from your several counties in the Legislature, were every member to be guided only by the apparent interest of his county, government would be impracticable. There must be a perpetual accomodation and sacrifice of local advantage to general expediency."
Alexander Hamilton,"[T]he Constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the Constitution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of convention, but from the general theory of a limited Constitution."
Alexander Hamilton,"Ah, this is the constitution, he said. Now, mark my words. So long as we are a young and virtuous people, this instument will bind us together in mutual interests, mutual welfare, and mutual happiness. But when we become old and corrupt, it will bind no longer."
Alexander Hamilton,There is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of the State governments... --I mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice.
Alexander Hamilton,"The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in the Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government."
Alexander Hamilton,A promise must never be broken
Alexander Hamilton,"There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself, in acts of bravery and heroism."
Alexander Hamilton,"If circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and"
Alexander Hamilton,Nobody expects to trust his body overmuch after the age of fifty.
Alexander Hamilton,You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent.
Alexander Hamilton,Learn to think continentally.
Anthony Hamilton,"I wanna change the game in way where I'm not knocking nobody out of the way, not claiming to be the best at this or that, but just doing wonders with the gift I've been given."
Anthony Hamilton,Being a barber is about taking care of the people.
Anthony Hamilton,"I learned patience, perseverance, and dedication. Now I really know myself, and I know my voice. It's a voice of pain and victory."
Brian Hamilton,"If the money is coming in the front door at 100 miles per hour, and going out the back door at 110 miles per hour, that's not a good thing. Businesses don't fail because they are unprofitable; they fail because they get crushed on the accounts receivable side."
Brian Hamilton,This would be statistically more significant if the company had flat revenues.
Brian Hamilton,"Benchmarking, generally, is far from a science. When you're talking about private company benchmarking, there are well-known limitations to the gathering and use of that data."
Brian Hamilton,Nobody wants to be criticized. Any company or research firm that goes against the grain is going to be criticized.
Brian Hamilton,"As an investing company, you have a lot of latitude in ways to make money, but Sears is an operating company. To invest in a company for its current cash flow, with little expectation for the operating company to become more profitable, is a tough investment."
Brian Hamilton,Business owners overstate the constraints. People don't understand that they are not going to lose clients over a stringent accounts receivable policy.
Bruce Hamilton,You can contribute our strength of schedule.
Bruce Hamilton,"Greyhound has a terrific safety record,"
Bruce Hamilton,It's hard for us to keep it on the shelf. One customer wanted to buy $500 worth of dehydrated food.
Bruce Hamilton,"The union insists that drivers who are fatigued have a right to book off. And the company has a policy: If a driver says he or she is fatigued, then Greyhound doesn't use them. You can't have it any other way."
Bruce Hamilton,"Tamara has a lot of experience, a lot of basketball savvy. When she plays within herself she does a great job and helps our team out a lot."
Dave Hamilton,"What's really reprehensible is that friends of the oil industry in Congress are using ... a disaster, which essentially pointed up our shortcomings in protecting public health and safety, to repeal environmental rules that are designed to protect public health and safety."
Dave Hamilton,It's roughly a flat budget.
Dave Hamilton,We're leaving a legacy of having to baby-sit this stuff.
Ian Hamilton,"Overall, we have been pleased with the progress of negotiations."
Ian Hamilton,Discussions at both operations are positive in tone and constructive in nature. We are committed to working toward successful conclusions of negotiations at both sites.
Ian Hamilton,"Among the field at the Canadian men's amateur golf championship, ... were Andrew Parr, Dave Bunker and Ryan Yip, who may want to blame his putting for his second-round loss."
Ian Hamilton,"No IT manager has ever lost their job from buying an HP printer, ... No matter how many Dell computers a company may have, people who purchase IT equipment look at HP as a long-standing leader in the printing business. It's a hard thing for Dell to crack, but they're still trying."
Ian Hamilton,That could explain why he threw so many high balls this season.
Ian Hamilton,We think it's a fair and balanced agreement that meets the needs of both the company and the union.
Jansen Hamilton,"It's been pretty quiet for the past month. It's been painful, very emotional, knowing we were letting down our school and community by losing when we knew we could win."
Jansen Hamilton,"I always knew he had it in him. He had the hot hand, so we had to keep giving it to him."
Jansen Hamilton,Basketball isn't a fair game.
Jim Hamilton,"Wood has a lot of talent,"
Jim Hamilton,This is a critical step in the process of approach design because this information is essential to understand the foundation on which this section will be built.
Jim Hamilton,We aren't dedicated as well as we should be. Bennett can place well and Ryan Fisher did well at the Gateway Invitational. He was our No. 2 man at one time.
John Hamilton,"It's a sense of flooding the brain too quickly. The brain has this disruption, and the short-term memory isn't converting into long-term memory."
John Hamilton,It's highly competitive. Kids here say being normal is being a loser.
John Hamilton,They made the girls wear shorts and tops.
John Hamilton,This is an experience I never want to live through again.
John Hamilton,"We had our first airplane ride when we were around 8 years old. A neighbor with a seed company had an airplane and took us up. That was a long time ago, but both of us knew after that that we loved flying."
John Hamilton,It feels really good. It's the first win in school history at state for Class 1A.
Leonard Hamilton,He's getting a better understanding of his strengths.
Leonard Hamilton,I think we're a little further along. We have a better understanding of our system.
Leonard Hamilton,I think we're a little further along. We have a better understanding of our system. We're able to make adjustments we could not make then. We're a little more mature team than we were a few years ago.
Leonard Hamilton,It appears that we don't get very much credit for the quality of teams we are playing against in the ACC.
Leonard Hamilton,"I think, overall, our team is making progress, but we have to get out of that mode where we're playing games against good caliber teams and coming up a little short."
Leonard Hamilton,"When we made mistakes, they made us pay. Most times you have one game like this per year, and hopefully, this will be our only one."
Leonard Hamilton,"When you give them those extra opportunities and they're having one of those nights, therein lies a butt-kicking."
Leonard Hamilton,"We've had more ups than downs. But more than anything else, I think we've had so many learning opportunities that I think now it's going to cause us to accelerate our growth process. Probably the most important thing is we've grown mentally."
Leonard Hamilton,"This is part of the journey. This is part of the process you go through, building programs. You have to give your team credit for making this kind of progress, but you also have to find a way to get over the hump, and that's mostly mental at this point."
Leonard Hamilton,"Part of the journey is overcoming obstacles, and this was one I thought mentally and physically we were prepared for. I guess I'd say that Duke's experience in being in these types of games with experienced guys came through."
Leonard Hamilton,I think we made improvement. Are we satisfied? Absolutely not.
Leonard Hamilton,"They are entertainers and they're speaking from their heart and the information that they have, but at this particular time, none of that matters, because we still got games to play. I'm not gonna allow myself to get all caught up in all these things, because if you win enough games, it takes care of itself."
Leonard Hamilton,"I'm very happy and proud for them because they've been model citizens. They keep our 100 percent graduation rate intact. But more than anything they're fine people. They're good basketball players, but I'm most proud of the fact that they have helped us move our program forward. Their last home game will be something to remember."
Leonard Hamilton,We have higher goals. We're not feeling like we need to start taking any bows.
Leonard Hamilton,"It was one of those games where we gave them too many unnecessary opportunities. But when they are already shooting the ball as well as they do and they are as patient as they are on offense, and then you give them extra opportunities, therein lies a nice little butt-kicking."
Leonard Hamilton,This is uncharted waters for us. I'm sure that in the future we'll try to win games by a little larger margin.
Leonard Hamilton,I was proud of our guys for fighting back at the end. We just couldn't get over the hump.
Leonard Hamilton,"Possibly -- possibly -- Duke, and maybe North Carolina State. I'm not sure that we all aren't fighting for positioning now. I said before the season started that this would be a year where you could throw predictions out the window. I'm not sure you could make calls. You've had a couple of wide margins, but most games could have gone either way. That's the way it is in the ACC."
Leonard Hamilton,We did not meet their style of ball with the type of enthusiasm that we should have. Maybe this is the type of game we needed to keep reality in front of us. We are not a team that can afford not to be at our very best mentally every time we step out.
Leonard Hamilton,"As I was coming in (the interview room), I was thinking about how much energy he brought to the game tonight. His comments and his enthusiasm on the bench and his communication with the players was extremely animated, unlike A.J. Sometimes he is very quiet, but he had a lot to say."
Leonard Hamilton,"We knew with the quick turnaround and the emotion we spent and the letdown we received from Sunday's loss, we would need energy and consistent play from our nonstarters. They gave us a big lift."
Leonard Hamilton,"They play to each other's strengths. They play with an unselfish spirit, and they play to win without any ego."
Leonard Hamilton,"I saw a very determined, focused look in his eye that we are going to get this done."
Leonard Hamilton,"He has that drive, determination and focus. You see it in his eyes. He has that special something about him that you like to see in athletes."
Leonard Hamilton,"I don't necessarily think that size has anything to do with rebounding. I think (it's) desire, willingness to be consistent with the fundamentals of rebounding."
Leonard Hamilton,"Sometimes you don't really know what to say because conversation sometimes makes it worse. You just have to give a person a hug and tell him you love him, you support him and be there for them."
Leonard Hamilton,We need to eliminate the mistakes that we're making that we can control. Unnecessary turnovers. We had two of them right there at the end of the first half that didn't have anything to do with (UNC).
Leonard Hamilton,Through this whole period we wanted to see that consistency from players. We're starting to see that develop.
Leonard Hamilton,"Once you understand the type of energy that it takes, the type of effort and communication it takes with your teammates, then it becomes fun when you're all on the same page."
Leonard Hamilton,"I know in my 30 years of coaching I have never heard of a player getting injured under any circumstances in a celebration after a game - not at a basketball game. Maybe you guys have, but I haven't."
Leonard Hamilton,We were very focused in guarding their very good perimeter players at the beginning of the game.
Leonard Hamilton,"Von is a special kind of athlete who has a great feel for scoring points. He can pass, shoot and dribble and do them all well. He is also able to utilize his size to his advantage, which makes him even more dangerous."
Leonard Hamilton,"There was a period where he kind of backed off his offensive aggressiveness to be a good team member. Now that we're kind of a little more in sync, the nature of the game is giving him certain opportunities."
Leonard Hamilton,"Andrew probably has been through as much adversity as any youngster I've known in my coaching career, just having the number of injuries he's had to endure. He's always maintained a positive attitude, and he's earned respect of his teammates. They're extremely happy for him."
Leonard Hamilton,I think I just have to let the ACC's action speak for itself.
Leonard Hamilton,This team has shown ability to bounce back and I guess this is another opportunity for us to show our faith and courage.
Marci Hamilton,"We won't know his actual views until his first opinions at the court appear,"
Marci Hamilton,"The poll numbers are bad. Katrina is added to other failures. The moderate choices look better politically,"
Marci Hamilton,"The poll numbers are bad. [Hurricane] Katrina is added to other failures. The moderate choices look better politically,"
Marci Hamilton,"The statute treats the Boy Scouts and the 4H Club and the church identically. Any organization that was overseeing children is subject to the law,"
Richard Hamilton,"We handle a lot of transactions with very few problems,"
Richard Hamilton,"If we've got a team down, we've got to keep them down. We can't play with them, we can't fool with them. All our losses probably this year, we had a team down 15 or 16 points. So when we've got them down, we've got to keep a foot on the pedal."
Richard Hamilton,"Usually, these games are tough to play, because you're looking at a week off. But our energy was great. We didn't want to lose two in a row, and we wanted to make a statement."
Richard Hamilton,"You go against these guys every night, there's not a whole lot of conversation. To get an opportunity to be on the same team and have fun with 'em is a great thing."
Richard Hamilton,"The only thing I know is he's supposed to coach his team. He don't need to be on the sideline running his mouth, trying to talk trash from the bench. He's not a player no more, he's a coach. His job is to coach his team, not to have little slick stuff to say from the bench."
Richard Hamilton,"My thing is, your job is to coach the team. Your job is not to say stuff to me, and that's what got me (ticked) off."
Robert Hamilton,We are seeking any new work we can get.
Robert Hamilton,We're trying to cope with the realities. The Navy had a lot of budget difficulties.
Robert Hamilton,"There will always be ad-hoc communication, but gambling that critical information gets communicated properly is dangerous, especially as you increase the number of active projects. Mistakes mean re-work, and I know that Phil hates rework more than anything."
Robert Hamilton,We are very concerned about that area of the business right now.

Scott Hamilton,There's more to sports than just being big and strong and quick.
Scott Hamilton,"As part of our testing, we identified a vulnerability that could have compromised the security of the application, so we need to take another week to bolster our protection."
Scott Hamilton,It's the ultimate reality television.
Scott Hamilton,"Theoretically, it's probably not going to be worth your while to apply. That's one of the problems we're working on. We have to go back to our original intent (for the money). It is our intent to help people who relied on the government. There are people who have already started to rebuild. How do you go back and help them?"
Scott Hamilton,It's hard to ask people who have been through so much for patience. But no one has ever done this before.
Scott Hamilton,"If people have come back, if they don't have the right information, if we create problems up front that have to be solved later, it'll delay everything."
Scott Hamilton,"We will cheer Emily on enthusiastically, but my heart hurts for Michelle Kwan."
Scott Hamilton,"You know, it's funny ... skating has always given me life,"
Scott Hamilton,"I don't care how many of these things I can inject into my body, am I going to be able to compete with Shaquille O'Neal on the basketball court? No. Or would he be able to compete with me on the skating surface? No. So there's a lot to just basic genetics, body style, physical stature, and then the mental capability, too. There's more to sports than just being big and strong and quick."
Scott Hamilton,"Without strength and courage it's really hard to perform at the highest levels of international figure skating, because you're alone on the ice and you only have seven minutes over two nights to prove yourself."
Scott Hamilton,"When you're expected to win and you have the press saying that you are going to win the Olympic gold medal, and you're the only sure thing in the Olympics, it can undermine your confidence."
Scott Hamilton,"That's what makes the Ryder Cup in golf so much better than the Masters or the U.S. Open. To be a part of something that is not about personal achievement, but about representing everyone and sharing it with the whole country, it's wonderful."
Scott Hamilton,"So as an amateur Olympic competitor I loved criticism, because it made me better. But now as a professional I don't really know how to channel it or where to take it, so I don't take it quite as well."
Scott Hamilton,"Most other competitions are individual achievements, but the Olympic Games is something that belongs to everybody."
Scott Hamilton,Male figure skating is different than female figure skating; we're not America's sweetheart.
Scott Hamilton,I'm very accessible. I don't get into this ego thing.
Scott Hamilton,I was nine-years-old when I first put on skates.
Scott Hamilton,I was more interested in skating and the girls and traveling than I was in calculus.
Scott Hamilton,I started skating and I kind of liked it because I could run circles around the guys that wouldn't pick me to play baseball.
Scott Hamilton,"I just try to touch people's hearts in a way through skating, so they're not just witnessing a performance, they're feeling a performance and they're a part of it."
Scott Hamilton,I had a ninth grade teacher who told me I was much smarter and much better than I was allowing myself to be.
Scott Hamilton,I don't think most teachers realize how much impact they have.
Scott Hamilton,"Half of figure skating is opinion, convincing judges."
Scott Hamilton,"From the fall of October, 1980 to March, 1984 I never lost a competition."
Scott Hamilton,"Fame is a very confusing thing, because you are recognized by a lot of people that you've never seen before, and they're at a great advantage."
Scott Hamilton,Everything that I've ever been able to accomplish in skating and in life has come out of adversity and perseverance.
Scott Hamilton,"But I never really thought that I would be extraordinarily successful at skating, it's just something that happened, you know."
Scott Hamilton,And the fact that I liked to show off and be the center of attention really lends itself to figure skating very well.
Scott Hamilton,"And so figure skating was a great vehicle for me to kind of be competitive at something, without having to be big."
Scott Hamilton,"Adversity, and perseverance and all these things can shape you. They can give you a value and a self-esteem that is priceless."
Scott Hamilton,What was really funny is that as I got older all those guys who called me a sissy in junior high school wanted me to be their best friend because they wanted to meet all the girls that I knew in figure skating.
Scott Hamilton,Rationality is not one of this industry's attributes.
Scott Hamilton,The high road is always respected. Honesty and integrity are always rewarded.
Scott Hamilton,"I didn't want to be the sissy figure skater, you know."
Scott Hamilton,"When you turn professional, you become an entertainer, and like every other entertainer, you don't want to get a bad review."

Steve Hamilton,"They are so incensed about the neglect, they risk getting caught themselves, ... This is not uncommon."
Steve Hamilton,"He went a little wider than I wanted to go, but I had a lot of horse and he did the rest."
Steve Hamilton,Food should be enjoyed rather than endured.
Marvin Hamlisch,"I would love to find other pop stars who would be willing to tour with our orchestra. One of the benefits of James Taylor was that he had orchestrations. Many stars do not. My wish list would be exceedingly long, and at the top of it would be Kenny G and Carly Simon. Of course, the cost of some of these artists might be prohibitive."
Marvin Hamlisch,learned about listening to yourself. You know the punch line but it has to seem as if you're going to find it.
Marvin Hamlisch,"Up until then, I was just zooming along. At Julliard, there was real competition."
Marvin Hamlisch,"Barbra Streisand is without a doubt one of the most honest people I have ever known. There is no doubt in my mind that she will not be doing any more concerts. Of course, she still will be making records and starring and directing in movies."
Marvin Hamlisch,"I started studying music at the age of five and a half. My older sister was taking piano lessons. When her teacher left our apartment, I would get up on the piano bench and start picking out the notes that were part of my sister's lessons."
Marvin Hamlisch,There have been studies that clearly state that children who are exposed to arts education at a young age will in fact do markedly better in their SAT tests.
Marvin Hamlisch,I auditioned and was accepted to the Juilliard School of Music Preparatory Division at the age of six and a half.
Mia Hamm,"You may get skinned knees and elbows, but it's worth it if you score a spectacular goal."
Mia Hamm,"You can't just beat a team, you have to leave a lasting impression in their minds so they never want to see you again."

Mia Hamm,"If you don't love what you do, you won't do it with much conviction or passion."
Mia Hamm,"Take your victories, whatever they may be, cherish them, use them, but don't settle for them."
Mia Hamm,"No-one gets an iron-clad guarantee of success. Certainly, factors like opportunity, luck and timing are important. But the backbone of success is usually found in old-fashioned, basic concepts like hard work, determination, good planning and perseverance."
Mia Hamm,It is more difficult to stay on top than to get there.
Mia Hamm,"True champions aren't always the ones that win, but those with the most guts."
Mia Hamm,Failure happens all the time. It happens every day in practice. What makes you better is how you react to it.
Mia Hamm,"I am a member of a team, and I rely on the team, I defer to it and sacrifice for it, because the team, not the individual, is the ultimate champion."
Mia Hamm,"I am building a fire, and everyday I train, I add more fuel. At just the right moment, I light the match."
Mia Hamm,I've worked too hard and too long to let anything stand in the way of my goals. I will not let my teammates down and I will not let myself down.
Dag Hammarskjold,"The breaking wave and the muscle as it contracts obey the same law. Delicate line gathers the body's total strength in a bold balance. Shall my soul meet so severe a curve, journeying on its way to form?"
Dag Hammarskjold,"The Assembly has witnessed over the last weeks how historical truth is established; once an allegation has been repeated a few times, it is no longer an allegation, it is an established fact, even if no evidence has been brought out in order to support it."
Dag Hammarskjold,"When the morning's freshness has been replaced by the weariness of midday, when the leg muscles give under the strain, the climb seems endless, and suddenly nothing will go quite as you wish-it is then that you must not hesitate."
Dag Hammarskjold,Praise those of your critics for whom nothing is up to standard.
Dag Hammarskjold,Every deed and every relationship is surrounded by an atmosphere of silence. Friendship needs no words -- it is solitude delivered from the anguish of loneliness.
Dag Hammarskjold,Freedom from fear could be said to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights
Dag Hammarskjold,"Time goes by, reputation increases, ability declines."

Mark Hammerl,"The fire itself was put out relatively easily and the damage to that roof was repaired within the first week. Since then we have just been battling the results of some smoke damage. With a business in the building of this size, it becomes a large project very similar to what we went through to open the business."
Mark Hammerl,"They gave me a call about 1 o'clock and said, 'Mark, your building is on fire and you better get back here.' Everything changed from that point."
Dashiell Hammett,The truth is you don't like the theater except the times when you're in a room by yourself putting the play on paper.

Dashiell Hammett,The roof might fall in; anything could happen.

John Hammond,We're still hopeful. We want to be in the running.

Earl Hamner,"I think I can go to Schuyler, ... Some feelings of sadness have melted away."
Earl Hamner,All Dogs Go To Heaven
Earl Hamner,"People think all I am is Mr. Walton, ... I've done books and movies and radio. My life has covered the entire span of commercial TV."
Casey Hampton,"Jerome's our guy. It wasn't even his idea to do it. We support Jerome, and we did all we could to get him back to end his career here. That's the type of team we have. We're very close. There's no 'me guys' on the team. We all support each other."
Casey Hampton,"We kind of got away [from the blitz] with [Tim] Lewis here. We didn't blitz like we did in the past. LeBeau brought it back. You don't know where the blitz is coming from, and that helps."
Casey Hampton,"They have problems because we come at you from so many different kind of ways, they don't know where the blitz is coming from. I think that's the main thing that causes problems (for the offense)."
Casey Hampton,"That might be a good strategy for a video game. But you don't question him. He's a great coach. From the standpoint of me being me, I'd feel we would stop them and block the field goal."
Casey Hampton,"Denver kind of kept the same thing going. He's a good coach who teaches the right techniques, so you've got to kind of have good technique to do it."
Fred Hampton,I believe I'm going to die doing the things I was born to do. I believe I'm going to die high off the people. I believe I'm going to die a revolutionary in the international revolutionary proletarian struggle.
Fred Hampton,"You can jail a revolutionary, but you can't jail the revolution."
Fred Hampton,"Let me just say: Peace to you, if you're willing to fight for it."
Mike Hampton,"If you'd told me I'd have these problems from the first month of the season, I'd have told you were crazy. But you can't dwell on it. Right now, I feel pretty good. I feel like I can help this team."
Mike Hampton,"Lee truly was a giant in the health insurance industry. Those of us who have worked for him were greatly honored to have that opportunity and we will miss him deeply. Not only was he our boss, but he was a true friend."

Mike Hampton,The doctors were surprised that I was able to pitch with the velocity that I had.
Mike Hampton,"It's just disappointing that my body won't allow me to do what I love to do, ... It won't let me go out there and compete. It's been frustrating. Now we've got to find out what's wrong so that I can get it taken care of, so I don't have to worry about it for the next three years."
Mike Hampton,"I'm disappointed my body won't let me do what I want to do, that it won't let me pitch and compete,"

George Hancock,"I think it's probably to do with the fact that the industry itself has some enemies, kind of neo-prohibitionists. There's always someone trying to basically put us out of business or increase our excise taxes or whatever."
George Hancock,"That's the frustrating thing - we have world-class beers brewed in Washington and, really, no one's telling the story. No one's out there explaining ... that this is the Bordeaux country for beer."

Herbie Hancock,I look for what's of value and extract that. I don't look to criticize.
Herbie Hancock,Technology has developed to a whole other level and there's the scientist part of me that loves that stuff.

Herbie Hancock,"When you struggle to reach for something you don't know, that's where the most interesting stuff is."
Herbie Hancock,"A lot of this look backwards in society and musically is to find some of the real roots, because they can't find them here. There are roots in the past, but not so much now. Maybe this explains their need to do that, and if that's the case, it's OK."
Herbie Hancock,"From '70 to '73 I'd had a sextet, but the band was not self-supporting and I couldn't afford it, so I broke it up. And then I didn't know what kind of music I wanted to do, because I was just fed up to here with it. It wasn't fulfilling anymore."
Herbie Hancock,I want to have a purpose.
Herbie Hancock,"When you try to define a purity as being something that's closed and limited, you're not talking about the music that I play called jazz."
Herbie Hancock,"I was making a hierarchy out of music, and it's ridiculous."
Herbie Hancock,"Recently I've been listening to Mahler; it's beautiful stuff. I just saw a performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony on television, and it was awesome. The music was so gorgeous I wasn't just crying tears, I was sobbing."
Herbie Hancock,Jazz is a music that translates the moment into a sense of inspiration for not only the musicians but for the listeners.
Herbie Hancock,"I agree with taking the time and respecting the great innovators of the past, but the word innovation would cease to exist if we all do is look at the past."
Herbie Hancock,"But if I'm banging my head against a wall because I can't come up with any ideas, that's not so much fun."
Herbie Hancock,I'm happy if anything that I did takes the limelight.
Herbie Hancock,"That's one of the reasons for the title of the record, Future 2 Future, because here they are creating kind of a new musical approach, underground approach, but coming out of what used to be underground but what has become popular, which is the whole hip-hop scene."
Herbie Hancock,You don't need the fame to be vital.
Herbie Hancock,"I brought my 40 years of jazz experience to the table, ... but I wanted to make something more ambitious than a little box."
Herbie Hancock,Things that happen to you are events. It's what you do with them that determine whether they're going to be problems or solutions.
Herbie Hancock,"A method that doesn't use what you know. It's just pure, raw emotion."
Herbie Hancock,"We've been looking at machines for so long, I really wish the technology community would look at human beings first for a change, let's balance the thing out."
Herbie Hancock,"When I'm sensitive to the circumstances surrounding me, then I can be inspired by them or use them in whatever I may be creating."

Herbie Hancock,"When I was in my early teens, I remember coming to the conclusion that your life never ends."
Herbie Hancock,Music is the tool to express life - and all that makes a difference.
Herbie Hancock,"Since time is a continuum, the moment is always different, so the music is always different."
Herbie Hancock,"In the past, there's always been one leader that has led the pack to development of the music."
Herbie Hancock,Creativity shouldn't be following radio; it should be the other way around.
Herbie Hancock,I'm always interested in looking forward toward the future. Carving out new ways of looking at things.
Herbie Hancock,"It pulled me like a magnet, jazz did, because it was a way that I could express myself."
Herbie Hancock,The music becomes something that is its own entity.
Herbie Hancock,I'm always looking to create new avenues or new visions of music.
Herbie Hancock,"When I was coming up, I practiced all the time because I thought if I didn't I couldn't do my best."

Herbie Hancock,"Being a musician is what I do, but it's not what I am."
Herbie Hancock,Nobody told me I was a child prodigy.
Herbie Hancock,It is people's hearts that move the age.
Herbie Hancock,Not too many people my age really zeroed in on the blues. Most of the people that listened to it were older than teenagers.
Herbie Hancock,"Don't be afraid to expand yourself, to step out of your comfort zone. That's where the joy and the adventure lie."
Herbie Hancock,"The thing that we possess, that machines don't, is the ability to exhibit wisdom."
Herbie Hancock,Music happens to be an art form that transcends language.
Herbie Hancock,But I have to be careful not to let the world dazzle me so much that I forget that I'm a husband and a father.
James Hancock,I've never heard of anyone burying horses.
James Hancock,"I don't think you'd bury horses three or four feet across,"
James Hancock,"Everyone here went out and grabbed up the hoses to try to help out until the fire department arrived. All I could think of was using the hose to help stop the fire from spreading. I formerly worked for the fire service when I was in the military, so I focused on the hot embers to help stop them from spreading,"
James Hancock,"Everyone here went out and grabbed up the hoses to try to help out until the fire department arrived. All I could think of was using the hose to help stop the fire from spreading.

James Hancock,The fire appeared to have started in an old shed behind our neighbor's house.
James Hancock,"We just do what we're told, because Coach Kane is a great coach. Our strengths are we want to be good, and we are willing to play hard. We can hang with some of those in teams in the Top 10."
John Hancock,"If the July jobs report was bad news, at least it wasn't awful news,"
John Hancock,"Maybe we need to fall on the common-sense side of protecting these species, but continue harvesting wood products we all use and enjoy. We've got to be able to do both -- protect water quality and species, as well as harvest trees."
John Hancock,The greatest ability in business is to get along with others and to influence their actions.
Tony Hancock,"We try to... we are, I suppose to a certain extent all affected and erm, that is both funny and sad I think."

Tony Hancock,I don't think I gain anything by seeing myself.
Tony Hancock,"And erm, perhaps looking like this it was perhaps the only thing I could do."
Learned Hand,"Yet with all the attraction that it has, our youth cannot long remain without feeling the narrowness of simply a classification of the world. Life is not a thing of knowing only - nay, mere knowledge has properly no place at all save as it becomes the handmaiden of feeling and emotion."
Learned Hand,"I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much upon constitutions, upon laws and upon courts. These are false hopes; believe me, these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it..."
Learned Hand,"While I should be the last to say that the making of a profit was not in itself a pleasure, I hope I should also be one of those to agree that there were other pleasures than making a profit"

Learned Hand,The aim of law is the maximum gratification of the nervous system of man
Learned Hand,"They taught me, not by precept, but by example, that nothing is more commendable, and more fair, than that a man should lay aside all else, and seek truth; not to preach what he might find; and surely not to try to make his views prevail; but, like Lessing, to find his satisfaction in the search itself."

Jack Handey,"A funny thing is if you're out hiking and your friend gets bit by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going for help, then go about ten feet and pretend YOU got bit by a snake. Then start an argument about who's going to get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke. - (Deep Thoughts) Saturday Night Live"

Michael Haneke,"I wanted to confront someone with something he had done as a child. That was the general idea, guilt and consequences. Then I wanted to make a film with Daniel Auteuil.

Lee Haney,When your goal is to put on muscle mass you must increase your calorie intake as you increase the activity level being given to the muscle.

Glen Hansard,"Things really stepped up for us over here after that tour. And it's funny, because up to that, things were really grooving along â€” the records were on sale and in stores, and everything was moving along really nice â€” but then we did the Damien Rice tour, and it opened up this whole new audience to us. It put us on a whole different level. Well, not a level, but a whole different place with a new audience, which I kind of found exciting and a little bit strange."

Tyler Hansbrough,"I'm not one of those guys that wants to come out and score 40 every game. I just want to be a solid player. Our team came out and won in a tough place, and ultimately, that's what I want."
Tyler Hansbrough,"The NBA is definitely a goal of mine down the line, but right now I am enjoying college a great deal and feel I can improve in every phase of my game. I enjoy school, my teammates and being part of the Carolina basketball program."

Mike Hanson,We don't see a lot of these in the Police Department. But we have to take it seriously because it's one person's allegation that it was an intentional act.

John Harbaugh,"You can trust him,"
John Harbaugh,"It's a great opportunity, though, to teach our guys, and I think that's what it really is. If it was going to happen, it couldn't happen at a better time, the first preseason game. So, you just take it as an opportunity. There is no greater teacher than experience."
John Harbaugh,"The thing about special teams - and I think football in general - is sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you,"

Tim Hardaway,You have to look at how chemistry develops.
Tim Hardaway,"When your team drops out, you make the ABA look bad."

Phil Hardberger,"I'd love to build in the feeling of early San Antonio, which was an oasis, which was why everybody came here. Urbanization has to some degree wiped that out ... we've been cutting trees and putting cement everywhere we can since then."
Phil Hardberger,"This year's general-fund revenue, paid for by property-tax revenues, fines, fees and City Public Service income is $728 million. Last year was $620 million, which is (about) a 17 percent increase over last year. Phil's not doing anything different than what the rest of them (former mayors) do. That money comes from taxpayers' pockets."
Phil Hardberger,It's always possible. It's a tough business and certainly that's not unknown that they leverage one city against the other. I don't believe so myself. I think they have some serious interest in San Antonio. But perhaps I'm of a trusting nature.

Rusty Hardin,We are still in negotiations and not close to agreement yet. Reports of an agreement being announced today are premature.
Lindsey Harding,That's our strength. We didn't have many fast-break points that I can remember in the first half. We had to take advantage of our transition game. That's where we score a lot. Coach told us at halftime we have so much depth and we have to play hard enough to use it.
Lindsey Harding,"I was pushing it as fast as I could. Our wings were getting out and our posts were running the floor. We had so much depth, we were able to keep going and going and going."
Lindsey Harding,"Some people went home, and I went out with friends. All of us left campus, and I just knew that I could not wait to get back to practice."
Lindsey Harding,"We made her get up on the bus and start singing and dancing. She did a little twist on the bus, but she gets embarrassed pretty quickly."
Lindsey Harding,It gives a team a lot of confidence. They might feel like they have momentum. You just feel good when you come off playing really well.
Lindsey Harding,I woke up knowing we were going to win this for her. I wanted to win this for Coach G. I get tired of people saying she can't win the big game.
Lindsey Harding,We were into the game. It was a great basketball game all-around and that was a big shot. You heard Barbara say she's a senior and she wanted it in her hands. She made a big play when it counted.
Lindsey Harding,"I think it's so good for women's basketball. I feel like five or six years ago, the No. 1 team was so far ahead compared to other high-ranked teams. We had four undefeated teams at one point late in the season."
Tonya Harding,"I still put on the skates once in a while, but I do not look back. I had a great career. I hope to have a great career in boxing, too. I am not bitter at the way some people may look at me. Sure, I am trying to turn my image around and be a lady. But you can be a lady, and an athlete, too."
Tonya Harding,She hits me and she beats me and she drinks. My mom is an alcoholic.
Tonya Harding,"I am in absolutely the best shape of my life and ready to go. I am not nervous at all. Physically and mentally, I have never felt better."
Luge Hardman,"We started back then and then worked on getting the support of the city council. The most important fact was that the businesses in downtown supported us. Out of the 24 businesses in downtown, 22 supported us."
Luge Hardman,We'll do it again. We're going to see it through.
Luge Hardman,Our next step will be that Bruce and I will be meeting with the state economic development people and will get the instructions on how to use the grant money and Bruce will be the administrator.
James Hardy,He didn't fall down on purpose. I made him fall down.
James Hardy,"I had this in my mind. I think about it before the game, every game. I see myself doing it before it happens. From the hotels. I'll be on the bus, just daydreaming, listening to music, looking out the window, and I see myself doing everything, and I just come out here and try to do it."
James Hardy,"Last year, he was coming in, and he really didn't know anybody. He was still learning names and their positions. This year, he knows what he wants. Either you're going to be able to do the job or you're not."
James Hardy,"I care too much about the people whose lives and jobs are on the line not to come back and give it all that I have. We're asking taxpayers to sacrifice so much, the least I can do is help explain my position and the position of the board."
James Hardy,"That didn't have anything to do with it. You can't have a great game every game. He played his heart out. We had something to do with the struggles, too."
James Hardy,"I was planning on coming out for basketball this year, but the football season took its toll on me physically. I needed to rest and rehabilitate some injuries. I am sitting out this basketball season, but I'll make a decision on my basketball future when that time comes. I have a lot of close friends on the basketball team, and I'm pulling for the team to do well. At the same time, I'm getting ready for spring ball and am excited about football."

Mike Hargrove,"I'm interested to see him. I don't know that we'll see him at full strength, but I'm kind of interested in seeing what he can do for us."
Mike Hargrove,"the thing sat up and hissed at us, with those nasty teeth showing. We had guys running out of its way."

Mike Hargrove,"I hate to use those two matchup guys, Sherrill and Putz, that early. They both did a great job and gave us a chance to do what we did later."
Mike Hargrove,"He'll get worked real hard,"
Mike Hargrove,"It's not a stretch we're happy with. But we've been in one of those stretches where it seems a lot of bad things happen, when they all come back to bite you in the butt â€” hard."
Mike Hargrove,I saw a stat that said Guerrero has 14 homers against Seattle in 34 games the past two years. That's a ton of homers against one club.
Mike Hargrove,He'll pitch at least one simulated game and probably a 'B' game. We want to get him to the 50- to 55-pitch level before he leaves.
Mike Hargrove,"I think we saw the result of not pitching in a game. Even at that, they only got two hits off him. But he was behind a lot of hitters and threw a lot of pitches."
Mike Hargrove,"The only redeeming thing about this game is, it's over."
Mike Hargrove,"I'm not going to talk about the umpire. Let's talk about something we can control, ... The first two innings were very non-typical of his outings this year."
Mike Hargrove,I'm not going to talk about the umpire. Let's talk about something we can control. The first two innings were very non-typical of his outings this year.
Mike Hargrove,"I honestly believe what we're seeing is Joel gaining confidence and arm strength,"
Mike Hargrove,"I honestly believe what we're seeing is Joel getting confidence and arm strength, ... We're just seeing him get strong and believe in that strength. He had a great changeup."
Mike Hargrove,"When I say Dan Wilson is one of the good guys, for me, that's the ultimate compliment. Very few of us, in all walks of life, rarely say and do the same thing. There's nothing phony about Dan Wilson. He talks the talk and walks the walk. Anytime someone like that leaves, we're all worse off for it."
Mike Hargrove,"With no outs and a runner on second, it's a good play. It was his choice to get the runner over like that, and it was his second great bunt in two nights."
Mike Hargrove,It was certainly the most nerve-wracking way to go. But we'll benefit in the long run by having him ready for the rest of the month.
Mike Hargrove,"Tonight he was really good. He can get wild and throw a lot of balls. We tried to let him do that, but he didn't."
Mike Hargrove,He threw a lot of strikes and got a lot of ground balls. I really expected him to throw a complete game. But the Angels have an awfully good ballclub and you have to keep them down when they are down.
Mike Hargrove,I didn't like it that our guys threw so many balls. They were all throwing strikes pitching in the bullpen. It is amazing what happens when you put a hitter at the plate.
Mike Hargrove,We gave up four quick ones and never got back in it. We didn't even hit many balls hard.
Mike Hargrove,"He's one-for-three as an outfielder. That's catching balls, not hitting."
Mike Hargrove,"He didn't have command of anything. He got away with some hanging breaking balls early, but he didn't get away with the one he threw to Barajas. It wasn't a good night for Felix."
Mike Hargrove,"He didn't have command of anything, ... He got away with some hanging breaking balls early, but he didn't get away with the one he threw to Barajas. It wasn't a good night for Felix."
Mata Hari,"I am a woman who enjoys herself very much; sometimes I lose, sometimes I win."
Mata Hari,"He's used to life in the fast lane, travels all over the world, already risks his life racing at over 300km/h and seems to be handy with a gun,"
Mata Hari,The dance is a poem of which each movement is a world.
Mata Hari,The dance is a poem of which each movement is a word
Keith Haring,"I don't think art is propaganda; it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further. It celebrates humanity instead of manipulating it."
Keith Haring,"See, when I paint, it is an experience that, at its best, is transcending reality."
Keith Haring,My contribution to the world is my ability to draw. I will draw as much as I can for as many people as I can for as long as I can.
Keith Haring,"People were more interested in the phenomena than the art itself. This, combined with the growing interest in collecting art as an investment and the resultant boom in the art market, made it a difficult time for a young artist to remain sincere without becoming cynical."
Keith Haring,"There are some images that I will only use once, and not use again because they don't seem to really hit the nail right on the head, but there are some which are so strong they have to be reduced; sometimes just reusing them makes them stronger."
Keith Haring,"I think you have to control the materials to an extent, but it's important to let the materials have a kind of power for themselves; like the natural power of gravity, if you are painting on a wall, it makes the paint trickle and it drips; there is no reason to fight that."
Keith Haring,Drawing is still basically the same as it has been since prehistoric times. It brings together man and the world. It lives through magic.
Keith Haring,"The dripping... well, if it happens, it happens; it does not take anything from the work. The dripping just proves that you were not trying to control the work, but the work was developing by itself and if it drips, it's a natural part in the evolution of the work."
Keith Haring,"Red is one of the strongest colors, it's blood, it has a power with the eye. That's why traffic lights are red I guess, and stop signs as well... In fact I use red in all of my paintings."
Keith Haring,"When it is working, you completely go into another place, you're tapping into things that are totally universal, completely beyond your ego and your own self. That's what it's all about."
Rafik Hariri,was organized by Syrian and Lebanese security officials.
Rafik Hariri,"We would like to see the United States play a more effective role to push the peace process forward,"
Rafik Hariri,made it very clear ... that the United States is engaged in the peace process.
Rafik Hariri,"The elections are behind us and we don't see anything in front of us but the future of Lebanon,"
Rafik Hariri,affirms to the Lebanese that he will continue to shoulder the responsibility in safeguarding the constitution and the laws.
Rafik Hariri,could not have been taken without the approval of top-ranked Syrian security officials and could not have been further organized without the collusion of their counterparts in the Lebanese security forces.
Tom Harkin,"If we can have a real recount in every county, it may take a few weeks, but it's worth it."
Tom Harkin,"I'm afraid that if we don't have some peacekeeping forces here that the intimidation and the level of violence might increase to the point where the election could be in jeopardy. And we cannot let that happen,"
Tom Harkin,"She was a citizen in the best sense of the word. She caused things to happen in our society that made us a better, more caring, more just society."
Tom Harkin,Shuttering nearly a fourth of the FSA offices in Iowa can only lead to more inconvenience and less service for Iowans.
Tom Harkin,"It's hard to believe the objective is better service when on its face, this plan to shutter nearly a fourth of Iowa's county offices will lead to more driving, greater inconvenience and less service,"
Tom Harkin,"I've said time and time again, there is little risk of BSE in U.S. beef, but it is obvious that we have not yet convinced key trading partners of that."
Tom Harkin,"Alarm bells must be rung, ... The warning signs are there and we have to start preparing. The time for planning and thinking about it is past. We have to do something immediately."
Tom Harkin,How many poor people are going to go on the Internet to apply for food stamps?
Tom Harkin,Parents should know that our schools are now one of the largest sources of unhealthy food for their kids.
Tom Harkin,"We should be preparing right now, setting appropriations, for the introductions of Bradley fighting vehicles, tanks, armored personnel carriers and ground forces into Kosovo,"
Tom Harkin,"Human cloning will take place, and it will take place in my lifetime. And I don't fear it at all -- I welcome it. I think it's right and proper that we continue this kind of inquiry."
Tom Harkin,"I am pleased that the Iowa Department of Education is receiving this important funding to provide gifted and talented programs in alternative schools, ... It is important that all schools in Iowa have the resources to help gifted and talented students reach their full potential."
Tom Harkin,Our escalating dependence on foreign and non-renewable sources of energy is heading us down a slippery slope.
Tom Harkin,"When we debate the impeachment of the president of the United States, this is something that affects every citizen of this country, and I believe they have a right again to witness that debate and to witness how and why we reach those decisions."
Tom Harkin,America's health care system is in crisis precisely because we systematically neglect wellness and prevention.
Tom Harkin,"Trust us' is not something the administration can say after Katrina, ... I don't think Congress is in a mood to trust. We want plans. We want specific goals and procedures we're going to take to prepare for this."
Tom Harkin,"If we are serious about combating the childhood obesity epidemic and improving child nutrition, then everyone must chip in -- parents, schools, and yes even Congress."
Tom Harkin,"Fortunately, the situation today is not as dire, but family farms continue to face big challenges  especially young people."
Tom Harkin,"This has created ridiculous situations where companies have sought $5 million and as a condition for approval they have been required to have that much money in the bank, ... If they have that much money in the bank, why would they need the loan?"
Tom Harkin,"Hurricane Katrina ripped the mask off of George Bush's America,"
Tom Harkin,"Let's face it, in America today we don't have a health care system, we have a sick care system. We wait until people become obese, develop chronic diseases, or become disabled - and then we spend untold hundreds of billions annually to try to make them better."
Tom Harkin,"Let's face it, in America today we don't have a health care system, we have a sick care system."
Tom Harkin,"If Congress is aware of the problems facing poor people in America, cuts in hunger assistance programs should not be part of any deficit reduction package,"
Tom Harkin,"Dana Reeve has already faced more than her fair share of adversity, but I know that she will face this latest challenge, as she has the others, with strength, dignity, courage and grace."
Tom Harkin,"It almost seems then that they will be allocated based upon a state's ability to pay, ... How are you going to ask Louisiana right now to come up with the money for that. Take Mississippi . They've been hit hard."
Jean Harlow,No one ever expects a great lay to pay all the bills.
Jean Harlow,I like to wake up each morning feeling a new man.
Jean Harlow,"When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas."
Butch Harmon,"I have told Tiger and his parents when they asked me that I think, physically, his game is at a level where he can play and succeed on the professional tour."
Butch Harmon,It's hard to believe. It just came out of the blue. He was fine last night and gone this morning.
Butch Harmon,"[Butch Harmon, who has worked with top players from Greg Norman to Woods, says one of the most common mistakes recreational golfers make is to practice without purpose.] They tend to go to the range, warm up with some irons and then whale away with the driver, ... There is no plan to what they are doing."
Butch Harmon,"These guys have no fear? Not to them, it's not; they've been doing it all their lives."
Mark Harmon,"Actors who come on this show concerned about where the camera is are in trouble, because you don't know and you shouldn't think about it."
Mark Harmon,"The thing to do is not to compete with quantity, but with quality. Quality and reliability are so valuable that [employers] will be less concerned with volume. I expect to work a little harder than anyone else, but I don't begrudge that."
Mark Harmon,"It couldn't have worked out any better. We have had zero problems. At small schools, we have to remind ourselves we're here for the kids. It's not just the wins and losses, but giving kids opportunity."
Mark Harmon,"But at the same time, it is a lovely place to work. I never lose perspective. You want to talk about hard work, let's talk about working in a coal mine."
Mark Harmon,"We have a lot more competition in practice this year. They have bonded real well. That's easy for you or me to say, but it's not always easy for kids competing for the same position. The way we have approached it is that we have five move-ins ... let's get to work."
Mark Harmon,"I recognized this as a strong character piece, where there is always a caper."
Ben Harper,You're definitely a different person at different stages in your life.
Ben Harper,You have to do what you believe in.
Ben Harper,We went for the best overall feel on each song. There are no musical overdubs at all. It's a true live record; it's one of the few true live records out there.
Ben Harper,"We figured you could download live shows for days, so we decided to go for a cream-of-the-crop approach, but not just take the best vocal or the best performances."
Ben Harper,"The music is in the lead here, and a large part of this, I have no idea what I'm doing. I feel a closer bond with the craft of songwriting, stronger than I ever have."
Ben Harper,"That happens every time I get behind a guitar, regardless of what I'm saying, 'cause music is freedom and being free is the closest I've ever felt to being spiritual."
Ben Harper,Sometimes I think to talk too much about music almost cheapens it.
Ben Harper,"Sometimes I may be totally arrogant, sometimes I may totally be the most humble guy you've ever met, sometimes I may be in between. But that's life. Who isn't like that? What's the big deal if I had an arrogant moment."
Ben Harper,"So it's not so much that I set out to do something different, it's just that the songs themselves require their own individual voice and attention."
Ben Harper,Right now I'm listening to a lot of different things but I listen to a lot of classical music. Eventually I would like to compose and perform classical.
Ben Harper,"My head works in music, so there's always music there."
Ben Harper,"If it comes out sounding like Dixieland jazz or classical or punk or rock or even slightly metal, that's because that's where I'm going to find inspiration."
Ben Harper,"If I'm inspired and music inspires me, then I will continue to play it."
Ben Harper,"If I fall, I fall. I'll rise up like anybody else."
Ben Harper,"If I don't have the potential to write in different styles and sing in different voices and play in different ways, I won't stay inspired."
Ben Harper,"I'm really looking forward to, not more of the same, but a continual growth."
Ben Harper,I'm not going to do the Ben Harper house record or the Ben Harper drum 'n' bass record.
Ben Harper,I refuse to make uninspired music.
Ben Harper,I refuse to age disgracefully in rock 'n' roll.
Ben Harper,I really feel there's no limitation on what this band can do in the studio or on the stage. That's an empowering feeling - that we can bring a song to life.
Ben Harper,I really feel like the sky is the limit with the Innocent Criminals today.
Ben Harper,"I love being on the road, I love playing."
Ben Harper,I just want to keep doing what I feel.
Ben Harper,"I grew up listening to spiritual music, Blind Willie Johnson and folk."
Ben Harper,I get diminishing returns when I bore myself in an interview.
Ben Harper,"I feel it strong in my heart and sing it and write it just because that's a part of Ben Harper, that's just a part of me, that makes me who I am."
Ben Harper,Folk is bare bones music.
Ben Harper,But I would never insult the people that love this music and I would never insult the blessing of music in my life and I would never insult myself by playing uninspired music.
Ben Harper,"As long as the songs are strong, I think you can express yourself in any style and have it be soulful and have it be your own voice."
Ben Harper,The Blind Boys are truly the deepest well of American musical heritage you can discover.
Ben Harper,It will make a weak man mighty. it will make a mighty man fall. It will fill your heart and hands or leave you with nothing at all. It's the eyes for the blind and legs for the lame. It is the love for hate and pride for shame. That's the power of the gospel.
Ben Harper,"You look like gold. I've been fooled before, but now i know I've made the mistake in the past. But now i, now i know the difference from gold and brass."
John Harper,We want to try to get a better understanding of the lakes and their relation to the groundwater.
John Harper,He is a brilliant demagogue. But it is not working now. He knows that he's in trouble.
John Harper,I really think he has national potential.
John Harper,"Fairly common sense, straightforward stuff. Who can disagree with that?"
Stephen Harper,"Set your sights not just on the next few weeks ... set your sights on the years ahead -- because our vision will look that far ahead,"
Stephen Harper,"All indications I've had to this point is that Mr. Layton still will not support a motion to bring down the government,"
Stephen Harper,made the [expense] rules up himself. And those rules allowed him to claim any kind of expense he wanted.
Stephen Harper,"When Paul Martin comes after us, as he will - when he comes after me, as he's already planning - take that as proof we are on the right track,"
Stephen Harper,"It was the removing of a regime that was hostile, that clearly had the intention of constructing weapons systems."
Stephen Harper,"I am waiting to hear somebody in the Prime Minister's Office put out some information that is contrary to what we're reading in the papers now,"
Stephen Harper,"We will honor your trust, we will deliver on our commitments."
Stephen Harper,It is a great honor and a feeling of great responsibility to be sworn in as the 22nd prime minister of Canada.
Stephen Harper,"You know, the public health system is the only one most Canadians have ever used. It's the only one my family has ever used. We've just got to make it work."
Stephen Harper,"Why, when the auditor-general condemned this practice in the sponsorship scandal, does this government still award contracts with no proper audit paper trail?"
Stephen Harper,"Canadians have seen nothing other than 100 days of inaction from the government,"
Stephen Harper,All too often we hear stories of veterans who are ignored or disrespected by government. What a shameful way to treat men and women who risked their lives to defend Canada. This shame will end with the election of a new government.
Stephen Harper,We're not going to try to force a vote unless we think we can win it.
Stephen Harper,We will improve Canadians' faith in our public institutions by making government more accountable and effective.
Stephen Harper,"The government will join, notwithstanding its failure to prepare, its neglect in co-operating with its allies, or its inability to contribute. In the end it will join out of the necessity created by a pattern of uncertainty and indecision. It will not join as a leader but unnoticed at the back of the parade."
Stephen Harper,"That would be our expectation, ... I'm obviously open to quicker timetables, but we're prepared for that one."
Stephen Harper,"Buying pollution credits is folly; it doesn't help the environment. Instead of using tax dollars to buy credits overseas, we'll use them at home."
Stephen Harper,"We all know that I would have preferred an election by now. We didn't have one,"
Stephen Harper,"It has fallen off because we're in the summer and not having an election,"
Stephen Harper,"I like the position we're in. I think we're ready for an election. I think we've got the members, the money and candidates and the support we need to have an election at any time."
Stephen Harper,"The single most important duty of the federal government is to protect and defend our national sovereignty. There are new and disturbing reports of American nuclear submarines passing though Canadian waters without obtaining the permission of, or even notifying, the Canadian government."
Stephen Harper,"If the special envoy were to conclude that this is not a direction in which the United States wishes to go, then Canada will have to make other long-term choices in its economic infrastructure,"
Stephen Harper,I've made no secret of our desire to rebuild the Canadian military to have the capacities of a sovereign nation. To make foreign policy decisions that are not only independent but are actually noticed by other powers around the world.
Stephen Harper,"I'd anticipated the Liberals would want to delay the election at least until the spring, if not longer, ... But look, if there's a necessity to have a fall election and the NDP ceases to prop up the government, that could still happen."
Stephen Harper,"I'm really looking for a clear signal that in fact he wants to defeat the government,"
Stephen Harper,Her dedication will not be forgotten as others follow in her footsteps and continue to build on her accomplishments.
Stephen Harper,"We have to make decisions on where we're going to put our investments and this is not a matter of threatening the United States, it's a matter of reaching assessments of what's in our own long-term best interests."
Stephen Harper,Should the government refuse to debate this motion or refuse to abide by the motion ... I will move a motion of non-confidence in the government the following week.
Stephen Harper,"We were committed at the time of the convention, and through the last debate, to put a free vote to the next Parliament on this issue, ... It will be a genuinely free vote when I am prime minister. I will not whip the cabinet; cabinet can vote as they want."
Stephen Harper,culture of waste and mismanagement.
Stephen Harper,Can the prime minister tell us why this Liberal culture of waste and scandal is only stopped once it is actually exposed publicly?
Stephen Harper,Let the Liberals complain about facing the people. We're interested in facing the future as a party and a country.
Stephen Harper,"This has been an historic evening in this Parliament and this country. This is not just the end of a tired, directionless, scandal-plagued government. It's the start of a bright new future for this country."
Stephen Harper,"A culture of waste, mismanagement and corruption is not going to fix itself,"
Stephen Harper,"What really needs to happen is this culture of waste and mismanagement and corruption that the Liberal Party practices must end,"
Stephen Harper,"This culture of waste, management and corruption that the Liberal Party practices needs to end. I don't think it's going to end with a few firings. I think it's only going to end when we fire the government."
Stephen Harper,"This culture of waste, management and corruption that the Liberal Party practices needs to end, ... I don't think it's going to end with a few firings. I think it's only going to end when we fire the government."
Stephen Harper,"It's all part of the pattern. This is a story of scandal and corruption, investigations, refusals to take responsibility. If this government continues in office, this will continue."
Stephen Harper,"Whether Canada ends up as o-ne national government or two national governments or several national governments, or some other kind of arrangement is, quite frankly, secondary in my opinion."
Stephen Harper,The world is now unipolar and contains o-nly o-ne superpower. Canada shares a continent with that superpower.
Stephen Harper,"I will strive to make this not the highest-spending country in the world, but instead the lowest taxing o-ne."
Stephen Harper,I do not intend to dispute in any way the need for defence cuts and the need for government spending cuts in general. I do not share a not in my backyard approach to government spending reductions.
Stephen Harper,The Leader of the Opposition's constitutional obligation - the obligation to Parliament - it's the reason we did the merger! - is to make sure Canadians have an alternative for government.
Stephen Harper,"We have in this country a federal government that increasingly is engaged in trying to determine which business, which regions, which industries will succeed, which will not through a whole range of economic development, regional development corporate subsidization programs."
Stephen Harper,"I think there is a dangerous rise in defeatist sentiment in this country. I have said that repeatedly, and I mean it and I believe it."
Stephen Harper,The government can only be brought down because it alienates several parties in the House.
Stephen Harper,"What the government has to do, if it wants to govern for any length of time, is it must appeal primarily to the third parties in the House of Commons to get them to support it."
Stephen Harper,I think the way to change it is to handle issues individually when it's essential to do so.
Stephen Harper,"First of all, I can't forget my first responsibility - which is to be the Leader of the Opposition and that's to provide an alternative government."
Stephen Harper,"But I'm very libertarian in the sense that I believe in small government and, as a general rule, I don't believe in imposing values upon people."
Stephen Harper,I don't get into that second guessing of myself publicly.
Stephen Harper,This party will not take its position based o-n public opinion polls. We will not take a stand based o-n focus groups. We will not take a stand based o-n phone-in shows or householder surveys or any other vagaries of pubic opinion.
Stephen Harper,"I've always been clear, I support the traditional definition of marriage."
Stephen Harper,"We'll support the government on issues if it's essential to the country but our primary responsibility is not to prop up the government, our responsibility is to provide an opposition and an alternative government for Parliament and for Canadians."
Stephen Harper,We should have been there shoulder to shoulder with our allies. Our concern is the instability of our government as an ally. We are playing again with national and global security matters.
Stephen Harper,"That's my personal view I would say most in my caucus agree with that but there are some who don't and I've always said that on these kinds of moral issues, people have the right to their own opinions."
Stephen Harper,It's the government's obligation to look really to the third parties to get the support to govern.
Stephen Harper,I have no difficulty with the recognition of civil unions for non-traditional relationships but I believe in law we should protect the traditional definition of marriage.
Stephen Harper,"If you want to be a government in a minority Parliament, you have to work with other people."
Stephen Harper,Make no mistake. Canada is not a bilingual country. In fact it is less bilingual today than it has ever been.
Stephen Harper,"Having hit a wall, the next logical step is not to bang our heads against it."
Stephen Harper,Universality has been severely reduced: it is virtually dead as a concept in most areas of public policy.
Stephen Harper,"If Ottawa giveth, then Ottawa can taketh away."
Stephen Harper,"I think in Atlantic Canada, because of what happened in the decades following Confederation, there is a culture of defeat that we have to overcome."
Stephen Harper,But we want Canada to stay competitive and we want to make sure the dollar is enhancing that.
Stephen Harper,"Minister MacKay, as you all know, has deep roots in Atlantic Canada and is very familiar with PEI and its provincial government. He will serve Islanders well in our new cabinet."
Stephen Harper,"There is a Canadian culture that is in some ways unique to Canada, but I don't think Canadian culture coincides neatly with borders."
Stephen Harper,Strong Canada-U.S. relations are a priority for my government.
Stephen Harper,"Our team is talented and diversified and reflects Canada and we will work hard for all Canadians. The Cabinet that I have put together is smaller, but it will be more focused and more effective."
Stephen Harper,The West has wanted in. The West is in now. Canada will work for all of us.
Stephen Harper,"The United States defends its sovereignty, Canada will defend its sovereignty."
Stephen Harper,Our mission is clear. We will restore faith and trust in our public institutions as we keep Canada strong and united.
Stephen Harper,"That is what has been blurred, ... Frankly, if the Government of Canada would sue the Liberal party, it would provide a wake-up call forever that that is not the same thing."
Stephen Harper,"Each and every day I will assure you of one thing -- I will dedicate myself to making Canada more united, stronger, more prosperous and a safer country."
Stephen Harper,"Since most of these announcements aren't funded in any of the three budgets the Liberals tabled this year, why should anyone believe these promises,"
Stephen Harper,This government has lost the moral authority to run this country because it has been named in a judicial inquiry on corruption.
Stephen Harper,I don't believe this government has the moral authority to govern.
Stephen Harper,"Canada remains alienated from its allies, shut out of the reconstruction process to some degree, unable to influence events. There is no upside to the position Canada took."
Stephen Harper,They're just way behind and they substitute announcements for action.
Stephen Harper,"We've had lots of security announcements from this government and very little action, ... This is part of a pattern of phony announcements. I'll believe it when I see it."
Stephen Harper,We have not seen an action plan in five years (from the Liberals)
Michael Harrington,"That the poor are invisible is one of the most important things about them. They are not simply neglected and forgotten as in the old rhetoric of reform; what is much worse, they are not seen."
Michael Harrington,Clothes make the poor invisible. America has the best-dressed poverty the world has ever known.
Michael Harrington,It takes a certain level of aspiration before one can take advantage of opportunities that are clearly offered.
Padraig Harrington,"The first couple of rounds are very important for me because I am a bit rusty. If I do struggle a bit it is going to be tough. The key is to not necessarily make a quick start, but not to make a slow start."
Padraig Harrington,"The ball tends to sweep into the pins at Augusta. Here, it's always running away from them. This is very tough."
Padraig Harrington,I've had nine weeks off with the main priority being rest.
Padraig Harrington,"I made a couple of mistakes on the last couple of holes but overall I was pretty happy with the way I played. If anything, maybe I was a little bit over-confident,"
Padraig Harrington,"Growing up in Ireland, you learn how to play the wind. Or if you don't, you don't play golf, one or the other. Yeah, I like the conditions here. I'm very comfortable here. I'd be happy to see a bit of wind this week."
Padraig Harrington,It's going to happen. The golf courses in Europe are being set up more like U.S. Open courses -- they're tighter than a regular PGA Tour event so maybe the U.S. Opens should suit Europeans now.
Padraig Harrington,"It's going to happen, ... The golf courses in Europe are being set up more like U.S. Open courses -- they're tighter than a regular PGA Tour event so maybe the U.S. Opens should suit Europeans now."
Padraig Harrington,"It can be quite a frustrating golf course. One of my strengths is to stay patient, and that's probably why I have performed well here in the past."
Padraig Harrington,"It's a funny week too. With three golf courses it's hard to prepare, so that leads to a certain bit of the unknown."
Padraig Harrington,"I was happy to finish strong. I didn't play well Thursday, so it's funny how things turned for me today."
Franco Harris,"How you look at a situation is very important, for how you think about a problem may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. When you get discouraged or depressed, try changing your attitude from negative to positive and see how life can change for you. Remember, your attitude toward a situation can help you to change it -- you create the very atmosphere for defeat or victory."
Franco Harris,"There's probably going to be about $100 million spent to buy the property ... for all the roads and everything that goes into that. Guess who has to pay for that? It's going to be us, the taxpayers. We're going to pay that money."
Franco Harris,"Yes, I would have rather finished up in Pittsburgh."
Franco Harris,"Where Joe was more vocal and emotional whereas Chuck was very reserved. But, both of them executed great strategy and both of them demanded a lot of their players."
Franco Harris,We just did a lot of things together as a team off the field and we really shared a lot of special moments off the field just as much as on the field.
Franco Harris,The Houston Astrodome was kind of a tough field.
Franco Harris,"Right now, I'm working with Super Bakery and we manufacture nutritional donuts called Super Donuts."
Franco Harris,"Once that was over, I knew that my ties to a football organization would be over because I never wanted to coach or be in the front office."
Franco Harris,"Jack Lambert is mean and relentless wherever he goes, on and off the field! I do remember many times he would chase me in practice but no way would I let him catch me."
Franco Harris,It's not how you come out of the starting blocks.
Franco Harris,"I really don't look at comparing things that way because even in a 14-game season, there could be a running back who could have a lot more carries than other running backs."
Franco Harris,"Halfway through the decade, we realized that we had a great team and that we could do great things, and that we could probably have something here that we believed we had a chance to reach greatness."
Franco Harris,"But, as always, Mr. Rooney would come over and shake your hand and congratulate you on a good game, no matter what the situation was."
Franco Harris,"And, coaching has never been an option for me."
Franco Harris,"And so, it's not a thing of how many carries, but were you effective when you did carry."
Franco Harris,All I wanted to be was a player.
Franco Harris,"After 12 years, the old butterflies came back. Well, I guess at my age you call them moths."
Gary Harris,We didn't swing the bat like we should have. We were over aggressive and didn't have the patience we needed at the plate.
Gary Harris,"The way my girls are playing right now, we don't care who we're playing. This is probably the best high school team I've coached."

Jim Harris,"We're in the middle, almost the end of the senior year. They've done all their hard work; they've finally been admitted. Now Mr. Financial Aid comes along and asks, 'How are you going to pay for this adventure?' and it becomes another round of hard work."
Jim Harris,"Now when we go to bed, we can't hear them,"
Ken Harris,I like the fact that I don't have to do a lot of planning; I can go online and see what's available and sign up. It's pre-arranged.
Ken Harris,He did a masterful job.
Ken Harris,"There's a new plastic innovation that was just invented in Denmark that makes plastic thinner and stronger. So, all of a sudden that's of importance."
Ken Harris,"At least they are leaving some unspoiled areas. They are trying to compromise and give everybody what they want, which is a very difficult thing to do."
Mike Harris,"I'm running because border security and illegal immigration have not been effectively, key word effectively, addressed by our current governor."
Mike Harris,"Trends 2006 is a compendium of good practice corporate reporting examples. These companies recognize that making both financial and non-financial information accessible is a competitive advantage.

Mike Harris,"If we knew at the beginning of the week we were going to be seven and two, we would have taken it."
Paul Harris,"I figured the way the draft would break down, and I wanted to start with a running back, and McAllister was still the best guy out there. I thought about Jamal Lewis and Domanick Davis, but the bottom line is that (McAllister) is still going to be the focus of their offense, and he was the best back to take at that spot. The fact is, they're still going to play 16 games."
Paul Harris,"During my two terms in the Virginia House of Delegates, I saw first-hand how government has grown out of control, ... Just over the past 10 years, the budget in Virginia has increased by 81 percent, coupled with unnecessary tax increases. This is why we need Americans for Prosperity in Virginia. Together we will form the first true grassroots organization dedicated to ensuring that the leaders of our state are held responsible for the lack of fiscal discipline in Richmond. We'll establish at least six local chapters across the state by November 1, and 10 by the time the General Assembly convenes in January."
Paul Harris,I'm real disappointed. It really hurts because it's one of the goals I really wanted to accomplish.
Paul Harris,"When an individual, a sect, a clique or a nation hates and despises another individual, sect, clique or nation, he or they simply do not know the objects of their hatred. Ignorance is at the bottom of it."
Paul Harris,"To attempt to superimpose its views through the exercise of force, is seldom the part of intelligence; it is frequently the part of ignorance."

Paul Harris,The very strength of a nation eventually proves to be its weakness.

Paul Harris,Many obstacles to the expansion of good will have presented themselves.
Paul Harris,"It would not be fair to the critics of Rotary, who include some of the most brilliant of the British and American writers, to charge them with prejudice."
Paul Harris,"It has been the way of Rotary to focus thought upon matters in which members are in agreement, rather than upon matters in which they are in disagreement."

Richard Harris,"What's interesting here is that you can see how the cost of operations continues to rise and debt obligations continue to rise, while capital improvements have gone down. Money has just not been available for those types of services."
Richard Harris,"People realize that what we have here is a rare scene, a preservation of our culture. And so they come from all over Southern California to be a part of it."
Richard Harris,"Looking at these numbers, what do they tell anyone who's got any common sense? Everything you're seeing is just too little, too late."
Robert Harris,I think it's great for them to come out and give their time and give some support and some acknowledgement to the Marine Corps and the base. I think it's awesome.

James Harrison,"We made a statement. We won, that was the statement we wanted. Margin of victory, stuff like that, is nice. But winning and going to the playoffs is our goal. That's what we want."
James Harrison,"I'll put it to you in simple terms: The center and the guard were so far gone, the running back had to make moves to avoid them. We were just coming in and cleaning things up."
James Harrison,"I guess it's luck, ... If Clark doesn't break his hand, I'm not here. Clark's been looking out for me for a while now, now that I think about it."

James Harrison,"If Clark Haggans didn't break his hand I'm not in Pittsburgh, I'm not in football,"
James Harrison,"This agency has been under a microscope for the last year and been subject to a fair degree of criticism. In some sense, this trial gives us a chance to prove what this agency has accomplished and how accountable it has been."
James Harrison,"Water looks so innocent much of the time, but with a flood it's not over when it's over. Its consequences go on for months. When people see their homes wrecked, and then the mildew and decay set in and they realize that life as they've known it is turned upside down, this can simply be overwhelming."
James Harrison,"He had two choices -- either take me up high, which I didn't think he would do, or cut me, ... I figured he was going to try to cut me because it's Monday night and you don't want to get run over in front of everybody."
James Harrison,"It's just that you're never going to hear me say that somebody is tougher than me, ... Because I don't believe somebody else could be tougher than me."
John Harrison,There is no trading market like this. Nowhere in the universe can you get 400 percent (returns).
John Harrison,CRATEL is a center with a two-fold mission -- to explore technology as an expressive element and to use technology to bridge gaps between diverse groups of people.
John Harrison,We are delighted to offer pint-sized inventors a unique opportunity to dream up their own frozen pop creations. The frozen pop was actually invented in 1905 by an 11 year old boy so we are looking forward to seeing what kids come up with in 2006.
John Harrison,"It's a payment basically made to shut you up, ... There's some money given to victims who complain. When that happens, the victims tell people of their success, that they actually got money. So more people invest more money and they (scammers) create a new crop of victims."
John Harrison,"I'm not at liberty to say, except that he appears to be a victim."
John Harrison,I would hope that Frank Herbert is smiling down on this and enjoying what I've done.
John Harrison,"I hate to turn it over to this kid, ... He doesn't realize what he's got. It's a gem."
John Harrison,It's hard to leave behind scenes and characters I am in love with.
John Harrison,"If the courts are making the decisions, it matters who the judge is and, of course, people are concerned with what is the bottom line."
John Harrison,"Perhaps one of the things I'll get criticized for, ... is the choice not to use the internal monologue that Herbert used in the book. If you use the voice-over narrative -- if you use it to tell the emotional state of a character while you're watching that character -- it has the effect of stopping the motion picture. Movies are images and moving pictures. Novels are words."
Marvin Harrison,"I can't really put my words into sentences to say how it feels, ... (Rice) has been around for a long time and done a lot of great things. I don't really put myself next to Rice."
Marvin Harrison,"I was trying to get up slowly so I wouldn't get knocked in the head, ... and I got up and ran."
Marvin Harrison,"I wanted to get out there and practice, not necessarily for the game Sunday, but for the preparation for the first playoff game."
Marvin Harrison,"I'm sure later I'll think, 'Man, we were really kickin' butt.'"
Marvin Harrison,The hand is pretty good. It reminds me of earlier in the year when I hurt my wrist. Today I wanted to get out here and practice â€” not necessarily for the game Sunday but practice in preparations for the first playoff game.
Rodney Harrison,I take three showers a day. I don't need to be in the shower for 15 minutes. I'm a five-minute guy.
Rodney Harrison,You can't even catch balls and you're being covered by a safety. How does that feel?
Rodney Harrison,"It's good to have a two-way [team], a passing game as well as a running game. Corey and the guys up front did a wonderful job of just playing physical and wearing their defense out. You've got to give them credit. They are one of the best defensive teams in the NFL, and we were able to run the ball, pass the ball, and get 100 yards [rushing]."
Rodney Harrison,"We pride ourselves in being a good tackling team and an aggressive defensive unit that can run to the ball, ... Our motto is 'Run and Hit.'"
Rodney Harrison,I turned around and I saw him down and I just started praying for him because you never want to see anybody down like that.
Rodney Harrison,"Everyone wants to judge us and gauge us on what happened in the past, but this is a totally different team. People have to realize that and we understand that. So there's no guarantee that we're going to go out there and do anything."
Rodney Harrison,I'm really excited at this point in time because I have an opportunity to play in the Super Bowl and I'm expecting my baby.
Rodney Harrison,"The league is really set up for the owners to make money and I really don't like the structure of the players' contract. But that's another situation. I think technically, as far as stepping down, he did a great job."
Rodney Harrison,There were a lot of mistakes. We were rusty out there. We didn't communicate will and we had some missed tackles.
Rodney Harrison,"I think what you look for in a person to replace him is a person of integrity, someone that's honest and someone who knows the game and understands that it is the players that drive the game as well as the fans. If you have that, you have an opportunity for a great future for the National Football League and continued success."
Rodney Harrison,"You'd see guys crying on the plane home,"
Rodney Harrison,"We're not caught up in history because what we've done in the past means nothing. As soon as you start feeling good about yourself, that's when you've set yourself up for failure."
Rodney Harrison,"I know I can come back from this, ... It's just a matter of how hard and how bad I want to do it. You and I have talked about this before; football is not my life, it's a part of my life. It's what I do, it's not who I am."
Rodney Harrison,"I cannot honestly say what's going to happen next year and what the future holds for me in terms of football, ... But I'm going to work my tail off to get back on the field."
Rodney Harrison,"He's a captain, a leader, a tremendous physical presence in the middle. When you have one of your best friends back, one of your best teammates back, it's always a good, rewarding moment."
Rodney Harrison,"A lot of teams today do not believe in veteran players. But (Belichick) believes in bringing smart, disciplined, tough football players who respect the game and have the ability to move on whether we win or lose."
Rodney Harrison,"When it comes down to it, ... it's  just football. After all the circus, the antics and  the sideshow, it's just football . . . just going  out there and just knocking heads and just  playing football."
Rodney Harrison,This is the most prepared since I have been playing football.
Rodney Harrison,"We're not a dynasty, we're just a good football team, and we've been a good football team since I've been here. The Chicago Bulls, they were a dynasty. They were a dynasty for six years, but once you lose, you're not a dynasty any more. I don't know how long dynasties last, but it seems like they don't last very long in professional sports nowadays."
Rodney Harrison,"There's nothing easy about winning a game in the National Football League, let alone winning a championship, things that we've done in the past. However, that's in the past."
Rodney Harrison,They're 2-0 right now. They're feeling good. We're going into a hostile environment. They want their revenge from the AFC championship and they will let it be known. So we have a set of challenges out there. It only gets tougher.
Rodney Harrison,Who cares? That's all entertainment-based.
Rodney Harrison,"We had some lack of communication and gave up a big play, and our goal is not to give up big plays,"
Rodney Harrison,He's the best in the business. He's a beast. We miss his leadership. We miss his smile. We miss his competitiveness.
Rodney Harrison,"Of course they have an image of being bad boys and being the dirty boys of the National Football League, ... but a reputation means nothing. What means something is going out there and executing on that particular day."
Scott Harrison,"I'd be very surprised if there isn't any violence, but that doesn't mean it's going to go to the other extreme and be another Seattle."
Scott Harrison,"He doesn't seem very confident, talking about what he is doing after his retirement,"
Scott Harrison,There's always chaos in the sense of normalcy in the Philippines.
Scott Harrison,I think the biggest thing will be to see some live competition. These boys are tired of playing against one another.
Tom Harrison,We support this budget enthusiastically and are confident that the voters will agree.
Tom Harrison,I was very pleased at the level of cooperation among the three boards. It was the best it's ever been.
Tom Harrison,"It's not like they've got a choice. They have to do it, they have to perform. Some of these kids, this is the time of their life. This is what they've waited for, to get themselves in this position."
Debbie Harry,You always fall for the rascal or the guy who's got a little bit of the devil in him. You can't help it.
Debbie Harry,We wanted to enjoy what we were doing and we had business things we had to straighten out and personnel problems and it sort of took a little time to do it.
Debbie Harry,"We probably, as primitive people, made music before we actually had a language, and that's where language comes from."
Debbie Harry,"That was the impetus for me to do music or art, because I knew if I didn't try when I was young, then I would get to be in my 40's and I'd be really unhappy that I hadn't."
Debbie Harry,"Something's that written out is okay, but it's not always a clear indication of what a person means."
Debbie Harry,Music is wonderful. Especially if there's some kind of content to it.
Debbie Harry,Lately I've been believing that music predates speech.
Debbie Harry,I've had some lovely extraordinary experiences on New Year's Eve.
Debbie Harry,I'm very proud of the fact that I was in two really interesting movies in the last year: one was Spun and the other was My Life Without Me.
Debbie Harry,"I'm a culture vulture, and I just want to experience it all."
Debbie Harry,"I turned on VH1 this morning just to get a little warm-up before I came over here, and I think it's just terrific. There's so much great stuff: diverse and wonderful music, good performances, great looking girls, great videos, the whole thing."
Debbie Harry,I think it's a Blondie tradition that all of our albums sort of have a wide spread of styles.
Debbie Harry,"I really, really like writing songs."
Debbie Harry,I mean I think that Blondie's influence is a little bit in a way more eclectic than those bands.
Debbie Harry,"I have a lot of regrets, but I'm not going to think of them as regrets."
Debbie Harry,"I get myself a gig somewhere, whether it's in a club, whether it's in a bar, it doesn't matter, and I just work on New Year's Eve because I always feel it's very symbolic for me for the next year, for the new year."
Debbie Harry,I feel like I have to have a voice.
Debbie Harry,I do know the effect that music still has on me - I'm completely vulnerable to it. I'm seduced by it.
Debbie Harry,"I always work on New Year's Eve, no matter what."
Debbie Harry,"I always say the new album is the best one yet. I always feel that - I really do, because it's the latest and it's the newest and it's a little bit better."
Debbie Harry,Christina Aguilera is an incredible musician and singer.
Debbie Harry,"But, you know, the issues of humanity and what is fair treatment and good treatment of a fellow human being should not really be based on a personal sense of right and wrong or judgment."
Debbie Harry,"But computers have changed the world for everyone, so there will be some way of working it out."
Debbie Harry,"But as a writer and performer, I want to get paid for what I do."
Debbie Harry,"And New Year's Eve is very, very important to me."
Debbie Harry,"And living in a metropolitan area which is ethnically diverse, our lives are very complicated, so our emotional experiences are going to be varied like that."
Debbie Harry,And I wasn't convinced that I was the most talented person in the world.
Debbie Harry,"A lot of the bands were really, really different and a lot of them actually didn't become huge but I think were hugely influential."
Debbie Harry,I don't mind if my skull ends up on a shelf as long as it's got my name on it.
Debbie Harry,"Capote wrote every day. He said that's the only way, you have to sit down every day and do it."
Ray Harryhausen,I was going to Columbia Pictures and Eastman Kodak had a class going for cameramen. I signed up to be a field cameraman. I showed this film to my professor and he showed it to Frank Capra.
Ray Harryhausen,Medusa was fascinating to work with because I gave her a snake's body so that she could pull herself with her hands which gave her a very creepy aura. I didn't want to animate cosmic gowns. Most Medusas you see in the classics have flowing robes which would be mad to even try to animate.
Ray Harryhausen,I had to learn to do everything because I couldn't find another kindred soul. Now you see eighty people listed doing the same things I was doing by myself.
Ray Harryhausen,"A lot of people thought my work was very tedious, and it can be if you look at it from that point of view, but I never looked upon it as tedious."
Ray Harryhausen,"I prefer to work alone and do everything alone, even today."
Ray Harryhausen,I brought in the stories many times. I don't just do animation.
Ray Harryhausen,That's why I never became a director. I never had patience with people.
Ray Harryhausen,"I was very limited in what I could do with flying saucers, because they're just a metal disc. I had to try and put character in as if they were intelligently guided."
Ray Harryhausen,"Many times I felt like I'd do better than what the director did, but some of them got a little discouraged because they didn't have full charge of making the film, and sometimes there'd be battles of egos."
Ray Harryhausen,I was never restricted. I was never told what to do.
Ray Harryhausen,"I know pretty well in the broad sense what I'm going to do, because I have to know that when we shoot the live-action, so that it'll synchronize. Then I know pretty well when I get to the animation stage, what that scene requires."
Ray Harryhausen,"So our films had a lot more to them than entertainment value, and I'm glad that a lot of people recognize that now. People realize now the value of them as educational."
Ray Harryhausen,I took courses at USC in film editing and art direction and photography when I was still in high school.
Joe Hart,We were just experiencing a wealth of drive-offs.
Joe Hart,Brandon got wide open and our quarterback acted like he was trying to throw it into the next county. We missed opportunities like that all night. You can't do that against a team like Fayetteville.
Joe Hart,Modern technology ... I guess it does do some good.
Joe Hart,The police were here 60 seconds after they attempted to break in.
Joe Hart,"soon realize they're out there spraying at daybreak. They're out there picking at night (under lights), and it's costing them more than they're getting out of it. That's not the type of vineyard longevity I'm looking for."
Joe Hart,"I'm actually quite concerned about it, ... I don't think we should be doing all this land-splitting. Five-acre vineyards are not a good idea. That's too small for serious farming."
John Hart,"If you wanted to buy some crack, you'd go to Broadway. It was so dangerous. People would huddle around the corners waiting for help."
John Hart,"I want to thank Frank McCourt for the opportunity to speak with him regarding his opening. I enjoyed speaking to him, ... However, I have indicated to Texas owner Tom Hicks my desire to remain with the Rangers. Therefore, I am withdrawing my name from consideration for the general manager's job with the Dodgers."
John Hart,"Sandy was always the baseball guy who understood what GMs went through, ... He wasn't afraid to tell it like it was. He was always fair because he understood the game. He's special."
John Hart,Sandy was always the baseball guy who understood what GMs went through. He wasn't afraid to tell it like it was. He was always fair because he understood the game. He's special.
John Hart,It appears to be a case of taking advantage of the fact that the vault door is open. It could be an attempt to make a relatively small-scale repair into a major renovation project under the guise of an emergency.
Bob Hartley,"I think that's a fair assessment. When you're on a winning streak, it seems you can't do anything wrong, and even when you do something wrong, it seems that it's overshadowed by something bigger or better. When you're riding a losing streak, it seems you're always just one mistake from putting yourself back in that big hole."
Bob Hartley,"I sat down with Michael this morning. I told him, that's the best way to get thrown in the fire. You didn't have time to get nervous and now that you've gone through this. [Tonight's] just another game."
Bob Hartley,The boys are on a mission.
Bob Hartley,"Marian is one of the top players in this league. He's an unbelievable athlete, and he's strong on the puck."
Phil Hartman,"It was literally a situation where you felt the most unbridled glory and the most excruciating emotional agony. What's the line -- laugh all your laughter, cry all your tears? And revel in the glory of it all,"
Phil Hartman,"Wonderful Canadian family who gave me free Canadian Scotch daily,"
Phil Hartman,"He was eager to serve his country,"
Phil Hartman,"Howl has certainly proved that the East Village sense of community has survived intact,"
Phil Hartman,"The one thing I could do was voices and impersonations and weird characters, and there was really no call for that, except on Saturday Night Live."
Phil Hartman,"One of the remarkable things about my career is that it has been marked by steady, incremental progress. No sudden spikes up, and no sudden downfalls, either."
Phil Hartman,I've succeeded beyond my wildest dreams - financially and the amount of fun I have in my life.
Phil Hartman,"I was 36, and I had decided to quit acting because it was so disappointing."
Phil Hartman,I found the writing arena to be much less competitive.
Phil Hartman,"I could do John Wayne, Jack Benny, Jack Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and entertain my friends. But I never seriously considered it as a career choice."
Phil Hartman,"Even at Westchester High in West LA, I was class clown."
Phil Hartman,"As an actor, I felt I couldn't compete. I wasn't as cute as the leading man; I wasn't as brilliant as Robin Williams."
Phil Hartman,"After working in the corporate world of advertising and graphic design, I know how hard the average person works, because I've been there."
Phil Hartman,"I benefit from the Mr. Potato Head syndrome. Put a wig and a nose and glasses on me, and I disappear."
Phil Hartman,"A master sergeant in the Army is in danger of losing his lavish lifestyle when a Pentagon official threatens to close Fort Baxter,"
Michael Hartnett,Previously it was a rush to buy anything. Now I think that quality will stand out.
Michael Hartnett,"The equity market responded positively to the jobs report, which in turn helped the dollar. It was a 'buy U.S.A.' payroll number."
Michael Hartnett,"Commodities will have a strong investment case in the year ahead because of the strong Asian growth, weakening demand for US bonds and strong prospects of oil. Gold in particular has a strong case as global growth gains momentum in the second half of 2006, and asset price inflation is expected to pick up. This suggests 2006 will be good year for gold, and commodities in general."
Michael Hartnett,"The great interest in the economy is what is going on in the consumer's mind. If you work that out, you unlock the key to what Japan will do over the next couple of years."
Rick Hartzell,"No one has called me from any place, and that's the absolute truth."
Rick Hartzell,"I am so happy that we were able to secure this private support and am hopeful that Mac, his staff and family will be with us for years to come."
Rick Hartzell,"I love Mac dearly. He's a great friend. I know Jake feels the same way. But he's a Cyclone now. We're going to turn the page and move this program forward as fast as we can, with the same aspirations and goals we had."
Rick Hartzell,It gives us something to shoot for during the regular season that we didn't have. It also . . . lets our kids get some recognition and gives us something other than two meets at the end of the year - the West Regional and the NCAA - to shoot for.
Rick Hartzell,We're going to forge ahead with every intention of keeping Mac as our coach.
Rick Hartzell,There are a lot of exciting pieces to this game. I think it will be great fun.
Rick Hartzell,"To be honest, Iowa State got a great coach - and they got a great friend of mine."
Rick Hartzell,"I think he's the best young basketball coach in the country, and I am overwhelmed with the fact that we can keep him here at UNI."
Brian Harvey,"This is very, very typical of the Chinese space program. They go quite a big step each time. They very rarely repeat missions."
Brian Harvey,Ultimately what they are planning is a Chinese space station in about 2008 or so. To do that they will need to learn about how to survive on longer missions.
Brian Harvey,"The answer really lies in prestige first, direct economic and social applications second, and using the space program as a cutting-edge tool for technology third."
Brian Harvey,"If you can handle the time, it's great. But it's tough on the families. You have one or two kids, you are travelling around all summer. It takes a lot of time."
Brian Harvey,They have a limited budget and have to manage funds very carefully.
Brian Harvey,"I love artists like Jon B, but I don't wanna be compared to anybody. I'm just doing my interpretation of rnb and how someone like me should be doing it."
Brian Harvey,I don't think I even knew how big we were at the time. It was mad. I gained a lot through East 17 and I'm grateful for being able to have that experience.
Fred Harvey,They have a lot of interest down there in all different areas of sports. I think they are just now putting a lot more interest in track and field.
Fred Harvey,We're really headed in the right direction and it's showing today.
Fred Harvey,It's tough to bet against a guy like that. He's a talented athlete and a fierce competitor.
Larry Harvey,My understanding is it is more aesthetically pleasing as a parking lot.
Larry Harvey,We've come through. This is the revolution I'd hoped for all along.
Larry Harvey,This is an opportunity for people who did not do interviews to have some one-on-one time. These guys will be able to talk to them and make their own decision.
Larry Harvey,I've never been comfortable with the goals because we never come close to the goals.
Larry Harvey,It is great we got to this point and can take control of the property.
Larry Harvey,"Well it seems to me, that all real communities grow out of a shared confrontation with survival. Communities are not produced by sentiment or mere goodwill. They grow out of a shared struggle. Our situation in the desert is an incubator for community."
Larry Harvey,They had been assigned a role. They were a member of the greater whole. They shared our same goals. Through the simple act of helping out.
Larry Harvey,"It avoids a self-conscious relationship to the act. We live in the most self-conscious society in the history of mankind. There are good things in that, but there are also terrible things. The worst of it is, that we find it hard to give ourselves to the cultural process."
Larry Harvey,"Black Rock gives us all a chance to heal, to become ourselves."
Larry Harvey,Belief is thought at rest.
Larry Harvey,Kleenex would have made a mint today.

Paul Harvey,? might make a real good Christmas present for the uninformed. The book is called 'Taking America Back.'
Paul Harvey,I've never seen a monument erected to a pessimist.
Paul Harvey,Ever occur to you why some of us can be this much concerned with animals suffering? Because government is not. Why not? Animals don't vote.
Paul Harvey,"Like what you do, if you don't like it, do something else."
Paul Harvey,"When your outgo exceeds your income, the upshot may be your downfall."
Paul Harvey,"In times like these, it helps to recall that there have always been times like these."
Paul Harvey,"If there is a 50-50 chance that something can go wrong, then 9 times out of ten it will."
Paul Harvey,Retiring is just practicing up to be dead. That doesn't take any practice.
Paul Harvey,"Every pessimist who ever lived has been buried in an unmarked grave. Tomorrow has always been better than today, and it always will be."
Paul Harvey,"Golf is a game in which you yell fore, shoot six, and write down five."
Paul Harvey,I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is.
Paul Harvey,If 'pro' is the opposite of 'con' what is the opposite of 'progress'?
Kevin Harvick,We would never be at the point we're at if his accident had never happened. Safety is incredible how fast it advanced.
Kevin Harvick,"We feel really good coming in here, but you still have to have a little bit of luck."
Kevin Harvick,"We're digging, and Matt's having some bad luck. If we keep knocking the lead off 80 or 100 points at a time, we're going to be in good shape in a couple of weeks. Right now, we're just going out and doing everything we can every week. Our cars are better, our pit stops more consistent, and that is helping everything come together. Down the stretch here, we're definitely racing a little harder because we've got something to shoot for. We just need luck to stay on our side and we'll see how things play out."
Kevin Harvick,"We're digging, and Matt's having some bad luck, ... If we keep knocking the lead off 80 or 100 points at a time, we're going to be in good shape in a couple of weeks.

Kevin Harvick,I hate to see Kurt Busch win. What a whiner.
Kevin Harvick,"He and I have committed to moving forward together in fulfilling our current agreement, which runs through 2006, and we anticipate being together for many years beyond that. Our focus is on continuing to improve our performance this year and being a championship contender in 2006."
Ernie Harwell,With the Giants I broadcast the debut of Hall of Famer Willie Mays.
Ernie Harwell,We had a dog in those days named Blue Grass and the players used to give us their Wheaties for him. Blue Grass loved Wheaties and so did I.
Ernie Harwell,"That other saying, I'm a part of all that I have met, I think that would have to begin with my wonderful parents back in Atlanta when I was a youngster five years old I was tongue tied."
Ernie Harwell,"If I walked back into the booth in the year 2025, I don't think it would have changed much. I think baseball would be played and managed pretty much the same as it is today. It's a great survivor."
Ernie Harwell,I've been lucky to broadcast some great events and to broadcast the exploits of some great players.
Ernie Harwell,I'd like to be remembered as someone who showed up for the job. I consider myself a worker.
Ernie Harwell,"I think I owe thanks to the people who have listened to me over the years, who tuned in on the radio. They have given me a warmth and loyalty that I've never been able to repay. The way they have reached out to me has certainly been the highlight of my life."
Ernie Harwell,"I love what I do. If I had my time over again, I'd probably do it for nothing."
Ernie Harwell,"I love the game because it's so simple, yet it can be so complex. There's a lot of layers to it, but they aren't hard to peel back."
Ernie Harwell,"I had a job to do, and I did it all these years to the best of my ability. That's what I'd like to leave behind as I finish my final game in Toronto."
Ernie Harwell,"I decided very early that I was going to be a reporter, that I would not cheer for the team. I don't denigrate people who do it. It's fine."
Ernie Harwell,God blessed me by putting me here for thirty-one years at Michigan and Trumbull.
Ernie Harwell,Especially in this strike filled year but my feelings about the game are still the same as they were back then and I think that maybe yours are too.
Ernie Harwell,"But most of all, I'm a part of you people out there who have listened to me, because especially you people in Michigan, you Tiger fans, you've given me so much warmth, so much affection and so much love."
Ernie Harwell,"Baseball is a lot like life. It's a day-to-day existence, full of ups and downs. You make the most of your opportunities in baseball as you do in life."
Ernie Harwell,"Also I'm a part of the people that I've worked with in baseball that have been so great to me, Mr. Earl Mann of Atlanta, who gave me my first baseball broadcasting job."
Ernie Harwell,"A tall, thin old man waving a scorecard from the corner of his dugout. That's baseball."
Ernie Harwell,When I went to Brooklyn in 1948 Jackie Robinson was at the height of his brilliant career.
Dominik Hasek,"The biggest improvement I think is that we work hard as a team. You need five people on the ice. From a defensive point, they did a really good job in front of me. They scored only two power play goals. So defensively, I have seen a big improvement."
Dominik Hasek,"Our medical staff decided that I'm not able to play. It's over. Also, I don't want to get hurt for the rest of the National Hockey League [season]."
Dominik Hasek,"Finally we won a close game, it's a great feeling. However, it was frustrating because we gave up two goals sort of on two lucky bounces and then all of a sudden the game was so close."
Dominik Hasek,"It's frustrating. We gave up 10 goals in the last two games and we've scored only three. I don't know what is the reason, but we better figure it out as soon as possible because we have a game tomorrow."
Dominik Hasek,"I consulted with the doctors but unfortunately, it isn't good, I can't play for the rest of the tournament."
Dominik Hasek,"We've been struggling since Christmas. We played a good game, but unfortunately it wasn't enough for us to win it."
Jim Haslett,"I have a lot of confidence in our team,"
Jim Haslett,"Those are Joe's words,"
Jim Haslett,I think it's just going to be nice that we don't have to get on a plane and travel. We've played bad the last two weeks - way too many of everything. But I don't think that has anything to do with the travel or anything we've gone through.
Jim Haslett,I think it's just going to be nice that we don't have to get on a plane and travel.
Jim Haslett,"We didn't make wholesale changes, ... There are less new parts than before. Everything we're doing, we're doing with a purpose. That's the way we ended last year with our last four games. I didn't feel like that early in the season last year."
Jim Haslett,"We've been in four complexes in four weeks, I've been in three hotels, now an apartment. But that (performance) had nothing to do with where we live or what we do. We sucked on that field today."
Jim Haslett,He's still learning the offense but he's steady. He's a heck of a blocker.
Jim Haslett,"It kind of put everything in perspective, ... Football's a game, and if it's going to bring some happiness to people around the Gulf Coast, then we should play for these people, and play for ourselves."
Jim Haslett,We talked all week about how we kick field goals instead of scoring touchdowns and we came out and did the same thing.
Jim Haslett,"Turnovers hurt us in the first half, giving Seattle a short field to work with. Those are things we have to clean up, and we will."
Jim Haslett,"For all of us, it was a time to follow a new direction, to bring closure to what was a disappointing year record-wise and move forward."
Jim Haslett,"Nobody's complaining about what we're doing and what we're going through,"
Jim Haslett,We really never gave Jake an opportunity like this. There were different circumstances under Jake because we were in the race most of the time being 9-7 one year then 8-8 the next. The only time Jake got the opportunity was when Aaron got hurt.
Jim Haslett,"No, it has nothing to do with it. No, it has nothing to do with dropped balls, missed tackles. We can do that anywhere."
Ron Hassler,I don't mind. We have lot of things to work on.
Ron Hassler,He's gotten his teammates involved this year. That's probably his biggest improvement ? trusting his teammates.
Ron Hassler,I think he's up with the best. Obviously I think other guys did things better at this age. But his potential is unlimited.

Dennis Hastert,"The vote we cast today will help ensure our continued prosperity,"

Dennis Hastert,"I think Tom Reynolds may have been talking about what his feelings are, ... Social Security is something very important. It's something we've talked about doing, and when we decide to move forward we'll let the press know."
Dennis Hastert,"Given the abysmal failure of state and local officials in Louisiana to plan adequately for or respond to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the city of New Orleans, and given the long history of public corruption in Louisiana, ... I am not confident that Louisiana officials can be trusted to administer federal relief aid."
Dennis Hastert,When the electricity goes out and everything else goes out -- you don't have the pumps to pump it out either. Because it doesn't work either.

Dennis Hastert,You can see there's still a lot of decisions to be made.
Dennis Hastert,"Some have said that we should not have this debate. I disagree,"
Dennis Hastert,"We're there, ... We can debate the reasons why we're there. ... But we are there."
Dennis Hastert,"We need to let our people speak. We need to debate those issues and then we let the best ideas win, ... Right now, we believe the American people stand behind us. They want to see us preserve Social Security, they want us to keep the budget balanced and we're going to do our level best to do it."
Dennis Hastert,"It's a good blueprint for America's future, ... We're also pleased this Congress can get its work done."
Dennis Hastert,"This Congress is serious about doing everything we can to help local, state and federal officials respond to this crisis,"
Dennis Hastert,"Congress will not use Social Security as a pot of gold to fund foreign aid,"
Dennis Hastert,"I agree with you that should work together in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe this work product is a result of a hard-fought compromise."
Dennis Hastert,"provides for common sense tax relief in the future. We have the largest surplus in history, which means the taxpayers are being overcharged."
Dennis Hastert,"The United States of America is prosperous and free. But storm clouds gather on our horizon. Our national security is challenged by the continued malfeasance of Saddam Hussein. Our economic security is challenged by a growing worldwide recession. Our future is bedeviled by too many schools that perform poorly and by a Social Security system in need of reform,"
Dennis Hastert,"Today, America mourns the loss of a woman who changed our nation,"
Dennis Hastert,"The United States of America is prosperous and free. But storm clouds gather on our horizon. Our national security is challenged by the continued malfeasance of Saddam Hussein. Our economic security is challenged by a growing worldwide recession. Our future is bedeviled by too many schools that perform poorly and by a Social Security system in need of reform. The President has the responsibility to tell us his thoughts on how to confront these growing problems,"
Dennis Hastert,"The American people want us to go to work. They want us to produce good policy, ... The ability for us to save Social Security and Medicare in the future, the ability to give American workers and working families more of their money so that they can keep it in their pocket instead of giving it to the tax collectors."
Dennis Hastert,Cagey trial lawyers have figured out there's a pretty good likelihood their case - no matter what its merit - will literally get its day in court because of favorable judges.
Reed Hastings,"I think the stock will trade down significantly because of lower profits for the next year, but the long term value (will rise) -- in two years -- because of our actions today, being decisive and taking the steps to ensure our continued leadership in this larger market with larger competitors."
Reed Hastings,"If the Starbucks secret is a smile when you get your latte, ... ours is that the Web site adapts to the individual's taste."
Reed Hastings,"There's some great charter schools and some not-so-great charter schools. I looked at quality, and I was impressed by the dedication of the people involved."
Reed Hastings,If the Starbucks secret is a smile when you get your latte... ours is that the Web site adapts to the individual's taste.
Reed Hastings,We are seeing the beginning of things. Web 2.0 is broadband. Web 3.0 is 10 gigabits a second.
Reed Hastings,(Last year) was another year of solid achievement and continued momentum. We enter 2006 confident we can reach our goal of 20 million subscribers within the 2010 to 2012 time frame.
Orrin Hatch,"If we want to get anything done in our society and we want to have things run as smoothly as we can, somebody has to be in control, somebody has to have the responsibility, somebody has to have the accountability and it's very apparent it's got to be the a side that has the 51-50 vote,"
Orrin Hatch,"is not a myth, it is a reality."
Orrin Hatch,"And that is, ... we could file a motion to adjourn with the following language: that basically we ... acknowledge the impeachment vote of the House, we acknowledge, if this is true, that we do not have or even have a chance of having 67 votes for conviction, and we acknowledge that the impeachment vote in the House is the highest form of censure or condemnation for this president's despicable acts. And if you do that, that basically adjourns. It ends the battle."
Orrin Hatch,"'I think everybody on the intelligence committee, everybody in the administration relied on flawed intelligence."
Orrin Hatch,"We all know that the intelligence with regard to these matters was flawed. We found that out since that it was flawed,"
Orrin Hatch,"There is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate crimes is warranted, ... Serious constitutional questions remain."

Orrin Hatch,"He's going to have to abide by the canons of judicial ethics, which basically state you never discuss things which might come up before your court in the future, ... no matter how much they badger him or say they aren't going to vote for him."
Orrin Hatch,"We now find ourselves on the threshold of a new election with many old questions still unanswered. ... It is now time to make a decision and be held accountable for it,"
Orrin Hatch,"I believe he's grasped the gravity of the situation. I won't talk about our conversation (Sunday) morning but I believe in having this conversation, I believe he knows how grave it is and I think he knows how important it is and he's trying to work through this."
Orrin Hatch,"(Clinton) has an obligation as the highest official in this government, sworn to uphold the Constitution and the laws of this country. If he doesn't do that, I think public opinion would turn overwhelmingly against him, ... Face The Nation."
Orrin Hatch,"I believe this modification is warranted so as to inform the Congress and the public of any involvement by the State Department and the Cuban government in the raid,"
Orrin Hatch,"I feel a great source of comfort in your nomination,"
Orrin Hatch,"There is a good reason they call these ceremonies 'commencement exercises'. Graduation is not the end, it's the beginning."
Orrin Hatch,"For the most part, passage of the DMCA has proven to be an achievement settling many complex liability issues up front and allowing the online businesses to grow.

Orrin Hatch,Microsoft is engaging in unlawful predatory practices that go well beyond the scope of fair competition.
Sylvia Hatchell,This could very easily be the national championship game. There will be a lot of talent on that floor.
Sylvia Hatchell,"I am very confident with Alex and the rest of them out there. Alex has played a lot this year. She plays with Ivory, and I know when Ivory picked up her second foul and I took her out, we were behind at that time. Alex did a nice job running the team, and we got the lead back."
Sylvia Hatchell,"I just think this is a real special group. They have a passion for playing, and not just playing but playing the way we play: up and down the court."
Sylvia Hatchell,I'm happy for our kids. They work really hard. But we know we can't relax. Everybody's going to be after us. And we want to be No. 1 at the end of the season.
Sylvia Hatchell,"I didn't feel we were in rhythm today, especially after Ivory got hurt. She's our spark that gets us going, and I just felt that the energy that we normally have just wasn't there."
Sylvia Hatchell,I don't see that they have any weaknesses really. It's an honor to beat them because they're such a great team.
Sylvia Hatchell,It's an honor to play them and to have won this game.
Sylvia Hatchell,"She is a force to be reckoned with out there. She's stronger, more aggressive and knows our system better."
Sylvia Hatchell,"I think this will definitely help us. When you go through a tough environment like this, it makes you tough."
Sylvia Hatchell,"She just makes people smile. She makes people feel good. She brings a freshness to the game, and her enthusiasm can't help but spread."
Sylvia Hatchell,She's our heart and soul. Her spirit and enthusiasm are what drives us.
Sylvia Hatchell,"Her excitement and enthusiasm and passion for the game, it makes people smile. I can't tell you the number of letters and e-mails and phone calls we have gotten from people that have just said how she brightens their day. ... I feel like the way we play and having a player like Ivory sells the game of basketball."
Sylvia Hatchell,"I love playing over here. This is a great environment. This is what every coach and every player dreams of, to play in a situation like this."
Sylvia Hatchell,We don't have the commitment to rebounding we need to have. We need to get better in that area.

Sylvia Hatchell,"She had one turnover. I mean, I think that's why she's the best point guard in America."
Ken Hatfield,"Everybody likes to play at home, and we're no exception, ... I guarantee you we are anxious to play at home one time this year and see what it looks and feels like."
Ken Hatfield,We were playing most of our games against teams east of the Mississippi River. We needed to go our own way and play Western teams. We were the new kid on the block as far as the service academies were concerned. We needed to gain our own identity.
Ken Hatfield,"The defense came up with some big turnovers, ... That's good. We're around the ball hitting folks, and that was a real plus."
Ken Hatfield,"I think every one of our guys felt that way when they started, even some on defense. That's something that they'll learn. They've known the speed of the game now, and they see that you just don't stand around; you'd better go attack somebody."
Scott Hatteberg,We've got a lot of young guys who have really flown up the learning curve.
Scott Hatteberg,You don't know what a guy's got. I always feel like the pitcher has the advantage. I talk to a lot of guys that faced [pitchers]. I go over video. It's very early. I hate to get too up or too down about whatever I'm doing. I get on base. That's been something I try to do and have taken pride in my whole career.
Scott Hatteberg,Feel it? It is one of the more amazing things I've felt here. It's the resilience and the ability mentally for the team not to fold. They come back from deficits that where I came from (Oakland) they'd say let's get through nine and look for tomorrow.
Aaliyah Haughton,"Keep working hard and you can get anything that you want. If God gave you the talent, you should go for it. But don't think it's going to be easy. It's hard!"
Aaliyah Haughton,"I think it's important to take a break, you know, from the public eye for a while, and give people a chance to miss you. I want longevity. I don't want to get out there and run myself ragged and spread myself thin."
Aaliyah Haughton,It's hard to say what I want my legacy to be when I'm long gone.
Aaliyah Haughton,You have to love what you do to want to do it everyday.
Vaclav Havel,The role of the writer is not simply to arrange Being according to his own lights; he must also serve as a medium to Being and remain open to its often unfathomable dictates. This is the only way the work can transcend its creator and radiate its meaning further than the author himself can see or perceive.
Vaclav Havel,"There can be no doubt that distrust of words is less harmful than unwarranted trust in them. Besides, to distrust words, and indict them for the horrors that might slumber unobtrusively within them --isn't this, after all, the true vocation of the intellectual?"
Vaclav Havel,"Work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed."
Vaclav Havel,"The tragedy of modern man is not that he knows less and less about the meaning of his own life, but that it bothers him less and less."
Vaclav Havel,"The dissident does not operate in the realm of genuine power at all. He is not seeking power. He has no desire for office and does not gather votes. He does not attempt to charm the public, he offers nothing and promises nothing. He can offer, if anything, only his own skin -- and he offers it solely because he has no other way of affirming the truth he stands for. His actions simply articulate his dignity as a citizen, regardless of the cost."
Vaclav Havel,"Without free, self-respecting, and autonomous citizens there can be no free and independent nations. Without internal peace, that is, peace among citizens and between the citizens and the state, there can be no guarantee of external peace."
Vaclav Havel,"The attempt to devote oneself to literature alone is a most deceptive thing, and often, paradoxically, it is literature that suffers for it."
Vaclav Havel,You have no idea how happy I am that you have won the Nobel Prize in literature. I think you absolutely deserve it.
Vaclav Havel,"That is very dangerous, ... in an absolutely legal way and in accordance with the wording of the law, but against the spirit of the ... constitution."
Vaclav Havel,"Just as the constant increase of entropy is the basic law of the universe, so it is the basic law of life to be ever more highly structured and to struggle against entropy."
Vaclav Havel,"The law is only one of several imperfect and more or less external ways of defending what is better in life against what is worse. By itself, the law can never create anything better. Establishing respect for the law does not automatically ensure a better life for that, after all, is a job for people and not for laws and institutions."
Vaclav Havel,Anyone who takes himself too seriously always runs the risk of looking ridiculous; anyone who can consistently laugh at himself does not.
Vaclav Havel,"Now we have a sort of economical drying of intellectuals,"
Vaclav Havel,"Just as many showed their solidarity with us when we were striving for freedom, so now we must show solidarity to those who are only striving for it in uneasy conditions,"
Vaclav Havel,It is as if many have again ignored the fact that an attack on the freedom of individuals threatens the freedom of all.
Vaclav Havel,"When a truth is not given complete freedom, freedom is not complete."
Vaclav Havel,"I feel with leaving office I will enter a new realm of great freedom than I have had ... and I will speak more freely,"
Vaclav Havel,"The award is destined for scientists who do not fear to touch on some of the darkest aspects of being without betraying what they have achieved. On the contrary, they head in this direction,"
Vaclav Havel,Our task is to feel the danger of these regimes.
Vaclav Havel,"When the internal crisis of the totalitarian system grows so deep that it becomes clear to everyone, and when more and more people learn to speak their own language and reject the hollow, mendacious language of the powers that be, it means that freedom is remarkably close, if not directly within reach,"
Vaclav Havel,"All respected domestic and international organizations agree that your demands are justified. Therefore I wish you strength, endurance, courage and fortunate decisions."
Vaclav Havel,"A state that denies its citizens their basic rights becomes a danger to its neighbors as well: internal arbitrary rule will be reflected in arbitrary external relations. The suppression of public opinion, the abolition of public competition for power and its public exercise opens the way for the state power to arm itself in any way it sees fit. A state that does not hesitate to lie to its own people will not hesitate to lie to other states."
Vaclav Havel,"Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out"
Vaclav Havel,Isn't it the moment of most profound doubt that gives birth to new certainties? Perhaps hopelessness is the very soil that nourishes human hope; perhaps one could never find sense in life without first experiencing its absurdity...
Vaclav Havel,"Twenty or thirty years ago, in the army, we had a lot of obscure adventures, and years later we tell them at parties, and suddenly we realize that those two very difficult years of our lives have become lumped together into a few episodes that have lodged in our memory in a standardized form, and are always told in a standardized way, in the same words. But in fact that lump of memories has nothing whatsoever to do with our experience of those two years in the army and what it has made of us."
Vaclav Havel,A human action becomes genuinely important when it springs from the soil of a clear-sighted awareness of the temporality and the ephemerally of everything human. It is only this awareness that can breathe any greatness into an action.
Vaclav Havel,"The deeper the experience of an absence of meaning -- in other words, of absurdity --the more energetically meaning is sought."
Vaclav Havel,"The exercise of power is determined by thousands of interactions between the world of the powerful and that of the powerless, all the more so because these worlds are never divided by a sharp line: everyone has a small part of himself in both."
Vance Havner,If we don't come apart; we will come apart.
Vance Havner,"Civilization today reminds me of an ape with a blowtorch playing in a room full of dynamite. It looks like the monkeys are about to operate the zoo, and the inmates are taking over the asylum."
Vance Havner,Many people are in a rut and a rut is nothing but a grave - with both ends kicked out.
Vance Havner,"Sometimes your medicine bottle has on it, ''Shake well before using.'' That is what God has to do with some of His people. He has to shake them well before they are ever usable."
Vance Havner,Too many church services start at eleven sharp and end at twelve dull.
Vance Havner,I'm tired of hearing sin called sickness and alcoholism a disease. It is the only disease I know of that we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year to spread.
Vance Havner,"If they had a social gospel in the days of the prodigal son, somebody would have given him a bed and a sandwich and he never would have gone home."
Vance Havner,The vision must be followed by the venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps - we must step up the stairs.
Vance Havner,The devil will let a preacher prepare a sermon if it will keep him from preparing himself.
Vance Havner,Doing leads more surely to talking than talking to doing.
A.J. Hawk,Once your bowl game is over this is what you work for. That's why I want to come here and compete. I don't want to delay it any longer. I'm ready to get back to doing some football-type things instead of working on mainly these drills.
A.J. Hawk,We knew Notre Dame was coming out to make plays. They have a ton of talent [but] we always talk about our next play [being] the most important.
A.J. Hawk,"You want to come in and prove yourself early. Obviously, it is a responsibility being drafted that high to come in and play well and to make an impact. If not, you're going to get cut. So you have to come in, make the team, have an impact and do something special. And I feel that, obviously, internally. I feel an obligation to myself to do that but obviously the organization, the fans, this community. I mean, they don't want to see a first-round draft pick be a bust, so I feel I have to come in and hopefully make an impact early."
A.J. Hawk,"It's a position where a lot of times they say they don't want to draft people too high because they think 'How much impact can a linebacker have?' I guess it's understandable. Obviously we're not big defensive ends who are going to get 15 to 18 sacks a year. We're not going to be a running back who's going to rush for 1,500 yards. But all I want's a chance, regardless of where I'm taken."
A.J. Hawk,Everybody talked about giving Charlie Weis four weeks to prepare. That kind of upset me. What about giving coach Tress four weeks to prepare? He's four out of five in bowl games.
A.J. Hawk,We knew they'd come out â€” with the atmosphere of the game and electricity in the air â€” they'd come out ready to play. And we knew we had to match that. I think coming out and giving up that early touchdown hurt us a little bit.
A.J. Hawk,That's what we do every game: affect the quarterback and just be a physical defense - a defense that people like to watch.
A.J. Hawk,I told all of the coaches here that we had two of the most physical safeties in the country playing behind me. I knew if I didn't make the tackle they were probably going to hit me on their way to make the tackle. So I had to get there first before them.
A.J. Hawk,They found some playmakers on their team. They are playing with a lot of confidence.
A.J. Hawk,"They completed a lot of balls. But when we needed to make plays, we did."
A.J. Hawk,We knew they'd come out  with the atmosphere of the game and electricity in the air  they'd come out ready to play. And we knew we had to match that. I think coming out and giving up that early touchdown hurt us a little bit.
Tony Hawk,"These sports are just -- you go do it, and you're doing it on your own. You don't have to answer to anyone."
Tony Hawk,"I consider skateboarding an art form, a lifestyle and a sport."
Tony Hawk,"I love snowboarding, but I would never want to do it competitively or at a professional level. Snowboarding is a spawn of skating, and skating is my passion."
Tony Hawk,I won't quit skating until I am physically unable.
Paul Hawken,The luck of having talent is not enough; one must also have a talent for luck.
Paul Hawken,Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them.
Paul Hawken,"We assume that everything's becoming more efficient, and in an immediate sense that's true; our lives are better in many ways. But that improvement has been gained through a massively inefficient use of natural resources."
Paul Hawken,We are now heading down a centuries-long path toward increasing the productivity of our natural capital - the resource systems upon which we depend to live - instead of our human capital.
Paul Hawken,All is connected... no one thing can change by itself.
Stephen Hawking,It matters if you just don't give up.
Stephen Hawking,It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value
Stephen Hawking,There are grounds for cautious optimism that we may now be near the end ofthe search for the ultimate laws of nature.
Stephen Hawking,The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
Stephen Hawking,"The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a certain underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired."
Stephen Hawking,"My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all."
Stephen Hawking,Someone told me that each equation I included in the book would halve the sales.
Stephen Hawking,"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?"
Stephen Hawking,"When one's expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have"
Stephen Hawking,Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.
Stephen Hawking,I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.
Coleman Hawkins,"If you don't make mistakes, you aren't really trying."
Coleman Hawkins,Music should always be an adventure.
Coleman Hawkins,I made the tenor sax - there's nobody plays like me and I don't play like anybody else.
Coleman Hawkins,Some people say there was no jazz tenor before me. All I know is I just had a way of playing and I didn't think in terms of any other instrument but the tenor.
Coleman Hawkins,"I honestly can't characterize my style in words. It seems that whatever comes to me naturally, I play."
Dan Hawkins,I've always said the one key to recruiting is to recruit the mom. So I'm recruiting the mom hard right now.
Dan Hawkins,"When I need to nail that riff to the cross, Marshall will always provide the hammer!"
Dan Hawkins,Hopefully it adds a little spice and adds a little diversity and will be something new for teams to go against as well as fans to see.
Dan Hawkins,"You bet there is. It's called hard work, determination and preparation. There's a lot of work to be done."
Dan Hawkins,"I though he was a good player, ... His JC (junior college) coach was going 'Hey I got a quarterback' and I said 'yeah I know, but we don't need a JC guy.' It's good he landed on his feet."
Dan Hawkins,"I though he was a good player. His JC (junior college) coach was going 'Hey I got a quarterback' and I said 'yeah I know, but we don't need a JC guy.' It's good he landed on his feet."
Dan Hawkins,"You've got a terrible tragedy, and everybody's trying to piece their lives back together, ... Everybody's got their own circumstances to deal with. It's not so much about what he can do for the team, but more what the team can do for him."
Dan Hawkins,"I should make a donation to their favorite charity, because I didn't give 'em their money's worth, that's for sure,"
Dan Hawkins,We are not so smart in this game that a guy that has great athletic ability or skills can't be utilized on the other side of the ball.
Dan Hawkins,"For us, the exposure on TV and the ease and ability to travel here is pretty impressive. I think you'll see this thing continue to grow."
David Hawkins,"What this report shows is that with careful government regulation, companies can lower the pollution coming from power plants smokestacks - and we should be doing this with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, too."
David Hawkins,I think this is a good example of why many colleges and high schools have de-emphasized class rank. It's part of the education process that doesn't involve education.
David Hawkins,I wish I were more optimistic of our ability to get a broad slice of the public to understand this and be motivated to act.
John Hawkins,"Now, instead of learning a valuable lesson, the city has discriminated and retaliated against Ms. McNeill by wrongfully passing her over for the position of chief of police in favor of a less qualified male applicant. When she then sought protection under the law as she had been forced to do before, the city fired her after nearly 30 years of dedicated public service."
John Hawkins,The men have long been unpaid and need relief.
John Hawkins,"We recognize the fundamental importance of good corporate governance and determined it would be prudent as a public company to separate the roles of board chairman and CEO,"
Justin Hawkins,We pride ourselves on that. The guys who are playing just can't go through the motions like they would be able to against some scout teams. It's like they're going against the same competition they play against every day in practice.
Justin Hawkins,We recorded the same line. I did it better than him but his management kicked up a stink and he is going to do it again today
Justin Hawkins,Chris Martin - what are those seven deadly sins again? Greed? Sloth? Calling your child Apple?
Justin Hawkins,"It really was an awful, awful environment,"
Justin Hawkins,"[RTB isn't an ordinary producer in the same way that The Darkness aren't an ordinary band. He and the band were introduced in Los Angeles, instantly bonded over a mutual love of rock and were able to start assembling the album together.] Roy Thomas Baker is a genius, that's all there is to say about it. ... It's been a privilege to watch that man work, his ear is perfect, his instinct fabulous."
Justin Hawkins,"There's no way that a fan of The Darkness, based on what we did on the last record, is not going to love this record even more than the first one."
Ronnie Hawkins,"They should never have to hire anybody from outside for big jobs in Canada. It's weird thinking, ... Keep the money in the country if you can. Canada has got the acts that can do the job in any vein."
Ronnie Hawkins,"I don't know who's left to hear us. But if there are people who want the real thing, we've got it. My band rocks, and I plan to keep doing it 'till nobody shows up to see it anymore."
Ronnie Hawkins,"I hope the Canada Pops can play in E and A. I do 'Forty Days' and 'Bo Diddley'. I don't change songs, just bands."
Ronnie Hawkins,"We were playing, not for the drunks, but for the musicians, because it was more intellectually challenging. We needed somewhere to put our energy to show that we were growing, and as we started to achieve this, people came to hear us musically."
Ronnie Hawkins,"A good band is like a team. You want to have the right balance. It's not always the best people you need, but the right ones for the job."
Ronnie Hawkins,"Wherever there are rock 'n' rollers, we'll play. That's what we've been doing for more than 30 years - rock 'n' roll. It's made me everything from an honorary mayor to honorary member of a motorcycle gang."
Ronnie Hawkins,"'The bigtime for you is just around the corner.' They told me that first in 1952 - boy, it's been a long corner. If I don't hit the bigtime in the next 25 or 30 years, I'm gonna pack in the music business and become a full-time gigolo."
Ronnie Hawkins,I am a cross between Carl Perkins and Led Zeppelin.
Ronnie Hawkins,"I spent ninety percent of my money on wine, women and song and just wasted the other ten percent."
Steve Hawkins,"If the whole thing was here, a lot of teams would be in a lot of trouble. Toledo is really hard to handle here. They played hungry and inspired. They were tremendous."
Steve Hawkins,"I don't want to make it sound like coach talk, but we know as quickly as the success comes it can go. It has to be protected. The formula involved is one thing and one thing only -- good players who are good kids. When you combine the two it makes it a lot easier to go into battle."
Steve Hawkins,"We believe that the BCMIF portfolio is ideally suited to benefit from the growing support and strength of the biotech and life sciences markets, and we are excited by the opportunity to further support venture capital investment in one of the fastest growing and most dynamic sectors of the economy."
Steve Hawkins,"Besides his scoring and everything, he's constantly shifting the praise to others. He was close to breaking the school scoring record and we'd mention it and he's like: 'Yeah, whatever.' He talks about how well everybody else is playing. You put all that together and he's a dream come true."
Steve Hawkins,"I was concerned when I found out his parents had both gone to Central Michigan and his high school coach had graduated from Central. I knew Central was recruiting him and became very concerned. Brian let me know early on that he was very interested in Western, and he was true to his word. That put my mind at ease that he was going to look at things openly."
Steve Hawkins,We competed hard; we just couldn't keep them off the glass. That was the game in a nutshell.
Steve Hawkins,"He showed his competitive greatness tonight. At a point when things were getting shaky, Brian was our steadying force."
Tim Hawkins,"We were up and running quickly. Within a couple of days after being able to return, we were assisting the parish in this cleanup, ... I would maintain that the response of the parish is unfair. Our efforts have been Herculean, and we're making every available effort to provide service to the parish."
Tim Hawkins,I didn't want to force people to buy the damage waiver.
Tim Hawkins,"Customization is a powerful opportunity because consumers tell us that customization leads to higher levels of motivation in incorporating fitness into their weekly routine. It also creates greater consumer confidence because consumers can select what they will use for years to come, while components can be updated as family fitness patterns evolve."
Tim Hawkins,"Customization is a powerful opportunity because consumers tell us that customization leads to higher levels of motivation in incorporating fitness into their weekly routine, ... It also creates greater consumer confidence because consumers can select what they will use for years to come, while components can be updated as family fitness patterns evolve."
Tim Hawkins,It's a project to provide curriculum material for teachers all over America and to provide that with audio supporting material that will encourage students to further study literature and the craft of writing.
Tim Hawkins,"We feel like the action is unfair,"
Trip Hawkins,"Steve never knew his parents. He makes so much noise in life, he cries so loud about everything, that I keep thinking he feels that if he just cries loud enough, his real parents will hear and know that they made a mistake giving him up."
Trip Hawkins,"Besides, games like total eclipse and john madden football combine great texture-mapping and polygon rendering, and that's a pretty satisfactory experience right now."
Trip Hawkins,"I heard about one very active online game in which two avatars [highly customizable drawings or photos of people, animals, cartoon characters, or inanimate objects that online users employ as identification in communicating with their peers] got married in the game. Later, I found out that the two people behind the avatars really did get married. And have children!"
Trip Hawkins,What that means initially is that you have alot of products that are only slightly better games in the same genre on another machine - and the titles that really take advantage of the machine come along later.
Trip Hawkins,"We also had good software in the key categories and more focus on the gameplaying capability, so more of the marketing effort was targeted at game customers."
Trip Hawkins,The way companies hang on to their marketshare is by being scared.
Trip Hawkins,The only problem we've had is the amount of time it's taking people to develop titles.
Trip Hawkins,None of our competitors have ever made two systems that run the same software.
Trip Hawkins,"Lower labor costs and tax benefits have, for example, caused publishers like EA, UbiSoft, and others to move more production to Canada."
Trip Hawkins,I can't tell you how important it was for us to be successful in japan.
Trip Hawkins,From day one our next generation system will run all our exsisting software - so that gives us a head start.
Trip Hawkins,But we also think that we've got more quite alot more support than any new format has ever had.
Trip Hawkins,"And initially, a lot of companies avoid trying to make a really radical new kind of title for a new system, because that would involve learning a new machine and learning how to make the new title at the same time."
Trip Hawkins,Online console gaming will continue to grow at a healthy pace.
Trip Hawkins,HD will only be relevant in the long run if applications like football use it effectively to enable you to see more of the field.
Trip Hawkins,"With our next generation hardware, polygon rendering will probably be an area we'll get more heavily into."
Trip Hawkins,"We're all going to be dead in 100 years, so in the meantime if you want to use the most advanced system this year, then you have to buy a 3DO."
Trip Hawkins,We want to make as big a market as we can with our current product.
Trip Hawkins,"Console game publishing has become more like theatrical release film-making and it is very hard if you are not one of the major publishers, and even for them it is hard unless they are working with major game brands."
Trip Hawkins,I'm not saying that more performance wouldn't be better - all these technologies are going to get better - that's the difference between first generation and second generation.
Trip Hawkins,We'll look at the japanese launch as a model and aspire to have things go as well as they did over there.
Trip Hawkins,"If you always wanted to wait for something better, you'd never buy anything, right?"
Trip Hawkins,"Digital Chocolate has 60% of its developers in Finland where the sun never sets in the summer and there is nothing to do outside in the winter, so we are very productive!"
Trip Hawkins,But any big change is more likely to result if there is a disruptive event such as new technologies or platforms that have a surprising effect on market share.
Trip Hawkins,There's a basic principle about consumer electronics: it gets more powerful all the time and it gets cheaper all the time. that's true of all types of consumer electronics.
Trip Hawkins,There have always been a lot of exclusive licenses and sometimes the publisher cuts some corners or gets a bit lazy and the quality goes down.
Trip Hawkins,"So the guy that we're really targeting our system at this year is one of the guys who brought a 16bit system three or four years ago and has pretty much had it with that, and he's ready to buy something new."
Trip Hawkins,"As a result, we will continue to see more innovation on the Internet and on mobile phones than on consoles."
Steven Hawks,The findings provide support for intuitive eating as a positive approach to healthy weight management.
Steven Hawks,Intuitive eating is a way to recognize all those influences and learn ways to counter that in terms of hunger and satisfaction. The idea that you can eat what you want is very threatening. But our bodies don't want junk food all day long; they want a tremendous variety of food.
Steven Hawks,Being in Thailand opened my eyes to seeing how people relate differently to food.
Goldie Hawn,"Oh, but Ingrid Bergman is a woman's woman. I mean, she is everything a woman should be. She's the kind of woman men aren't afraid of because she's so warm. She has a real quality. It's too bad she isn't queen of some country."
Goldie Hawn,"I must say that the biggest lesson you can learn in life, or teach your children, is that life is not castles in the skies, happily ever after. The biggest lesson we have to give our children is truth. We're all built with illusions. And they break."
Goldie Hawn,"Never apologize for your success because you worked hard for it,"
Goldie Hawn,I have witnessed the softening of the hardest of hearts by a simple smile.
Goldie Hawn,"There aren't many romantic comedies anymore that star just a female lead without being paired with a male lead,"
Goldie Hawn,I wanted to investigate the nature of this joy.
Goldie Hawn,All I ever wanted to be was happy.
Goldie Hawn,"You had a whole life's design, what motivated you when the negativity surrounded you?"
Goldie Hawn,"There are only three ages for women in Hollywood--Babe, District Attorney, and Driving Miss Daisy."
Goldie Hawn,"There are only three ages for women in Hollywood - Babe, District Attorney, and Driving Miss Daisy"
Goldie Hawn,"The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are, and not who people think you are."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Man's own youth is the world's youth; at least he feels as if it were, and imagines that the earth's granite substance is something not yet hardened, and which he can mould into whatever shape he likes."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"A grave, wherever found, preaches a short and pithy sermon to the soul"
Nathaniel Hawthorne,This world owes all its forward impulses to people ill at ease.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"I wonder that we Americans love our country at all, it having no limits and no oneness; and when you try to make it a matter of the heart, everything falls away except one's native State; --neither can you seize hold of that, unless you tear it out of the Union, bleeding and quivering."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Dr Johnson's morality was as English an article as a beefsteak.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which one is true."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"It is a good lesson --though it may often be a hard one --for a man who has dreamed of literary fame, and of making for himself a rank among the world's dignitaries by such means, to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized, and to find how utterly devoid of all significance, beyond that circle, is all that he achieves, and all he aims at."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility. from The Scarlet Letter"
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Mankind are earthen jugs with spirits in them.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Generosity is the flower of justice.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,She had not known the weight until she felt the freedom!
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"My heart was a habitation large enough for many guests, but lonely and chill, and without a household fire. I longed to kindle one! It seemed not so wild a dream . . ."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Is it a fact -- or have I dreamt it -- that, by means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve, vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time?"
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Eager souls, mystics and revolutionaries, may propose to refashion the world in accordance with their dreams; but evil remains, and so long as it lurks in the secret places of the heart, utopia is only the shadow of a dream"
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"A bodily disease which we look upon as whole and entire within itself, may, after all, be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Let men tremble to win the hand of woman, unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart! Else it may be their miserable fortune, when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities, to be reproached even for the calm content, the marble image of happiness, which they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Shall we never, never get rid of this Past? cried he, keeping up the earnest tone of his preceding conversation. It lies upon the Present like a giant's dead body."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Words - so innocent and powerless as they are, as standing in a dictionary, how potent for good and evil they become in the hands of one who knows how to combine them."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,What we call real estate - the solid ground to build a house on - is the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of this world rests.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,A hero cannot be a hero unless in a heroic world.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"A stale article, if you dip it in a good, warm, sunny smile, will go off better than a fresh one that you've scowled upon."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Nobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom, to know when it ought to be resisted, and when it be obeyed."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Time flies over us, but leaves it shadow behind."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"The only sensible ends of literature are, first, the pleasurable toil of writing; second, the gratification of one's family and friends; and lastly, the solid cash."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Life is made up of marble and mud.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Mountains are earth's undecaying monuments.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Our Creator would never have made such lovely days, and have given us the deep hearts to enjoy them, above and beyond all thought, unless we were meant to be immortal."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a deathlike slumber, must always create sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, this it overflows upon the outward world."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Caresses, expressions of one sort or another, are necessary to the life of the affections as leaves are to the life of a tree. If they are wholly restrained, love will die at the roots."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"My fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and, altogether beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,What other dungeon is so dark as one's own heart! What jailer so inexorable as one's self !
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Our most intimate friend is not he to whom we show the worst, but the best of our nature."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,The world owes all its onward impulses to men ill at ease. The happy man inevitably confines himself within ancient limits.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Moonlight is sculpture.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,You can get assent to almost any proposition so long as you are not going to do anything about it.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvelous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Selfishness is one of the qualities apt to inspire love.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"A woman's chastity consists, like an onion, of a series of coats."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Nobody has any conscience about adding to the improbabilities of a marvelous tale.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health, to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Sunlight is painting.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,Every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect whether he chooses to be so or not.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,A pure hand needs no glove to cover it.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,"No author, without a trial, can conceive of the difficulty of writing a romance about a country where there is no shadow, no antiquity, no mystery, no picturesque and gloomy wrong, nor anything but a commonplace prosperity, in broad and simple daylight, as is happily the case with my dear native land."
Louise Hay,We are each responsible for all of our experiences.
Louise Hay,The point of power is always in the present moment.
Louise Hay,The thoughts we choose to think are the tools we use to paint the canvas of our lives.
Louise Hay,Every thought we think is creating our future.
Louise Hay,Love is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives.
Louise Hay,"If we really love ourselves, everything in our life works."
Nicky Hayden,"I enjoyed running at that pace, I tried to just hang on to Valentino,"
Nicky Hayden,"The race is always what's important. Qualifying now is so important. You have so many riders, so close together. The way the grid is it's really important to qualify well. The bike feels so much better today than yesterday. We didn't change anything major - just a few little things to get it to steer and get my confidence up to where I can ride it. That last lap was fun. Michelin qualifiers around hereâ€¦ you can hang it out and go for it. When you've got that grip you just kind of open the throttle and go for it. I feel like with a good start we can be right in there with the boys."
Nicky Hayden,I'm so happy to be to be on the podium today. Before the race things weren't going to plan. In the morning warm-up we were so slow and were in real trouble. My guys made some changes and I have to be real grateful to them as they got it right and that's why I got third. The bike was so much better in the race than it had been all weekend - so much faster.
Nicky Hayden,"Things are steadily coming better, but I'm having problems with a few places on the track."
Nicky Hayden,"We've improved the machine, found some good tires and I think I've  improved my riding as well over these past two days."
Nicky Hayden,"I'm looking forward to this end part of the season, ... Riding  the bike in Japan for a factory Honda rider is a real honour. We left Brno  two weeks ago after the race and tests in pretty good spirits. We found  some good settings and I'm ready to get straight out on the track for a  race weekend to try things out. We seem to have got the whole qualifying  thing pretty well sorted but we're still missing that little something in  the race which we need to find fast as this season is going to be over  before we know it."
Nicky Hayden,"I'm so happy to be to be on the podium,"
Nicky Hayden,"I was hoping to go under (one minute) 29.5 and it is quite fun when the bike is working and the lap comes together,"
Nicky Hayden,"Definitely it was quite fun. When it?s like that, the bike?s working, the bike has got grip, and the lap comes together, it?s a lot of fun to ride the bike like that. Really enjoyed it."
Tom Hayden,Coalition for Police Accountability.
Tom Hayden,The peace and justice movement has to expand and not run away from the plight of gang members.
Tom Hayden,"If you look at the data, the inner city that was the riot zone lost 55,000 jobs in the ten years from 1992 to 2002, instead of gaining a surplus of 50,000."
Tom Hayden,He was a reflection of what was going on. The poem 'Howl' was a howl against the hypocrisy and silence of the generations of the 1950s -- of the people who failed to perform their function as real elders.
Tom Hayden,"If I were George W. Bush, I would be terrorized by the eyes of those scruffy-looking veterans, the so-called band of brothers, volunteering for duty with the Kerry campaign. They look like men with scores to settle."
Tom Hayden,"The only possibility of reform in Los Angeles, which is a 'see no, hear no evil' city, is if there is the glaring eye of outside investigators from Sacramento and from Washington D.C.,"
Tom Hayden,I wish that I'd been in Congress at some point. Especially now with Bush there. But I would have a really hard time getting elected because of my views. L.A. is very ethnic. Many of the Jewish voters would not support me because of my views on the Middle East.
Tom Hayden,"It takes a certain kind of bravery and a certain kind of goodness to be able to not just put your destructive past behind you, but to continue to take harassment from society and from police for your past."
Tom Hayden,"I've written a book on gangs, taught a course on gangs at Occidental."
F. A. Hayek,"This is the constitutional limitation of man's knowledge and interests, the fact that he cannot know more than a tiny part of the whole of society and that therefore all that can enter into his motives are the immediate effects which his actions will have in the sphere he knows."
F. A. Hayek,the case for individual freedom rests largely on the recognition of the inevitable and universal ignorance of all of us concerning a great many of the factors on which the achievements of our ends and welfare depend.
F. A. Hayek,"Ever since the beginning of modern science, the best minds have recognized that the range of acknowledged ignorance will grow with the advance of science. Unfortunately, the popular effect of this scientific advance has been a belief, seemingly shared by many scientists, that the range of our ignorance is steadily diminishing and that we can therefore aim at more comprehensive and deliberate control of all human activities. It is for this reason that those intoxicated by the advance of knowledge so often become the enemies of freedom."
F. A. Hayek,"It may indeed prove to be far the most difficult and not the least important task for human reason rationally to comprehend its own limitations. It is essential for the growth of reason that as individuals we should bow to forces and obey principles which we cannot hope fully to understand, yet on which the advance and even the preservation of civilization depend."
F. A. Hayek,it is largely because civilization enables us constantly to profit from knowledge which we individually do not possess and because each individual's use of his particular knowledge may serve to assist others unknown to him in achieving their ends that men as members of civilized society can pursue their individual ends so much more successfully than they could alone.
Edward Hayes,Innocent men get accused and with evidence everybody thinks is true.

John Hayes,We have always escorted our programs. We've always had security staff on our programs.
John Hayes,"Ellen, Annie and Scorsese all collaborated and helped build the ad ideas."
Matt Hayes,"I think we just wanted it more. It wasn't a pretty game with mistakes all across the board, but we had some fight at the end and wanted it."
Matt Hayes,"We want to relax and play our game. We want to play our game and not make mistakes. If we do that and don't panic and have a good counter to what they do, we will be fine."
Matt Hayes,Whoever made the least mistakes in a game like this is going to win. Whoever doesn't goes home a loser.

Woody Hayes,Paralyze resistance with persistence
Woody Hayes,"Any time you give a man something he doesn't earn, you cheapen him. Our kids earn what they get, and that includes respect."

Justin Hayward,And if you stop and think about it you won't believe it's true: That all the love you've been giving has all been meant for you.
Justin Hayward,I sometimes don't know what songs are about for several years after I've written them.
Justin Hayward,"Just what you want to be, you will be in the end."
Justin Hayward,"My songs form a kind of biography or diary of my life as they are about people I have loved and people I only knew in my heart, places I have seen only for a moment and places I have lived all my life."
Susan Hayward,"Don't worry, you'll be taken care of."
Susan Hayward,"There's so much potential here in Huron and the fairgrounds are beautiful,"
Susan Hayward,"What we have done in past years is we have different types of shows, the rock bands, the '70s shows. We've gone back over five to six years and looked to see what has done the best, and it has always been classic country."
Susan Hayward,"I don't know if that's entertainment or people with gas issues or what it would be, but I'm not concerned about it at this point."
Bryan Hazard,"He's been a different kid. Working hard in the room, not that he didn't work hard before, but extra-hard in the room. Putting in the extra time, being a good leader. All of the things you need to be to be successful."
Bryan Hazard,It's a cash cow. You want to raise funds. You want to give people their proper due.
Bryan Hazard,I can't imagine being a CEO of big business. We are going down to crunch time trying to get everything squared away.
Lee Hazlewood,"When we did that kind of stuff our only rule was... Well, we didn't have any rules, really, but my rule, because I was the drinker of the group, was not at any time of the day before the night we're working."
Lee Hazlewood,"Well, you'll find the most boring part of it is the waiting, at least if it's in films anyway. Television's a lot faster, but the product... I don't think it's as good as a film."
Lee Hazlewood,"There's nothing worse, I guess, than being black in an all-white church or being southern and being a liberal."
Lee Hazlewood,"The thing I hated about it was that you live in your trailer all the time and then they call you and you do maybe two dozen lines. Then they do that for three hours and you wait and wait and wait, and I don't like waiting."
Lee Hazlewood,"The movie wasn't a hit, although it did well in Europe for some reason."
Lee Hazlewood,"Sweden was very nice. I did a lot of television. I wrote, directed and was in a lot of television there."
Lee Hazlewood,So I became a producer because I knew one of the reasons was they didn't do them the way I thought was right.
Lee Hazlewood,"So anyway, I really enjoyed the European audiences."
Lee Hazlewood,"People think I'm crazy because I travel too much, but I haven't been doing any of that lately because I got a little sick this year and I've tried to take care of it."
Lee Hazlewood,"Oh no, I'm not a historian or anything like that."
Lee Hazlewood,"Nobody heard records of you playing whatever the melody was on those low strings. It worked out good, you know, about 25 or 26 million records later. I guess it worked out alright."
Lee Hazlewood,"If it was Europe, I just picked a country that I hadn't been to, but I didn't try to check up on what was going on in the country or anything like that. I just went and had a good time and met a lot of very nice people who are still my friends."
Lee Hazlewood,"I'm not a very good actor, I don't think."
Lee Hazlewood,"I used to not stutter any. Oh, I did when I was a kid, I stuttered, I had a bad stutter until I was probably between the second and third grade and a guy got rid of it for me."
Lee Hazlewood,"I think for writers who write that kind of stuff, they want to make changes. Look at Kris Kristofferson and Dylan. I mean, whole generations come along liking that stuff and that's great."
Lee Hazlewood,"I just did one movie and there was no career for me, anyway."
Lee Hazlewood,"I always liked circuses, so I would have enjoyed that."
Lee Hazlewood,"I tell ya, I could have got some more jobs if I'd tried, but I went to Sweden instead."
William Hazlitt,"The characteristic of Chaucer is intensity: of Spencer, remoteness: of Milton elevation and of Shakespeare everything."
William Hazlitt,He who draws upon his own resources easily comes to an end of his wealth.

William Hazlitt,"There is nothing more likely to drive a person mad than . . . an obstinate, constitutional preference of the truth to the agreeable."
William Hazlitt,Malice often takes the garb of truth
William Hazlitt,"The way to secure success, is to be more anxious about obtaining than about deserving it; the surest hindrance to it is to have too high a standard of refinement in our own minds, or too high an opinion of the discernment of the public."
William Hazlitt,"Life is a continued struggle to be what we are not, and to do what we cannot"
William Hazlitt,We talk little when we do not talk about ourselves.
William Hazlitt,"If the schemes of Utopians could be realized, the tone of society would be changed from what it is, into a sort of insipid high life. There could be no fine tragedies written; nor would there be any pleasure in seeing them. We tend to this conclusion already with the progress of civilization."
William Hazlitt,I do not think there is anything deserving the name of society to be found out of London.
William Hazlitt,"Walk groundly, talk profoundly, drink roundly, sleep soundly"
William Hazlitt,The silence of a friend commonly amounts to treachery. His not daring to say anything in our behalf implies a tacit censure.
William Hazlitt,The most silent people are generally those who think most highly of themselves.
William Hazlitt,Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity and afraid of being overtaken
William Hazlitt,"One truth discovered, one pang of regret at not being able to express it, is better than all the fluency and flippancy in the world."
William Hazlitt,The ballot is only useful as a screen from arbitrary power.
William Hazlitt,"He stood bewildered, not appalled, on that dark shore which separates the ancient and the modern world. . . . He is power, passion, self-will personified."
William Hazlitt,"If a person has no delicacy, he has you in his power."
William Hazlitt,"The poetical impression of any object is that uneasy, exquisite sense of beauty or power that cannot be contained within itself; that is impatient of all limit; that (as flame bends to flame) strives to link itself to some other image of kindred beauty or grandeur; to enshrine itself, as it were, in the highest forms of fancy, and to relieve the aching sense of pleasure by expressing it in the boldest manner."
William Hazlitt,"If mankind had wished for what is right, they might have had it long ago."
William Hazlitt,"An accomplished coquette excites the passions of others, in proportion as she feels none herself"

William Hazlitt,Nothing is more unjust or capricious than public opinion.
William Hazlitt,"The fields his study, nature was his book."
William Hazlitt,The ignorance of the world leaves one at the mercy of its malice
William Hazlitt,"Women have often more of what is called good sense then men. They have fewer pretensions; are less implicated in theories; and judge of objects more from their immediate and involuntary impression on the mind, and, therefore, more truly and naturally."
William Hazlitt,"The thing is plain. All that men really understand, is confined to a very small compass; to their daily affairs and experience; to what they have an opportunity to know, and motives to study or practice. The rest is affectation and imposture."
William Hazlitt,Those who cannot miss an opportunity of saying a good thing . . . are not to be trusted with the management of any great question.
William Hazlitt,"What I mean by living to one's-self is living in the world, as in it, not of it: it is as if no one know there was such a person, and you wished no one to know it: it is to be a silent spectator of the mighty scene of things, not an object of attention or curiosity in it; to take a thoughtful, anxious interest in what is passing in the world, but not to feel the slightest inclination to make or meddle with it."
William Hazlitt,The love of liberty is the love of others; the love of power is the love of ourselves.
William Hazlitt,"Surely, nothing is more simple than Time. His march is straightforward; but we should have leisure allowed us to look back upon the distance we have come, and not be counting his steps every moment."
William Hazlitt,"The more we do, the more we can do; the more busy we are the more leisure we have"
William Hazlitt,"That which any one has been long learning unwillingly, he unlearns with proportional eagerness and haste."
William Hazlitt,"Learning is, in too many cases, but a foil to common sense; a substitute for true knowledge. Books are less often made use of as ''spectacles'' to look at nature with, than as blinds to keep out its strong light and shifting scenery from weak eyes and indolent dispositions. The learned are mere literary drudges."
William Hazlitt,"Learning is the knowledge of that which is not generally known to others, and which we can only derive at second-hand from books or other artificial sources. The knowledge of that which is before us, or about us, which appeals to our experience, passions, and pursuits, to the bosom and businesses of men, is not learning. Learning is the knowledge of that which none but the learned know."
William Hazlitt,"Those are ever the most ready to do justice to others, who feel that the world has done them justice."
William Hazlitt,"In public speaking, we must appeal either to the prejudices of others, or to the love of truth and justice. If we think merely of displaying our own ability, we shall ruin every cause we undertake."
William Hazlitt,A man knows his companion in a long journey and a little inn.
William Hazlitt,"We go a journey chiefly to be free of all impediments and of all inconveniences; to leave ourselves behind, much more to get rid of others. It is because I want a little breathing-space to muse on indifferent matters. . . ."
William Hazlitt,One of the pleasantest things in the world is going on a journey; but I like to go by myself
William Hazlitt,We go on a journey to be free of all impediments; to leave ourselves behind much more than to get rid of others
William Hazlitt,"The soul of a journey is liberty, perfect liberty, to think, feel, do just as one pleases"
William Hazlitt,"There is nothing more likely to drive a man mad, than the being unable to get rid of the idea of the distinction between right and wrong, and an obstinate, constitutional preference of the true to the agreeable."
William Hazlitt,"I like a person who knows his own mind and sticks to it; who sees at once what, in given circumstances, is to be done, and does it."
William Hazlitt,The diffusion of taste is not the same thing as the improvement of taste
William Hazlitt,Taste is nothing but an enlarged capacity for receiving pleasure from works of imagination.
William Hazlitt,"Love at first sight is only realizing an imagination that has always haunted us; or meeting with a face, a figure, or cast of expression in perfection that we have seen and admired in a less degree or in less favorable circumstances a hundred times before."
William Hazlitt,"There are many who talk on from ignorance rather than from knowledge, and who find the former an inexhaustible fund of conversation."
William Hazlitt,Ignorance alone makes monsters or bug-bears; our actual acquaintances are all very common-place people.
William Hazlitt,We are not hypocrites in our sleep
William Hazlitt,He is a hypocrite who professes what he does not believe;  not he who does not practice all he wishes or approves
William Hazlitt,His works (taken together) are almost like a new edition of human nature.
William Hazlitt,"Genius, like humanity, rusts for the want of use"
William Hazlitt,"They are, as it were, train-bearers in the pageant of life, and hold a glass up to humanity, frailer than itself. We see ourselves at second-hand in them: they show us all that we are, all that we wish to be, and all that we dread to be. What brings the resemblance nearer is, that, as they imitate us, we, in our turn, imitate them. There is no class of society whom so many persons regard with affection as actors."
William Hazlitt,"Want of principle is power. Truth and honesty set a limit to our efforts, which impudence and hypocrisy easily overleap."
William Hazlitt,Honesty is one part eloquence. We persuade others by being in earnest ourselves.
William Hazlitt,"The only true retirement is that of the heart; the only true leisure is the repose of the passions. To such persons it makes little difference whether they are young or old; and they die as they have lived, with graceful resignation."
William Hazlitt,Vice is man's nature: virtue is a habit -- or a mask. . . . The foregoing maxim shows the difference between truth and sarcasm.
William Hazlitt,He who comes up to his own idea of greatness must always have had a very low standard of it in mind
William Hazlitt,The public have neither shame nor gratitude
William Hazlitt,"If goodness were only a theory, it were a pity it should be lost to the world. There are a number of things, the idea of which is a clear gain to the mind. Let people, for instance, rail at friendship, genius, freedom, as long as they will --the very names of these despised qualities are better than anything else that could be substituted for them, and embalm even the most envenomed satire against them."
William Hazlitt,"The definition of genius is that it acts unconsciously; and those who have produced immortal works, have done so without knowing how or why. The greatest power operates unseen."
William Hazlitt,"Men of genius do not excel in any profession because they labor in it, but they labor in it because they excel"
William Hazlitt,"There are persons who cannot make friends. Who are they? Those who cannot be friends. It is not the want of understanding or good nature, of entertaining or useful qualities, that you complain of: on the contrary, they have probably many points of attraction; but they have one that neutralizes all these --they care nothing about you, and are neither the better nor worse for what you think of them. They manifest no joy at your approach; and when you leave them, it is with a feeling that they can do just as well without you. This is not sullenness, nor indifference, nor absence of mind; but they are intent solely on their own thoughts, and you are merely one of the subjects they exercise them upon. They live in society as in a solitude."
William Hazlitt,The most violent friendships soonest wear themselves out.
William Hazlitt,"We may, with instruction and opportunity mend our manners, or else alter for the worse, -- as the flesh and fortune shall serve; but the character, the internal, original bias, remains always the same, true to itself to the very last."
William Hazlitt,"There is no force but argument in the case, and it is reason, not the will of another, that gives the law."
William Hazlitt,"It might be argued, that to be a knave is the gift of fortune, but to play the fool to advantage it is necessary to be a learned man"
William Hazlitt,"The dupe of friendship, and the fool of love; have I not reason to hate and to despise myself?  Indeed I do; and chiefly for not having hated and despised the world enough."
William Hazlitt,Spleen can subsist on any kind of food
William Hazlitt,"We are cold to others only when we are dull in ourselves, and have neither thoughts nor feelings to impart to them. Give a man a topic in his head, a throb of pleasure in his heart, and he will be glad to share it with the first person he meets."
William Hazlitt,There are names written in her immortal scroll at which Fame blushes!
William Hazlitt,"The love of fame is almost another name for the love of excellence; or it is the ambition to attain the highest excellence, sanctioned by the highest authority, that of time."
William Hazlitt,"We affect to laugh at the folly of those who put faith in nostrums, but are willing to try ourselves whether there is any truth in them."
William Hazlitt,"General principles are not the less true or important because from their nature they elude immediate observation; they are like the air, which is not the less necessary because we neither see nor feel it."

William Hazlitt,The are of will-making chiefly consists in baffling the importunity of expectation.
William Hazlitt,"No man would, I think, exchange his existence with any other man, however fortunate."
William Hazlitt,"The power rests with the multitude, but let them beware how the exercise of it turns against their own rights! It is not the idol but the worshippers that are to be dreaded, and who, by degrading one of their fellows, render themselves liable to be branded with the same indignities."
William Hazlitt,"A man's look is the work of years; it is stamped on his countenance by the events of his whole life, nay, more by the hand of nature, and it is not to be got rid of easily."
William Hazlitt,"There is a feeling of Eternity in youth, which makes us amends for everything. To be young is to be as one of the Immortal Gods."
William Hazlitt,"There is nothing good to be had in the country, or if there is, they will not let you have it."
William Hazlitt,We never do anything well till we cease to think about the manner of doing it.
William Hazlitt,We are not hypocrites in our sleep.
William Hazlitt,To give a reason for anything is to breed a doubt of it.
William Hazlitt,"Though familiarity may not breed contempt, it takes off the edge of admiration."
William Hazlitt,"The world judge of men by their ability in their profession, and we judge of ourselves by the same test: for it is on that on which our success in life depends."
William Hazlitt,The truly proud man knows neither superiors or inferiors. The first he does not admit of - the last he does not concern himself about.
William Hazlitt,"The soul of a journey is liberty, perfect liberty, to think, feel, do just as one pleases."
William Hazlitt,The smallest pain in our little finger gives us more concern than the destruction of millions of our fellow beings.

William Hazlitt,"Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way across the room."
William Hazlitt,"There are few things in which we deceive ourselves more than in the esteem we profess to entertain for our firends. It is little better than a piece of quackery. The truth is, we think of them as we please, that is, as they please or displease us."
William Hazlitt,The public have neither shame or gratitude.
William Hazlitt,"To be capable of steady friendship or lasting love, are the two greatest proofs, not only of goodness of heart, but of strength of mind."

William Hazlitt,"The dupe of friendship, and the fool of love; have I not reason to hate and to despise myself? Indeed I do; and chiefly for not having hated and despised the world enough."
William Hazlitt,"Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps; for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are, and what they ought to be."

They see their objects always near, and never in the horizon. Hence arises that egotism which has been remarked as the characteristic of self-taught men."
William Hazlitt,"Wit is the rarest quality to be met with among people of education, and the most common among the uneducated."

William Hazlitt,"Gallantry to women - the sure road to their favor - is nothing but the appearance of extreme devotion to all their wants and wishes, a delight in their satisfaction, and a confidence in yourself as being able to contribute toward it"

There are technical things (Camara) can do to get better â€“ relax, take a deep breath before shooting, how he holds the ball, how he releases it â€“ but it's up to him to get in the gym and put up hundreds of them. It's the only way you get better."
Brandon Heath,"Our team did a great job of going after the 50-50 balls. And once we got control of the ball, our team was very unselfish. John Sharper had a look at the basket, but instead he passed up that shot and made an extra pass because I had a better look."

Mitch Hedberg,I think fooseball is a combination of soccer and shishkabobs.

Joseph Heller,"[(CNN) --] Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy, ... Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts -- and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?"
Joseph Heller,"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to."
Joseph Heller,"Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three."
Joseph Heller,"When I read something saying I've not done anything as good as Catch-22 I'm tempted to reply, Who has?"
Joseph Heller,Every writer I know has trouble writing.
Joseph Heller,I had examined myself pretty thoroughly and discovered that I was unfit for military service.
Joseph Heller,"Destiny is a good thing to accept when it's going your way. When it isn't, don't call it destiny; call it injustice, treachery, or simple bad luck."
Joseph Heller,He had decided to live forever or die in the attempt.
Joseph Heller,"We do have a zeal for laughter in most situations, give or take a dentist."
Joseph Heller,"Some people are born mediocre, some people achieve mediocrity, and some people have mediocrity thrust upon them."
Joseph Heller,I don't believe in miracles because it's been a long time since we've had any.
Joseph Heller,Peace on earth would mean the end of civilization as we know it.
Joseph Heller,Rise above principal and do what's right.
Joseph Heller,He knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it.
Joseph Heller,"The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on."
Joseph Heller,"I want to keep my dreams, even bad ones, because without them, I might have nothing all night long."
Joseph Heller,Hungry Joe collected lists of fatal diseases and arranged them in alphabetical order so that he could put his finger without delay on any one he wanted to worry about.
Joseph Heller,He was a self-made man who owed his lack of success to nobody.
Joseph Heller,I think in every country that there is at least one executive who is scared of going crazy.
Joseph Heller,When I grow up I want to be a little boy.
Levon Helm,"You can either make it come around or you can't. By the time we would be ready to record a song, we would know for sure that it was the best way we could do it."
Levon Helm,"With horns and a full rhythm section, the drums always looked like the best seat in the house."
Levon Helm,"When the second record came out, they started calling it The Band. I voted to call it The Crackers. I'm no fool."
Levon Helm,"Well, somebody's got to sing. They won't hire you unless you sing."
Levon Helm,"We're all dealt with the same hand here, so to speak. I feel like I've had it a lot better than most people. I've had the opportunity to travel and play music all my life."
Levon Helm,We all love musical architecture; there's no doubt about that.
Levon Helm,"There were no rules, other than that the song should sound good and be fun to play."
Levon Helm,The way to do it is to put as much life into the song as I can. You can either get it to breathe or you can't.
Levon Helm,"The rock star stuff never came up for us. The Band was never attacked by groupies before, during or after any show that we ever played."
Levon Helm,"The Jungle Bush Beaters didn't last too long as a group, but we had a pretty good time while we did."
Levon Helm,The crowd is just as important as the group. It takes everything to make it work.
Levon Helm,The Band never really played big concert tours. We never sold millions and millions of albums.
Levon Helm,My dad and I played music. He teaches me a song or two every time I'm home.
Levon Helm,"Most of our stuff was trial and error. You live with a tape recorder, you turn it on, you play the song and you listen to it."
Levon Helm,"If you pour some music on whatever's wrong, it'll sure help out."
Levon Helm,"If you give it good concentration, good energy, good heart and good performance, the song will play you."
Levon Helm,"If you feel like you're getting into a rut with a song, a night off usually fixes it."
Levon Helm,"If things are going slow, I'm itchy."
Levon Helm,I've had all the lessons I could get. I've learned from everybody I've ever met.
Levon Helm,"I was in high school, trying to get out of high school. The only thing slowing me up was grades."
Levon Helm,I played some Yamaha drums that I like a lot. And I like the Yamaha people a lot too. They've been really nice to me and The Band.
Levon Helm,I never subscribe to the stay-at-home policy. I'm not sick of the road or sick of eating in good restaurants around the country. I like to travel.
Levon Helm,"I love horns, and the bigger the band, the better it sounds to my ear."
Levon Helm,I like walking on the edge.
Levon Helm,"I like to get within handshaking distance of the crowd. If it happens, they know it, we know it, and that's all we came here for."
Levon Helm,I don't fool with a lot of things that I can't have fun with. There's not much reward in that.
Levon Helm,Good times don't last long sometimes.
Levon Helm,"Forever Young, by Dylan, is one of my favorite songs."
Levon Helm,Drums usually seem to tune themselves.
Levon Helm,Drums just always sounded like the most fun part of that good music for me.
Levon Helm,Don't we all want what's best for each other?
Levon Helm,"Dad and mom would have preferred that I be a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, or a great humanitarian."
Levon Helm,"Conway Twitty was always our local hero while I was growing up. He had a series of good bands. I wanted to sit in, if Conway would let me. And he did a couple of times."
Levon Helm,"Anytime I switch to another instrument, I immediately turn it into another kind of drum so that I can understand it better."
Levon Helm,"A friend of mine took me to Memphis advised me that I should get in the musicians' union. He gave me a set of drums and said, Stay on the job, son."
Levon Helm,"By the time The Band did The Last Waltz, the chemistry had changed, and it wasn't a thrill anymore to live that studio kind of life."
Jesse Helms,"This is a moment of truth for Pakistan as a nation,"
Jesse Helms,"Madam Ambassador, it's been a joy to work with you while you were at the United Nations."
Jesse Helms,"Giving permanent normal trade relations to the government of China will destroy an important lever that we now have and we have had to influence Chinese behavior, ... We are tossing it aside."
Jesse Helms,"It had been my feeling that AIDS was a disease largely spread by reckless and voluntary sexual and drug-abusing behavior, and that it would probably be confined to those in high-risk populations, ... I was wrong."
Jesse Helms,"It's their deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct that is responsible for the disease"
Leona Helmsley,Only little people pay taxes.
Leona Helmsley,Only the little people pay taxes.
Leona Helmsley,We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.
Mike Helton,"Jack Roush has absolutely played by the rules,"
Mike Helton,We believe strongly that the old Southeastern redneck heritage that we had is no longer in existence. But we also realize that there's going to have to be an effort on our part to convince others to understand that.
Mike Helton,"Itâ€™s hard to explain the commitment that this area has to whatever it does, ... Iâ€™m excited for this campaign because I know the entire community is behind it. ... The bottom line is that caring and compassion take money to make things happen."
Mike Helton,"Its hard to explain the commitment that this area has to whatever it does, ... Im excited for this campaign because I know the entire community is behind it. ... The bottom line is that caring and compassion take money to make things happen."
Mike Helton,"This type of behavior cannot be tolerated and is in no way indicative of the manner in which our drivers, teams, tracks and sponsors interact with the media."
Mike Helton,"The gentleman's agreement is just that,"
Todd Helton,"Time will tell but we definitely have the talent, but that doesn't mean nothing. We have to go out and win ball games. There are a lot of good players. The more experience everybody gets the better we are going to be."
Todd Helton,I don't see why not. He was starting to last year and he got hurt.
Todd Helton,"I'd rather make that walk when we won, ... It's kind of hard 2 minutes after the game's over and we lose. It takes a little while to take (a loss) off. It's kind of hard to walk around there with a smile on your face when you just lost, but you got to do it for the fans."
Todd Helton,He doesn't fear anything or anyone when he's out there.
Todd Helton,"I think we've got a chance to be a lot better this year. If everybody just plays to their ability. Nobody really has to go off, nobody has to do anything crazy. There are going to be teams better than us, talent-wise, but we are going to play the game hard and we never give up."
Claude Helvetius,Genius is nothing but continued attention.
Claude Helvetius,Truth is the torch that gleams through the fog without dispelling it.
Claude Helvetius,"There are men whom a happy disposition, a strong desire of glory and esteem, inspire with the same love for justice and virtue which men in general have for riches and honors....But the number of these men is so small that I only mention them in honor of humanity."
Claude Helvetius,"By annihilating the desires, you annihilate the mind. Every man without passions has within him no principle of action, nor motive to act."
Robert Hemenway,"We are closely monitoring the situation, making contact with parents and students affected and offering any and all assistance we can, ... We are grateful so many were able to escape this terrible fire and pray for a swift and complete recovery for those who were injured."
Robert Hemenway,"We have some evidence that people are reacting to the state board's evolution debates, ... People are raising questions whether certain kinds of science can be done successfully in Kansas."
Robert Hemenway,"Let us use the evolution controversy to intensify our efforts to provide a world-class education to our students and to support the faculty who engage in the important research and teaching missions of our schools and universities,"
Ernest Hemingway,I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can.
Ernest Hemingway,Courage is grace under pressure.
Ernest Hemingway,Never confuse movement with action.
Ernest Hemingway,"Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day."
Ernest Hemingway,"The writer must write what he has to say, not speak it."
Ernest Hemingway,"They can't yank a novelist like they can a pitcher. A novelist has to go the full nine, even if it kills him."
Ernest Hemingway,Oak Park is a neighborhood of wide lawns and narrow minds.
Ernest Hemingway,"The rich were dull and they drank too much or they played too much backgammon. They were dull and they were repetitious. He remembered poor Julian and his romantic awe of them and how he had started a story once that began, ''The very rich are different from you and me.'' And how someone had said to Julian, ''Yes, they have more money.''"
Ernest Hemingway,"Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy will be nada in nada as it is in nada. Give us this nada our daily nada and nada us our nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from nada; pues nada. Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee."
Ernest Hemingway,"Never write about a place until you're away from it, because that gives you perspective"
Ernest Hemingway,I've seen a lot of patriots and they all died just like anybody else if it hurt bad enough and once they were dead their patriotism was only good for legends; it was bad for their prose and made them write bad poetry. If you are going to be a great patriot i.e. loyal to any existing order of government (not one who wishes to destroy the existing for something better) you want to be killed early if your life and works won't stink.
Ernest Hemingway,"Only one marriage I regret. I remember after I got that marriage license I went across from the license bureau to a bar for a drink. The bartender said, ''What will you have, sir?'' And I said, ''A glass of hemlock.''"
Ernest Hemingway,"If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a movable feast."
Ernest Hemingway,He was just a coward and that was the worst luck any many could have
Ernest Hemingway,For luck you carried a horse chestnut and a rabbit's foot in your right pocket. The fur had been worn off the rabbit's foot long ago and the bones and the sinews were polished by the wear. The claws scratched in the lining of your pocket and you knew your luck was still there.
Ernest Hemingway,"I am opposed to writing about the private lives of living authors and psychoanalyzing them while they are alive. Criticism is getting all mixed up with a combination of the Junior F.B.I.-men, discards from Freud and Jung and a sort of Columnist peep-"
Ernest Hemingway,All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.
Ernest Hemingway,All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn. American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.
Ernest Hemingway,"How simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well written. It is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go, out to where no one can help him."
Ernest Hemingway,"There are some things which cannot be learned quickly, and time, which is all we have, must be paid heavily for their acquiring. They are the very simplest things and because it takes a man's life to know them the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave."
Ernest Hemingway,Retirement is the ugliest word in the language.
Ernest Hemingway,I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed tight.
Ernest Hemingway,"You write a book like that you're fond of over the years, then you see that happen to it, it's like pissing in your father's beer."
Ernest Hemingway,To me heaven would be a big bull ring with me holding two barrera seats and a trout stream outside that no one else was allowed to fish in and two lovely houses in the town; one where I would have my wife and children and be monogamous and love them truly and well and the other where I would have my nine beautiful mistresses on nine different floors.
Ernest Hemingway,To me heaven would be a big bull ring with me holding two barrera seats and a trout stream outside that no one else was allowed to fish in and two lovely houses in the town; one where I would have my wife and children and be monogamous and love them
Ernest Hemingway,I still need more healthy rest in order to work at my best. My health is the main capital I have and I want to administer it intelligently.
Ernest Hemingway,"The best ammunition against lies is the truth, there is no ammunition against gossip. It is like a fog and the clear wind blows it away and the sun burns it off."
Ernest Hemingway,"There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games."
Ernest Hemingway,"Auto racing, bull fighting, and mountain climbing are the only real sports ... all others are games."
Ernest Hemingway,"You know that fiction, prose rather, is possibly the roughest trade of all in writing. You do not have the reference, the old important reference. You have the sheet of blank paper, the pencil, and the obligation to invent truer than things can be true. You have to take what is not palpable and make it completely palpable and also have it seem normal and so that it can become a part of experience of the person who reads it."
Ernest Hemingway,"It's enough for you to do it once for a few men to remember you. But if you do it year after year, then many people remember you and they tell it to their children, and their children and grandchildren remember and, if it concerns books, they can read them. And if it's good enough, it will last as long as there are human beings."
Ernest Hemingway,"Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use."
Ernest Hemingway,"Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work a"
Ernest Hemingway,I have noticed that doctors who fail in the practice of medicine have a tendency to seek one another's company and aid in consultation. A doctor who cannot take out your appendix properly will recommend you to a doctor who will be unable to remove your tonsils with success.
Ernest Hemingway,Some people show evil as a great racehorse shows breeding. They have the dignity of a hard chancre.
Ernest Hemingway,"Madame, it is an old word and each one takes it new and wears it out himself. It is a word that fills with meaning as a bladder with air and the meaning goes out of it as quickly. It may be punctured as a bladder is punctured and patched and blown up again and if you have not had it does not exist for you. All people talk of it, but those who have had it are marked by it, and I would not wish to speak of it further since of all things it is the most ridiculous to talk of and only fools go through it many times."
Ernest Hemingway,"From things that have happened and from things as they exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, you make something through your invention that is not a representation but a whole new thing truer than anything true and alive, and you make it alive, and if you make it well enough, you give it immortality. That is why you write and for no other reason that you know of. But what about all the reasons that no one knows?"
Ernest Hemingway,"If the book is good, is about something that you know, and is truly written, and reading it over you see that this is so, you can let the boys yip and the noise will have that pleasant sound coyotes make on a very cold night when they are out in the snow and you are in your own cabin that you have built or paid for with your work."
Ernest Hemingway,"I am opposed to writing about the private lives of living authors and psychoanalyzing them while they are alive. Criticism is getting all mixed up with a combination of the Junior F.B.I. -men, discards from Freud and Jung and a sort of Columnist peep-hole and missing laundry list school. Every young English professor sees gold in them dirty sheets now. Imagine what they can do with the soiled sheets of four legal beds by the same writer and you can see why their tongues are slavering."
Ernest Hemingway,"Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over"
Ernest Hemingway,"Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo style of architecture."
Ernest Hemingway,"To be a successful father... there's one absolute rule: when you have a kid, don't look at it for the first two years."
Ernest Hemingway,That is what we are supposed to do when we are at our best - make it all up - but make it up so truly that later it will happen that way.
Ernest Hemingway,Hesitation increases in relation to risk in equal proportion to age.
Ernest Hemingway,"As you get older it is harder to have heroes, but it is sort of necessary."
Ernest Hemingway,All good books have one thing in common - they are truer than if they had really happened.
Ernest Hemingway,"What is moral is what you feel good after, and what is immoral is what you feel bad after."
Ernest Hemingway,"About morals, I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after."
Ernest Hemingway,All our words from loose using have lost their edge.
Ernest Hemingway,Man is not made for defeat.
Ernest Hemingway,Man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
Ernest Hemingway,The world breaks everyone and afterward many are stronger at the broken places.
Ernest Hemingway,"Ezra was right half the time, and when he was wrong, he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it."
Ernest Hemingway,All things truly wicked start from innocence.
Ernest Hemingway,Pound's crazy. All poets are. They have to be. You don't put a poet like Pound in the loony bin.
Ernest Hemingway,"Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture."
Ernest Hemingway,We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.
Ernest Hemingway,"I learned never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it."
Ernest Hemingway,My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.
Ernest Hemingway,The man who has begun to live more seriously within begins to live more simply without.
Ernest Hemingway,There is no rule on how to write. Sometimes it comes easily and perfectly; sometimes it's like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges.
Ernest Hemingway,Every man's life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.
Ernest Hemingway,Why should anybody be interested in some old man who was a failure?
Ernest Hemingway,"When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen."
Ernest Hemingway,The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.
Ernest Hemingway,I know now that there is no one thing that is true - it is all true.
Ernest Hemingway,When you have shot one bird flying you have shot all birds flying. They are all different and they fly in different ways but the sensation is the same and the last one is as good as the first.
Ernest Hemingway,"If a writer knows enough about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water."
Ernest Hemingway,Somebody just back of you while you are fishing is as bad as someone looking over your shoulder while you write a letter to your girl.
Ernest Hemingway,There is no friend as loyal as a book.
Ernest Hemingway,No weapon has ever settled a moral problem. It can impose a solution but it cannot guarantee it to be a just one.
Ernest Hemingway,His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred.
Ernest Hemingway,There are events which are so great that if a writer has participated in them his obligation is to write truly rather than assume the presumption of altering them with invention.
Ernest Hemingway,"When I have an idea, I turn down the flame, as if it were a little alcohol stove, as low as it will go. Then it explodes and that is my idea."
Ernest Hemingway,That terrible mood of depression of whether it's any good or not is what is known as The Artist's Reward.
Ernest Hemingway,I've tried to reduce profanity but I reduced so much profanity when writing the book that I'm afraid not much could come out. Perhaps we will have to consider it simply as a profane book and hope that the next book will be less profane or perhaps more sacred.
Ernest Hemingway,When writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature.
Ernest Hemingway,"You're beautiful, like a May fly."
Ernest Hemingway,There's no one thing that is true. They're all true.
Ernest Hemingway,"I don't like to write like God. It is only because you never do it, though, that the critics think you can't do it."
Ernest Hemingway,A man's got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book.
Ernest Hemingway,"Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination."
Ernest Hemingway,Cowardice... is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend functioning of the imagination.
Ernest Hemingway,If you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons. If you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work.
Ernest Hemingway,The only thing that could spoil a day was people. People were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself.
Ernest Hemingway,The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.
Ernest Hemingway,I never had to choose a subject - my subject rather chose me.
Ernest Hemingway,For a long time now I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can.
Ernest Hemingway,The shortest answer is doing the thing.
Ernest Hemingway,I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.
Ernest Hemingway,"Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over."
Ernest Hemingway,"If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast."
Ernest Hemingway,I like to listen. I have learned a great deal from listening carefully. Most people never listen.
Ernest Hemingway,"The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places."
Ernest Hemingway,A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
Ernest Hemingway,All my life I've looked at words as though I were seeing them for the first time.
Ernest Hemingway,I'm not going to get into the ring with Tolstoy.
Ernest Hemingway,"A serious writer is not to be confounded with a solemn writer. A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl."
Ernest Hemingway,Personal columnists are jackals and no jackal has been known to live on grass once he had learned about meat - no matter who killed the meat for him.
Ernest Hemingway,An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools.
Ernest Hemingway,It's none of their business that you have to learn how to write. Let them think you were born that way.
Ernest Hemingway,You can wipe out your opponents. But if you do it unjustly you become eligible for being wiped out yourself.
Ernest Hemingway,The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.
Ernest Hemingway,But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
Ernest Hemingway,"There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter."
Ernest Hemingway,Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut.
Ernest Hemingway,There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.
Ernest Hemingway,All things truly wicked start from an innocence.
Ernest Hemingway,"I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?"
Ernest Hemingway,Never mistake motion for action.
Ernest Hemingway,"We have come out of the time when obedience, the acceptance of discipline, intelligent courage and resolution were most important, into that more difficult time when it is a person's duty to understand the world rather than simply fight for it"
Ernest Hemingway,Never go on trips with anyone you do not love.
Ernest Hemingway,The game of golf would lose a great deal if croquet mallets and billiard cues were allowed on the putting green.
Ernest Hemingway,Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.
Ernest Hemingway,All our words from loose using have lost their edge
Brian Henderson,"I think as far as the potential of this team, it's pretty good,"
Brian Henderson,"Zach is a nice player and he comes up with big goals. There are very opportune times when we need him. When his wrist shot is on in tight, he can spark the team when we need them."
Brian Henderson,"To solve complex biological problems, scientists must move beyond the confines of their own discipline and explore new organizational models for team science."
Brian Henderson,It was a good game. I thought at no point was anyone in control. It was one of the best defensive efforts we've had for an all-star game.
Brian Henderson,"Their commitment level is very high and their work ethic is very good, ... I like the fact we've got some girls that are physical and really get after it."
Brian Henderson,"If you are going to exercise, there are other good reasons, ... But protection from breast cancer is not one of them."
Brian Henderson,that's where the idea came from that exercise might affect risk for breast cancer.
Joe Henderson,"I'm in constant search of new information and ideas, and I want to make the best of this short time that we're out here on this planet living this nebulous thing called life. And I want to plant a few trees along the way and nurture some minds and watch them grow, as people did for me."
Joe Henderson,Yet the home courses are where you spend dozens to hundreds of hours a year. You must choose them well.
Joe Henderson,Where did you run today? Now there's a question you don't often hear.
Joe Henderson,"When running to fill a time quota, however, the reverse happens. You can't make that time pass any faster by rushing, so you settle into a pace that feels right to you at the moment. Each minute above a quota is a little victory."
Joe Henderson,"When instinct kicks in now, he bolts into high gear and dashes invisible laps for a minute or two before dropping back to my pace."
Joe Henderson,"Time means a great deal to every runner. It means everything to me, because most days miles don't count; only minutes do."
Joe Henderson,This act demonstrates graphically a turning away the past and moving ahead. You now get to refresh your time in a friendly way by running with the watch instead of against it or away from it.
Joe Henderson,"They trained mostly by time periods, checking their pace for known distance only on special occasions."
Joe Henderson,"These thieves defend themselves by saying, 'I was there all the time, and the officials missed me.' Favorite excuses for missing surveillance checkpoints: jacket covered the number took off the shirt with the number hidden in a crowd."
Joe Henderson,The results would have stayed on the watch face until the batteries died. But trying to make time stand still this way would have been a mistake. It is just as important to erase times eventually as to save them at first.
Joe Henderson,"The records fell easily at first. Dozens of seconds peeled away with every running of a course, and I could hardly wait for the next chance to improve."
Joe Henderson,The natural urge when running a distance is to push harder and finish sooner - to race against time. Every second behind a deadline is a little defeat.
Joe Henderson,"The Chip also reduces the damage done by bandits. They still steal drinks and cheers along the course, but no longer scramble the paying runners' results. No entry fee, no Chip, no time or place."
Joe Henderson,That's how most of us would feel. But the sport has a few deviants without consciences.
Joe Henderson,That time is important. It gives a comforting illusion of permanence not found in running by the mile.
Joe Henderson,"Speed eventually neared its peak. The records forced me to work ever harder to drop a less and less time. These time trials came to feel like races, which are fun to run sporadically but not daily."
Joe Henderson,"Since Buzz joined my runs, I too have run more laps - slower and bigger ones than he might otherwise do, but laps just the same."
Joe Henderson,"Ours is a life of constant reruns. We're always circling back to where we'd we started, then starting all over again. Even if we don't run extra laps that day, we surely will come back for more of the same another day soon."
Joe Henderson,Our favorite: a former garbage dump converted into a riverside park. I first ran there more than 30 years ago when a marathon passed through this park that later became home to Pre's Trail.
Joe Henderson,"Our bond is our shared status as retired racers. Before joining my family, he had a brief professional career - on the greyhound track."
Joe Henderson,"In fact, the bandits steal the drinks and assistance provided along the course. Worse, they cross the finish line and mess up the scoring of legitimate runners."
Joe Henderson,"I've lived nearby since 1981 and probably have averaged one run a week there. That's more than 1000 repetitions, and I have yet to tire of this course."
Joe Henderson,"I was joking but he took responded seriously: 'I would know, and I couldn't live with myself knowing that I'd only run 97 miles or whatever.'"
Joe Henderson,"I feared the verdict of the watch, where I either lost the race against time that day or would lose it soon by making the record even harder to break. The time trap had snapped shut."
Joe Henderson,"His name, Buzz, fits. He can buzz along at 40 miles an hour when his genetic memory moves him."
Joe Henderson,"Buzz has reduced my range. Running safely with him means using fewer and shorter routes, with multiple laps per day or multiple returns there per week. Neither of us minds repeating ourselves. This is what runners do."
Joe Henderson,"A course never quite looks the same way twice. The combinations of weather, season, light, feelings and thoughts that you find there are ever-changing."
Joe Henderson,"The hours, minutes and seconds stand as visible reminders that your effort put them all there. Preserve until your next run, when the watch lets you see how Impermanent your efforts are."

I paid Randy's bonus in '04. I paid him six months in '05. She got a BMW. I paid her insurance. ... When you attack my family personally when we've done everything we can, I was very disappointed in Diane and I thought it was uncalled for and inaccurate."
Rick Hendrick,"[Hendrick's son, Ricky, killed in a plane wreck last year, had worked closely with Busch.] Ricky had so much confidence in Kyle and the structure of the two teams, and to see the two cars run like that, and Kyle to win, and become the youngest guy.... ... Kyle has done a super job. He got a lot of criticism early on that he was too young. But I'm just really proud."
Rick Hendrick,"I think that Ricky had so much confidence in Kyle and the structure of the 25 and the 5, and to see the two cars run like that tonight and Kyle to win the race and become the youngest guy, it's incredible,"
Rick Hendrick,"You know, to see both cars run well this year, it's outstanding. It means a lot, because we know the equipment is the same. These guys have done an outstanding job."

Jimi Hendrix,"When I die, I want people to play my music, go wild and freak out and do anything they want to do."
Jimi Hendrix,"Music is a safe type of high. It's more the way it was supposed to be. That's where highness came, I guess, from anyway. It's nothing but rhythm and motion."
Jimi Hendrix,Rock is so much fun. That's what it's all about - filling up the chest cavities and empty kneecaps and elbows.
Jimi Hendrix,Excuse me while I kiss the sky.
Jimi Hendrix,I've been imitated so well I've heard people copy my mistakes.

Justine Henin-Hardenne,I had a lot of trouble with my serve in this tournament.

Don Henley,"Let hope inspire you, but let not idealism blind you. Proverb Don't look back, you can never look back."

Don Henley,"I'm certainly not thrilled with everything the Eagles did, but there are some things I'm quite proud of."
Don Henley,I'm blessed with a pretty good voice. So just sitting back there banging on the tubs wasn't enough.
Don Henley,I'm always jotting things down on pieces of paper. I've got pieces of paper all over my house.
Don Henley,I try to write conversationally; I try to write like people speak and put the emphasis on the right syllable.
Don Henley,I think my first instrument was a ukulele that they gave me. I used to know how to play that pretty well.
Don Henley,I played drums on Keith Carradine's first record.
Don Henley,I have a bad back partially from playing the drums and singing. I used to have to hold my body in such a position that my spine got out of alignment.

Don Henley,I don't care what anybody says about Ringo. I cut my rock-n-roll teeth listening to him.
Don Henley,"I could stand out front and sing Eagles songs that I sing in my set, but I think people enjoy watching me sing and play the drums. It seems to fascinate people. I don't know why."

Don Henley,"Between each album I try to gain a new insight that I didn't have before and perhaps write a song about something that I've written about before, but from a fresh viewpoint."

Don Henley,Sometimes you get the best light from a burning bridge.
Don Henley,Lawsuits should not be used to destroy a viable and independent distribution system. The solution lies in the marketplace and not the courtroom.
Tim Henman,"It was a good one to finally win. I had to be a lot more patient, more selective, when I came forward."
Tim Henman,The best way for me to win the tournament is just to worry about my game.
Tim Henman,But I do like the way I responded from that. I just played another good service game and just felt all round it was a good performance.
Tim Henman,"I think it's a bug of some sort, probably nothing serious. Now I need to rest and make sure I feel fresh for the French Open."
Tim Henman,"Those guys probably have separated themselves (from the rest). Maybe I wouldn't put Federer in the same bracket as the other three, he's had such a superb season."
Tim Henman,"My stomach has responded well to rest over the weekend, although I've still got to be careful over the next few days not to over-do it."
Tim Henman,"It's been a difficult summer for me. I haven't had any results at all. Actually, in terms of the purpose that I've had, it's been much, much better. That's why when I keep doing the right things, I've got no doubts my results will get better."
Tim Henman,I have had so many problems withy my bad back that when I get out there and actually feel healthy I really feel I want to take advantage of it.
Tim Henman,"I've enjoyed getting back on the practice court and I'm really looking forward to heading out to Asia,"
Tim Henman,"I knew that my back wasn't great, but after the practice I had for three-quarters of an hour on Sunday and then a bit longer yesterday, I felt like it was moving in the right direction. But I just think there's always that difference between practice and matches. You know, you've got to go after shots a bit more."
Tim Henman,"At least I know that it's still possible for me to do well even if my time on the practice court needs to be limited,"
Tim Henman,"I haven't been able to practice as much as I would have wanted, but at least I know what the problem is and how to go about treating it,"
Tim Henman,"It was much better today, in terms of the result. I've been playing as well in practice as I have in years and I know that if I just remain patient, then the hard work will pay off."
Tim Henman,I've never been influenced by their opinions anyway but now we are talking tennis and they didn't know anything [on tennis journalists].
Tim Henman,"Wimbledon is certainly getting harder, I can't deny that. With the nature of my opponents and the nature of the surface it's going to be a tough challenge."
Tim Henman,I don't think it had the biggest influence on the match.
Tim Henman,"It certainly hasn't shown in my results yet, but I'm a big believer the hard work you put in will pay off somewhere down the line."
Tim Henman,"When I'm not competing I try and play as much golf as time allows, and my handicap is three."

Tim Henman,"At the Masters Series events, you have to win six matches and you play the very best guys. But once you can beat Roddick and Hewitt, there's no reason why you can't do it. It's another level for Andy but not a massive step."
Tim Henman,There's no doubt it's been a difficult 15 or 16 months and that's been probably dominated more by back problems than my results on the court.
Tim Henman,Everything so far has been a bonus and this is a good way to finish my birthday.
Tim Henman,"I just had to be patient, hold my own serve and make him hit as many balls as possible."
Tim Henman,"I have got enough of my own issues to concentrate on but if he wants my advice, and we have sat down and talked about different things, then absolutely I would be there."
Tim Henman,It's a good sense of achievement. But why stop here? I feel good about my game and I am feeling in good shape. I'm ready to come here on Friday and do it all again.

Matt Hennessy,"This has been telegraphed for a long time, and I think Waterford has been given every opportunity to come into compliance, from the city's perspective."

Matt Hennessy,He has not yet made any decisions about who he's going to be supporting for governor.

Thierry Henry,You learn from your mistakes.

Thierry Henry,"We had to concentrate on the beginning of the season, which was tricky because you don't know if you're going to lose your skipper."
Thierry Henry,"That's the way I've been educated: I always think about what I missed and the things that you did, you did them, so you don't have to think about them any more."
Thierry Henry,"So, all the time you always have to put yourself back to the beginning position and just try to perform when there is the next game around."
Thierry Henry,"So when I go home, sometimes, even when I had an amazing game, I always think about what I missed."
Thierry Henry,"So many people say that obviously my game has changed since I arrived here and I say that it's good that it changed, otherwise it would show a lack of intelligence."

Thierry Henry,"I always think about what I missed, and I think that was my driving force - never be satisfied with what I've done."
Thierry Henry,"But, at the moment, when I step on the pitch, when I have the ball I know it's mine. It's just a feeling."

Thierry Henry,The only thing the Sunderland players wanted to do was kick people. We can play football but some of the tackles in the second half were clearly not for the ball.
Thierry Henry,"We're a good team with good togetherness and you surely saw where my desire is. The way I was playing is the most important thing, not all the time talking about my contract."
Thierry Henry,Of course I thought about leaving. I asked myself a lot of questions at Christmas time.
Thierry Henry,We are bringing through some outstanding youngsters and the character they showed to get us through to the League Cup semi-finals at Doncaster gave us a real lift for the Christmas matches and I think we took that into the matches against Charlton and Portsmouth.

Jim Henson,"You're assisting the audience to understand; you're giving them a bridge or an access. And if you don't give them that, if you keep it more abstract, it's almost more pure. It's a cooler thing."
Jim Henson,"Yeah, well when I first started working, it was $5 a show; it was probably a little higher by the time I got to my own show, but I remember that they put me under contract at $100 a week, which to me was really an astronomical price."
Jim Henson,"Yeah, we pretty much had a form and a shape by that time - a style - and I think one of the advantages of not having any relationship to any other puppeteer was that it gave me a reason to put those together myself for the needs of television."
Jim Henson,"Yeah, I think we did the term Muppets before we got the show Sam and Friends - a few months after I started working."

Jim Henson,"We thought it would be fun to try to design a show that would work well internationally and so that' s what we're intending to do with Fraggle Rock, and we are indeed now selling it around the world."

Jim Henson,The most sophisticated people I know - inside they are all children.
Jim Henson,"Somebody like a Piggy or a Kermit, there needs to be several versions and so there will be several of them."

Jim Henson,"No, there's not much competition between puppeteers in general because everybody's working their own style."
Jim Henson,"NBC was trying to convert all of their local programming to color right away to encourage the sale of the sets, so I barely remember working in black and white, although I do know that I did do it, but there was not a major difference, though."

Jim Henson,It has always been difficult to get Big Bird to be very pretty. Big Bird in England is much more gorgeous.
Jim Henson,"If you're doing a large, complicated character with radio controls, it might take a number of people several months to make it and if you're talking about a quick little hand puppet, it could be made in 2 days, so there's enormous range there, and no real easy generalities."

Jim Henson,"Actually the copies of characters is something I don't particularly like to talk about in articles but just for your information, most characters there's only one."

Audrey Hepburn,"I was born with an enormous need for affection, and a terrible need to give it."

Audrey Hepburn,"It's that wonderful old-fashioned idea that others come first and you come second. This was the whole ethic by which I was brought up. Others matter more than you do, so 'don't fuss, dear; get on with it.'"
Audrey Hepburn,"I don't want to be alone, I want to be left alone."

But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change, you're the one who has got to change. It's as simple as that, isn't it?"
Katharine Hepburn,"Life can be wildly tragic at times, and I've had my share. But whatever happens to you, you have to keep a slightly comic attitude. In the final analysis, you have got not to forget to laugh."

Katharine Hepburn,"Someone asked someone who was about my age: How are you? The answer was, Fine. If you don't ask for details."

Paul Herbert,These sorts of funds have set themselves up to outperform by virtue of the fact that individual picks can really make a difference.
Paul Herbert,"I won't say there isn't a place for those kinds of funds, but I think the price risk, and the fact that they tend to be concentrated in certain sectors, can be something investors overlook when they see really great one-year numbers. People need to understand what they really do and the chances they're taking."

Mark Herring,"I think voters have sent a strong message this past election that they want someone who will go down and work on issues that are priorities for the citizens in the district.

Mark Herring,I feel really good about the momentum and the direction of the campaign.

Werner Herzog,"Strangely enough, I've always believed that my stories were mainstream stories; the films are narrated in a way that you never have a boring moment."
Werner Herzog,"I'm making films for an audience out there and a very tiny fraction of them are would-be filmmakers. But let's speak of them-the would-be filmmakers, the tiny fraction.

Werner Herzog,"Technology has a great advantage in that we are capable of creating dinosaurs and show them on the screen even though they are extinct 65 million years. All of a sudden, we have a fantastic tool that is as good as dreams are."

Whitey Herzog,"Some people asked me if I would be interested in managing the A's. I said a definite no thank you. At night, that place is a graveyard with lights."
Whitey Herzog,We need just two players to be a contender. Just Babe Ruth and Sandy Koufax.
Whitey Herzog,"What counts aren't the number of double plays, but the ones you should have had and missed."

Whitey Herzog,"I'm not buddy-buddy with the players. If they need a buddy, let them buy a dog."

When I was a boy, we were taught to be discrete and respectful of elders, but the present youth are exceedingly wise and impatient of restraint."
Hesiod,Whoever has trusted a woman has trusted deceivers.
Hesiod,"Whoever, fleeing marriage and the sorrows that women cause, does not wish to wed comes to a deadly old age."
Hesiod,Do not let a flattering woman coax and wheedle you and deceive you; she is after your barn.

Hermann Hesse,"For mountain and stream, tree and leaf, root and blossom, every form in nature is echoed in us and originates in the soul whose being is eternity and is hidden from us but none the less gives itself to us for the most part in the power of love and cr"
Hermann Hesse,"The man of power is ruined by power, the man of money by money, the submissive man by subservience, the pleasure seeker by pleasure."
Hermann Hesse,"You treat world history as a mathematician does mathematics, in which nothing but laws and formulas exist, no reality, no good and evil, no time, no yesterday, no tomorrow, nothing but an eternal, shallow, mathematical present."

John Hewitt,"You have to repopulate slowly. To capture a couple of sharks and move them across the country, you have to have holding spaces, isolation and quarantine areas. â€¦ Catching them is the easier part. Getting them from here to there without mortal damage is what gets complicated."

John Hewitt,It was incredibly difficult. It's like burying your children - and that's all I'm going to say about that.
Lleyton Hewitt,I've had a different preparation this year. I did a lot of hard work and training so that I'd last right through the Australian summer.
Lleyton Hewitt,"I'm very happy to get away with the win that I got and be in the locker room after a comfortable win and not waste a lot of energy, ... Physically, I felt great out there."
Lleyton Hewitt,"There didn't seem to be a whole lot of emotion out there. The first two sets, no one had much to cheer about."
Lleyton Hewitt,"He spat in my direction; he apologized at the net after the match, and I accepted his apology. I don't think it's the right thing, and it's not good for the game. It's unfortunate because we were having a good dogfight match out there. We were going for it. It's sad that something like that happens. But I said, 'Just forget about it, mate'."

Lleyton Hewitt,It's nice to be done before midnight. It's more about getting in bed a decent hour.

Lleyton Hewitt,"With my baby due in the next two weeks, it is not possible for me to come. I wish the event well and am sure it will be a great success and I hope to qualify for next year's Masters Cup in Shanghai,"
Paul Hewitt,It's taking awhile to get off the ground. We're still really in the toddler phase; we're still trying to find our legs.
Paul Hewitt,"Talent-wise, I'm convinced we can be competitive. But we've suffered injuries to Lewis and now Mario. It's a long season, and we're getting better."
Paul Hewitt,"I knew it was going to happen because I know his talent level and I know what he's capable of. But when he was in rut he was in, I didn't know if he was going to work his way out of it."
Paul Hewitt,"The talent is definitely stretched a little thinner. In terms of the concentration of top 100, top 200 playersÂ -- it is spread out a little more. You think about going all the way back to Princeton, N.J., where you had the best 200 players in the country. Then, you went to two camps and now we're at three camps. I guess it's not all bad, because now you give more kids an opportunity to be seen. And we tend to lose sight that the game is supposed to be about opportunities for kids to get an education or be seen and do something better with their lives, as opposed to making it sane for college coaches."
Paul Hewitt,I felt like I was watching a school yard game.
Paul Hewitt,"Thaddeus didn't shoot really well the other night, but the good thing about him is that he's not just a scorer. He can do other things, too. We also really liked his transcript. He's a Georgia Tech-type of kid."
Paul Hewitt,"There were mistakes (against Maryland) that we could have controlled. When we executed well, we got some great looks. There were a couple breakdowns and in a one-possession game you have to win every possession."
Paul Hewitt,We're not going to shy away from our goals. Our No. 1 goal is always to get back to the NCAA tournament.
Paul Hewitt,"I think it's an object lesson that paying the cost of Social Security in the future is going to depend upon economic growth. If you don't have growth, our pensions and other obligations are going to become unaffordable."
Paul Hewitt,"The concerns I've had is that defensively we haven't maintained our concentration. We've had some good spurts of playing good basketball, but we have not maintained the intensity, especially on defense. That's where we've really fallen down."
Paul Hewitt,"We talk about the tradition of Georgia Tech basketball when we go out recruiting, and in some sense, I feel like I owe those guys something, ... Now, we've built on that tradition, and now here we are in the Final Four."
Paul Hewitt,"He's a great athlete, and I always remind him that he can make plays off the ball. I don't think he understands how much ground he covers. I think you're starting to see that. He had three steals today. He's starting to see the floor better."
Bill Hicks,"God help me. I'm so tired. I need my sleep. I make no bones about it. I need eight hours a day, and at least ten at night. . . ."
Bill Hicks,"They can't easily say what they want to say in case they're deemed unpatriotic. It's all part of a fear-based hypnosis, so I was worried about how they'd take the track, but I played it when I was on tour in the US and people loved it."
Bill Hicks,"Ultimately, it is in fun. It is supposed to be highly entertaining."
Bill Hicks,"They also have a sense of irony, which America doesn't have seeing as it's being run by fundamentalists who take things literally."
Bill Hicks,"Sometimes you feel in control, and it's great, but sometimes you just don't feel in control and you really have to struggle to get laughs."
Bill Hicks,Music is a great energizer. It's a language everybody knows.
Bill Hicks,"Listen, the next revolution is gonna be a revolution of ideas."
Bill Hicks,I get a kick out of being an outsider constantly. It allows me to be creative.
Bill Hicks,I don't like anything in the mainstream and they don't like me.
Bill Hicks,As long as one person lives in darkness then it seems to be a responsibility to tell other people.
Bill Hicks,"And if I can take part in it by transforming my own consciousness, then someone else's, I'm happy to do it."
Bill Hicks,"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit."
Bill Hicks,We are the facilitators of our own creative evolution.
Bill Hicks,I'm a heavy smoker. I go through two lighters a day.
Bill Hicks,I'm not really a heavy smoker any more. I only get through two lighters a day now.
Bill Hicks,People in the United Kingdom and outside the United States share my bemusement with the United States that America doesn't share with itself.
Bill Hicks,"If you're so pro-life, do me a favour: don't lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're so pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries."
Bill Hicks,It's always funny until someone gets hurt. Then it's just hilarious.
Bill Hicks,Children are smarter than any of us. Know how I know that? I don't know one child with a full time job and children.
Bill Hicks,Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves.
Bill Hicks,Watching television is like taking black spray paint to your third eye.
Bill Hicks,"I don't mean to sound bitter, cold, or cruel, but I am, so that's how it comes out."
Bill Hicks,"Does anyone here work in advertising or marketing? Well if you do, when you get home take a gun shoot yourself. No bullshit, I'm not joking just do it. I'm just sowing seeds, one day they may take root."
Brian Hicks,I think the school should take responsibility for their traffic.
Brian Hicks,"I think that I have an open mind. I try to find what's best for everyone. I'll do the same that I've done these past two years, which is holding down spending and being accountable to the people."
Brian Hicks,Messaging is not just for kids anymore.
Brian Hicks,Institutions are looking to hedge themselves against weakness in the dollar and inflationary threat. Gold can go much higher. It hasn't eclipsed its previous highs.
Brian Hicks,I think it's going to be very close. This is one of these elections that there will not be a breakaway winner. Probably in this state we're in for a Gerald Ford-Jimmy Carter race where it may be one vote a precinct. Ohio's going to determine the next president.
Brian Hicks,"At first glance the output target is disappointing. But given the company has had so much trouble growing in the past, I think they don't want to set the bar too high."
Brian Hicks,"This is the greatest community in the whole county, and I want to keep it that way. We're all neighbors."
Dan Hicks,"At 19 or 20 in Junior College I had a friend who was strumming a guitar and getting into folk, and I wanted to do that too."
Dan Hicks,"My stuff was more of a folk coffeehouse thing, with more acoustic guitar, just me doing a single, and then adding on instruments and voices, with emphasis on lyrics and singing and light kind of acoustic jazz."
Dan Hicks,There's been a big buzz about the Charlatans in the last couple of years. I've heard the word Charlatans more in the last few years than I'd heard it for the previous 20 years. People would interview me for years and never even mention the Charlatans.
Dan Hicks,"And it really is a good feeling to get up there and make that sound. I'm not stuck in a time warp, because I can use as many of the old songs as I want to, just the favorites."
E. Hicks,"He's not going to stop preying on innocent women, ... We're not angry. We're not scorned. We're much better off without him . . . and we don't want him to do this to any other women."
E. Hicks,"If you notice how the requirement for Constitution Day came about, it was a stipulation hidden in another bill. That's part of the Constitution controversy, ... The way the founding fathers crafted the passage of a bill, the president has to accept or reject all of it. That makes it very difficult."
E. Hicks,"The Constitution is very similar to a human skeleton. It is the framework upon which government operates, ... Ever since it was adopted, we have been putting on muscles, skin and limbs. As educators, it's our duty to instill the basic knowledge of American government in our students."
John Hicks,It validates everything that we work for.
John Hicks,This is a fun event.
John Hicks,"There is much of economic theory which is pursued for no better reason than its intellectual attraction; it is a good game. We have no reason to be ashamed of that, since the same would hold for many branches of mathematics."
John Hicks,all for the children.
Guus Hiddink,I'm satisfied with this result against a team with physical and tactical strength.....we have had more worse starts in the Champions League.
Guus Hiddink,"We played tactically very well in the first half, despite all our problems,"
Guus Hiddink,I can see the potential of the team. I can see that there are a lot of good players. They are keen to secure good results. My task is to help them do that.
Guus Hiddink,It is normal that we were knocked out when you look at the potential of the two sides.
Guus Hiddink,I'm an ambitious coach and I want to be successful here in Russia. There is a lot of technical potential within Russia's national team and if the players are aware of their potential I think they can increase their level.
Guus Hiddink,"[He relies] a little bit less on the shouting, more on planning and a schedule. I have found Arnie very good, he is a very open person to what I say. He is serious, he is very keen, intelligent, and knows the players."
Guus Hiddink,I talked with (Liverpool manager) Rafael Benitez a few days ago about him and we were planning to get him in a special program to have him fit as soon as possible. I have my ideas and Benitez has his ideas and we will work on this to get him fit as soon as possible.
Guus Hiddink,"Robert is on his way, but we need more time and patience,"
Guus Hiddink,He has more passion in his right toe than other internationals have in both legs.
Guus Hiddink,"not goodbye, just 'so long'."
Guus Hiddink,"I think the reaction is very nice because it's a reaction of enjoyment, it's not violent...I think there were one or two injuries where people dislocated their shoulders waving flags."
Guus Hiddink,"First, I can understand the emotions just after a game but second I think it's always good to look in the mirror... when you are a big team, you must punish a little team."
Guus Hiddink,Despite all the pressure we only gave away two chances and I have to give my team the compliments for the way they achieved this result.
Guus Hiddink,"At times, they were complaining that we were working too hard. But I think it was worth it."
Guus Hiddink,By the look of things the budget for players has changed too.
Guus Hiddink,We can be proud of the boys -- what they did.
Guus Hiddink,"The problem tonight was finishing off. I'm proud of the boys, the way they played against a team with a budget five times bigger than us. But I always like to get a result. It's not easy to get six chances against Milan in this stadium, which we did."
Guus Hiddink,"We just have to see what damage is done physically, ... but mentally I'm very proud of the boys. I have a long flight to think what we can do tactically. It's in our hands, but I expect Uruguay to come to Sydney to defend - and they are a team which knows how to defend."
Jim Higgins,"They are very far apart on difficult issues like work rules. Delta has a work rule advantage versus other competitors that it doesn't want to give up. And among the pilots, there is a very vocal dissident group, and it makes it more difficult to reach a settlement,"
Jim Higgins,I see it as a lose-lose situation. Integration problems with airline mergers are legendary.
Jim Higgins,"My understanding is that the single greatest gap is on the Delta Express issue. Management is saying we need to enlarge it, and pilots saying we don't want it at all. That's a pretty big gap, so I'd be surprised if they reach an agreement today."
Jim Higgins,"I think there's a risk we're going through a period that profits will get squeezed relative to expectations. If economy slows dramatically, there could be real downside risk to numbers. But having said that, if we have a soft landing (for economic growth) and fuel prices coming down just a bit, then things could actually improve."
Jim Higgins,"Without those concessions, we think approval of the loan is unlikely,"
Jim Higgins,"She showed wisdom way beyond her age and delivered a result for that gentleman that we could only hope to achieve in every situation,"
John Higgins,"It's even more special in London because he has got such a great support, more than anywhere."
John Higgins,It's perfectly reasonable for the captain to be thinking about the safety of his passengers but I honestly thought we were fine.
John Higgins,Being at Miami has definitely helped in my coaching skills. I had the opportunity of a lifetime and tried to learn as much as possible about the game.
John Higgins,"They also failed to save enough money during the good times in the late '90s, when there was plenty of money accumulating in the coffers. Instead of actually sensibly trying to reduce their deficits at that time they simply spent the money,"
John Higgins,My personal feeling is it's a great improvement to that corner.
John Higgins,"If I could enter the final, I hope my opponent would be Ding."
John Higgins,"I won it for my two boys tonight,"
Tom Higgins,Although I'd have trouble envisioning who would rent that. But that's a whole different subject.
Tom Higgins,"The defence had another stellar performance. It was tough sledding out there just to operate the way we do normally. There's a lot of fond memories that come back from the crowd, which I thought was in this football game. It's not an easy place to ever win when you bring a team in to this place. It's humbling to come into this stadium and be on the other side. A lot of teams leave this locker-room dejected because they can't win here."
Tom Higgins,We just do the best that we can. There's a lot of luck involved.
Tom Higgins,but he never let on that he had health problems.
Patricia Highsmith,Perhaps God and the Devil danced hand in hand around every single electron.
Patricia Highsmith,That wasn't a bad price for a first book. My agent upped it as much as possible. I was 27 and had nothing behind me. I was working like a fool to earn a living and pay for my apartment.
Patricia Highsmith,"Robert Walker as Bruno was excellent. He had elegance and humor, and the proper fondness for his mother."
Patricia Highsmith,Ripley is married. And he's not lost. He has his feet on the ground.
Patricia Highsmith,My imagination functions much better when I don't have to speak to people.
Patricia Highsmith,"If people have bought something of mine, they know by now that I will decline writing it for the movies."
Patricia Highsmith,"I was in New York. Hitchcock was in California. He rang me to make a report on his progress and said, I'm having trouble. I've just sacked my second screenwriter."
Patricia Highsmith,"I think J.D. Salinger is correct in granting no interviews, and in making no speeches."
Patricia Highsmith,I prefer to live in the country where it's quiet. Woody Allen movies there are dubbed into Italian.
Patricia Highsmith,"I only know it takes weeks to recover, as if one had been in a car accident."
Patricia Highsmith,I like to work for four or five hours a day. I aim for seven days a week.
Patricia Highsmith,"I hope it will be set in California. In a way, I made a mistake, because a New Jersey policeman can't operate that way in New York. But in California, he can move between different counties."
Patricia Highsmith,I have no television - I hate it.
Patricia Highsmith,"I have Graham Greene's telephone number, but I wouldn't dream of using it. I don't seek out writers because we all want to be alone."
Patricia Highsmith,I don't want to know movie directors. I don't want to be close to them. I don't want to interfere with their work. I don't want them to interfere with mine.
Patricia Highsmith,I don't set the alarm to get up. I get up when I feel like it.
Patricia Highsmith,I didn't hang around films. I don't know if I'd ever seen Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.
Patricia Highsmith,"I can't write if someone else is in the house, not even the cleaning woman."
Patricia Highsmith,"A few years ago, there were requests to me, Can we make this? I said that I have no rights. Contact the Hitchcock estate, which won't release it for a remake."
Patricia Highsmith,I find the public passion for justice quite boring and artificial.
Patricia Highsmith,For neither life nor nature cares if justice is ever done or not.
Austin Hill,"We're giving Internet users total privacy, which they've never had before. We don't even ask you to trust us because even we don't know where you are browsing."
Austin Hill,"You can have separate identities for the separate parts of your life. For example, you can have a health-care identity that you use to discuss your health care problems, and a separate identity that you use to apply for health insurance, which is your true identity. But now, those two identities are separated."
Austin Hill,"Like all freedom, this can be abused or used for good, ... we don't outlaw cars because people sometime have accidents in them."
Brian Hill,"I don't mean to be insensitive, but you worry about the guys you have, not the guys you don't have. I'm concerned about the guys we have returning and the new additions and trying to put the pieces together so we make the best use of their abilities."
Brian Hill,"We have to explore it. Whether it's the D-League or doing something trade-wise, we have to explore everything to try to improve the team."
Brian Hill,"Sometimes big guys just take longer to progress. Not everybody comes in as Shaquille O'Neal and dominates the league right away. Sometimes big guys don't develop until the third, fourth or fifth year. And you certainly don't develop in this league without an opportunity to play."
Brian Hill,The thing that's separating him from years past is his attacking the basket. He's putting the ball on the floor and really looking to get to the basket.
Brian Hill,I'm sure it's discouraging for him. He looked to me that he was having some pain and I didn't want to take any chances. I saw him wincing out there and holding his midsection. It didn't make sense for him to continue. I know he's down.
Brian Hill,"He's not a physical type of player right now. But we just feel, given the opportunity to play and show what he can do, we will try to develop him into the type of player we feel can help our team."
Brian Hill,"This gives us an opportunity to acquire a big player with a high skill level. We only have three healthy big men, so he will immediately add depth to our rotation."
Brian Hill,"When he's getting to the line eight, nine, 10 times a night, that's when he's having a good offensive game."
Brian Hill,"It was like picking our poison. (Tuesday) night, Shaq had his way inside when we tried to guard him with one man. Tonight, we made the decision to double him, and they made their three's."
Brian Hill,"Getting a young big man and a point guard, that doesn't happen very often. So to be able to do that in one-fell swoop and get two players you like is good."
Brian Hill,It's been the strangest thing I've ever seen. Let's hope we can stay with that trend and run off a few wins in a row here.
Brian Hill,He's one of those guys who any night can explode for 40 or 50 or -- you certainly hope not -- 60 points against you. He's so tough because he's constantly attacking and he never really gives your defense a chance to relax. And pound for pound he's probably the toughest guy in the league.
Brian Hill,"We're not going to rule out the playoffs until we're mathematically eliminated. I know the players would hate to hear this, but I'd love to go to training camp with this group of guys right now and start the season all over again."
Brian Hill,It was a learning experience for Dwight.
Brian Hill,We had way too many turnovers in the first half. We gave them 17 points. Our offensive execution to start the third quarter was poor.
Brian Hill,"Home wins are huge, no doubt about it. We got excellent contributions from everybody at some point in the game and I was obviously pleased with our defense at the end. Phoenix is a tough team to defend."
Brian Hill,"I think (Nelson) just settles our team down a little bit, gives them some real good direction out there and he's very difficult to guard in pick and roll situations."
Brian Hill,Everyone is secured from everyone else. There's no danger of any animal taking advantage.
Brian Hill,Everyone is secured from everyone else. There's no danger of any animal taking advantage. We believe we are in good shape.
Brian Hill,"He has been on exhibit since his birth, but we had kind of kept the public at a distance until today, to give mom and baby a little peace and quiet and a little opportunity to get to know each other."
Brian Hill,Obviously with each win our guys are beginning to believe more and more. We want teams to know if they come into our place they are going to have their hands full.
Brian Hill,Steve has played under control and yet at the same time has been aggressive at driving the basketball and creating opportunities. He's really played well lately.
Brian Hill,"He's progressed steadily through the season from the standpoint of running the basketball team, keeping the team organized offensively, making sure that we don't get into a helter-skelter type of game, especially when we're in transition. Obviously he's playing with more confidence with the success he's having, attacking the basket and putting pressure on the defense. He's a very willing passer and always willing to make the extra pass when a teammate is open."
Brian Hill,We didn't execute on our last two offensive possessions down the floor and it cost us the basketball game.
Chris Hill,"Since it's a very small car, I don't have much office space."
Chris Hill,We have to accept that that is what's going on in the world. We've been fortunate enough to compete at a national level. We have a good league we compete in. We don't worry about everyone else.
Chris Hill,"[Rogers is 1-0-1 after a 20-20 tie with Memphis (Tenn.) Ridgeway last Friday night. Its the first tie for a Mountaineer football team since 1983 when Rogers left Forrest City in Week 2 with a 7-7 tie.] Theyre a good football team, ... Theyre very solid on both sides of the ball. Their kicking game has been great, too."
Chris Hill,"Criminals know the best way to get shot is to break in at night. When you go to work, they go to work. It's rare to have a home invasion at night,"
Chris Hill,"We don't know why that's true, but countywide, statewide, even nationally, data shows us that violent crimes tend to increase during July and August,"
Chris Hill,"Look for a typical Seattle Christmas, mild and rainy."
Chris Hill,He is a good guy. He is one of our best friends.
Christopher Hill,"They are asking to be given nuclear technology when they are outside the treaty, which is impossible."
Christopher Hill,"The purpose of these three weeks is to be in touch and be ready, because I would like this to be shorter than 13 days so we can get on to the main event, which is negotiations,"
Christopher Hill,"The purpose of the meeting was to make sure, make absolutely sure, that we understood what their position is and what our position is, ... In that regard, I thought it was a very, very good meeting."
Christopher Hill,There is a strong sense among all six delegations that we really want to make progress.
Christopher Hill,"There is a strong sense among all six delegations that we really want to make progress,"
Christopher Hill,"We don't feel the need to spend 13 full days here, ... I think we can make progress more quickly than that."
Christopher Hill,"I can't say really that there has been progress,"
Christopher Hill,There has been progress in this (so far) and we don't want to have that progress slip away. ... We've been rolling this rock up the hillside and we don't want it to roll all the way back down.
Christopher Hill,"If we're not going to make progress, we're not going to be here,"
Christopher Hill,we didn't make as much progress as we planned.
Christopher Hill,"We'll stay here as long as we feel we're making progress, ... If we're not making progress, we're not going to stay."
Christopher Hill,"We want to make demonstrable progress in the next few weeks,"
Christopher Hill,They (North Korea) introduced some elements that are not in the agreed principles
Christopher Hill,"There're not too many other ways I know how to say 'no' without slipping into another language,"
Christopher Hill,There're not too many other ways I know how to say 'no' without slipping into another language.
Christopher Hill,We discussed some specific ideas about how we could make the process move ahead.
Christopher Hill,"It's hard to be optimistic or pessimistic at this point. It hasn't started,"
Christopher Hill,Only very slowly and late have men come to realize that unless freedom is universal it is only extended privilege.
Christopher Hill,"It has been very obvious to us that they are not so much interested in electricity,"
Christopher Hill,"We all felt duty-bound to continue, because I think there is a feeling that we have taken this further than we ever have in the past,"
Christopher Hill,We welcome President Arroyo's desire to lift the state of emergency as soon as possible.
Christopher Hill,"We're not expecting North Korea to become a Jeffersonian democracy, but we do expect them to sit down and talk to us about these issues, to talk to the international community."
Christopher Hill,"So for every four weeks they delay, they lose 80 million dollars, and you can do the math from here."
Christopher Hill,We think there has been a very good package on the table and we believe the D.P.R.K. needs to look very carefully.
Christopher Hill,Everybody is the winner. This is a win-win situation. We got an agreement on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Christopher Hill,"Everybody is the winner. This is a win-win situation. We got an agreement on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"
Christopher Hill,There is no agreement yet.
Christopher Hill,I think the Chinese draft is an excellent basis for reaching an agreement.
Christopher Hill,"We're not prepared to make a separate agreement for them to freeze programs. We don't want to get into a situation where they stop the programs - in short, freeze the programs, and then expect us to compensate them for a freeze."
Christopher Hill,"It is very clear in the agreement what they need to do,"
Christopher Hill,is to see how we can take an agreement in principle and begin to see how an agreement in principle can be put into practice.
Christopher Hill,"We'd like to see if we can get to an agreement, and we're not there yet. No one is quite ready to say we can't get there."
Christopher Hill,"It wasn't easy, but I think important things don't come easily, and I think it's a very important agreement."
Christopher Hill,Whether this agreement helps solve this will depend in large measure on what we do in the days and weeks that follow.
Christopher Hill,"The Beijing agreement on principle in September I think was a very important agreement, but it needs to be followed up on an agreement on implementation."
Christopher Hill,"So the question is why are they standing aside, losing so much money from only the energy agreement ... they have to answer that question."
Christopher Hill,This is first time they have committed to completely dismantle their weapons in an international agreement. They cannot just stall and pretend it does not exist. I think they have gotten the message.
Christopher Hill,"The problem is not we don't have talks, the problem is we need to have more action. The gap is between five of us and one of them."
David Hill,"If you grant the variance, you may as well throw out the county rules."
David Hill,"This is a total revolution,"
David Hill,"If I'm a newcomer, I am going to be making less money, my job is more vulnerable, so those concerns are somewhat expected."
David Hill,We've got most of the tagging information. But we're missing some of the resolution information from various periods. We know where those areas are and people are helping us by filling in the blanks.
David Hill,It's really cute and really terrific.
David Hill,He is a very clever and subtle negotiator.
David Hill,"The Catalogue of Ships in the second book of Homer's Iliad names the places in Greece that committed ships and troops to the siege of Troy,"
David Hill,"We are excited about what this means for our professional team. This allows our highly experienced consultants the ability to continue to grow professionally while maximizing their skills in an exciting, progressive environment. Our clients will benefit from an even higher level of professional service."
David Hill,He is a very clever and subtle negotiator. What makes him so great is his ability to see a situation from different points of view.
David Hill,We did well. We stuck with our ability to take people off the course at 51/2 hours. We gave people the option of getting on the bus and coming in or continuing on the course.
Jerry Hill,"It's a very difficult thing to believe is going on, ... I believe they're as safe in the school with a lockdown, certainly safer than they would be out in the community right now."
Jerry Hill,"I came to San Antonio for one purpose, and that was to work at a golf course and to run a golf course. And that's what happened."
Jerry Hill,It reaffirmed my faith in government. The dollar isn't king. They looked at it and analyzed it and took the high moral road.
Jerry Hill,These indictments which target me personally are puzzling since I work for the School Board and followed their direction during the development and distribution of the flier. I look forward to a quick and fair resolution of this matter so the important work being done in this school division can continue uninterrupted.
John Hill,"From the point of view of security, I can encrypt an RFID tag. I can ensure that the tag has not been tampered with. But the tag itself is not going to do a lot to prevent a guy from penetrating the container."
John Hill,You need to back up the landowner when he wants best management practices enforced.
John Hill,"Gold prices have been resurgent, following oil, inflation data, and fretting over global economic imbalances."
John Hill,"Looking ahead, we continue to be positive on gold, seeing multiple hand-offs between fabrication and investment demand, and between commodity fundamentals and macro/monetary catalysts."
John Hill,"We would be buyers of gold and select gold equities at current levels,"
John Hill,"Gold should be well-positioned if the U.S. economy slows sharply, given debt and dual-deficit strains that would likely emerge,"
Lauryn Hill,"The only wealth I have to give, is not material - and if you need much more than that, I'm not available"
Lauryn Hill,"Wow, this is so amazing. I thank God. This is crazy because this is hip-hop music."
Lauryn Hill,It's funny - more people talk about my 'babe-dom' now than they did before I had a child. Whatever. I guess I'm a role model in hot pants now. That's cool!
Lauryn Hill,You don't know how much artists go through to make it look so easy. It's all in the practice.
Lauryn Hill,"What was freely given to me, I freely give."
Lauryn Hill,"We don't want people to have expectations of us, but then we have expectations of everybody else."
Lauryn Hill,We call ourselves creators and we just copy.
Lauryn Hill,This life is a process of learning.
Lauryn Hill,"The less I have, the freer I am to do whatever I want to do."
Lauryn Hill,"That strong mother doesn't tell her cub, Son, stay weak so the wolves can get you. She says, Toughen up, this is reality we are living in."
Lauryn Hill,Reality is easy. It's deception that's the hard work.
Lauryn Hill,Nobody's going to force me to do something against my will. What do I owe anybody that I should submit my will to them?
Lauryn Hill,I wouldn't even hold my kids sometimes because I didn't want them to spit up on me when I was dressed for an awards show.
Lauryn Hill,"I tried to manipulate and control people, and I harbored resentment. I wanted to be forgiven, but I wouldn't forgive others."
Lauryn Hill,I never did anything I'm really ashamed of.
Lauryn Hill,I need to be surrounded by people as passionate and as dedicated as I am.
Lauryn Hill,I got into direct confrontation with everybody I love.
Lauryn Hill,"I don't need anybody to market or promote me. If people don't want to hear this music, then it's not for them. You cannot please everybody."
Lauryn Hill,I don't know anybody that's not emotionally unstable or schizophrenic.
Lauryn Hill,I believe God will make a way.
Lauryn Hill,"Hip-Hop isn't just music, it is also a spiritual movement of the blacks! You can't just call Hip-Hop a trend!"
Lauryn Hill,"From the first time someone says, Who do you think you are? we learn how to repress."
Lauryn Hill,Everything we do should be a result of our gratitude for what God has done for us.
Lauryn Hill,"Be honest, brutally honest. That is what's going to maintain relationships."
Lauryn Hill,We can't plan life. All we can do is be available for it.
Linda Hill,It's always nice to be acknowledged for the work that we do.
Linda Hill,Our kids have to work doubly hard to compete with schools that require their students to take debate as a class.
Linda Hill,"We have several new shooters, several getting back into it and a couple who've taken the (safety) class."
Linda Hill,"If you get promoted, you have a lot of anxiety because you don't want people to know you're a promotion mistake."
Napoleon Hill,"Edison failed 10, 000 times before he made the electric light. Do not be discouraged if you fail a few times."
Napoleon Hill,"Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything."

Napoleon Hill,You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself
Napoleon Hill,No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility.

Napoleon Hill,There would be no advantage to be gained by sowing a field of wheat if the harvest did not return more than was sown.

It can keep you from procrastinating when an unpleasant duty faces you. But it can also help you do those things that you want to do.

Napoleon Hill,Don't wait. The time will never be just right.
Napoleon Hill,You must get involved to have an impact. No one is impressed with the won-lost record of the referee.
Napoleon Hill,"All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination, Imagination is the workshop of your mind, capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth."

Pat Hill,They've got more horses than we've got.

Kirk Hinrich,"I've got a few bumps and bruises, but I'm confident that with treatment and a little bit of rest, I'll be able to go. It's one of those things where when you get warmed up and get some treatment, you can go. I just hope I don't get hit there again."
Kirk Hinrich,I've got enough problems. I'm not worried about what's going through his head.
Kirk Hinrich,I've got enough problems; I'm not worried about what's going through his head. I just think it's just been really good team defense; our weak-side defense has been great since we played them.
Kirk Hinrich,It was a tough it out game.
Kirk Hinrich,"It's nice, but it doesn't feel like it's ours yet. We're still fighting for it, and there's still so much up for grabs. We've got a big one again Saturday, and we have to get ready for that."
Kirk Hinrich,"(For) a lot of guys, last year was their first time in the playoffs. I'm glad to have that experience, and hopefully, I can capitalize on it."
Kirk Hinrich,"I expect a huge leap. They both had such good years last year, and you know from experience how much easier your second year is from your rookie year. We expect big improvements."
Kirk Hinrich,We just can't dig holes for ourselves like that. We spend all our energy trying to get back in the game. We've got to stay in the game. We're not playing a full game -- we're just playing in stretches right now.
Kirk Hinrich,We all had an off night. They came out and pretty much took control of the game from the start. We never really made it much of a game tonight.
Kirk Hinrich,"The biggest thing with him is his speed and his ability to shoot the three. He's a good passer, and in transition he's been giving us problems. We've had to get everybody below the ball and stop him in transition. Maybe it was just one of those [games] for him."
Barry Hinson,"I think the conference race is already done. I think Wichita State is going to win the race. I think what everybody else is trying to do is to get the highest seed they can get for the tournament, or finish as the runner-up."
Barry Hinson,"I don't think there's any question the league has the potential to be better. I anticipate it being better, but at the same time that also puts a lot of pressure to say the Valley is going to have six teams in the top (45) of the RPI and competing for an NCAA berth. That's a lot of pressure."
Barry Hinson,"They average (27) 3-point attempts a game and, to put that in perspective, that's 10 more than we average."
Barry Hinson,And I would expect them to play much better than they did the other night.
Barry Hinson,"I think our body of work is deserving. I believe in the selection committee and I believe they'll make the right choices. If we're in, it's the right thing. If we're not, it's the right thing and you won't hear me moaning and groaning."
Barry Hinson,"We are probably a mid-major conference in most of our other sports, but in men's basketball we are obviously a high-major conference. It's the sixth best conference in the country, and there should be talk of five teams going into the NCAA Tournament. Whether we get that or not, we deserve the attention."
Barry Hinson,Defensively we turned it up a notch. We forced 21 turnovers against a good basketball team and that's pretty good.
Barry Hinson,"No messages. We just played good basketball (against Stanford). Coaches that run their mouths, that all comes back to haunt them."
Barry Hinson,"We have a student body that is fired up about Bears basketball. It's a whole different level, the best our students have been since I've been here. This is a big game."

Alfred Hitchcock,Television is like the invention of indoor plumbing. It didn't change people's habits. It just kept them inside the house.

Ken Hitchcock,"Look, it's not pretty. It's about getting points right now. We talked about fighting to the end and we fought to the end and got two points."
Ken Hitchcock,"I don't think that stuff is relevant because some of [them] were overtime losses. I worry about the response after a win. My major focus is, how do we respond after a big game? We have had lots of big wins but we have not always responded well."
Ken Hitchcock,We?re going to have to make some adjustments. We honestly don?t know how this is going to work for us until we play some exhibition games.
Ken Hitchcock,"If you can't get ready for the best team in the league, you're in trouble. They've taken on all comers this year and they've really eaten up some teams. I don't know whether it's the fear of getting embarrassed, but we've got a lot of competitive guys and we love to play in these type of games."
Ken Hitchcock,"He, (Wayne) Gretzky and Gordie (Howe), for me, personally, are the guys. Special player, special person, special talent."
Ken Hitchcock,"We're locked in now. Hopefully we can make this interesting. Sometimes we struggle to get emotionally connected, but we're locked in now."
Ken Hitchcock,"It's still not good enough. We know the rules and we took two penalties in the third period that we can't take, not when the game is on the line. You're just dealing with an unbelievable level of fire when you're giving a team like that six, seven or eight penalties."
Ken Hitchcock,"I think we were overwhelmed the first 10 minutes. That's my responsibility. We were embarrassed, embarrassed by the way we performed and embarrassed by the way we finished the hockey game."
Ken Hitchcock,"He was happier on that side and as a result, he was exceptional in practice (Wednesday). He likes the left a lot more because he thinks it helps his confidence and speed."

Ken Hitchcock,Management misses an opportunity to build a team greatly.
Ken Hitchcock,"Their tenacity, speed and hunger controlled the game."
Ken Hitchcock,"Those are usually a reward for hard work. Good players score those goals. Guys like you and me, the puck would end up in the seats."
Ken Hitchcock,We had a lot of things that we did very well tonight. But to give up the two goals (in the third period) was really disappointing.
Ken Hitchcock,"We knew they were going to play games for us, but to switch locker rooms before we even played a game, we never even thought about that stuff. We had our 23 guys and we thought that was it, then bang, bang things change dramatically."
Ken Hitchcock,"It's just bad luck. We feel like we might as well get it done now. If we wait 25 games and he's sore, he won't get a chance to play (healthy) down the line."
Ken Hitchcock,"As the game wore on, we were out-competed,"
Ken Hitchcock,"There almost becomes a fear factor. Nobody is used to what you can do and can't do. If you take one or two, then you don't want to do anything. Then you end up doing nothing."
Ken Hitchcock,"It seemed like every mistake we made went in our net. We deserved a better fate. We had a ton of things go right. We out-shot them. We out-chanced them. We outplayed them, but they're an opportunistic team and they took advantage of the mistakes we made. That's what good teams do."
Ken Hitchcock,We're disappointed. We played a great game. We deserved a better fate. It's the best game we've played in a month.
Ken Hitchcock,"We were tentative, but once we got angry, we got some emotion and we were ready to go."
Ken Hitchcock,I guess I need to apologize. I know better than that. I kind of lost discipline the way our team did in the game.
Ken Hitchcock,"Their determination defensively was a little better than ours was offensively. Overall, they were all committed physically. We were one chance and out."
Ken Hitchcock,"We look at that as a compliment, first of all,"
Ken Hitchcock,That second period felt like the longest period I've ever been through as a coach. The first question was whether we could skate with them. We can. They've got speed and so do we.
Ken Hitchcock,They pushed the level out there. It's not about whether we can keep up. We don't have a choice.
Ken Hitchcock,There are too many games now where there's too much structure and not enough of the chaos.
Ken Hitchcock,"This is a huge deal for the players. For once in their lives, they get to feel like an athlete, not an entertainment machine. They live with everyone else from different sports. They get to represent their countries, which is the biggest thing for these players. From the experiences of '98 and '02, this is a big thing."
Ken Hitchcock,"You were taught at an early age that you don't just fall down as soon as someone puts a stick on you,"
Ken Hitchcock,We've had to overcome adversity the whole season.
Ken Hitchcock,We feel confident in his ability. He has the speed to get up on the attack.
Christopher Hitchens,I have personal knowledge that Mr. Blumenthal recounted to other people in the journalistic community the same story about Monica Lewinsky that he told to me and Carol Blue.
Christopher Hitchens,Ronald Reagan used to alarm his Soviet counterparts by saying that surely they'd both unite against an invasion from Mars.
Christopher Hitchens,Ronald Reagan said that he sought a Star Wars defense only in order to share the technology with the tyrants of the U.S.S.R.
Christopher Hitchens,"One of the many problems with the American left has been its image as something rather too solemn, mirthless, herbivorous, dull, monochrome, righteous, and boring."
Christopher Hitchens,Nothing could make me forget what the Reagan years had actually been like.
Peter Hitchens,[Earnings of] $2.1 billion were not enough to support BP's share price. Shell looks the better bet.
Peter Hitchens,"[Earnings of] $2.1 billion were not enough to support BP's share price, ... Shell looks the better bet."
Peter Hitchens,"This is a good deal, BP had a hole in its lubricants portfolio and need a quality lubricant following the Mobil venture's breakup,"
Peter Hitchens,"This is a good deal, BP had a hole in its lubricants portfolio and need a quality lubricant following the Mobil venture's breakup."
Peter Hitchens,"The compromise could be 700,000 barrels but the actual production increase could be around 400,000. At 1 million extra barrels prices may be drawn lower but at 500,000 prices could hit $40."
Peter Hitchens,"There was huge pressure on Elf to come to an agreement, ... The French government didn't want a messy situation, and Elf's (counter-)bid was not accepted as credible by the market."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"Subdue fate by exerting human strength to the maximum; and if, when the effort has been made and success is not achieved, no one else can be blamed."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"When the leader passes over all alike, not making a distinction, then the endeavors of those who are capable of exertion are entirely lost."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,She is a wife who is the soul of her husband.
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,That one is learned who has reduced his learning to practice.
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,Learning is a livelihood.
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"Amongst all things, knowledge is truly the best thing: from its not being liable ever to be stolen, from it not being purchasable, and from its being imperishable."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,Greatness does not approach him who is forever looking down.
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"No wise person should make known the loss of fortune, any malpractice in their house, his being cheated, or having been disgraced."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"A store of grain, Oh king is the best of treasures. A gem put in your mouth will not support life."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"The mind is lowered through association with inferiors. With equals it attains equality; and with superiors, superiority."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,One should not lift the rod against our enemies upon the private information of another.
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"The people of the world having once been deceived, suspect deceit in truth itself."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"In time of danger it is proper to be alarmed until danger be near at hand; but when we perceive that danger is near, we should oppose it as if we were not afraid."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"No man should ever display his bravery unless he is prepared for battle, nor bear the marks of defiance, until he has experienced the abilities of his enemy."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"Youth, abundant wealth, high birth, and inexperience, are, each of them a source of ruin. What then must be the fate of those in whom all four are combined."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"What ever is the natural propensity of a person is hard to overcome. If a dog were made a king, he would still gnaw at his shoes laces."
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,Is anyone simply by birth to be applauded or punished?
Hitopadesa Hitopadesa,"When a husband is embraced without affection, there must be some reason for it."
Alexander Hleb,"I have to admit there are some problems within the team, ... I don't want to go into details, but I will put it like this: good results may come only if there's a unity between players and coach. I can't say that this unity exists in the Belarus team at the moment."
Alexander Hleb,"I have to admit there are some problems within the team. I don't want to go into details, but I will put it like this: good results may come only if there's a unity between players and coach. I can't say that this unity exists in the Belarus team at the moment."
Alexander Hleb,"I am very happy at Arsenal. I love playing Premier League football, this is an exciting opportunity for me and I am determined to do well here."
Calvin Hobbes,Maybe then I can finish my book.
Calvin Hobbes,I wonder if I can grow fangs when my baby teeth fall out.
Calvin Hobbes,Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of body experience.
Calvin Hobbes,Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.
Dee Hock,"The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get old ones out. Every mind is a building filled with archaic furniture. Clean out a corner of your mind and creativity will instantly fill it."
Dee Hock,"With the capacity to communicate, immediately came the evolution of complex communities of organisms: hives, flocks, tribes, herds, whatever."
Dee Hock,With the advent of genetic engineering the time required for the evolution of new species may literally collapse.
Dee Hock,"What will become compellingly important is absolute clarity of shared purpose and set of principles of conduct sort of institutional genetic code that every member of the organization understands in a common way, and with deep conviction."
Dee Hock,"Today, everything is accelerating change, with one incredibly important exception. There has been no loss of institutional float."
Dee Hock,"Throughout history, it took centuries for the habits of one culture to materially affect another. Now, that which becomes popular in one country can sweep through others within months."
Dee Hock,Think about technological float: it took centuries for the wheel to gain universal acceptance. Now any microchip device can be in use around the world in weeks.
Dee Hock,"The prudent course is to make an investment in learning, testing and understanding, determine how the new concepts compare to how you now operate and thoughtfully determine how they apply to what you want to achieve in the future."
Dee Hock,"The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get old ones out."
Dee Hock,"The closest thing to a law of nature in business is that form has an affinity for expense, while substance has an affinity for income."
Dee Hock,Success follows those adept at preserving the substance of the past by clothing it in the forms of the future.
Dee Hock,"Substance is enduring, form is ephemeral."
Dee Hock,Preserve substance; modify form; know the difference.
Dee Hock,"Money motivates neither the best people, nor the best in people. It can move the body and influence the mind, but it cannot touch the heart or move the spirit; that is reserved for belief, principle, and morality."
Dee Hock,"Make another list of things done for you that you loved. Do them for others, always."
Dee Hock,"Make an empty space in any corner of your mind, and creativity will instantly fill it."
Dee Hock,"Make a careful list of all things done to you that you abhorred. Don't do them to others, ever."
Dee Hock,"Lead yourself, lead your superiors, lead your peers, and free your people to do the same. All else is trivia."
Dee Hock,Language was a huge expansion of that capacity to deal with information.
Dee Hock,"It won't do away with hierarchy totally, but the principal leader will be the person who most exemplifies the kind of organization and behavior required who is best able to create the conditions such organizations require."
Dee Hock,"It is essential to employ, trust, and reward those whose perspective, ability, and judgment are radically different from yours. It is also rare, for it requires uncommon humility, tolerance, and wisdom."
Dee Hock,"If you're in such a position of power and your ego is such that this is not possible, then its essential to have a small cadre of very bright, committed people who are questioning, exploring and understanding these emerging concepts."
Dee Hock,"If you look to lead, invest at least 40% of your time managing yourself - your ethics, character, principles, purpose, motivation, and conduct. Invest at least 30% managing those with authority over you, and 15% managing your peers."
Dee Hock,"If you go back to the first single-cell form of life, it clearly possessed the capacity to receive, to utilize, to store, to transform, and to transmit information."
Dee Hock,Experience is easy to provide and quickly put to good use by people with all the other qualities.
Dee Hock,Every mind is a room packed with archaic furniture.
Dee Hock,"As I like to say, the entire collective memory of the species - that means all known and recorded information - is going to be just a few keystrokes away in a matter of years."
Dee Hock,"An organization, no matter how well designed, is only as good as the people who live and work in it."
Dee Hock,"An illustration I use to get people to understand it is this: I'll ask major corporate audiences: Why don't you just take all your traditional beliefs about organizations, and apply them to the neurons in your brain?"
Dee Hock,Clean out a corner of your mind and creativity will instantly fill it.
Dee Hock,"If you don't understand that you work for your mislabeled 'subordinates,' then you know nothing of leadership. You know only tyranny."
David Hockney,"If we are to change our world view, images have to change. The artist now has a very important job to do. He's not a little peripheral figure entertaining rich people, he's really needed."
David Hockney,Someone has to speak up. It's a serious subject because really the subject is liberty.
David Hockney,"A belief is like a guillotine, just as heavy, just as light."
David Hockney,"It is very good advice to believe only what an artist does, rather than what he says about his work."
David Hockney,"The moment you cheat for the sake of beauty, you know you're an artist."
Julius Hodge,"He's been telling me to make sure that if you practice at 11 o'clock and (Karl) wants you to be there at 10, you show up at 8:45,"
Julius Hodge,"Oh man, no one believed it could happen, ... It feels so much better, because no one believed."
Julius Hodge,"I hope we're in the tournament now. That was a great win against a possible No. 1 seed. And we didn't just win -- for the most part in the second half, we were dominating the game."
Julius Hodge,"It'll be a great honor just to look in the rafters and see the David Thompsons and Tommy Burlesons, and then be able to see my jersey. I think it's a great thing."
Julius Hodge,I just felt jubilation. I thought all the hard work I put in for four years paid off. I'm going to try to do the same thing I did in college at the next level.
Julius Hodge,"All Coach Karl does is talk about UNC, ... And I can't say nothing about it."
Julius Hodge,"I'm going to have to be as patient as I've ever been in basketball, ... I'm going to have to continue to work hard every day and when I get my opportunity, I have to make the best of it."
Eric Hoffer,We do not really feel grateful toward those who make our dreams come true; they ruin our dreams.
Eric Hoffer,The wisdom of others remains dull till it is writ over with our own blood. We are essentially apart from the world; it bursts into our consciousness only when it sinks its teeth and nails into us.
Eric Hoffer,"When we believe ourselves in possession of the only truth, we are likely to be indifferent to common everyday truths."
Eric Hoffer,Add a few drops of venom to a half truth and you have an absolute truth
Eric Hoffer,It is a talent of the weak to persuade themselves that they suffer for something when they suffer from something; that they are showing the way when they are running away; that they see the light when they feel the heat; that they are chosen when they are shunned.
Eric Hoffer,Youth itself is a talent / a perishable talent.
Eric Hoffer,"To the intellectual, America's unforgivable sin is that it has revolutions without revolutionaries, and achieves the momentous in a matter-of-fact way"
Eric Hoffer,"The short-lived self, teetering on the edge of extinction, is the only thing that can ever really matter"
Eric Hoffer,A successful social technique consists perhaps in finding unobjectionable means for individual self-assertion.
Eric Hoffer,The remarkable thing is that we really love our neighbor as ourselves: we do unto others as we do unto ourselves. We hate others when we hate ourselves. We are tolerant toward others when we tolerate ourselves. We forgive others when we forgive ourselves. We are prone to sacrifice others when we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.
Eric Hoffer,"The main effect of a real revolution is perhaps that it sweeps away those who do not know how to wish, and brings to the front men with insatiable appetites for action, power and all that the world has to offer."
Eric Hoffer,We need not only a purpose in life to give meaning to our existence but also something to give meaning to our suffering. We need as much something to suffer for as something to live for.
Eric Hoffer,"Nationalist pride, like other variants of pride, can be a substitute for self-respect."
Eric Hoffer,It is also plausible that those movements with the greatest inner contradiction between profession and practice-that is to say with a strong feeling of guilt-are likely to be the most fervent in imposing their faith on others
Eric Hoffer,"The real persuaders are our appetites, our fears and above all our vanity. The skillful propagandist stirs and coaches these internal persuaders."
Eric Hoffer,"Nature is a self-made machine, more perfectly automated than any automated machine. To create something in the image of nature is to create a machine, and it was by learning the inner working of nature that man became a builder of machines."
Eric Hoffer,It is part of the formidableness of a genuine mass movement that the self-sacrifice it promotes includes also a sacrifice of some of the moral sense which cramps and restrains our nature.
Eric Hoffer,A soul that is reluctant to share does not as a rule have much of its own. Miserliness is here a symptom of meagerness.
Eric Hoffer,A great man's greatest good luck is to die at the right time.
Eric Hoffer,Wise living consists perhaps less in acquiring good habits than in acquiring as few habits as possible
Eric Hoffer,There would be no society if living together depended upon understanding each other.
Eric Hoffer,We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves.
Eric Hoffer,Charlatanism of some degree is indispensable to effective leadership.
Eric Hoffer,We are least open to precise knowledge concerning the things we are most vehement about.
Eric Hoffer,Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind.
Eric Hoffer,"We find it hard to apply the knowledge of ourselves to our judgment of others. The fact that we are never of one kind, that we never love without reservations and never hate with all our being cannot prevent us from seeing others as wholly black or white."
Eric Hoffer,"The intellectuals and the young, booted and spurred, feel themselves born to ride us"
Eric Hoffer,It would be difficult to exaggerate the degree to which we are influenced by those we influence.
Eric Hoffer,"It is the individual only who is timeless. Societies, cultures, and civilizations --past and present --are often incomprehensible to outsiders, but the individual's hungers, anxieties, dreams, and preoccupations have remained unchanged through the millennia."
Eric Hoffer,Naivete in grownups is often charming; but when coupled with vanity it is indistinguishable from stupidity.
Eric Hoffer,Far more crucial than what we know or do not know is what we do not want to know.
Eric Hoffer,Glory is largely a theatrical concept. There is no striving for glory without a vivid awareness of an audience.
Eric Hoffer,"However much we guard ourselves against it, we tend to shape ourselves in the image others have of us. It is not so much the example of others we imitate, as the reflection of ourselves in their eyes and the echo of ourselves in their words."
Eric Hoffer,"Friendship Never explain -- your friends do not need it, and your enemies will not believe it anyway. A real friend never gets in your way, unless you happen to be on the way down. A friend is someone you can do nothing with and enjoy it. However much we guard ourselves against it, we tend to shape ourselves in the image others have of us. It is not so much the example of others we imitate, as the reflection of ourselves in their eyes and the echo of ourselves in their words."
Eric Hoffer,The basic test of freedom is perhaps less in what we are free to do than in what we are free not to do.
Eric Hoffer,"Fear comes from uncertainty. When we are absolutely certain, whether of our worth or worthlessness, we are almost impervious to fear. Thus a feeling of utter unworthiness can be a source of courage."
Eric Hoffer,The passion to get ahead is sometimes born of the fear lest we be left behind
Eric Hoffer,Absolute faith corrupts as absolutely as absolute power.
Eric Hoffer,With some people solitariness is an escape not from others but from themselves. For they see in the eyes of others only a reflection of themselves.
Eric Hoffer,The individual who has to justify his existence by his own efforts is in eternal bondage to himself.
Eric Hoffer,It is not so much the example of others we imitate as the reflection of ourselves in their eyes and the echo of ourselves in their words
Eric Hoffer,The pre-human creature from which man evolved was unlike any other living thing in its malicious viciousness toward its own kind. Humanization was not a leap forward but a groping toward survival.
Eric Hoffer,You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.
Eric Hoffer,"The central task of education is to implant a will and facility for learning; it should produce not learned but learning people. The truly human society is a learning society, where grandparents, parents, and children are students together."
Eric Hoffer,We do not really feel grateful toward those who make our dreams come true; they ruin our dreams
Eric Hoffer,Every intense desire is perhaps a desire to be different from what we are.
Eric Hoffer,"It sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities, but its own talents."
Eric Hoffer,Creativity is discontent translated into arts
Eric Hoffer,Nonconformists travel as a rule in bunches. You rarely find a nonconformist who goes it alone. And woe to him inside a nonconformist clique who does not conform with nonconformity.
Eric Hoffer,"The only index by which to judge a government or a way of life is by the quality of the people it acts upon. No matter how noble the objectives of a government, if it blurs decency and kindness, cheapens human life, and breeds ill will and suspicion- it is an evil government."
Eric Hoffer,"The birth of the new constitutes a crisis, and its mastery calls for a crude and simple cast of mind -- the mind of a fighter -- in which the virtues of tribal cohesion and fierceness and infantile credulity and malleability are paramount. Thus every new beginning recapitulates in some degree man's first beginning."
Eric Hoffer,It is the awareness of unfulfilled desires which gives a nation the feeling that it has a mission and a destiny.
Eric Hoffer,"To become different from what we are, we must have some awareness of what we are"
Eric Hoffer,"The misery of a child is interesting to a mother, the misery of a young man is interesting to a young woman, the misery of an old man is interesting to nobody."
Eric Hoffer,The pleasure we derive from doing favors is partly in the feeling it gives us that we are not altogether worthless. It is a pleasant surprise to ourselves.
Eric Hoffer,Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.
Eric Hoffer,Every new adjustment is a crisis in self-esteem.
Eric Hoffer,"It is the child in man that is the source of his uniqueness and creativeness, and the playground is the optimal milieu for the unfolding of his capacities and talents."
Eric Hoffer,The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness.
Eric Hoffer,"It is often the failure who is the pioneer in new lands, new undertakings, and new forms of expression."
Eric Hoffer,What greater reassurance can the weak have than that they are like anyone else?
Eric Hoffer,It is by its promise of a sense of power that evil often attracts the weak.
Eric Hoffer,"It is remarkable by how much a pinch of malice enhances the penetrating power of an idea or an opinion. Our ears, it seems, are wonderfully attuned to sneers and evil reports about our fellow men."
Eric Hoffer,We all have private ails. The troublemakers are they who need public cures for their private ails.
Eric Hoffer,"There is probably an element of malice in our readiness to overestimate people - we are, as it were, laying up for ourselves the pleasure of later cutting them down to size."
Eric Hoffer,Animals often strike us as passionate machines.
Eric Hoffer,The savior who wants to turn men into angels is as much a hater of human nature as the totalitarian despot who wants to turn them into puppets.
Eric Hoffer,Propaganda does not deceive people; it merely helps them to deceive themselves.
Eric Hoffer,"Our passionate preoccupation with the sky, the stars, and a God somewhere in outer space is a homing impulse. We are drawn back to where we came from."
Eric Hoffer,There is in most passions a shrinking away from ourselves. The passionate pursuer has all the earmarks of a fugitive.
Eric Hoffer,It almost seems that nobody can hate America as much as native Americans. America needs new immigrants to love and cherish it.
Eric Hoffer,"The superficiality of the American is the result of his hustling. It needs leisure to think things out; it needs leisure to mature. People in a hurry cannot think, cannot grow, nor can they decay. They are preserved in a state of perpetual puerility."
Eric Hoffer,To grow old is to grow common. Old age equalizes -- we are aware that what is happening to us has happened to untold numbers from the beginning of time. When we are young we act as if we were the first young people in the world.
Eric Hoffer,Old age equalizes -- we are aware that what is happening to us has happened to untold numbers from the beginning of time. When we are young we act as if we were the first young people in the world.
Eric Hoffer,Old age equalizes - we are aware that what is happening to us has happened to untold numbers from the beginning of time. When we are young we act as if we were the first young people in the world.
Eric Hoffer,"No matter what our achievements might be, we think well of ourselves only in rare moments. We need people to bear witness against our inner judge, who keeps book on our shortcomings and transgressions. We need people to convince us that we are not as bad as we think we are."
Eric Hoffer,"Our achievements speak for themselves. What we have to keep track of are our failures, discouragements and doubts. We tend to forget the past difficulties, the many false starts, and the painful groping. We see our past achievements as the end results of"
Eric Hoffer,"In the shaping of a life, chance and the ability to respond to chance are everything"
Eric Hoffer,Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature.
Eric Hoffer,"They who lack talent expect things to happen without effort. They ascribe failure to a lack of inspiration or ability, or to misfortune, rather than to insufficient application. At the core of every true talent there is an awareness of the difficulties inherent in any achievement, and the confidence that by persistence and patience something worthwhile will be realized. Thus talent is a species of vigor."
Eric Hoffer,Someone who thinks the world is always cheating him is right. He is missing that wonderful feeling of trust in someone or something.
Eric Hoffer,The only way to predict the future is to have power to shape the future.
Eric Hoffer,Our sense of power is more vivid when we break a man's spirit than when we win his heart.
Abbie Hoffman,The only way to support a revolution is to make your own.
Abbie Hoffman,Never impose your language on people you wish to reach.
Abbie Hoffman,The first duty of a revolutionary is to get away with it.
Abbie Hoffman,"Expedience, not justice, is the rule of contemporary American law."
Abbie Hoffman,To steal from a brother or sister is evil. To not steal from the institutions that are the pillars of the Pig Empire is equally immoral.
Abbie Hoffman,Once you get the right image the details aren't that important.
Abbie Hoffman,"When decorum is repression, the only dignity free men have is to speak out."
Abbie Hoffman,Free speech means the right to shout 'theatre' in a crowded fire.
Abbie Hoffman,Sacred cows make the tastiest hamburger.
Abbie Hoffman,"I believe in compulsory cannibalism. If people were forced to eat what they killed, there would be no more wars."
Abbie Hoffman,Structure is more important than content in the transmission of information.
Abbie Hoffman,I was probably the only revolutionary referred to as cute.
Abbie Hoffman,"Revolution is not something fixed in ideology, nor is it something fashioned to a particular decade. It is a perpetual process embedded in the human spirit."
Abbie Hoffman,A modern revolutionary group heads for the television station.
Abbie Hoffman,"You measure a democracy by the freedom it gives its dissidents, not the freedom it gives its assimilated conformists."
Abbie Hoffman,"The key to organizing an alternative society is to organize people around what they can do, and more importantly, what they want to do."
Alice Hoffman,I'm thinking of reading something by chef Paul Prudhomme. It's a reading of all kinds of Southern literature.
Alice Hoffman,"You can try to take sorrow and make it into something enduring, meaningful and beautiful. I always feel guilty that this is my job, that I get to do this."
Alice Hoffman,They were written on cheap blue notebooks bought by poor women. I'm interested in folk tales in the way that medicine and magic in women's stories are all kind of combined.
Alice Hoffman,"The original fairy tale was about the youngest sister going into a room in the castle and finding all the bodies of the wives that came before her - she is confronted with truth, thinking about how often we think we know people and we really don't."
Alice Hoffman,The adults don't know what's happening on the kids' universe and the kids don't know what's happening on the adults' universe.
Alice Hoffman,No one knows how to write a novel until it's been written.
Alice Hoffman,"It was a great escape for me and it was a way to take a break from what was going on in my own world, to go into another world."
Alice Hoffman,"Ironically, now that my children are older and gone quite a bit, I find it harder to work when they're not around. Too much free time!"
Alice Hoffman,I've been a screenwriter for twenty-five years. Every one of my books have been optioned for movies and I have written a few of those screenplays.
Alice Hoffman,"I'm much faster now. When you only have a certain amount of time to write, after a while you learn to use your time well or you stop writing."
Alice Hoffman,"I think we are bound to, and by, nature. We may want to deny this connection and try to believe we control the external world, but every time there's a snowstorm or drought, we know our fate is tied to the world around us."
Alice Hoffman,"I think secrets often come out. I spoke to a friend who is a therapist and I asked her if there were people who came to her and admitted to doing horrible things and she said, 'More than you know.'"
Alice Hoffman,I think love is a huge factor in fiction and in real life. Is there a risk? Always. In fiction and in life.
Alice Hoffman,I really feel like the gift is also the curse. It's always half-and-half. Whatever brings you the most joy will also probably bring you the most pain. Always a price to pay.
Alice Hoffman,"I never see a novel as a film while I'm writing it. Mostly because novels and films are so different, and I'm such an internal novelist."
Alice Hoffman,"I never plot out my novels in terms of the tone of the book. Hopefully, once a story is begun it reveals itself."
Alice Hoffman,"I feel more influenced in my own work by dreams than I do by other writers' works in a way. Or by popular culture, movies - what else is there to write about than love and loss?"
Alice Hoffman,I don't really read as much as I used to. A lot of what I was looking for as an escape I find in writing. And the other thing is that I don't want to get into someone else's language when I'm working.
Alice Hoffman,"I did go there later, but I hadn't been there before I wrote the book. Sometimes I feel like the imagined can feel more real than the real?"
Alice Hoffman,I can't really work on more than one thing at a time.
Alice Hoffman,I always quit at three when my kids come home from school so I feel pretty spoiled.
Alice Hoffman,I always felt and still feel that fairy tales have an emotional truth that is so deep that there are few things that really rival them.
Alice Hoffman,"Hawthorne has given us a tradition that some people refer to as Yankee Magic Realism, and I do think there is a certain quality to the landscape that definitely leads into the dark woods."
Alice Hoffman,"Every time I finish a book, I forget everything I learned writing it - the information just disappears out of my head."
Alice Hoffman,"Even in times when it's difficult to figure out, how do you go forward, art - and books - always help."
Alice Hoffman,"Anyway, the sort of love that will not wait is probably best to pass by."
Alice Hoffman,Any institution becomes a community - whether it's a high school or a boarding school or a publishing company or a small town where everybody knows certain things about people.
Alice Hoffman,"All the characters in my books are imagined, but all have a bit of who I am in them - much like the characters in your dreams are all formed by who you are."
Alice Hoffman,"After a while, the characters I'm writing begin to feel real to me. That's when I know I'm heading in the right direction."
Alice Hoffman,"I also like the whole idea of fairy tales and folk tales being a woman's domain, considered a lesser domain at the time they were told."
Alice Hoffman,I don't think I make much of a distinction between the 'real' and the 'fantastic.' They both seem to be threads in the same cloth as far as I'm concerned.
Alice Hoffman,"Among men and women, those in love do not always announce themselves with declarations and vows. But they are the ones who weep when you're gone. Who miss you every single night, especially when the sky is so deep and beautiful, and the ground so very cold."
Alice Hoffman,"I think growing up is difficult and it's a process that I'm always interested in, with kids and adults, they are often on two different universes."
Alice Hoffman,"Mothers always find ways to fit in the work - but then when you're working, you feel that you should be spending time with your children and then when you're with your children, you're thinking about working."
Bruce Hoffman,"He knows the terrain, he knows the problems and he understands the solutions. He's bringing the right vision, but this is the vision that should've been brought three years ago."
Bruce Hoffman,"So, in other words, all the lessons that they're learning on how to attack the United States are being communicated and shared not only throughout Iraq but with insurgents and terrorists throughout the world."
Bruce Hoffman,"We may be setting up new TV and radio stations, and that's fine, but ... they're getting their information from the Internet."
Bruce Hoffman,terrorists can still accomplish their basic aims of fear and intimidation just as well by using entirely conventional weapons -- the gun and the bomb.
Bruce Hoffman,There's absolutely no doubt that executing him would turn him into a martyr.
Bruce Hoffman,I think this is one of the major challenges that we face in the U.S.. The major incidents in the U.S. have not conformed to our stereotype of an established terror organization attacking a major iconic landmark.
Bruce Hoffman,These kidnappings represent a significant gap in the country's security and undermine public confidence in the ability of both Iraqi government and coalition forces to maintain order and protect Iraqi citizens from violence - whether insurgent or criminal.
Mark Hoffman,"It's not just technology alone that makes us strong. It is technology plus all the infrastructure that makes us unique, i.e. venture capitalists, lawyers, bankers."
Mark Hoffman,He's (Moneysmith) a big strong running back and a tough kid. Mississinawa just executed and played better than us.

Mark Hoffman,"I have an awful lot of girls on my two teams, and there used to be a paradigm that girls cannot do math. But all these kids are honors students, and you have to constantly keep challenging them. Otherwise they'll get lazy, roll over and do the minimum to get an A."
Mark Hoffman,"I can't attach even an approximate estimate to this. If you look at the (pest control) report, he's got damage all the way around the house - there's not one area of the building that doesn't have damage. When there's that much stuff there, you'd almost have to take everything off to find out what's going on there."
Mark Hoffman,"To beat Penn you have to be error-free, execute on special teams and control the ball on offense. If we do that we'll have a chance to win. I saw the scrimmage tape against Andrean, where (Andrean) didn't run the ball past the line of scrimmage. I wanted to turn the tape off."

Ben Hogan,Why Don't you aim more to the right?
Ben Hogan,"There is no similarity between golf and putting; they are two different games, one played in the air, and the other on the ground."
Ben Hogan,I learn something new about the game almost every time I step on the course.
Ben Hogan,I couldn't wait for the sun to come up the next morning so that I could get out on the course again.

Hulk Hogan,Hopefully I can become the Babe Ruth of the World Wrestling Federation and be the champion at the same time.
Hulk Hogan,I feel really good right now. It will really be a tough decision. It's so hard to give up what you love doing. Hanging up the boots will not be an easy thing to do.

Larry Hogan,"Billy played well. He got into foul trouble in the second quarter. He got two fouls in the second so I pulled him. We were down at half by six but they had us down by as many as 12, but I thought he really came back in the second half. It was a big game for Billy."
Larry Hogan,"They're pretty physical, about like the team that we just played. They play a lot of man-to-man and will try to pound it in to a guy who's 6-foot-6 and about 240."
Larry Hogan,You're not going to find a team that has that kind of quickness. It was a tremendous win against a very good basketball team.
Larry Hogan,"Victor got hurt, and Billy was in foul trouble so we had a few starters out. I thought we just didn't play very well to be quite honest. We were a little bit flat. Maybe we were worried about what happened to Victor, I'm not sure. We were just kind of stagnant on both ends."
Larry Hogan,There are a whole host of great players and significant players I've come to know as personal friends who were wonderful sources.

Patricia Hogan,"It came down to crunch time, to enter him in a prep race, and there just wasn't enough time. I was very much on the fence. It was a tough decision, but it's better to be safe and just wait."
Patricia Hogan,The horse is doing very well clinically and has progressed remarkably well.

Paul Hogan,I didn't get into entertainment until I was like 31. I didn't star in a movie until I was 46.
Paul Hogan,The secret to my success is that I bit off more than I could chew and chewed as fast as I could.
Paul Hogan,"What career? A man's got a body of film of about four movies in about 10 years or something. I do it because I think I can do a good job of something and I'll enjoy it, do it, and sort of vanish. I don't want to be an actor for hire."
Paul Hogan,"Well, there's nothing strange about Americans as a whole. But, Angelinos are different!"
Fred Hoiberg,"(From) the smiles on the kids' faces, you could really tell that you took them away from everything that's been going on in their lives these last couple of weeks."
Fred Hoiberg,"They all say there is a small amount of risk. They have differing opinions on how much there is. They can't put a number on that risk, because nobody has ever played with my condition. At the end of the day, with the family I have, I think the smartest thing for me to do is retire."
Fred Hoiberg,"Even though the risk of something serious happening is very low, there is a risk."
Fred Hoiberg,"All of you are aware of the journey I've taken this past year and I just want to relay to all of the people that sent along their prayers and well wishes, my heartfelt thanks. It was truly overwhelming to me and my family the outpouring that we received from the Twin Cities community and from across the Midwest."
Fred Hoiberg,"If there's something wrong or a chance something can go wrong, I'll hang 'em up. I'll think about that first hit (if he returns). My game is diving on the floor, setting screens, but if the doctors say it's OK, and they say the heart has healed, I'll play."
Brady Hoke,"You have to execute it. We didn't get the ball high enough. It put our defense in a bad position, but we thought we needed to try some things to get some momentum. I wouldn't change a thing. Let's face it, [BC's] a talented team, so why not?"
Brady Hoke,"It's about the game here today. The 13 players, that's not my job. We didn't do anything different today."
Brady Hoke,We didn't change anything. I'm not going to talk about it. It's not my job. It's about this game today.
Brady Hoke,"There aren't any secrets. We got beat by a good team. We got outplayed and everything. They are a good football team, real good football team."

Richard Holbrooke,"As for the peace process, we will continue active negotiations in the next few days."
Richard Holbrooke,I want to point out in the clearest possible terms that long-term peace and stability in the Balkans will not be possible as long as the current leadership in Belgrade is in power. And those people who have been indicted also should be brought to justice.

James Holmes,You could see the confidence out there. We knew we were going to get it done.

Oliver Wendell Holmes,"For I say unto you in all sadness of conviction that to think great thoughts you must be heroes as well as idealists. Only when you have worked alone -- when you have felt around you are a black gulf of solitude more isolating than that which surrounds the dying man, and in hope and despair have trusted to your own unshaken will -- then only can you gain the secret isolated joy of the thinker, who knows that a hundred years after he is dead and forgotten men who have never heard of him will be moving to the measure of his thought -- the subtle rapture of postponed power, which the world knows not because it has no external trappings, but which to his prophetic vision is more real than that which commands an army. And if this joy should not be yours, still it is only thus you can know that you have done what lay in you to do -- can say that you have lived, and be ready for the end."

Every achievement is a bird on the wing."

Mike Holmgren,"We just changed some of our packages so it gets to be seen more. Plus, everybody knows that this could be my last year here so everybody is kind of paying attention to everything."
Mike Holmgren,Our trainers thought it would be good to give him a rest throwing the ball today.
Mike Holmgren,"They would go at it in practice pretty good, and Darrell is off to a good start. That will be a fun thing to watch, those two."
Mike Holmgren,"Now, we've all seen potential fall by the wayside, but he has a great work ethic. If he's fortunate not to get hurt, it will work for him."
Mike Holmgren,"I think we made a little mistake last year not throwing him in there sooner. He would have struggled a little bit, but when he did play, he was very good."
Mike Holmgren,"I pretty much made up my mind. If I kicked it right now, without running a play, (Brown) would make this kick. I've done it before. You take a chance on a pass and goofy stuff happens. I was not going to take that chance there."
Mike Holmgren,"I've very, very proud of the job he has done. He is stronger and better because of some of the tough things he had to go through. He and I kind of banged around a little bit, but we're in a good place now."
Mike Holmgren,"If you are hurt and can't play or practice, and then the other guys come in and make a case for themselves, you've got to look at that. Before we make any decisions there, we've got to find out what they say in Alabama."
Mike Holmgren,"He is as hard of a working lineman as I've been around. Offensive linemen are usually that way, but he kind of goes over the edge in his work ethic. He is tremendously strong, very bright and he really wants it every play, every down. His ability to focus in is really very amazing."
Mike Holmgren,It would be an understatement to say I'm not happy about this.
Mike Holmgren,"It's like, OK, we're playing the game and those guys are upstairs doing whatever they are doing,"
Mike Holmgren,"He is a lifelong football personnel man. Personnel people, they have a passion for it. They want to help the head coach. They want to give him the best players they can give him. And it creates a real healthy trust and working relationship. Bob's first love, as you know, was basketball. And he was taking on a lot of jobs. It's different now, because Tim is a lifelong football guy. We have a good relationship."
Mike Holmgren,Darrell was very much ready to play this football game. He came up big today.
Mike Holmgren,"He's a wonderful young man and a great football player -- let me say those things first,"
Mike Holmgren,"We were careless with the football, and we made too many mistakes. And when you play a good team like the Steelers, that's not a good combination."
Mike Holmgren,It's a clear example of ... when the fire is burning a little brighter for one team.
Mike Holmgren,We had a good practice. I was pleased. The enthusiasm and execution were pretty good.
Mike Holmgren,"It is good to know that he is heading in the right direction, and we can focus on what we need to focus on,"
Mike Holmgren,"Some of those were by design, ... Some of this stuff, the stars lined up and it allowed us to do this stuff."
Mike Holmgren,"I had a conversation with the league, and there were mistakes that were made, which we felt at the time."
Mike Holmgren,"We're dealing with young people. I used to lecture my children all the time, too."
Mike Holmgren,"I'm a tremendous believer now. It's about as much like grass as you can have a synthetic surface be. I really think the right decision was made. This is great for everyone. Players love it, and I think this surface will offer a better product on the field for fans."
Mike Holmgren,"As he explained to me exactly what happened, I believe I understand what happened. At that point I have made the decision that he will play in the football game."
Mike Holmgren,"That was very distasteful to me, to retaliate so to speak like that (against the Vikings). I do believe the commissioner should look into these kind of clauses. We work so hard on trying to gain labor peace and a new collective bargaining agreement and then we as clubs allow agents to get cute and circumvent it. On the playing field there are rules and there are unwritten rules about how the game should be played in the spirit and the fairness of it all. It doesn't make sense to me that we had to lose such a fine football player this way. I was surprised by the ruling."
Mike Holmgren,"I had made an agreement when we signed him that if he got a chance to be a starter that I would help to make that happen, and a deal's a deal,"
Michael Holt,"I was completely gone and to carry on would have wasted everyone's time. When I look back I'll probably regret it because it was unprofessional, but it was the second match in a row I'd lost from 4-2 up and it was on my mind."
Michael Holt,My mind was gone. I chucked it away. I will probably regret what I have done. I know it is an unprofessional thing to do but I live with regrets all my life anyway.
Michael Holt,"If I thought it would help his health in any way, I would lose on purpose, but it's not going to"

Lou Holtz,"With his optimism and with the new enthusiasm that a new coach always brings, I think he can take it to the championship level, and I will be surprised if he doesn't win the championship. Not that it will be easy, but he's a very talented individual."
Lou Holtz,"I haven't seen anything that would compare to the anxiety of the game. Look at this: USC was No. 1 preseason, Texas was No. 2 and it never changed the entire year. Everyone said these would be the two best teams in the entire country and they were. How often does that happen?"
Lou Holtz,"When all is said and done, more is said than done."
Lou Holtz,Coaching is nothing more than eliminating mistakes before you get fired.
Lou Holtz,"If you try to fight the course, it will beat you."
Lou Holtz,"If he's got golf clubs in his truck or a camper in his driveway, I don't hire him."

Lou Holtz,"You're never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you're never as bad as they say when you lose."
Lou Holtz,I think everyone should experience defeat at least once during their career. You learn a lot from it.
Lou Holtz,No one has ever drowned in sweat.
Lou Holtz,"A lifetime contract for a coach means if you're ahead in the third quarter and moving the ball, they can't fire you."
Lou Holtz,The man who complains about the way the ball bounces is likely the one who dropped it.

Lou Holtz,I can't believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary.
Lou Holtz,There's nothing is this world more instinctively abhorrent to me than finding myself in agreement with my fellow-humans.
Lou Holtz,"Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and I'll show you someone who has overcome adversity."
Lou Holtz,Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.
Lou Holtz,Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.
Lou Holtz,"A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song."
Skip Holtz,"I thought we made some more progress Friday. We've still got a ways to go to get where we want to be but there were many positives to build on, both offensively and defensively."
Skip Holtz,"I think we did a great job of not giving up the big play. There were some missed tackles, but overall I was pleased. I keep telling people that we are going to be solid on defense, and if we can build on today's performance, we will be in good shape."
Skip Holtz,"It's all about making plays. While I was pleased with the intensity, enthusiasm and the physical part of it, this is the stage of the spring where you look for execution and people who consistently make plays and a difference out there. As I've said before, this is a work in progress and changes are part of it."
Skip Holtz,"We really looked flat out there offensively. There was no enthusiasm, and we missed some easy assignments and our handoff exchanges were just not there. On a positive note, the offensive line looked real solid and that was encouraging."
Skip Holtz,"We're going to treat it like tryouts, and after the week, we're making our decisions and we're going with them. We can't wait any longer."
Skip Holtz,"He moves around decently enough for (Duke) to utilize any play action. More than anything, he has been there before. He has been under fire and has the experience. He is poised and he is very intelligent which means he has the ability to hurt you if you give him an opening. He is going to present some problems for us because of his knowledge in the pocket."
Evander Holyfield,"Well, of course a boxing match is hard because boxing isn't set for you to do good. You have to force your will upon someone, but dancing you don't have to force your will. It should be a lot easier because if I make a mistake I don't get hit."
Evander Holyfield,"Well, number one I like dancing. Number two I knew it would be challenging because I had never done this type of dance before. I always wanted to and I happened to have the courage to go out there and give it my best shot."
Evander Holyfield,It is not the size of a man but the size of his heart that matters.
Evander Holyfield,My goal is to be the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.
Evander Holyfield,"Well, when I think of steroids I think of an image. You have the advantage over someone, which is a form of cheating. I guess it wouldn't be right unless it was legal for everybody. Reason it's not legal for everybody is because it can hurt people seriously."
Josh Homme,"The Queens Of The Stone Age have teamed up with multimedia wizardbrain Liam Lynch to make the video for 'Burn The Witch' , a home-made affair that's just in time for Halloween.

Rob Honzo,"They are still playing around with their positioning, trying to see what works."
Rob Honzo,"From what I've heard, Colorado Academy has a good team. They have some girls who went to the state tournament last year. Most of the Denver teams are good. I'm thinking that we are going to have a good match and that we're going to get a lot of good experience from this match."
Rob Honzo,That match was a huge win for those girls to beat a Denver team. Those girls earned that win.
Gavin Hood,"My parents have been car-jacked. I have been mugged. We all know what it is like. But do you write a story about the way it is, or the way it should, or could, or needs to be?"
Gavin Hood,"I want to thank my fellow nominees, who I've become deep friends with. We may have foreign-language films, but our stories are the same as your stories. They're about the human heart and emotion."
Gavin Hood,Our stories are the same as your stories. They're about the human heart and emotion.
Gavin Hood,"When you make a little film without stars and not in English, you [just] hope you get into international festivals, so we didn't know if we'd get accepted in competition in Edinburgh or Toronto. Each [one seemed to bring] attention to the film to audiences around the world. We [originally] just wanted it to play in London, New York and Los Angeles like most small films do."
Gavin Hood,"It's when [the subject] makes eye contact with you, and there's that tiny moment of challenge, of vulnerability or sudden aggression or confusion or insecurity. You construct the movie out of those moments that happen between lines and beneath the lines, and then you're very lucky to have actors like Presley and Terry, who can deliver those very subtle moments in characters that don't say a huge amount."
John B. Hood,I knew that if the feat was accomplished it must be at a most fearful sacrifice of as brave and gallant soldiers as ever engaged in battle.
John B. Hood,"I can assure you, that the gallant hearts that throb beneath its sacred folds, will only be content, when this glorious banner is planted first and foremost in the coming struggle for out independence."
John B. Hood,After this urgent protest against entering into battle at Gettysburg according to instructions - which protest is the first and only one I ever made during my entire military career - I ordered my line to advance and make the assault.

Bell Hooks,Secrets find a way out in sleep . . . It is the place where there is no pretense.
Bell Hooks,"For most people, what is so painful about reading is that you read something and you don't have anybody to share it with. In part what the book club opens up is that people can read a book and then have someone else to talk about it with. Then they see that a book can lead to the pleasure of conversation, that the solitary act of reading can actually be a part of the path to communion and community."
Bell Hooks,"I often find it easier to be teaching or giving to others, and often struggle with the place of my own pleasure and joy."
Bell Hooks,"Usually, when people talk about the strength of black women . . . . they ignore the reality that to be strong in the face of oppression is not the same as overcoming oppression, that endurance is not to be confused with transformation."
Bell Hooks,"I feel enormously blessed to be a successful black woman writer in this culture, but I have found my small fame, such as it is, to be very isolating... because I think that especially for black women, the more we rise from the bottom, the more we move and journey, the more we are the targets of the most brutal and vicious attacks."
Bell Hooks,"Why is it that many contemporary male thinkers, especially men of color, repudiate the imperialist legacy of Columbus but affirm dimensions of that legacy by their refusal to repudiate patriarchy?"
Bell Hooks,What had begun as a movement to free all black people from racist oppression became a movement with its primary goal the establishment of black male patriarchy.
Bell Hooks,No other group in America has so had their identity socialized out of existence as have black women... When black people are talked about the focus tends to be on black men; and when women are talked about the focus tends to be on white women.
Bell Hooks,Life-transforming ideas have always come to me through books.
Bell Hooks,"Some people act as though art that is for a mass audience is not good art, and I think this has been a very negative thing. I know that I have wanted very much to write books that are accessible to the widest audience possible."
Bell Hooks,"We judge on the basis of what somebody looks like, skin color, whether we think they're beautiful or not. That space on the Internet allows you to converse with somebody with none of those things involved."

Bell Hooks,"Many spiritual teachers - in Buddhism, in Islam - have talked about first-hand experience of the world as an important part of the path to wisdom, to enlightenment."
Bell Hooks,"Yesterday I was thinking about the whole idea of genius and creative people, and the notion that if you create some magical art, somehow that exempts you from having to pay attention to the small things."
Bell Hooks,"I have been thinking about the notion of perfect love as being without fear, and what that means for us in a world that's becoming increasingly xenophobic, tortured by fundamentalism and nationalism."
Bell Hooks,I thought about how we need to make children feel that there are times in their lives when they need to be alone and quiet and to be able to accept their aloneness.
Bell Hooks,"I'm such a girl for the living room. I really like to stay in my nest and not move. I travel in my mind, and that that's a rigorous state of journeying for me. My body isn't that interested in moving from place to place."
Bell Hooks,It's in the act of having to do things that you don't want to that you learn something about moving past the self. Past the ego.
Bell Hooks,"I'm so disturbed when my women students behave as though they can only read women, or black students behave as though they can only read blacks, or white students behave as though they can only identify with a white writer."
Bell Hooks,I will not have my life narrowed down. I will not bow down to somebody else's whim or to someone else's ignorance.
Bell Hooks,"For me, forgiveness and compassion are always linked: how do we hold people accountable for wrongdoing and yet at the same time remain in touch with their humanity enough to believe in their capacity to be transformed?"
Bell Hooks,"I feel like there is always something trying to pull us back into sleep, that there is this sort of seductive quality in all the hedonistic pleasures that pull on us."
Bell Hooks,I began writing a book on love because I felt that the United States is moving away from love.
Bell Hooks,Being oppressed means the absence of choices.

Shannon Hoon,I think we really almost burnt ourselves out on one record.
Shannon Hoon,I really enjoy the therapeutic value of writing songs.
Shannon Hoon,"I know that sounds selfish, but you have to look at what it's doing to you personally - are you frustrated because of the way people perceive you, or are you happy enough about the things you've realized about yourself that you can tolerate the way people perceive you?"
Shannon Hoon,"I hate the word 'hippy'. I hate a lot of people, and hippies don't do that!"

Ibrahim Hooper,"The administration quite rightly struck a balanced tone, balancing freedom of expression with responsibility in the media."
Ibrahim Hooper,"We tend to see the number of bias incidents go in cycles in large part tied to international events. It has leveled off since 9/11, but unfortunately at a higher level than prior to 9/11."
Ibrahim Hooper,We know how to deal with these things in a positive way. We're opening an education campaign on the life and legacy of the Prophet Muhammad.
Ibrahim Hooper,It's important to keep the lines of communication open.

Martin Hughes,Our continuing growth in both revenue and earnings provides a strong basis for increased cash payments to our shareholders. This represents a seventeen percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate.
Martin Hughes,"We don't see rates declining much further or a significant firming in the near future, partly because ample capital is flowing into the market after the 2005 hurricane season. At the same time, we are encouraged by the ongoing development of our internal sales culture and by our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions. We anticipate further improvement in both areas in 2006. We also anticipate that contingent commissions could decline this year due to loss experience for insurers in 2005."

Our acquisition team continued to excel in identifying and closing attractive opportunities. In addition, we achieved our goal of increasing operating margins, recording a one-percentage-point improvement for the quarter and the year."
Mike Hughes,This was the original buying service we put together in 1992.

Chad Hugo,"When I made it, I still didn't wave the flag and say, Yeah go Asian people. I do want people to know that about me, but I always felt like at least musically, let me just do what I do and be the best at it. Which is what I'm doing right now."

Victor Hugo,"Let us have compassion for those under chastisement. Alas, who are we ourselves? Who am I and who are you?

Look closely at life. It is so constituted that one senses punishment everywhere."
Victor Hugo,Progress is the stride of God.
Victor Hugo,"Progress is the life-style of man. The general life of the human race is called Progress, and so is its collective march. Progress advances, it makes the great human and earthly journey towards what is heavenly and divine; it has its pauses, when it rallies the stragglers, its stopping places when it meditates, contemplating some new and splendid promised land that has suddenly appeared on its horizon. It has its nights of slumber; and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker to see the human spirit lost in shadow, and to grope in the darkness without being able to awake sleeping progress."
Victor Hugo,"Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two has the grander view?"
Victor Hugo,"The greatest blunders, like the thickest ropes, are often compounded of a multitude of strands.

Victor Hugo,"To rescue from oblivion even a fragment of a language which men have used and which is in danger of being lost --that is to say, one of the elements, whether good or bad, which have shaped and complicated civilization --is to extend the scope of social observation and to serve civilization."
Victor Hugo,"Have no fear of robbers or murderers. They are external dangers, petty dangers. We should fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices the real murders.

Victor Hugo,"Be like the bird that, pausing in her flight awhile on boughs too slight, feels them give way beneath her, and yet sings, knowing that she hath wings."
Victor Hugo,"Ask not the name of him who asks you for a bed. It is especially he whose name is a burden to him, who has need of an asylum (room)."
Victor Hugo,Do not ask the name of the person who seeks a bed for the night. He who is reluctant to give his name is the one who most needs shelter.
Victor Hugo,No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come.
Victor Hugo,"From the oyster to the eagle, from the swine to the tiger, all animals are to be found in men and each of them exists in some man, sometimes several at the time. Animals are nothing but the portrayal of our virtues and vices made manifest to our eyes, the visible reflections of our souls. God displays them to us to give us food for thought."
Victor Hugo,"Anger may be foolish and obsurd, and one may be irritated when in the wrong; but a man never feels outraged unless in some respect he is at bottom right."
Victor Hugo,"In each age men of genius undertake the ascent. From below, the world follows them with their eyes. These men go up the mountain, enter the clouds, disappear, reappear, People watch them, mark them. They walk by the side of precipices. They daringly pursue their road. See them aloft, see them in the distance; they are but black specks. On they go. The road is uneven, its difficulties constant. At each step a wall, at each step a trap. As they rise the cold increases. They must make their ladder, cut the ice and walk on it., hewing the steps in haste. A storm is raging. Nevertheless they go forward in their madness. The air becomes difficult to breath. The abyss yawns below them. Some fall. Others stop and retrace their steps; there is a sad weariness. The bold ones continue. They are eyed by the eagles; the lightning plays about them: the hurricane is furious. No matter, they persevere."
Victor Hugo,"Adversity makes men, and prosperity makes monsters."
Victor Hugo,"Separated lovers cheat absence by a thousand fancies which have their own reality. They are prevented from seeing one another and they cannot write; nevertheless they find countless mysterious ways of corresponding, by sending each other the song of birds, the scent of flowers, the laughter of children, the light of the sun, the sighing of the wind, and the gleam of the stars --all the beauties of creation."
Victor Hugo,Wisdom is a sacred communion.
Victor Hugo,All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come.
Victor Hugo,What would be ugly in a garden constitutes beauty in a mountain.
Victor Hugo,Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent.

Victor Hugo,"Intelligence is the wife, imagination is the mistress, memory is the servant."
Victor Hugo,A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil.
Victor Hugo,Fashions have done more harm than revolutions.
Victor Hugo,A faith is a necessity to a man. Woe to him who believes in nothing.
Victor Hugo,Each man should frame life so that at some future hour fact and his dreaming meet.
Victor Hugo,To love beauty is to see light.
Victor Hugo,Dear God! how beauty varies in nature and art. In a woman the flesh must be like marble; in a statue the marble must be like flesh.
Victor Hugo,"When grace is joined with wrinkles, it is adorable. There is an unspeakable dawn in happy old age."
Victor Hugo,Forty is the old age of youth; fifty the youth of old age.
Bobby Hull,"Always keep your composure. You can't score from the penalty box; and to win, you have to score."
Bobby Hull,"Somewhere in my wildest childhood I must have done something right. Being able to make a boyhood dream come true is one thing, but to have a kid come along and thrill his dad like Brett Hull has thrilled me over his career is too much for one guy to handle."
Bobby Hull,"Every professional athlete owes a debt of gratitude to the fans and management, and pays an installment every time he plays. He should never miss a payment."
Brett Hull,"There's an old expression, and I don't know who said it ? 'The mind is willing but the body isn't, ... I wish no one had to do this because it's so hard, it's hard because you never think you're going to grow older and be unable to live up to the expectations you set for yourself."
Brett Hull,"There's an old expression, and I don't know who said it 'The mind is willing but the body isn't,'"
Brett Hull,"When my dad was playing in Winnipeg in '72-I was about 8 years old-he took me to my first outdoor rink in the winter. My feet were so cold, and then it gets even more excruciating once they start to thaw. It was the most excruciating pain I've ever had."
Brett Hull,"That was special, ... I know what my dad meant to the game."
Brett Hull,"I think everyone has underestimated how intimidated players are reacting to Wayne being (a coach),"
Brett Hull,"There's no one more competitive, ... He's the ultimate champion and competitor. He's going to have to really fight that when things don't go as great as he wants them to. I think it's going to help us players to have that. He's not going to settle for people going through the motions or not executing."
Brett Hull,They should not be allowed to put your picture on a hockey card without your approval of the picture.
Brett Hull,You have to know how to score.
Brett Hull,"If you're going to play hockey now, you have to be able to play. If you have the ability to fight and play, you're an unbelievable commodity. But if you can only fight, there might be six of those guys left in the league, and I can guarantee they're going fast."
Brett Hull,"You can't get big in hockey. You need to be pliable... they've even taken fighting out of the game, so there's no more of those big huge guys who just fight."
Brett Hull,"I'm not done yet making people miserable. If they're going to make me miserable, then I'm going to make them miserable."
Brett Hull,"I see myself playing as long as I am partially enjoying the game and partially successful and they are paying me. But honestly, two more years is about all I can take."
Brett Hull,I'm good at everything.
Brett Hull,"I'm very impatient. I am. That's the bane of my game. I don't think about what I'm going to do-I just go hit it, I don't stop to wait and think. Costs me two shots a round."
Brett Hull,"My teeth have never been touched. Why did I tell you that? Knock on wood. I've got a few scars over the eyes, a couple on the chin, a few on the beak and one across the cheek. But my luck is running out."
Brett Hull,There are so many unbelievable words... But that doesn't mean I have a favorite word.
Brett Hull,"If you have an active mind, it always helps. You know, people who don't do crosswords, their minds fall asleep. That's why I do them-my mind is always working. One day my brain is going to explode through the top of my head."
Brett Hull,"I'm realistic. And realistically, I'm not that type of player that earns that type of money any more. So I'd be willing to take a little cut to get a couple of extra years."
Brett Hull,Baseball has all the money.
Brett Hull,I'm known as a winner now.
Brett Hull,"I think the biggest thing for me is being able to adjust to the way the game has changed. It's basically a 180-degree turn from the style I like to play. That's what I think I'm most proud of, being able to fit into this style of game and still be fairly successful."
Brett Hull,I'm patient with crossword puzzles and the most impatient golfer.
Brett Hull,Sometimes guys need to cry. Some hockey players think they're too tough to cry.
Brett Hull,Canadian hockey fans... They boo me every time I go anywhere. Because I play for Team USA.
Brett Hull,Do I catch flak because I'm so much smarter than everyone else? I don't know.
William Hull,Because our task is not to outnumber the Methodists but to win the world-a world in which every day there are more lost persons than the day before.
William Hull,"One problem with ideas, however valid, is that they are static and impersonal, whereas a person is active and dynamic."
William Hull,"In a few days an officer came to our camp, under a flag of truce, and informed Hamilton, then a captain of artillery, but afterwards the aid of General Washington, that Captain Hale had been arrested within the British lines condemned as a spy, and executed that morning."
David Hume,"I may venture to affirm the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement."
David Hume,"Such is the nature of novelty that where anything pleases it becomes doubly agreeable if new; but if it displeases, it is doubly displeasing on that very account"
David Hume,Everything in the world is purchased by labor
David Hume,It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.
David Hume,Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of Human Nature. It fell dead-born from the press.
David Hume,"The great end of all human industry is the attainment of happiness. For this were arts invented, sciences cultivated, laws ordained, and societies modeled, by the most profound wisdom of patriots and legislators. Even the lonely savage, who lies exposed to the inclemency of the elements and the fury of wild beasts, forgets not, for a moment, this grand object of his being."
David Hume,"The richest genius, like the most fertile soil, when uncultivated, shoots up into the rankest weeds."
David Hume,A propensity to hope and joy is real riches; one to fear and sorrow real poverty
David Hume,"It is more rational to suspect knavery and folly than to discount, at a stroke, everything that past experience has taught me about the way things actually work"
David Hume,He is happy whose circumstances suit his temper but he is more excellent who can suit his temper to any circumstances
David Hume,Character is the result of a system of stereotyped principals.
David Hume,A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence
David Hume,Beauty is no quality in things themselves: it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them
David Hume,Truth springs from argument amongst friends.
David Hume,"Human happiness seems to consist in three ingredients; action, pleasure and indolence.

David Hume,Men often act knowingly against their interest.
David Hume,Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them.
John Hume,She has made an enormous contribution toward bringing about peace on our streets.
John Hume,"If the word 'No' was removed from the English language, Ian Paisley would be speechless"
John Hume,"This is about principled compromise, not compromised principles."
John Hume,"The whole world is in favor of this agreement, ... as fascists if they try to wreck this agreement."
John Hume,"Looking back on that, it was quite an accomplishment. You had some of the best teams in the state in the CKC."
Rob Hummel,"I've got to work harder to create my own shot. The first few quarters, I put way too much burden on (Martin)."
Rob Hummel,"After the Highland game, I got the lecture from the coaches to shoot more, so I've been trying to be more aggressive on the offensive end. I had my opportunities tonight and my teammates did a good job of getting me the ball."
Rob Hummel,"Definitely, when you see a coach Painter or coach Alford, that's going to stick in your mind. It's a big deal. (The head coach) is the guy."
William Hung,I already gave my best. I have no regrets at all.
William Hung,"I don't think I should have made it to Hollywood. I wasn't ready for the next level yet, but I wouldn't have known that until I did it."
William Hung,"My singing wasn't horrible, but my dancing really made it look silly. It's not like I'm a horrible singer that can't sing. But I don't have the consistency or the presentation skills that a good performer has."
William Hung,"I feel the producers really exploited my lack of talent at this time. I looked like an idiot up there. I want to be good, not something that people will laugh at."
William Hung,"I was just trying out and having some fun. I don't think I'd want to pursue singing as a career; it's an on-the-side thing. It would be great if I could make a career out of it but if I can't, that's OK too."
Gloria Hunniford,"Dancing was what we always used to do around the house,"
Gloria Hunniford,"Ultimately, I really want it to be a tribute to Caron and her extraordinary courage throughout the whole thing,"
Gloria Hunniford,Always buy a good pair of shoes and a good bed as if you aren't in one you are in the other
Lacy Hunt,I don't think any benefit of the dividend tax elimination is worth the increase in the deficit.
Lacy Hunt,"In the past two years, we've seen the budget go from surplus to deficit, adding about $400 billion of stimulus to the economy, but we've still lost 2.5 million private-sector jobs."
Lacy Hunt,"When [consumers] shift their income stream from purchases to saving, it slows GDP, and that's a long-term process. I think interest rates are going to remain very low for a couple of years."
Lacy Hunt,"When [consumers] shift their income stream from purchases to saving, it slows GDP, and that's a long-term process, ... I think interest rates are going to remain very low for a couple of years."
Lacy Hunt,"Powerful restraining forces are impacting the consumer, and this will result in slower growth in the latter part of this year and into 2005,"
Lacy Hunt,The Fed has made a statement here that they are not going to allow higher energy costs to translate into inflation.
Lacy Hunt,"This economy is too fragile to sustain this type of severe rate rise; the consumer sector is leveraged up the gourd. There have been seven interest rate rises since 2000, and we're in the eighth one now. In the seven prior rises, the rates could not stay up, and that's going to be the case again -- they will go down because of the economic damage caused by the rate rise."
Lacy Hunt,"This economy is not producing jobs in a normal way. We have serious global competitive pressures working on the economy. There continues to be a very rapid increase in productivity, which is undermining demand for labor."
Lacy Hunt,The risk to the economy is that we lose the consumer -- and I think we are losing the consumer.
Lacy Hunt,"When you have a large debt buildup and a lot of excess capacity, that's not corrected very quickly,"
Lacy Hunt,"In Japan, for example, the debt deflation started in 1990 and price deflation started in 1992 or 1993. That's what we're in for right now."
Lacy Hunt,"When you have a large debt buildup and a lot of excess capacity, that's not corrected very quickly."
Lacy Hunt,"The ratio of corporate debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is at an all-time high, ... And we don't know exactly what corporate debt is because so much has been parked off the balance sheet and hidden. But, even without knowing what the off-balance-sheet debt is, corporations have too much."
Lacy Hunt,"The country is entering a period of debt deflation, where households and businesses are forced to move funds from spending to debt repayment. This forces down economic growth and reduces inflationary pressures and long-term interest rates."
Lacy Hunt,"The Fed was given control of margin lending in response to the excess speculation in the 1920s,"
Lamar Hunt,"He is the essence of sports in Kansas City and why there is a Truman Sports Complex and, frankly, why the two teams are there. He is and always will be a champion of all sports in Kansas City."
Lamar Hunt,I think the game has an enormous spectator appeal that dwarfs all American sports because it is so international.
Lamar Hunt,We're looking at ideas to remodel Arrowhead Stadium. It's 30 years old and it's not a good American soccer stadium. We're looking at ways to improve Arrowhead-which is oriented for NFL games--for our spectators.
Lamar Hunt,I'm a friend in the context that we helped fight a battle together for survival of the American Football League. But I don't consider myself close to Al in recent years. You just don't continually sue your business partners like he has.
Lamar Hunt,The equality of play was a surprise-it was the most competitive race in the seven-year history of MLS.
Lamar Hunt,It could tremendously augment what happens at Arrowhead Stadium and maybe create some other entertainment options at the sports complex when it's rolled off the stadium.
Lamar Hunt,"No two (stadiums) are going to be exactly alike, ... Each one will be part of the community, and that's another important factor. It's the type of identity we've not had before. It was hard to have that identity playing in the Cotton Bowl."
Lamar Hunt,I thought we disgraced this organization and certainly this community.
Lamar Hunt,That does make me proud. Those things help. They create awareness.
Lamar Hunt,He is not someone who went off to play in Europe and only a few Americans follow. He has the potential to be on magazine covers and more newspaper coverage.
Lamar Hunt,"The most difficult part of the trip was the logistics - planes, trains, a rental car, taxis, buses, subways, lots of walking, we did it all."
Lamar Hunt,I have no doubts that it will be a major sport-in the United States. I'm probably not going to live to see that day because Americans are a little afraid of getting interested in something at which they're not very good.
Lamar Hunt,"Well, we've made huge strides since the 1990 World Cup, USA '94, and obviously since '98. Unfortunately, those strides only register with the public once every four years."
Lamar Hunt,We literally had all 10 teams alive for a playoff position in the final week of the season. That outstanding balance and those close races created a major surge in attendance in the last month of the season.
Lamar Hunt,"I get asked this a lot: Why has soccer not succeeded? My answer is, soccer has succeeded. It is already the fastest growing youth participation sport in the U.S. It has already succeeded at the youth level, no question."
Lamar Hunt,The stadiums are like none I've ever seen. I think there must have been some strong competition nationally between Korea and Japan to make the best facilities because they are very well designed.
Lamar Hunt,"You can't compare a Super Bowl crowd, which tends to be more polite and a little more neutral to that. The Super Bowl only has 7,000 to 8,000 fans for each team."
Lamar Hunt,I'm really honored to receive this lifetime achievement award.
Lamar Hunt,"It gives us the ability to control all the revenue streams, ... It gives us the opportunity to sell a naming-rights sponsorship and signature sponsorships and control of our concessions, parking and scheduling, which is an important part of it. Instead of scrambling for secondary dates, we control the dates in the stadium."
Alex Hunter,"Football is the game I love, but everybody knows that your health comes first, ... In a way, it's been a blessing. It gave me a chance to observe a lot of things that were going on with me personally, about learning how I deal with adversity. And it gave me time to think about my future beyond football. Usually, when football season's going on, it's all about football."
Alex Hunter,"Under no circumstances will I, or any of my advisers, prosecutors, the law enforcement officers working on this case or the grand jurors discuss grand jury proceedings -- today or ever -- unless ordered by the court,"
Alex Hunter,"It's scary when you don't know what's going on with your body, ... I'm only 21. I'm used to having the time of my life, going out there and having fun, not worrying about anything."
Alex Hunter,"Every rock must be turned over, and if that means swabbing everyone's mouth or exhuming JonBenet's body, that's what the police will have to do, ... I don't want the public to think everything's been done, if in fact, in effect, everything hasn't been done."
Bob Hunter,"This is where it gets tricky, especially for inexperienced travelers who are making long-range plans. It might be worth it for a really expensive cruise that is non-refundable, for instance. It depends on your risk quotient and health."
Bob Hunter,"This is where it gets tricky, especially for inexperienced travelers who are making long-range plans, ... It might be worth it for a really expensive cruise that is non-refundable, for instance. It depends on your risk quotient and health."
Bob Hunter,Our research shows that you don't have to pay more to get good service. Some of the least-expensive companies have the best service.
Bob Hunter,"I think taxpayers will say we need to take care of people and we shouldn't walk away from people with insurance policies,"
Bob Hunter,"I'm proud of him. He does a good job. All the kids out here do good jobs, ... We try our best every year."
Bob Hunter,We just felt it was our duty to serve on the boards we serve on. We knew that we were elected to perform these duties.
Bob Hunter,"that in the vast majority of hurricanes, other than those in Florida in 2004, complaints are rife that FEMA has vastly underpaid hurricane victims. The Frances overpayments are questionable given the timing of the election and Florida's importance as a battleground state."
Bob Hunter,It's a good citizenship type of thing.
Bob Hunter,"We have enjoyed record attendance the past two years, and we believe that that trend will continue, based on advanced reservations. We had more than 600 people from 35 states, Canada and China participate in last year's three-day event, and we expect a larger and more diverse group this year. Despite our growing size, we remain the most accessible of the four major conferences. Our size allows us to attract the best speakers, yet gives everyone an opportunity to network in a relaxed atmosphere."
Bob Hunter,"You should call your insurance company and tell them, 'I've changed my driving behavior ? I've stopped driving to work' or, 'I'm using my car less,' and explain it to them and that you'd like to know if you qualify for a lower rate."
Bob Hunter,"The typical car in America is about $900 for insurance for one car. So, if you have a single car and you save 10 percent, that's $90, so it's worth a phone call."
Bob Hunter,"There has been a number of fatal car accidents and it needs to be controlled by a traffic signal,"
John Hunter,I can't believe they were trying to destroy our neighborhood. I am glad cooler heads prevailed.
John Hunter,We just know the government is one good resource.
John Hunter,"I think we kept focus on the reason we're here, the kids. I think the compromise you came up with still addresses the kids, and they'll come out the winners."
John Hunter,"We had every kind of audience you could name. Young, old, not-so-old, some older than old, some younger than young: they were there, they were there! There was everything."
John Hunter,Most animals are built to withstand one bad year.
John Hunter,"If they didn't have ten fights a night, it was a bad night."
Mark Hunter,"We hope (Kane and Montgomery) come here at some time, but we'll have to see,"
Mark Hunter,Until recently scientists measured changes in plant growth with simple tools rather like a ruler. Now you can essentially watch plant genes turn on and off. This gives us a much better idea of how the plant is responding to the insect's damage.
Mark Hunter,"Until recently scientists measured changes in plant growth with simple tools rather like a ruler, ... Now you can essentially watch plant genes turn on and off. This gives us a much better idea of how the plant is responding to the insect's damage."
Mark Hunter,There's no fear in his game.
Mark Hunter,"From where I sit, it [the consumer tech market] looks more like the fashion industry than grown-up ICT."
Mark Hunter,"Anything they want to do , all of their dreams and goals starts here and it's so important. So it's easy to talk about this."
Mark Hunter,"There is an ongoing conflict between 'whole organism' and 'molecular' approaches to studying insects. Friction has evolved because molecular biology is taking over a tremendous amount of resources, including funding and space within universities."
Mark Hunter,"We're looking for a place for Matthew to play. At the beginning of the year, we weren't sure if Adam would be back. Now, he's going to play most of the games and Steve will back him up."
Robert Hunter,I don't believe there's any evidence that credit scoring is a risk factor. What is it about someone having a worse credit score that makes them a worse driver? (Insurers) can't answer that.
Robert Hunter,"[The CFA found, for example, that consumers did not benefit from the merger of two insurers in the Maryland-D.C. area a few years ago.] The CFA's complaint ratio went up, ... We concluded the service got worse and prices went up."
Robert Hunter,"rock 'n' roll, jazz and traditional folk culture."
Robert Hunter,Being in a floodplain is like sitting down in a bathtub.
Robert Hunter,"At the top of the cycle you write policies for everybody, no matter how bad, and at the bottom you cancel everybody, no matter how good. It's a manic-depressive cycle."
Robert Hunter,I feel I've got 10 books in me.
Robert Hunter,"When you get ready to vote, make sure you know what you are doing."
Robert Hunter,"You who choose to lead must follow. But if you fall, you fall alone."
Robert Hunter,In wickedness of pride is lost the light to understand how little grace is earned and how much given.
Samuel Huntington,The founding fathers added the propositional dimension to American identity at the time of the Revolution. How else were they going to justify themselves in rebelling against the British monarchy?
Samuel Huntington,It was this society and culture that among other things - including economic opportunities here and repression in Europe - attracted subsequent generations of immigrants to this country.
Samuel Huntington,"Also, of course, for most of this time most Americans thought of America as a white country with, at best, only a very segregated and subordinate role for blacks."
Samuel Huntington,The other aspect of American identity worth focusing on is the concept of America as a nation of immigrants. That certainly is a partial truth. But it is often assumed to be the total truth.
Lamar Hurd,"I think for the most part we are ready. We are Pac-10 home ready, that's for sure. It's going to be a wait-and-see thing to see how we play on the road. It's going to be a great test for us against the Ducks to see how we play over there."
Lamar Hurd,"That's a game that has the most implications for the most importance in the state. We know what it means to us, and our fans. If you can't get up for that, you shouldn't be suited up for that game."
Lamar Hurd,"I feel it's better than when we came. You look at the circumstances (this season), there's a lot of things that had nothing to do with the coaches. Next year when people see the new team here and guys are healthy, then you'll see the product."
Lamar Hurd,"We are playing good basketball right now. It's hard to not be part of it. I felt like I was playing well, and I wanted to play better. I felt like I was able to give more, and now I'm not able to. The timing is as bad as it could get. But even with all those things, I'm a firm believer that things happen for a reason. I think something good is going to come out of it."
Mark Hurd,We've got a lot of stuff to go work on. You may not always like what we say ... but we will work exceedingly hard to deliver on commitments we set.
Mark Hurd,"I think you'll see us trying to be more precision-oriented in terms of who we partner with,"
Mark Hurd,"You talk about problems but there are a bunch of opportunities at the same time, ... I want to get underneath every piece of the business and will be focused on doing my best to optimize each part."
Mark Hurd,It wasn't what I would like it to be. I think we were spending a lot of money. We were building an architecture that was complicated. We had fragmented information.
Mark Hurd,"The better you perform, the more money you make. I won't tell you everybody's loved it."
Mark Hurd,"We are continuing to deliver on our plan to strengthen HP and better serve our customers. Growth was balanced across most of our businesses and geographies, cash flow was strong and we were disciplined in controlling costs. While hard work remains ahead of us, our efforts are starting to show results."
Mark Hurd,"We're trying to put more energy into our relationship. If you're a customer, the key message I want to you hear is you can sleep well tonight, knowing you've got tremendous energy, power and investment behind this."
Mark Hurd,"I'm aware of competition and have seen questions about strategy, structure and consistency. But I also see the potential with these businesses,"
Mark Hurd,"Lew cared deeply for H-P and its people, and his loss is being felt widely across our company. He was a natural leader who was enormously well liked and made an enduring impression on those he encountered."

Mark Hurd,"Lew cared deeply for HP and its people, and his loss is being felt widely across our company, ... He was a natural leader who was enormously well liked and made an enduring impression on those he encountered."
Mark Hurd,"It could be an issue for us, ... The message we get [from customers] is we like the company, we like the people, it's just that you're a tough company to do business with."
Mark Hurd,"The way he treated people and how he ran the company set an exceptionally high standard of personal decency,"
Mark Hurd,"We have to grow our company, invest and deal with competitive forces at the same time we need to be efficient on the cost side,"
Mark Hurd,"Lew cared deeply for HP and its people, and his loss is being felt widely across our company. He was a natural leader who was enormously well liked and made an enduring impression on those he encountered. The way he treated people and how he ran the company set an exceptionally high standard of personal decency."
Mark Hurd,"To make HP a great company once again, we need more than competitive costs and operational efficiency. We're in the process of assessing and refining our growth strategy, and the same concepts that were behind our operational changes will be at work here: simplicity, focus, alignment, and execution."
Mark Hurd,"You have all of our commitment to making HP an easier company to deal with,"
Mark Hurd,"We're not working on spinning off any part of the business. They give good leverage points across the company, which are of value."
Mark Hurd,"We look at the channel as a strategic advantage and not a strategic problem, We need you. We can't get to every buying point. And even when we get to every buying point, we can't bring every solution. We need your help."
Mark Hurd,"Lew cared deeply about HP and its people, and his loss is being felt widely across our company,"
Clint Hurdle,"His demeanor, his rhythm, the pace of game -- all of that is what you expect and what you need from your No. 1 starter. That's something he can bring every night, whether his best stuff's with him or not."
Clint Hurdle,"That's a very resilient victory. To be down twice. . . . These guys are just focused on playing the game, inning by inning, and getting the job done."
Clint Hurdle,"That was a very resilient victory,"
Clint Hurdle,"Like I said, we're going to have a good year. We have too much talent in that room to dream small."
Clint Hurdle,We're just seeing how healthy he is. He is still working his way back arm-strength wise. There might be a little bit more arm there as he continues to pitch. We've always liked him.
Clint Hurdle,"As a player, I was a quick-fix type guy, ... I wanted it now. The society we live in wants everything now. We're results-oriented. Well, I've come to understand that results are just that. And sometimes they come in their own time."
Clint Hurdle,He says he feels fine. We'll monitor it. He's going to get some rest.
Clint Hurdle,"That's been a redeeming quality, that he has been able to slow things down and been able to get an inning over with before it completely got out of hand. He said he has not been comfortable out of the stretch the last couple of games. I told him I didn't think he was lying. I told him either we have to find a way to make him comfortable or for him to not let any guys get on."
Clint Hurdle,He is a ballplayer. He takes a lot of pride in what he is asked to do. He is comfortable with who he is and the skills he has.
Clint Hurdle,"He's the best hitter in the league that nobody knows about, from my perspective. He's starting to get talked about more, but he's a real good hitter."
Clint Hurdle,I do believe we are in this position by showing patience and providing opportunities during the season. I don't want to take away from any momentum the team has gained.
Clint Hurdle,"My opinions, I'll keep to myself. The replay speaks for itself. We'll see how it unfolds."
Clint Hurdle,It's a memory for him.
Clint Hurdle,"It was kind of an oxymoron, me passing him in my Mitsubishi Montero. That used to tickle me."
Clint Hurdle,"There was some improvement, but we need some more improvement."
Clint Hurdle,I think there is improvement. More optimism maybe today than there was yesterday.
Clint Hurdle,"I think we've talked about it all -- his humility, his work ethic. He has a unique passion for the game. He leads by example. In the groups that he's been in, that's been talked about."
Clint Hurdle,"His humility, his work ethic and he has a unique passion for the game. And he's going to be what, 21 next month? So, he just needs to play, and we'll see how it works out. The beauty of any young player that can play is when they force your hand."
Clint Hurdle,"Obviously, we set the bar very high on the road, and we need to play better at home. We know that. When you don't pitch, hit or play defense, it's very difficult to win."
Clint Hurdle,The game's at home and you're tied. It's not a save situation. I thought (Fuentes) gave us the best shot to get to the ninth and score a run.
Clint Hurdle,I would hate anything to aggravate (the injury) this late in the season.
Clint Hurdle,You hate to keep tweaking things with him. You want to get in a position where he can just move forward. We know the raw skills he has. We have to turn those into game-day skills.
Clint Hurdle,"Having a winning record at home or avoiding finishing last weren't motivating factors for us. When you are 27 games under .500, can we really expect to be better at home?"
Clint Hurdle,He's our third baseman. We'll give him the freedom to play. We're not going to give him any power goals. We feel he's a good enough hitter and a smart enough hitter to be a good run producer.
Clint Hurdle,"In a perfect world, you bring young players into an environment (like Atlanta),"
Clint Hurdle,I enjoyed seeing the emotion. I enjoyed seeing that it hasn't become commonplace (for the Braves). They had an infusion of youth this year.
Clint Hurdle,He experienced every emotion. He pitches well at times. He learned to battle and survive at times. He didn't back down from anything. He carried his load.
Clint Hurdle,Some times the male ego gets in the way of a lot of things.
Clint Hurdle,"The fact is, Kim pitched without a fastball or command of it. That's usually a recipe for disaster in this park."
Clint Hurdle,"has hit the ball harder with more consistency than anyone on this ballclub. Anytime you have Todd Helton on your ballclub, that's something."
Clint Hurdle,"Communication and managing crisis, and I use that word loosely, that is gotten with experience. I just think it would be very difficult, and it's a very challenging situation to be in, to never have done it anywhere before and have to do it at this level."
Clint Hurdle,We're not messenger boys. We want to be delivery boys. We have to play and win games.
Clint Hurdle,"It's not an easy job, ... It's [easier] to look at things when they're not right and say who's to blame than when they're going right [and saying], 'Well, they're supposed to.' That's where I come into play, to look at what happens when things go right."
Clint Hurdle,I told him the beauty to this game is when you do well you don't go up. You stay around until you do lousy and then figure out how to do well again.
Clint Hurdle,You have to like what you see. His humility. His work ethic. His passion for the game. . . . The beauty of a young player is when they force your hand.
Clint Hurdle,What we need to do is play better baseball. And then there won't be a section closed down. There will be a section opened up.
Clint Hurdle,"Those are called shutdown innings. That's a big part of baseball. When you score, your opportunity to shut out the other team the next inning is there and you need to capitalize on them."
Clint Hurdle,"That was a pretty swing. That's a tremendously well-struck baseball today with wind blowing the way it was, hit over the scoreboard."
Clint Hurdle,These guys overcame adversity. They persevered through it all.
Clint Hurdle,"More can be learned from adversity than when everything good happens. They realize they were short in areas, went down to (Class AAA) Colorado Springs, addressed the shortcomings and came back."
Clint Hurdle,"Nothing provides an opportunity for growth more than adversity. They can handle it one of two ways: they can deal with it, become better from it, work through it. They can feel sorry for themselves and make a bad situation worse. So, it's all part of growing up and I expect them to handle it very professionally."
Clint Hurdle,"We're not looking to fiddle around too much, but they both have qualities that we can take advantage of."
Clint Hurdle,Danny is taking advantage of the opportunities that he's been given. He's provided some very good defensive stability behind home plate. His receiving and his blocking and his throwing has been a marked improvement over anything that we've really had here in a long time.
Clint Hurdle,"He painted himself in a corner and fought his way out. That showed some pitch ability. One, some fortitude, two, and some more gray hairs on the manager, three."
Clint Hurdle,"With the ability he has to hit the ball to all fields, in the fifth spot, he's very flexible and dangerous. When Holliday did miss, [Atkins] did a lot of cleaning up last year, and he takes a lot of pride in driving in runs."
Clint Hurdle,"He is completely healed, and with his ability we believe he'll keep improving. I believe that. He believes that, and his teammates believe in him."
Clint Hurdle,"Danny handles the staff extremely well. His defensive skills are second to none. And his ability to throw is as good as there is in our league. So, that skills set, that defensive package, makes me very comfortable with Danny behind the plate."
Clint Hurdle,It is something we have dealt with since Day 1. You can't recreate that environment. It's just the ability to go out there and slow the inning down as much as you can.
Clint Hurdle,"He showed us what we needed to see to have confidence in his ability to put him in the game at any time, at any place in the outfield or as part of the lineup."
Jim Hurley,"They're inches away and it's not worth getting hit. This [vehicle] is about 80,000 pounds when it's fully loaded."
Jim Hurley,"Insurance is about covering risk, and in Texas we have a lot of risk."
Jim Hurley,We're disappointed. We feel Allstate should have to pay the (additional living expense) claims. Other companies with similar types of policies have been paying their claims.
Sol Hurok,"If they're not temperamental, I don't want them. It's in the nature of a great artist to be that way."
Sol Hurok,"When people don't want to come, nothing will stop them."
Sol Hurok,"If I would be in this business for business, I wouldn't be in this business."
Sol Hurok,The sky's the limit if you have a roof over your head.
Saddam Hussein,Little progress was made in the solution of outstanding issues... The long list of proscribed items unaccounted for and as such resulting in unresolved disarmament issues was not shortened either by the inspections or by Iraqi declarations and documentation.
Saddam Hussein,We have been on a hunger strike for the past three days in protest of the treatment by you and your masters.
Saddam Hussein,For three days we have been holding a hunger strike protesting against your way in treating us â€” against you and your masters.
Saddam Hussein,"I don't harbor any hatred toward any of you,"
Saddam Hussein,Our enemy is not the American people. Our enemy is the American government which is destroying Iraq.
Saddam Hussein,"[Saying] every man or woman is a glory symbol of jihad holding the flag of God, ... hit them back and front so they stumble and lose control so they fall to your fire."
Saddam Hussein,"In the future, what would prevent a booby trapped car causing a nuclear explosion in Washington or a germ or a chemical one?"

Saddam Hussein,"We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We will not let evil triumph over virtue,"
Saddam Hussein,"We have said with certainty that the embargo will not be lifted by a Security Council resolution but will corrode by itself,"
Saddam Hussein,Why have you brought us here with force? Your authority gives you the right to try a defendant in absentia. Are you trying to overcome your own smallness?
Saddam Hussein,"You know me... If you are Iraqi, you know me."
Saddam Hussein,Who are you and what are you?... I need to know.
Saddam Hussein,"If you are Iraqi, you know who I am... and you know that I do not tire. I am the president of Iraq and I refuse to answer these questions because this court is illegitimate."
Saddam Hussein,I said I'm the president of Iraq... I did not say deposed.
Saddam Hussein,"I am not going to answer to this so-called court, out of respect for the truth and the will of the Iraqi people. I've said what I've said, and I'm not guilty."
Saddam Hussein,"I didn't say 'former president,' I said 'president,' and I have the constitutional rights according to the constitution, including immunity from prosecution."
Saddam Hussein,Those who fight in God's cause will be victorious.
Saddam Hussein,Allah is on our side. That is why we will beat the aggressor.
Saddam Hussein,"We are not intimidated by the size of the armies, or the type of hardware the US has brought."
Saddam Hussein,"I am not guilty, I am innocent."
Saddam Hussein,Remember the valiant Iraqi peasant and how he shot down an American Apache with an old weapon.
Saddam Hussein,"There is much to be said for having an experienced international jurist who is entirely unconnected with the allied invaders, on the tribunal."
Saddam Hussein,"We are ready to sacrifice our souls, our children and our families so as not to give up Iraq. We say this so no one will think that America is capable of breaking the will of the Iraqis with its weapons."
Saddam Hussein,"America needs wisdom, not force. It had used force, along with the West, to its extreme extent, only to find out later that it did not achieve what they wanted,"
Saddam Hussein,"[But the United States of America invaded Iraq and removed Saddam Hussein to] bring democracy and freedom and human rights to the Iraqi people. ... When you are the good guys, you've got to act like the good guys."
Saddam Hussein,"Do you know the pretext this time? (Washington) is saying that Iraq is threatening the American aircraft of aggression, which break through its air, trespassing upon its skies, sovereignty, land, people and wealth,"
Saddam Hussein,"After the course of the aggression 11 years ago, backed up by a continuous aggression till this day, our people will not be taken by surprise."
Saddam Hussein,"The military action (in Iraq) was gravely mistaken,"
Saddam Hussein,[Clinton also said military action] should always be the last resort ... unexpected consequences.
John Huston,"She fought her enemy, consciousness, with sedatives"
John Huston,"What to do when inspiration doesn't come; be careful not to spook, get the wind up, force things into position. You must wait around until the idea comes."
John Huston,"You walk through a series of arches, so to speak, and then, presently, at the end of a corridor, a door opens and you see backward through time, and you feel the flow of time, and realize you are only part of a great nameless procession."
John Huston,Hollywood has always been a cage... a cage to catch our dreams.
John Huston,I don't try to guess what a million people will like. It's hard enough to know what I like.
John Huston,"It's not color, it's like pouring 40 tablespoons of sugar water over a roast."
John Huston,The directing of a picture involves coming out of your individual loneliness and taking a controlling part in putting together a small world. A picture is made. You put a frame around it and move on. And one day you die. That is all there is to it.
John Huston,"After all, crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavor."
John Huston,"I prefer to think that God is not dead, just drunk."
Michael Hutchence,You know sometimes I just want to curl up on stage and lie there for a while - it's weird.
Michael Hutchence,We'd have to suck away at oxygen canisters between songs just so that we could keep playing.
Michael Hutchence,"We played every bar, party, pub, hotel lounge, church hall, mining town - places that made Mad Max territory look like a Japanese garden."
Michael Hutchence,"We always thought it strange that nobody was up on that stage playing soul stuff. Maybe people were playing it in their garages, like us, but they always reverted to pure rock when they got on stage."
Michael Hutchence,There's something intrinsically Australian about a bunch of brothers and school friends getting together as a band at a very young age and all pulling together as a band at a very young age and all pulling together as mates to make something happen.
Michael Hutchence,There's a certain point where you have to choose whether you're going to be a cliche or whether you're going to discover new things about yourself.

Michael Hutchence,I turn over a lot of money for a lot of people and I'm the smallest fish in it.
Michael Hutchence,I think there is a certain sensibility to someone you are attracted to and when it rubs off that's good.
Michael Hutchence,I still haven't come to grips with our success.
Michael Hutchence,"I manage to scrape together a private life, despite the press."
Michael Hutchence,I look at Jagger and the like and if I see a good attitude I'll admire it but I wouldn't copy their style.
Michael Hutchence,I know who I am and what I do.
Michael Hutchence,"I hate it when people lose it, there's nothing left because they're not interesting, they're boring, I hate it, and especially smack, people on smack are the most boring in the world."
Michael Hutchence,"I get pretty terrified, to be honest, when I'm on tour. You really have to muster a lot of ego to go our there, which I find rather draining."
Michael Hutchence,I don't think success arrives and you're suddenly happy. It's not like that. If people think that they'll be very disappointed.
Michael Hutchence,"I am of the belief that every couple thousand years someone comes along like Buddha and goes, hey this is what it is! And everybody goes Wow!"
Michael Hutchence,"Fame makes me feel wanted and loved, anybody wants that."
Michael Hutchence,Every actor I know wants to be a pop star.
Michael Hutchence,But we got up there and decided to stick to this mix of power chords and funk and that's where it really started for us. In having the courage to take that decision. To take a gamble not just with our music but our lives.
Michael Hutchence,"But then, you know, I'm very happy, I've got to this stage in my life and I'm not dead. I haven't got married and divorced and done all that palimony business, you know all that mess."
Michael Hutchence,"Actually, I find it embarrassing being a pop star. I prefer it when people just treat me like anybody else, although occasionally there is a side of me, which is indulgent and I expect certain things because of my position. It's one of the perks."
Michael Hutchence,Women are incredible in groups together. Terrifying. Men have nothing on them.
Aldous Huxley,Words from the thread on which we string our experiences.
Aldous Huxley,Words form the thread on which we string our experiences.
Aldous Huxley,"The business of a seer is to see; and if he involves himself in the kind of God-eclipsing activities which make seeing impossible, he betrays the trust which his fellows have tacitly placed in him."
Aldous Huxley,"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you mad"
Aldous Huxley,Silence is as full of potential wisdom and wit as the unshown marble of great sculpture. The silent bear no witness against themselves.
Aldous Huxley,"We are living now, not in the delicious intoxication induced by the early successes of science, but in a rather grisly morning-after, when it has become apparent that what triumphant science has done hitherto is to improve the means for achieving unimproved or actually deteriorated ends."
Aldous Huxley,"Morality is always the product of terror; its chains and strait-waistcoats are fashioned by those who dare not trust others, because they dare not trust themselves, to walk in liberty."
Aldous Huxley,Most human beings have an absolute and infinite capacity for taking things for granted
Aldous Huxley,It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one's life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than 'try to be a little kinder
Aldous Huxley,"Science and art are only too often a superior kind of dope, possessing this advantage over booze and morphia: that they can be indulged in with a good conscience and with the conviction that, in the process of indulging, one is leading the ''higher life.''"

Aldous Huxley,"Bondage is the life of personality, and for bondage the personal self will fight with tireless resourcefulness and the most stubborn cunning."
Aldous Huxley,"A child-like man is not a man whose development has been arrested; on the contrary, he is a man who has given himself a chance of continuing to develop long after most adults have muffled themselves in the cocoon of middle-aged habit and convention."
Aldous Huxley,Thought must be divided against itself before it can come to any knowledge of itself.
Aldous Huxley,"Your true traveller finds boredom rather agreeable than painful. It is the symbol of his liberty - his excessive freedom. He accepts his boredom, when it comes, not merely philosophically, but almost with pleasure."

Aldous Huxley,"The worst enemy of life, freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy; their second worst enemy is total efficiency."
Aldous Huxley,"The vast majority of human beings dislike and even actually dread all notions with which they are not familiar... Hence it comes about that at their first appearance innovators have generally been persecuted, and always derided as fools and madmen."

Aldous Huxley,"I can sympathise with people's pains, but not with their pleasures. There is something curiously boring about somebody else's happiness."

Aldous Huxley,We are all geniuses up to the age of ten.
Aldous Huxley,"I have discovered the most exciting, the most arduous literary form of all, the most difficult to master, the most pregnant in curious possibilities. I mean the advertisement. It is far easier to write ten passably effective Sonnets, good enough to take in the not too inquiring critic, than one effective advertisement that will take in a few thousand of the uncritical buying public."

Henry Hyde,"By their very nature, these kinds of crimes attack the integrity of the judicial system, ... Indeed, that's why they're crimes. To argue that in certain instances these crimes mean little is to say our judicial system means little. I reject that notion."
Henry Hyde,"What about the unborn? ... What about those who can't run away, who depend on our sense of humanity?"
Henry Hyde,I think that the House has a lot less enthusiasm for the U.N. than exists outside the House.
Henry Hyde,"I wish it never happened, ... I wish this sad chapter wasn't opened, but you have to do your duty, whether it's pleasant or whether it's onerous, and I think America needs some reassurance that people do have principles and do have a conscience and are going to vote their principles and their conscience."
Henry Hyde,"I wish to commend you for your vigorous defense of American values, including democracy and human rights, and for holding to account those who would threaten America's economic security through the systematic counterfeiting of our national currency."
Henry Hyde,"We are not confined to the Starr referral, ... That was the debate we had on the floor with the resolution that empowered us to review the material from the independent counsel. Mr. (Rick) Boucher (D-Virginia) and the Democrats wanted a very narrow scope. And we wanted a wider scope. And we prevailed. And so we are not bound by the parameters of the Starr referral."
