Rodney Eade,He's probably a 20 year old really as far as his development.
Rodney Eade,"I haven't had a chance to talk to the match committee or the board at this stage, but I would imagine Brad would take the captaincy."
Rodney Eade,He'll probably miss this week's practice match and then he'll be fine.
Rodney Eade,"People are saying we're playing very well at the moment but there are going to be up and down periods, it's not going to be plain sailing the whole time."
Rodney Eade,"People are saying we are going to benefit from the new rules the most, but Lindsay mightn't be close enough to take advantage of the quick kick-in. We might lose an advantage there."
Rodney Eade,"He's pain-free so we're fairly confident that he'll certainly be right by the first round, but hopefully be able to get one or two practice matches in."
Rodney Eade,We see him hopefully as a 200-game player for the Bulldogs and a future leader for us as well.
Rodney Eade,"I'm not to sure about the figure, but there's no doubt when you look at the premier who gets $250,000 and the night premier gets about $220,000 which is about the same - (it) seems like a bit of an inequity."
Rodney Eade,People are dancing at shadows. I can't believe people are worried so much about kick-ins.
Lawrence Eagles,"There is clearly a risk that this is going to happen, however small that risk may be,"
Lawrence Eagles,It has to be put into perspective. We have strategic stocks which can obviously be used very quickly indeed if necessary.
Lawrence Eagles,"There were a few signs overnight that, although clearly tensions are rising, there is a window of opportunity for some peace settlement over the next three days."
Lawrence Eagles,"As we go forward, geopolitical issues won't go away over night, but we wouldn't have got to oil at $60 plus without a lot of other factors."
Lawrence Eagles,Demand is still strong within China but growth was exceptionally strong last year. That year-on-year growth is narrower is not a surprise.
Lawrence Eagles,"Recently a former aid, giving evidence against him, said he was running short of funds. Therefore, if he was the instigator of the attacks on the US, another sponsor was likely to be involved."
Lawrence Eagles,The U.S. will respond to this attack in some fashion and there remains a small fear that it may lose some Middle Eastern support as a result.
Lawrence Eagles,"While gasoline was clearly the main driving force behind the market on Friday, there is little doubt that the Middle East tension also provides some upside momentum for crude."
Lawrence Eagles,"Under normal circumstances, it would be far too soon for OPEC to consider raising production, but these are exceptional circumstances,"
Lawrence Eagles,"Indeed, even if OPEC is not bothered about helping America per say, economic considerations make a lower price as sensible option."
Lawrence Eagles,"Indeed, even if OPEC is not bothered about helping America per say, economic considerations make a lower price as sensible option,"
Lawrence Eagles,"[Describing the Saudi action as a] totally shocking move ... The Saudis are stamping their authority on the world oil market, but at the expense of relations within the cartel and the Middle East."
Terry Eagleton,"Literature transforms and intensifies ordinary language, deviates systematically from everyday speech. If you approach me at a bus stop and murmur ''Thou still unravished bride of quietness,'' then I am instantly aware that I am in the presence of the literary."
Terry Eagleton,Deconstruction insists not that truth is illusory but that it is institutional.
Terry Eagleton,Postmodernism is among other things a sick joke at the expense of revolutionary avant-gardism.
Terry Eagleton,"Readers are less and less seen as mere non-writers, the subhuman ''other'' or flawed derivative of the author; the lack of a pen is no longer a shameful mark of secondary status but a positively enabling space, just as within every writer can be seen to lurk, as a repressed but contaminating antithesis, a reader."
Charles Eames,"We work because it's a chain reaction, each subject leads to the next."
Charles Eames,The real questions are: Does it solve a problem? Is it serviceable? How is it going to look in ten years?
Charles Eames,It makes me feel guilty that anybody should have such a good time doing what they are supposed to do.
Charles Eames,"It is not easy to do something good, but it is extremely difficult to do something bad."
Charles Eames,It is almost impossible to reconcile self expression with the creative act.
Charles Eames,In architecture the idea degenerated. Design allows a more direct and pleasurable route.
Charles Eames,Ideas are cheap. Always be passionate about ideas and communicating those ideas and discoveries to others in the things you make.
Charles Eames,"Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se."
Charles Eames,"Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely and to the best of your ability and that way you might change the world."
Charles Eames,"Art resides in the quality of doing, process is not magic."
Charles Eames,"The details are details. They make the product. The connections, the connections, the connections. It will in the end be these details that give the product its life."
Charles Eames,The details are not the details. They make the design.
Charles Eames,Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.
Charles Eames,Who ever said that pleasure wasn't functional?
Charles Eames,"To whom does design address itself: to the greatest number, to the specialist of an enlightened matter, to a privileged social class? Design addresses itself to the need."
Charles Eames,Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design.
Steve Earle,"If they're as committed to mine safety as they say they are, then they need to incorporate these things into their bill. These are things that shouldn't be argued over."
Steve Earle,The Revolution Starts Now
Steve Earle,It was kind of crazy luck that it was me with the device and two nurses that were three of the first four on the scene.
Steve Earle,"The play's about forgiveness,"
Steve Earle,"Sonnets are guys writing in English, imitating an Italian song form. It was a form definitely sung as often as it was recited."
Steve Earle,"Me, I'm spiritually retarded, I need to be knee deep in water with a fly rod in my hands, that's about as close to God as I get."
Steve Earle,"If there is such a thing as a workaholic, I'm it, and that's what passes for leisure."
Steve Earle,"If I can get Me out of the way, I can do anything."
Steve Earle,I think the criticism that I take to heart is from other writers that I respect.
Steve Earle,I don't usually read reviews.
Steve Earle,I don't really think in terms of obstacles. My biggest obstacle is always myself.
Steve Earle,"Actually, in its purest form, Islam is incredibly tolerant. That makes what's going on in the world really bizarre."
Steve Earle,"Before, I recorded in specific blocks of time. That's changed. Now everything revolves around making music for me. And it feels good."
Steve Earle,You see things differently at 40 than you do at 31. Especially if you got to 40 the way I did.
Steve Earle,Townes van Zandt is the best songwriter in the whole world and I'll stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that.
Dale Earnhardt,He and I had a really great working relationship. He knew what he wanted and he knew what we had accomplished. He wanted to be with us and we wanted him to be there.
Dale Earnhardt,"You've got to be closer to the edge than ever to win. That means sometimes you go over the edge, and I don't mean driving, either."
Dale Earnhardt,"With 20 top-10 finishes, I feel we're on the right path."
Dale Earnhardt,"When he was young, I told Dale Jr. that hunting and racing are a lot alike. Holding that steering wheel and holding that rifle both mean you better be responsible."
Dale Earnhardt,Two of my favorite things are my steering wheel and my Remington rifle.
Dale Earnhardt,"To come in and win three races already this year and maybe set a record by winning four is pretty unique. But guys like Mark Martin, Rusty Wallace and these guys are not wanting that to happen."
Dale Earnhardt,"The thing about it is, all those races we lost, we won this race together. We won it as a team."
Dale Earnhardt,The atmosphere seems to change once the sun goes down and the race fans get to watch a good show.
Dale Earnhardt,"That's what we're striving for, making us a contender in every race."
Dale Earnhardt,That strategy of racing for the top five and racing for the win is where everybody wants to be.
Dale Earnhardt,Richard Childress and myself have made some important innovations on our cars.
Dale Earnhardt,People are going to get older and young guys are going to come in and race and get more competitive.
Dale Earnhardt,Maybe now that we have the same sponsor in Remington we can spend some time together outdoors.
Dale Earnhardt,"It's just really hard to work and get better, building and planning for the future with the new Monte Carlo and keeping the race team intact and keeping them healthy."
Dale Earnhardt,If we're going to run for points we need to run in the top-five every week.
Dale Earnhardt,"If I was 30th in points and not making races and not being competitive in races, I could understand them saying I'm over-the-hill or I'm ready to quit or whatever."
Dale Earnhardt,I've never won the Daytona 500 before.
Dale Earnhardt,I've had confidence in myself all along. It was just a matter of getting the pieces back in place.
Dale Earnhardt,I've got to win every race.
Dale Earnhardt,I'm racing for the wins and racing up front and finishing in the top 10. It's puzzling to me how you can judge a driver on that.
Dale Earnhardt,"I woke up this morning, and I still don't believe I won the Daytona 500."
Dale Earnhardt,I want to be up front racing.
Dale Earnhardt,I started 20 years without missing a race and ESPN started broadcasting on the air waves.
Dale Earnhardt,"I see it on pit road when we make better pit stops and that comes from harder work back at the shop, practicing, testing, trying to get better."
Dale Earnhardt,I enjoy Saturday night racing.
Dale Earnhardt,I don't want to argue with my wife about her car - or my driving.
Dale Earnhardt,"Finishing races is important, but racing is more important."
Dale Earnhardt,"But I'm good to go through my contract with Childress, and my determination is to win races and try to win that other championship."
Dale Earnhardt,"As a GM Goodwrench Service Plus dealer, I understand how good service makes a difference to our customers."
Dale Earnhardt,Second Place is just the first place loser.
Dale Earnhardt,You can't let one bad moment spoil a bunch of good ones.
Dale Earnhardt,"You win some, lose some, and wreck some."
Dale Earnhardt,It's a never ending battle of making your cars better and also trying to be better yourself.
Norm Eash,"A lot of those kids have been playing for two years. It's not going to be a senior-dominated squad, but we have that experience."
Norm Eash,"We're a little thin right now. Losing Adam Bohr really hurt us offensively against Simpson. Marcus' injury is more of a nagging, pain-tolerance type of injury. As a coach you have to make a decision as to when he becomes ineffective. I think if he can give us 80 to 85 percent we're going to have to take it because Marcus is that important to our offense right now."
Norm Eash,I think we can run and get to the football. Last year five of the seven games we lost we were ahead. The defense has to stop people and keep teams out of the end zone.
Norm Eash,"People are going to feel better about the defeat just from what we were able to do at the end. That showed people we can move the football when we need to. We have to build upon that and stay positive, stay focused and stay together."
Norm Eash,"Anytime you lose you're disappointed, but I'm really proud of the way we played. It showed a lot of character about our football team. We just have to get better and improve this week."
Gregg Easterbrook,"You know, some of the good part of blog theory was that blogs would be like diaries that the world could read. They would be spontaneous, whatever pops into your mind, as a diary would be."
Gregg Easterbrook,"The publication date of that book was Sept. 10, 2001. That's why nobody's ever heard of it. Maybe I'll do another one in the future someday."
Gregg Easterbrook,Playing football is obviously very strenuous. It's exhausting. You have to try very hard in football. But there's no heroic risk involved.
Gregg Easterbrook,"Now, for pure bloggers, for individual people who are just posting their own thoughts, they would still run the same risk of saying something wrong or embarrassing, but they wouldn't harm their institutions by doing so."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Neither Aristotle nor the Framers were known for self-indulgence. All believed that happiness is a legitimate goal in life; perhaps, one of the reasons we are here."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Jewish persecution is a historical memory of the present generation and people fear it in the present day, and that's why those references are so much more powerful. I just understand that better now."
Gregg Easterbrook,"It was Orwellian. I completely disappeared, and disappeared the same day. It was by early that evening when the Times story ran. That was an overreaction. All human beings under pressure behave poorly."
Gregg Easterbrook,"It was actually a very nice little book done by a gift book company. They illustrated it with pictures from 1920s football, before there were face guards."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Inevitably, these sorts of things are going to come back to blow up in people's faces."
Gregg Easterbrook,"I'm working seven days a week in the fall. I couldn't possibly keep that up. This is only for the fall. In the last couple of years I've tended to do most of my serious writing in the winter, when there's nothing going on with football."
Gregg Easterbrook,"I'm a smart guy, I know the history of this issue and why people care about it."
Gregg Easterbrook,"I would guess that at the very least that all blogs that are affiliated with an organization are going to be edited, if they're not already."
Gregg Easterbrook,"I view the players as entertainers. Their job is to entertain you, and although an Arizona Cardinals game might not have that effect, most of them do."
Gregg Easterbrook,"I think they completely overreacted by firing me, but in my mind I think this coming a month after Rush Limbaugh had a lot to do with it."
Gregg Easterbrook,I think the thing that I most appreciate now is that stereotypes involving Jewish identity activate fears of persecution that exist in the present day.
Gregg Easterbrook,"I think that might have been an element in it, and people have asked me that very thing. Remember, Disney is the majority shareholder, but it is not an operating division of Disney."
Gregg Easterbrook,"I think professional sports, football, to use it as an example, it's fundamentally a form of entertainment."
Gregg Easterbrook,I don't think there are many larger lessons to be found in sports.
Gregg Easterbrook,I didn't view myself as attacking the boss. I viewed my boss at ESPN as the publisher and president of ESPN.
Gregg Easterbrook,"I behaved poorly by starting this whole thing and I made some mistakes in dealing with it, and they made some mistakes in dealing with me, and taking down all my stuff was probably one of them."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Heroic people take risks to themselves to help others. There's nothing heroic about accepting $5 million to go out and run around chasing a ball, although you may show fortitude or those other qualities while you do it."
Gregg Easterbrook,"For what I wrote that started this whole controversy, I deserved to be criticized, and I felt bad about writing it. I felt bad mainly as a writer and a thinker."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Even though Rush is not me and the situations were very different, I think, in the Rush Limbaugh thing, ESPN was criticized for not acting, and you remember that after a couple days of controversy over Rush."
Gregg Easterbrook,"ESPN has said that they fired me without having been told to do so by Disney, and I actually believe that. I think they did it on their own."
Gregg Easterbrook,But if you could make that mistake and press the send button and the entire world sees it forever.
Gregg Easterbrook,"But by showing us live coverage of every bad thing happening everywhere in the world, cable news makes life seem like it's just an endless string of disasters - when, for most people in most places today, life is fairly good."
Gregg Easterbrook,And then ESPN fired me. I did not think that was a fitting punishment.
Gregg Easterbrook,"And if there was something, suppose I wanted to write something really damning or embarrassing about one of the owners, that would really be a problem on the NFL's site."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Torture numbers, and they'll confess to anything."
Gregg Easterbrook,"Everyone needs a certain amount of money. Beyond that, we pursue money because we know how to obtain it. We don't necessarily know how to obtain happiness."
George Eastman,"You push the button, we do the rest."
George Eastman,What we do during our working hours determines what we have; what we do in our leisure hours determines what we are.
George Eastman,"Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light. Know it for all you are worth, and you will know the key to photography."
John Eastman,"We don't really worry about who we are playing,"
John Eastman,"We went above and beyond. We're required to notify all neighbors, but we notified everyone in that township range because of our experience in the initial review. We notified everyone in Milner and everyone in Saddle Mountain Estates. So far, we haven't received any comments."
John Eastman,"We are going to treat it as a normal week just like any other game. Obviously, our kids know it's homecoming, but as a football team, we haven't even talked about it."
John Eastman,"All are very strong judges. The one who's probably best prepared for the role of state Supreme Court justice is Vance Raye. The others are highly regarded. Morrison England is a relatively recent appointment to a court. For him, a little more time on the bench would be useful."
John Eastman,If he wants to give her judicial experience why doesn't he nominate her to the Fifth Circuit (Court of Appeals)?
John Eastman,We would best honor Chief Justice RehnquistÃ¢s memory and legacy by getting back to his project of restoring constitutionalism. That means enforcing the limits on government that are clearly in the Constitution and not making up and enforcing rights that are not in the Constitution.
Clint Eastwood,They say marriages are made in Heaven. But so is thunder and lightning.
Clint Eastwood,There's only one way to have a happy marriage and as soon as I learn what it is I'll get married again.
Clint Eastwood,"He played the tour because he loved the game, but he loved to play percentage golf,'' Miller said."
Clint Eastwood,"Harry Callahan: I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya punk?"
Clint Eastwood,"Politicians have to make unpopular decisions. Schwarzenegger is going to understand the nature of his job. I wish him good luck, he's going to need it. It's going to be difficult for him."
Clint Eastwood,"Hollywood, as everyone knows, glamorizes physical courage. . . . if I had to define courage myself, I wouldn't say it's about shooting people. I'd say it's the quality that stimulates people, that enables them to move ahead and look beyond themselves."
Clint Eastwood,Ten Million Dollar Baby.
Clint Eastwood,"Go ahead, make my day."
Clint Eastwood,"Half of them are suicides or accidents, Martha. Don't exaggerate."
Clint Eastwood,Men must know their limitations.
Adam Eaton,"The arm strength and stamina's there. I felt good in the sixth inning, made some good pitches and got them 1-2-3. It's definitely nice to go out there in the sixth and put up a zero."
Adam Eaton,"Toward the end of September, the finger was pretty much gone from the mind, and pitches were starting to come back to where they were. I felt good about going into the postseason, but obviously came up short."
Adam Eaton,"I'd been waiting a few years to get to that point, put a bunch of hard work in. Seeing the fruits of my labor pay off the way they were and just having kind of a freak injury prevent that from continuing was frustrating."
Adam Eaton,"You play 162 games, get to the playoffs and not perform the way you want to. We're just frustrated more than anything."
Adam Eaton,"I still haven't been able to find a baseball player who has had this. You think about elbows, shoulders, ankles, knees, but this is definitely a different thing."
Adam Eaton,"Just one statement would be: missed opportunities. We didn't get that one big hit, that stolen base or take advantage of a mental mistake they made. It's just frustrating, more than anything."
Mark Eaton,"I said a few words to them, but I'm not going to call myself Rudy or anything. I played there, so those guys can see that they're not too far from reaching their goals. If I can be any kind of inspiration to them, that'd be great."
Mark Eaton,We had a lot of quality chances and we all thought it was just a matter of time. (Anderson) had been playing well against us and we talked about just getting people in front of him.
Mark Eaton,"The thing that makes it difficult is that every team in this league has a lot of pride. If you see that a team has beaten you the last three or four games, a sense of pride takes over and you say, 'Enough is enough.' It's like what we did earlier this season against Los Angeles."
Mark Eaton,"We tried to learn from our mistakes (Monday). Their success comes from their defensemen shooting the puck and the guy in front not allowing the goalie to catch the puck cleanly. If they shot the puck, we wanted it to be from the outside or the boards."
Mark Eaton,"The losing is coming at a bad time. We have to figure out a way to win games. It doesn't have to be pretty, but we have to win."
Mark Eaton,"We're the fourth-seeded team, so we know we're going to have to win a few road games. Now is as good a time as any. This is an important game. We'd like to win both games, but we want to get at least one."
Mark Eaton,It was fun and it brought back good memories. I probably hadn't swung a bat in five years and I'd never used a wooden bat.
Shirin Ebadi,"The condition of women in Islamic societies as a whole is also far from desirable. However, we should acknowledge that there are differences. In certain countries, the conditions are much better and in others much worse."
Shirin Ebadi,I maintain that nothing useful and lasting can emerge from violence.
Shirin Ebadi,I hope the example of Saddam Hussein will give a lesson to leaders of other countries where human rights are not respected.
Shirin Ebadi,"Democracy doesn't recognize east or west; democracy is simply people's will. Therefore, I do not acknowledge that there are various models of democracy; there is just democracy itself."
Shirin Ebadi,"Women are the victims of this patriarchal culture, but they are also its carriers. Let us keep in mind that every oppressive man was raised in the confines of his mother's home."
Shirin Ebadi,"No American soldier should be allowed to se t foot on Iranian soil, regardless of the criticism we have of the Iranian government."
Abba Eban,"Lest Arab governments be tempted out of sheer routine to rush into impulsive rejection, let me suggest that tragedy is not what men suffer but what they miss."
Abba Eban,Consensus is what many people say in chorus but do not believe as individuals.
Abba Eban,Men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all the other alternatives.
Abba Eban,His ignorance is encyclopedic
Abba Eban,History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all other alternatives.
Isabelle Eberhardt,"I am full of the sorrow that goes with changes in surroundings, those successive stages of annihilation that slowly lead to the great and final void."
Isabelle Eberhardt,One must never look for happiness: one meets it by the way
Isabelle Eberhardt,One must never look for happiness:  one meets it by the way
Isabelle Eberhardt,"For those who know the value of and exquisite taste of solitary freedom (for one is only free when alone), the act of leaving is the bravest and most beautiful of all."
Isabelle Eberhardt,"The farther behind I leave the past, the closer I am to forging my own character"
Buddy Ebsen,Use it or lose it. I'm using what's left of my mind and I enjoy it very much and it seems to keep my mind productive.
Buddy Ebsen,"Writing fiction, there are no limits to what you write as long as it increases the value of the paper you are writing on."
Buddy Ebsen,I had a mother who taught me there is no such thing as failure. It is just a temporary postponement of success.
Robert Eckert,"Third quarter results are disappointing as sales increases in much of our portfolio were offset by declines in the Barbie brand,"
Robert Eckert,Today is a major step in cleaning up the past. This is a plan that will enable us to leverage our core brands and increase cash flow. I still believe the basic foundation of this enterprise -- our core brands -- is sound and has the opportunity to be as successful as ever.
Robert Eckert,"Based on retail sell-through, we expect to see an improvement in international sales during the second half of the year,"
Aaron Eckhart,"It's mostly done with smiles and being very enthusiastic. No matter what you're saying, if you're doing it in a likable enough way, they'll forgive you."
Aaron Eckhart,"For Nick, the game, basically, is convincing people. It's getting people to look at things your way. That's the big game in life, and that's what he's teaching his son. That's what he and his friends talk about when they get together. He's not defending cigarettes so much as he's defending his right to defend cigarettes."
Aaron Eckhart,"I think people could come out of this movie thinking, although all of these are very serious subjects, (political) spin is very serious because the truth is more important than the spin. But sometimes spin becomes the truth, or that's the perception."
Aaron Eckhart,He came prepared to play. He fulfilled the author's intention. It's his movie. He's the man in it.
Aaron Eckhart,"All these people are so firm on their positions. That's where the humor in the movie comes from, ... It's like the debate team. Nothing is rooted, everything is malleable. As soon as you start to hate what Nick Naylor is saying, then you have a senator saying the same thing. Everybody is complicit; whatever their cause is, they all have unethical thoughts. It just shows that we're all just out there trying to ply our trade."
Aaron Eckhart,"the highest regard you can receive. That photo can describe an entire life, just an honor, as well as a fun moment."
Aaron Eckhart,"Audiences like both savory and unsavory characters, and [even] unsavory elements can be attractive. It all depends on how passionate you are about playing them."
Meister Eckhart,"[...] Cause in eternity there's no yesterday or tomorrow, but only Now."
Meister Eckhart,"It is a fair trade and an equal exchange: to the extent that you depart from things, thus far, no more and no less, God enters into you with all that is his, as far as you have stripped yourself of yourself in all things. It is here that you should b"
Meister Eckhart,"Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than time: and not only time but temporalities, not only temporal things but temporal affections, not only temporal affections but the very taint and smell of time."
Meister Eckhart,"You must learn an inner solitude, wherever or with whomsoever you may be. You must learn to penetrate things and find God there, to get a strong impression of God firmly fixed in your mind."
Meister Eckhart,"If you seek the kernel, then you must break the shell. An likewise, if you would know the reality of Nature, you must destroy the appearance, and the farther you go beyond the appearance, the nearer you will be to the essence."
Meister Eckhart,"To be sure, this requires effort and love, a careful cultivation of the spiritual life, and a watchful, honest, active oversight of all one's mental attitudes towards things and people. It is not to be learned by world-flight, running away from things, turning solitary and going apart from the world. Rather, one must learn an inner solitude, where or with whomsoever he may be. He must learn to penetrate things and find God there, to get a strong impression of God firmly fixed on his mind."
Meister Eckhart,"Godâ€™s gifts are meted out according to the taker, not according to the giver."
Meister Eckhart,"There exists only the present instant... a Now which always and without end is itself new. There is no yesterday nor any tomorrow, but only Now, as it was a thousand years ago and as it will be a thousand years hence."
Meister Eckhart,"God expects but one thing of you, and that is that you should come out of yourself in so far as you are a created being made and let God be God in you."
Meister Eckhart,Every creature is a word of God.
Meister Eckhart,"If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough."
Meister Eckhart,"If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, thank you, that would suffice."
Meister Eckhart,"We are celebrating the feast of the Eternal Birth which God the Father has borne and never ceases to bear in all eternity... But if it takes not place in me, what avails it? Everything lies in this, that it should take place in me."
Meister Eckhart,"Truly, it is in darkness that one finds the light, so when we are in sorrow, then this light is nearest of all to us."
Meister Eckhart,"One person who has mastered life is better than a thousand persons who have mastered only the contents of books, but no one can get anything out of life without God."
Meister Eckhart,"When you are thwarted, it is your own attitude that is out of order."
Meister Eckhart,"What we plant in the soil of contemplation, we shall reap in the harvest of action."
Meister Eckhart,Words derive their power from the original word.
Meister Eckhart,All God wants of man is a peaceful heart.
Meister Eckhart,"A human being has so many skins inside, covering the depths of the heart. We know so many things, but we don't know ourselves! Why, thirty or forty skins or hides, as thick and hard as an ox's or bear's, cover the soul. Go into your own ground and learn to know yourself there."
Meister Eckhart,To be full of things is to be empty of God. To be empty of things is to be full of God.
Meister Eckhart,"The knower and the known are one. Simple people imagine that they should see God as if he stood there and they here. This is not so. God and I, we are one in knowledge."
Meister Eckhart,The more we have the less we own.
Meister Eckhart,"Man goes far away or near but God never goes far-off; he is always standing close at hand, and even if he cannot stay within he goes no further than the door."
Meister Eckhart,A just person is one who is conformed and transformed into justice.

Meister Eckhart,Do exactly what you would do if you felt most secure.
Meister Eckhart,If God gave the soul his whole creation she would not be filled thereby but only with himself.

Meister Eckhart,God is at home; it is we who have gone for a walk.

Marc Ecko,"We knew this was worth fighting for, and clearly the mayor must have been misinformed. I can't wait until Wednesday."
Marc Ecko,Producing a game that encompasses such originality and innovation has been an incredible experience and we are very excited to unveil Getting Up. This tour is our way to celebrate its launch and say thanks to all of our supporters.
Marc Ecko,"This is not intended as a how-to, ... This is a pop culture moment, not a criminal activity."
Marc Ecko,"We are, as we have for nearly 10 months, continuing our dialogue with the proper authorities to reach a mutually agreed upon means of hosting this event on August 24th as planned, ...

David Eckstein,"When you have a guy like (Pujols) who every single night comes out and with the lineups we've had has the average he has, the homers he has, the RBIs he has ... and plays defense the way he plays defense, that's (the MVP). It's not even a question."
David Eckstein,"I know that at some point in time it's going to be on. I love it, it's one of my favorite plays."
David Eckstein,"When my sister has the two kids (and) the two of them look like they're going to have the same problem in life, it just is like, `Yeah, this can end now, ... But there are so many worse things that could happen."

David Eckstein,Those guys are stepping up big when we lose key guys. They have stepped in and done unbelievable jobs.
David Eckstein,"I hope not. Because if it does, you're in trouble. He's got some great stuff."
David Eckstein,We expected to win. I didn't even pack anything (Wednesday) or make any plans for getting home because I thought we would win tonight.
David Eckstein,"We held home field advantage. One thing we've got to do, we've got to stay aggressive. We can't wait to get over there."
David Eckstein,"The way Jimmy [Edmonds] hit the home run in Game 6, and making the catch he made in Game 7 -- it just seemed like every one of those games was so intense. Home-field advantage was a real key, so you definitely have to be ready to play."
David Eckstein,We have a couple of guys capable of hitting a lot of home runs that haven't yet.
David Eckstein,"Last year had a lot of tradition and a lot of history and now we're opening up something new -- and it's beautiful. It's a new era of baseball. You definitely miss the old stadium, but now you have something as beautiful as this. You're kind of torn between them both."
David Eckstein,"He's a Gold Glover,"
David Eckstein,That could come down to a 1-0 game with those guys on the mound. So it was very key for us to go out there and get some runs early.
David Eckstein,Scott's a hard-nosed guy who really understands and loves playing the game.
David Eckstein,"It's fun,"
David Eckstein,It never gets old having the opportunity to throw some champagne. This is so much fun.
David Eckstein,"It's pretty loud. The whole game, there's like a buzz going through (the stands). It's nice, it was fun going out there."
David Eckstein,"I feel very confident with two strikes. I feel it's more of a freedom. I get very upset with myself if I make an out on a bad pitch before two strikes. With two strikes, it's all out the window. I feel free."
David Eckstein,I feel almost like a freedom. You get to swing at a pitch no matter where it is. I love it.
David Eckstein,"How many little kids are out there fighting because they know David did it? ... A lot of people have said to me that we are an inspiration. . . . People say, `How do you do it?' What choice do I have? You get up and go."

David Eckstein,"It was one of those things where we definitely wanted a family friend, ... We didn't want someone from too far outside the family, because sometimes you might not know what the intentions behind it are. With Lorie, she's a great friend to our family, as well as a great person. We've known her a long time. It was perfect."
David Eckstein,"On paper, we have more talent [than 2002]. Without a doubt. And we have more experience now, because we've done it before. But it's a long season."
David Eckstein,"Without a doubt, ... His location was unbelievable. You watch the film and he throws the ball up a lot, but today he was throwing the ball down, right at the knees, on the corners. He did a fantastic job tonight."
David Eckstein,"I was in complete control. I knew what I was saying. I had a meaning behind it,"
David Eckstein,"Having gone through this other times, I have full confidence in the surgery. Actually, it'll probably be a day of joy. Because my dad will get a lot of his freedom back."
David Eckstein,"Watch this. Froze him like you wouldn't believe. Definitely, he has not just a fastball."
David Eckstein,"I told them baseball owed them nothing and wasn't a fair game. I emphasized what a privilege that it is to wear a uniform every day. I challenged them to do something to earn and deserve the right to wear a uniform. I warned them that if they didn't, they might not be wearing one."
David Eckstein,It's one of those things. Baseball is a funny game. Every club can beat any club. They come out and play great against us. It's hard to believe to see where they're standing. They've got a great club.
David Eckstein,I've hit balls with everything I've got and it doesn't go over the fence. So I definitely run hard. I'll never have the opportunity to sit there and watch one as it goes out because I don't have that kind of pop.
David Eckstein,"By starting up the action with the hit-and-run and making him swing the bat and try to hit the ball to the right side, that might have gotten him going. It takes a little while, but his swing looked a lot better tonight."

Umberto Eco,"The ideology of this America wants to establish reassurance through Imitation. But profit defeats ideology, because the consumers want to be thrilled not only by the guarantee of the Good but also by the shudder of the Bad."
Umberto Eco,"There is a constant in the average American imagination and taste, for which the past must be preserved and celebrated in full-scale authentic copy; a philosophy of immortality as duplication. It dominates the relation with the self, with the past, not infrequently with the present, always with History and, even, with the European tradition."

Ric Edelman,"we have gone through a lot in the past couple of years with budget and other problems, but they are behind us and I see a higher level of excitement this year than in the past. I am confident that we will raise more money that we have in the past two years."
Ric Edelman,"With that money sitting in your pocket, all of a sudden you're going to buy more expensive wines at dinner, take a carriage ride and ogle at some glorious thing in a window,"
Ric Edelman,"Never again will you have 200-to-250 people giving you lump sums of money. Consider this a jumpstart on your future. It can help you buy a house sooner than you would have been able to or enable you to avoid the risks of incurring debt as you're starting out. This can give you a huge head start on your goal of building a strong financial foundation, which is the exact reason they gave it to you."

Randy Edsall,We won't have to worry about that this week.
Randy Edsall,There has to be a whole revamping of recruiting because of technology.
Randy Edsall,"They're all pretty excited about it, but they also understand the practice squad can be a week-to-week thing,"
Randy Edsall,Shane has got a tremendous passion to be a pilot. It's not something that he could do here from an academic standpoint so he's going to be going down there because he wants to be a corporate pilot. I told him that when he gets his license we'll rent a corporate jet and he can fly me around or something.
Randy Edsall,"He's demonstrated to me to have the best work ethic. He has the most passion of the next best tackle that I think we have on our team. He has the size, the strength and the athletic ability we're looking for. I just felt as we head into spring that he's going to line up there. It's based on what he's done and what other guys didn't do."
Randy Edsall,Dan made significant improvement from the time his second spring ended to the fall. We?re hoping we get the same thing with D.J. We know he?s going to work his tail off.
Randy Edsall,"Danny made significant improvement from the time his second spring ended to the time we started in the fall. He made a complete jump. That's what I'm hoping with D.J., that he'll make that jump."
Randy Edsall,"He's never thrown a ball like that since I've seen him. He's a guy that's not going to force a ball, but that one should have gone into the stands. These are the things he's going to have to learn from. He's as upset with himself as anybody."
Randy Edsall,They all watched the Iowa State-Army game on television. They saw what kind of team Army had.
Randy Edsall,I knew physically that he had the ability to do it. It was just a matter of him learning his assignments and the things that he had to do from a mental standpoint of playing the position.
Randy Edsall,"When I saw him at our summer camp, (Hurd) demonstrated a lot of athletic ability. And he showed good speed for a big man. We'll put some weight on him and where we plays ... I'm not sure yet ... but I know he's going to keep getting bigger and better."
Randy Edsall,"We feel Jonathon has speed and athletic ability coming off the edge if we play him as a defensive end. In college football you don't need to have all those big people up front rushing all the time. Plus, with his athleticism, it helps us with some of the other things we do with our nickel package."

Randy Edsall,"We knew about his athleticism when we recruited him. We wanted to utilize his speed and athleticism and his ability to get to the ball. He's a tough kid, too."
Randy Edsall,"When you can get that kind of field position through special teams it's a big advantage. Guys like that, the one thing it does is it gets the guys in front of them to keep blocking longer and sustain their blocks because they know that whenever he touches the ball he can go the distance."
Braylon Edwards,"He's a professional. He knows a lot about the game and can give you a lot of insights. The great thing about him is that he provides a lot of detail. He never leaves anything out. After he explains something to you, you'd be an idiot to mess it up."
Braylon Edwards,"It was weird at first but then it was kind of fun. I was just laughing and cracking jokes, being a cheerleader."

Carl Edwards,"A lot can happen in 500 laps and, at Martinsville, things like pit strategy and tire management can make or break you, ... This is definitely one of the bigger obstacles for us as a team in the 'Chase.'"
Carl Edwards,I'm not the greatest qualifier and I'm learning a lot. I'm really excited to get to start up front in a race that we really need to run well in.
Carl Edwards,It will be great to be back in Charlotte this weekend. It's always good to race close to home. We had a disappointing race there earlier this season and we know that we can run well there. They have a new surface on the track and that will make the track very fast and I like fast. That will be awesome and work to our advantage. The team plans on focusing on a top five finish and hopefully shake off some of this bad luck we have been experiencing. We have a great team and we plan on showing that at Lowe's.
Carl Edwards,"Richmond is a great track, and it will be a fun race to watch this week. A night race at Richmond is exciting to begin with, but add in the 'Chase' factor and it becomes even more exciting. Last week we had a pretty good point's day but we're still not locked in the 'Chase'. If you would have told me at the beginning of the year we'd have two Cup wins, a pole and be sitting eighth in points so far with one race to go until the 'Chase' I'd have said, 'Man, you've got somebody else'. I just didn't expect our year to go this well. Our primary goal this week is to make the 'Chase'. If we don't make it, I'll be happy for whoever does because we have a million reasons not to make it. But we really want to make it and I think we can."
Carl Edwards,We felt like if everything went well and we got some lucky breaks and a caution at the end that we would be sitting good at the end of the race on fresh tires. I am telling you what the big win for the day was that we had a lot of fun. Racing with Jeff Burton and Greg Biffle that was great fun.
Carl Edwards,"I'm having so much fun, it's hard to explain it, ... They just keep giving me great cars with great engines."
Carl Edwards,"The Fusion really feels like our cars last year, and when they were good last year, they were easy to drive."

Carl Edwards,"It's really easy to get down and out and have a bad attitude when things aren't going well, but that doesn't help you,"
Carl Edwards,"In the long haul, the absence of any public scrutiny means the practice in the future could evolve into one that is an extremely uncompetitive, behind-the-scenes give away of work with the taxpayer not knowing whether a fair price is being paid. The current system may have flaws, but at least the public is assured of a competitive price."
Herman Edwards,"All I can tell you is the truth, what I was told, and that's what I did. I don't lie."
Herman Edwards,"We have some talent, but we still have to go do it. We haven't done anything yet."
Herman Edwards,We came in knowing we were going to struggle. But we?ve got to find a way to move the ball offensively.
Herman Edwards,He makes you smile. And then he makes you cry.
Herman Edwards,"[1. Ed Reed, safety, Ravens : He's not just the best safety in the NFL. He's the best defensive player. Last year he led the league with nine interceptions and a league-record 358 return yards while adding two defensive touchdowns (one on a 106-yard interception return and the other on a 22-yard fumble return). This year he'll be even more dangerous in Baltimore's 46 defense.] You can see he really studies the game, ... He doesn't just walk out there and play. He waits for his opportunity to make the play and when you think he's not going to make the play, that's when he gets you."
Herman Edwards,"He just got a little tired, playing special teams. We have to give him a little more rest on special teams. He's done a good job, but he did a good job last year when he had to step into Victor Hobson's position."
Herman Edwards,"[His performance in Sunday's game] will chew on him until Wednesday, ... No, (today), that's when we get the new game plan."
Herman Edwards,I can promise you that he will not touch it 20 times [tomorrow night against the Giants]. He'll go right along with the number we decided on this summer. Nobody knows that number except Curtis Martin and the head coach.
Herman Edwards,"I don't know if he's ahead, but for him to go out and throw and for all of mankind to put it on TV like we found our lost son, I have to say something. His status is doubtful. It's not like I can hide it any longer. He's been throwing for three days."
Herman Edwards,We just can't turn the ball over. The problem is when you turn the ball over in the gold area and you don't score points. That's not good.
Herman Edwards,"I have a funny feeling he'll be back. I think he has something to prove. I don't think he wants to end his career like that (with an injury). I have a feeling he's coming back, but that's just me. I could be wrong."
Herman Edwards,"He's a really funny guy,"
Herman Edwards,He tried to force some things.
Herman Edwards,"It could be ugly football for us. What you saw Sunday [in the 17-7 win over Miami], the next five weeks could be like that. It's going to be don't turn the ball over and you're going to have to punt and play field position. If you can stay in the game, you've got a chance to win."
Herman Edwards,I finally found my way back. You never plan on something like this until it happens. Fate has me back here. It's good to be back home.
Herman Edwards,You've got to try to have a lot of faith in God and lean on that.
Herman Edwards,"I'm out of being Mr. Doctor, ... I spoke on it [Tuesday], and now it's in the doctors' hands. I have no more to say. I wish I could say it, but I'm not going to say it. That's on the doctors."
Herman Edwards,"The conversation I left with him, he knows what's going on."
Herman Edwards,"I've always been happy here. I like it here. I'm the Jet coach, as far as I'm concerned, period. That's all I can say. It's done. Move on."
Herman Edwards,"Donnie is not a villain. He's a very intense coach. Regardless of all the rumors, Donnie is a heck of a coach. He's a good man with a great motor and a passion for the game. He respects the integrity of the game."
Herman Edwards,"He caught a lot of balls in one game all of a sudden. That's good. That helps you. ... I think he did a good job blocking. He's a good player. We drafted him as a blocking tight end who can catch the ball. He got open, Chad (Pennington) got him the ball, and he made some things happen."
Herman Edwards,He's a gifted player. You can do some things with a cornerback of his ability. You can put a lot on his plate. It frees us up to do things with our secondary and our linebackers.
Jeff Edwards,Use the numbers we have and let the principals work it out.
Jeff Edwards,It's got to work out. Our fingers are crossed. We never want to put odds on it.

Jeff Edwards,"I have signed (initiative petitions) in the past, but the last round I didn't even bother. It just seems like every initiative has some baggage or special interest associated with it."
Jeff Edwards,Dealer reaction to the program has been overwhelmingly positive. They welcomed the opportunity to bring in new customers who might not have previously considered buying a Hummer. We anticipate 100 percent of Hummer dealers will participate in the certified pre-owned program.
Jeff Edwards,"Once something becomes commonplace, it ceases to be news. Twenty years ago a black man shooting a black man dead in a car in Hackney was a story. When it happens 10 times in three months, it ceases to be a story."
Jeff Edwards,"This program will help our dealers help aspiring, cost-conscious Hummer enthusiasts fulfill their dreams of having a Hummer of their very own. At the same time, the program allows those same dealers to generate even more revenue for their businesses."
Jeff Edwards,"It was a great message; we needed to hear it. I think each coach has his own way of getting through to the kids. I tell my players to make decisions as if I was standing right behind them. And if they need to stop and think about a situation, they should already know the answer."
Jeff Edwards,"Beginning this fall, the $7 has been divided into two equal $3.50 deposits - one deposit for fall and one for spring."

Jim Edwards,"We, as the leaders of the universities, the colleges and technical institutions, have an important role to play in making this a reality."
Jim Edwards,The program teaches them that they need to invest themselves in working toward their goals.

Jim Edwards,That will really help us provide instruction on computers and better serve our children by teaching them the skills to further educate themselves so they will not be limited because they do not have any knowledge of computers.
Jim Edwards,The turnout is a little disappointing. But at our age ...
Mike Edwards,We've also requested that the state ask FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to participate as well.

Mike Edwards,"At the college and university level, poker is pretty much the hottest thing going."
Mike Edwards,"College students around the world are telling us how much they love Absolute Poker's free 'Win Your Tuition' tournament. For no money down, these up-and-coming poker players can experience the excitement of participating in a global, interactive event, which is now bigger than the World Series of Poker (WSOP), for a shot at winning the grand prize of one semester's tuition and other awesome prizes."
Paul Edwards,"Well, look around and find the closest trash can and throw it in there and start over."
Paul Edwards,"This is a tough track for me since I've never raced here. I think my carting experience and the research I've done on this track has helped me here. It's the first time the GTO.R will be on the pole and it's been a hard road getting here. We've had some difficulties in qualifying since late June when these cars started racing, and we've made big improvements to the car each time. Now all we have to do is win."
Paul Edwards,"We are looking at a second potential investment in China. We expect to announce that before Christmas, but there's still a little way to go in negotiations."

Jan Egeland,It's really been a terrible year in terms of suffering and in terms of challenges. But it ends with a glimmer of hope.
Jan Egeland,"The way it is now it can not continue. We need security, which we do not have. We need a government that enables us to work and does not create obstacles to our work. We need a guerrilla (force) that does not specialize in hijacking relief trucks and fighting each other and displacing new people, which has happened in the past few weeks. And we need funding."
Jan Egeland,the race against the clock.
Jan Egeland,"This is a desperate situation. As you can see we are making progress in the more populated areas but it is so hard to reach the others,"
Jan Egeland,"This appeal, ... is truly forward-looking in that it attempts to avert hunger and at the same time promote sustainable recovery of livelihoods. Investing in prevention will prove much more cost effective than providing emergency assistance year after year."
Jan Egeland,"We have seen 2004 and 2005 as the years of disaster,"
Jan Egeland,If we don't work together we will become a disaster within a disaster.
Jan Egeland,"This has never ever happened before, that two weeks after a disaster that we have $717 million that we can spend on the immediate emergency effort."
Jan Egeland,I would salute the very effective American efforts to warn the populations of the imminent danger and the very successful evacuation.
Jan Egeland,"In terms of the human lives lost, this is the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world today. It is beyond belief that the world is not paying more attention."
Jan Egeland,"So it's a nightmare trying to reach community after community which are homeless, roofless, without food, without water. It is this race against time I fear we are now losing for many of these outlying villages."
Jan Egeland,"We have not reached agreement with the government on the text (of an appeal), we have not agreed on how many are affected, how to help them, the role of (non-governmental organizations) NGOs and other operational aspects."
Jan Egeland,We want to stay as long as we can. As we speak we have had to suspend action in many areas. Tens of thousands of people will not get any assistance because it's too dangerous and it could grow exponentially.

We look forward to working with John and drawing on his wealth of experience and insight."
Paul Eibeler,"The comprehensive company-wide changes we have instituted in recent years, including implementing a series of internal controls and procedures designed to ensure that our financial reporting processes meet the highest standard of integrity and professionalism, and making key additions to our senior executive team and Board of Directors, have made our company much stronger."
Adolf Eichmann,"To sum it all up, I must say that I regret nothing."
Adolf Eichmann,"Now that I look back, I realize that a life predicated on being obedient and taking orders is a very comfortable life indeed. Living in such a way reduces to a minimum one's need to think."
Adolf Eichmann,I was one of the many horses pulling the wagon and couldn't escape left or right because of the will of the driver.
Adolf Eichmann,financed special research institutes investigating lethal gases and methods of execution.
Adolf Eichmann,"I witnessed the gruesome workings of the machinery of death; gear meshed with gear, like clockwork,"
Adolf Eichmann,"From my childhood, obedience was something I could not get out of my system. When I entered the armed service at the age of twenty-seven, I found being obedient not a bit more difficult than it had been during my life to that point. It was unthinkable that I would not follow orders."

Albert Einstein,"The analogy I like is this: imagine being able to see the world but you are deaf, and then suddenly someone gives you the ability to hear things as well - you get an extra dimension of perception,"
Albert Einstein,All these constructions and the laws connecting them can be arrived at by the principle of looking for the mathematically simplest concepts and the link between them.
Albert Einstein,The search for truth is more precious than its possession.
Albert Einstein,"When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute -- then it's longer than any hour. That's relativity!"
Albert Einstein,"These thoughts did not come in any verbal formulation. I rarely think in words at all. A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterward."
Albert Einstein,Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value.
Albert Einstein,"If A equals success, then the formula is A equals X plus Y and Z, with X being work, Y play, and Z keeping your mouth shut."
Albert Einstein,"Space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind union of the two will preserve an independent reality."
Albert Einstein,"Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know that man is here for the sake of other men."
Albert Einstein,X is work. Y is play. Z is keep your mouth shut.
Albert Einstein,Only a life lived in the service to others is worth living.
Albert Einstein,"One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike - and yet it is the most precious thing we have"

Albert Einstein,"Where the world ceases to be the scene of our personal hopes and wishes, where we face it as free beings admiring, asking and observing, there we enter the realm of Art and Science"
Albert Einstein,Science is the attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our sense experience correspond to a logically uniform system of thought.
Albert Einstein,Formal symbolic representation of qualitative entities is doomed to its rightful place of minor significance in a world where flowers and beautiful women abound.
Albert Einstein,Science is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thorough-going an association as possible.

Albert Einstein,If we knew what we were doing it wouldn't be research.
Albert Einstein,(Bias against the Negro) is the worst disease from which the society of our nation suffers.
Albert Einstein,Only a life lived for others is worth living.
Albert Einstein,The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.
Albert Einstein,You cannot solve a problem from the same consciousness that created it. You must learn to see the world anew.
Albert Einstein,"The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill."
Albert Einstein,Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.
Albert Einstein,"Personally, I experience the greatest degree of pleasure in having contact with works of art. They furnish me with happy feelings of an intensity such as I cannot derive from other realms."

Albert Einstein,"I have little patience with scientists who take a board of wood, look for its thinnest part, and drill a great number of holes where drilling is easy."
Albert Einstein,"The opinion prevailed among advanced minds that it was time that belief should be replaced increasingly by knowledge; belief that did not itself rest on knowledge was superstition, and as such had to be opposed."
Albert Einstein,"â€œNature hides her secrets because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse."
Albert Einstein,Stand still. The trees ahead and bush beside you are not lost.
Albert Einstein,"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."
Albert Einstein,"The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. He who know it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out can."
Albert Einstein,"Many of the things you can count, don't count. Many of the things you can't count, really count."
Albert Einstein,There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
Albert Einstein,Brilliant spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.
Albert Einstein,"To the extent math refers to reality, we are not certain; to the extent we are certain, math does not refer to reality."
Albert Einstein,"But there is another reason for the high repute of mathematics: it is mathematics that offers the exact natural sciences a certain measure of security which, without mathematics, they could not attain."
Albert Einstein,"We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made."
Albert Einstein,Mathematics are well and good but nature keeps dragging us around by the nose.
Albert Einstein,"The more I study physics, the more I am drawn to metaphysics."

Albert Einstein,"The most evident difference springs from the important part which is played in man by a relatively strong power of imagination and by the capacity to think, aided as it is by language and other symbolically devices."
Albert Einstein,Your imagination is your preview of life's coming attractions.
Albert Einstein,In that way imagination and intelligence enter into our existence in the part of servants of the primary instincts.
Albert Einstein,"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand."
Albert Einstein,"If I can't picture it, I can't understand it."
Albert Einstein,"The distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."

Albert Einstein,Enjoying the joys of others and suffering with them - these are the best guides for man.
Albert Einstein,The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.
Albert Einstein,Considered logically this concept is not identical with the totality of sense impressions referred to; but it is an arbitrary creation of the human (or animal) mind.
Albert Einstein,It is every man's obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it.
Albert Einstein,â€œI cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation [and] is but a reflection of human frailty.
Albert Einstein,"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings."
Albert Einstein,Remember your humanity and forget the rest.
Albert Einstein,"We cannot despair of humanity, since we are ourselves human beings."

Albert Einstein,"From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of each other - above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy. Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow men, both living and dead, and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received."

Albert Einstein,"God is subtle, but he is not malicious."
Albert Einstein,Whoever undertakes to set himself up as judge in the field of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the Gods.
Albert Einstein,God does not play dice with the universe.
Albert Einstein,It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere.
Albert Einstein,"It is a very high goal which, with our weak powers, we can reach only very inadequately, but which gives a sure foundation to our aspirations and valuations."
Albert Einstein,The value of a man resides in what he gives and not in what he is capable of receiving.
Albert Einstein,"When you sit with a nice girl for two hours, it seems like two minutes. When you sit on a hot stove for two minutes, it seems like two hours that's relativity."
Albert Einstein,"He who joyfully marches in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice."
Albert Einstein,"To the Master's honor all must turn, each in its track, without a sound, forever tracing Newton's ground."
Albert Einstein,There could be no fairer destiny for any physical theory than that it should point the way to a more comprehensive theory in which it lives on as a limiting case.
Albert Einstein,The world is not dangerous because of those who do harm but because of those who look at it without doing anything.
Albert Einstein,"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."
Albert Einstein,I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
Albert Einstein,Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.
Albert Einstein,Our task must be to free ourselves by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and its beauty.
Albert Einstein,Never do anything against conscience even if the state demands it.
Albert Einstein,"As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."
Albert Einstein,"The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it."
Albert Einstein,"We cannot despair of humanity, since we ourselves are human beings."
Albert Einstein,"The distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."
Albert Einstein,Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.
Albert Einstein,Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.
Albert Einstein,"A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy?"
Albert Einstein,It gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubbornness of an incorrigible nonconformist warmly acclaimed.

Albert Einstein,"The process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a continual flight from wonder."
Albert Einstein,"Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone."
Albert Einstein,The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.

Albert Einstein,"When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than any talent for abstract, positive thinking."
Albert Einstein,It stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man's insecurity before himself and before nature.
Albert Einstein,"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science."
Albert Einstein,"Everything should be as simple as it is, but not simpler."
Albert Einstein,The only real valuable thing is intuition.
Albert Einstein,"In order to be an immaculate member of a flock of sheep, one must above all be a sheep oneself."

Albert Einstein,There is not the slightest indication that (nuclear) energy will ever be obtainable

Albert Einstein,"Desire for approval and recognition is a healthy motive, but the desire to be acknowledged as better, stronger or more intelligent than a fellow being or fellow scholar easily leads to an excessively egoistic psychological adjustment, which may become injurious for the individual and for the community."
Albert Einstein,"Since I do not foresee that atomic energy is to be a great boon for a long time, I have to say that for the present it is a menace. Perhaps it is well that it should be.

But the child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books---a mysterious order which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects."
Albert Einstein,"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. [He was speaking of Quantum Mechanics and the breaking down of determinism.] My religiosity consists in a humble admiratation of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance -- but for us, not for God."
Albert Einstein,"The mystical trend of our time, which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so-called Theosophy and Spiritualism, is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion. Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions, and combinations of sensory impressions, the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning."

Albert Einstein,So long as there are men there will be wars.
Albert Einstein,Setting an example is not the main means of influencing others; it is the only means
Albert Einstein,A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought
Albert Einstein,"Nationalism is an infantile disease, the measles of mankind"
Albert Einstein,Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them.
Albert Einstein,"Man tries to make for himself in the fashion that suits him best a simplified and intelligible picture of the world; he then tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his for the world of experience, and thus to overcome it."
Albert Einstein,The true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which he has attained liberation from the self.
Albert Einstein,"A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be."
Albert Einstein,Lasting harmony with a woman (was) an undertaking in which I twice failed rather disgracefully.
Albert Einstein,I maintain that cosmic religiousness is the strongest and most noble driving force of scientific research.
Albert Einstein,When the number of factors coming into play in a phenomenological complex is too large scientific method in most cases fails.
Albert Einstein,"Force always attracts men of low morality, and I believe it to be an invariable rule that tyrants of genius are succeeded by scoundrels."
Albert Einstein,Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Albert Einstein,Only a life lived for others is a life worth while.
Albert Einstein,"With the affairs of active human beings it is different. Here knowledge of truth alone does not suffice; on the contrary this knowledge must continually be renewed by ceaseless effort, if it is not to be lost. It resembles a statue of marble which stands in the desert and is continuously threatened with burial by the shifting sands. The hands of science must ever be at work in order that the marble column continue everlastingly to shine in the sun. To those serving hands mine also belong."
Albert Einstein,The point is to develop the childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition and to guide the child over to important fields for society. Such a school demands from the teacher that he be a kind of artist in his province.
Albert Einstein,"The school has always been the most important means of transferring the wealth of tradition from one generation to the next. This applies today in an even higher degree than in former times, for through modern development of economic life, the family as bearer of tradition and education has become weakened.The continuance and health of human society is therefore in a still higher degree dependent on school than formally."
Albert Einstein,"Unless Americans come to realize that they are not stronger in the world because they have the bomb but weaker because of their vulnerability to atomic attack, they are not likely to conduct their policy at Lake Success [the United Nations] or in their relations with Russia in a spirit that furthers the arrival at an understanding."
Albert Einstein,Two things inspire me to awe -- the starry heavens above and the moral universe within.
Albert Einstein,"I sometimes ask myself how it came about that I was the one to develop the theory of relativity. The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops to think about problems of space and time. These are things which he has thought about as a child. But my intellectual development was retarded, as a result of which I began to wonder about space and time only when I had already grown up."
Albert Einstein,"Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being."
Albert Einstein,Relativity teaches us the connection between the different descriptions of one and the same reality.
Albert Einstein,"The wireless telegraph is not difficult to understand. The ordinary telegraph is like a very long cat. You pull the tail in New York, and it meows in Los Angeles. The wireless is the same, only without the cat."
Albert Einstein,I have no particular talent. I am merely inquisitive.
Albert Einstein,"Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity."
Albert Einstein,"Watch the stars, and from them learn. To the Master's honor all must turn, each in its track, without a sound, forever tracing Newton's ground."
Albert Einstein,"On the big Bang theory: For every one billion particles of antimatter there were one billion and one particles of matter. And when the mutual annihilation was complete, one billionth remained - and that's our present universe."
Albert Einstein,"If I had my life to live over again, I'd be a plumber."
Albert Einstein,It is high time that the ideal of success should be replaced by the ideal of service
Albert Einstein,Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.
Albert Einstein,"When a blind beetle crawls over the surface of the globe, he doesn't realize that the track he has covered is curved. I was lucky enough to have spotted it."
Albert Einstein,"Everyone should be respected as an individual, but no one idolized."
Albert Einstein,MacMillan has this particular quote simply as God doesn't play dice. and notes that it is often quoted as doesn't play dice with the universe
Albert Einstein,"We have penetrated far less deeply into the regularities obtaining within the realm of living things, but deeply enough nevertheless to sense at least the rule of fixed necessity... what is still lacking here is a grasp of the connections of profound generality, but not a knowledge of order itself."
Albert Einstein,Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving
Albert Einstein,"Why does this applied science, which saves work and makes life easier, bring us so little happiness? The simple answer runs: Because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it."
Albert Einstein,The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.
Albert Einstein,"I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature."
Albert Einstein,Understanding of our fellow human beings...becomes fruitful only when it is sustained by sympathetic feelings in joy and sorrow.
Albert Einstein,"To me the worst thing seems to be a school principally to work with methods of fear, force and artificial authority. Such treatment destroys the sound sentiments, the sincerity and the self-confidence of pupils and produces a subservient subject."
Albert Einstein,We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.
Albert Einstein,It is a magnificent feeling to recognize the unity of complex phenomena which appear to be things quite apart from the direct visible truth.
Albert Einstein,"Setting an example is not the main means of influencing another, it is the only means."
Albert Einstein,"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. ... I get most joy in life out of music."
Albert Einstein,"I think that a particle must have a separate reality independent of the measurements. That is an electron has spin, location and so forth even when it is not being measured. I like to think that the moon is there even if I am not looking at it."
Albert Einstein,Anyone who doesn't take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.
Albert Einstein,To understand the world one must not be worrying about one's self.
Albert Einstein,"Reality is merely an illusion, although a very persistent one"
Albert Einstein,A person starts to live when he can live outside himself.
Albert Einstein,Know where to find the information and how to use it - That's the secret of success
Albert Einstein,"Human beings, vegetables, or comic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible player"
Albert Einstein,Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.
Albert Einstein,The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.
Albert Einstein,"Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore."
Albert Einstein,"The minority, the ruling class at present, has the schools and press, usually the Church as well, under its thumb. This enables it to organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its tool of them."
Albert Einstein,Strange is our Situation Here Upon Earth.
Albert Einstein,"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow."
Albert Einstein,It is our American habit if we find the foundations of our educational structure unsatisfactory to add another story or wing. We find it easier to add a new study or course or kind of school than to recognize existing conditions so as to meet the need. strangled the holy curious of inquiry. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.
Albert Einstein,"According to this conception, the sole function of education was to open the way to thinking and knowing, and the school, as the outstanding organ for the people's education, must serve that end exclusively."
Albert Einstein,Education is the progressive realization of our ignorance.
Albert Einstein,Information is not knowledge.
Albert Einstein,"Bear in mind that the wonderful things you learn in your schools are the work of many generations. All this is put in your hands as your inheritance in order that you may receive it, honor it, add to it, and one day faithfully hand it on to your children."
Albert Einstein,Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school.
Albert Einstein,"It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack & ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing & searching can be promoted by means of coercion & a sense of duty. To the contrary, I believe that it would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected accordingly"
Albert Einstein,Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty.
Albert Einstein,Nationalism is an infantile sickness. It is the measles of the human race.
Albert Einstein,"We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made"
Albert Einstein,I have just got a new theory of eternity.
Albert Einstein,"It's not that I'm so smart , it's just that I stay with problems longer ."
Albert Einstein,The devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life. Either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat.
Albert Einstein,Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.
Albert Einstein,Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.
Albert Einstein,"And the high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule, or to impose himself in any other way."
Albert Einstein,"So long as they don't get violent, I want to let everyone say what they wish, for I myself have always said exactly what pleased me."
Albert Einstein,"Don't listen to their words, fix your attention on their deeds."
Albert Einstein,"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."
Albert Einstein,"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly disco"
Albert Einstein,"The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."
Albert Einstein,You can't blame gravity for falling in love.
Albert Einstein,Never lose a holy curiosity.
Albert Einstein,Curiosity has its own reason for existence.
Albert Einstein,"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery everyday. Never lose a holy curiosity."
Albert Einstein,E = mc2 Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.
Albert Einstein,It is nothing short of a miracle that modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.
Albert Einstein,"It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry."
Albert Einstein,"The individual must not merely wait and criticize, he must defend the cause the best he can. The fate of the world will be such as the world deserves."
Albert Einstein,"I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent; curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism, have brought me to my ideas."
Albert Einstein,I lived in solitude in the country and noticed how the monotony of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.
Albert Einstein,The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.
Albert Einstein,The legs are the wheels of creativity.
Albert Einstein,In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Albert Einstein,The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.
Albert Einstein,What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.
Albert Einstein,"In my experience, the best creative work is never done when one is unhappy."
Albert Einstein,I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation [and] is but a reflection of human frailty.
Albert Einstein,You can never solve a problem on the level on which it was created.
Albert Einstein,You can't solve a problem on the same level you created it.
Albert Einstein,We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
Albert Einstein,Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom.
Albert Einstein,The problems that exist in the world today cannot be solved by the level of thinking that created them.
Albert Einstein,Feeling and longing are the motive forces behind all human endeavor and human creations.
Albert Einstein,"The ideas that have lighted my way and, time after time, have given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth."
Albert Einstein,"To put it boldly, it is the attempt at a posterior reconstruction of existence by the process of conceptualization."
Albert Einstein,"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning."
Albert Einstein,"Each makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life, in order to find in this way peace and security which he can not find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience."
Albert Einstein,The only way to escape the personal corruption of praise is to go on working.
Albert Einstein,"A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving."
Albert Einstein,"How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people."
Albert Einstein,"Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people."
Albert Einstein,"Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory yields a lot, but it hardly brings us any closer to the secret of the Old One. In any case I am convinced that He doesn't play dice"
Albert Einstein,For there is no secret and there is no defense; there is no possibility of control except through the aroused understanding and insistence of the peoples of the world. We scientists recognise our inescapable responsibility to carry to our fellow citi
Albert Einstein,"I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right."
Albert Einstein,"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community."
Albert Einstein,"You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there."
Albert Einstein,Common sense is merely the deposit of prejudice laid down in the human mind before the age of 18.
Albert Einstein,Memory is deceptive because it is colored by today's events.
Albert Einstein,"Example isn't another way to teach, it is the only way to teach"
Albert Einstein,"God is clever, but not dishonest."
Albert Einstein,"I am neither especially clever nor especially gifted. I am only very, very curious."
Albert Einstein,One may say the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.
Albert Einstein,"Not until the creation and maintenance of decent conditions of life for all people are recognized and accepted as a common obligation of all people and all countries - not until then shall we, with a certain degree of justification, be able to speak of humankind as civilized."
Albert Einstein,The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it. Only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure.
Albert Einstein,Most people say that is it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.
Albert Einstein,Not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.
Albert Einstein,The human mind is not capable of grasping the Universe. We are like a little child entering a huge library. The walls are covered to the ceilings with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written these books. It doe
Albert Einstein,"[What guided Einstein was that, in his mid-twenties, he found the unknown intriguing. He felt compelled to comprehend what might have been intended for our universe by The Old One (as he referred to his notion of God).] We are in the position, ... of a little child entering a huge library, whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different languages. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend but only dimly suspects."
Albert Einstein,"[My] deep religiosity... found an abrupt ending at the age of twelve, through the reading of popular scientific books."
Albert Einstein,"Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science. Nature to him was an open book. He stands before us strong, certain, and alone."
Albert Einstein,Isn't it strange that I who have written only unpopular books should be such a popular fellow?
Albert Einstein,It is not so very important for a person to learn facts. For that he does not really need a college. He can learn them from books. The value of an education is a liberal arts college is not learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think something that cannot be learned from textbooks.
Albert Einstein,"I have never belonged wholeheartedly to a country, a state, nor to a circle of friends, nor even to my own family."
Albert Einstein,"People like you and I, though mortal of course like everyone else, do not grow old no matter how long we live.... [We] never cease to stand like curious children before the great mystery into which we were born."
Albert Einstein,A theory can be proved by experiment; but no path leads from experiment to the birth of a theory.
Albert Einstein,My life is a simple thing that would interest no one. It is a known fact that I was born and that is all that is necessary.
Albert Einstein,Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.
Albert Einstein,"I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind."
Albert Einstein,I cannot believe that God plays dice with the cosmos
Albert Einstein,"Do you believe in immortality? No, and one life is enough for me"
Albert Einstein,Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.
Albert Einstein,Mere unbelief in a personal God is no philosophy at all
Albert Einstein,"During the last century, and part of the one before, it was widely held that there was an unreconcilable conflict between knowledge and belief."
Albert Einstein,Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with the important matters.
Albert Einstein,I like to think that the moon is there even if I am not looking at it
Albert Einstein,God always takes the simplest way.
Albert Einstein,I cannot believe that God would choose to play dice with the universe.
Albert Einstein,"A theory is something nobody believes, except the person who made it. An experiment is something everybody believes, except the person who made it."
Albert Einstein,"Though our conduct seems so very different from that of the higher animals, the primary instincts are much alike in them and in us."
Albert Einstein,"If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed."
Albert Einstein,"I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves - such an ethical basis I call more proper for a herd of swine. The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty."
Albert Einstein,"The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been kindness, beauty, and truth."
Albert Einstein,Our task must be to free ourselves...by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and its beauty.
Albert Einstein,"The ideals which have always shone before me and filled me with the joy of living are goodness, beauty, and truth."
Albert Einstein,"To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty... this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness."
Albert Einstein,"The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been kindness, beauty, and truth"
Albert Einstein,"A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms Ã° it is this knowledge and this feeling"
Albert Einstein,I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil.

Albert Einstein,Joy in looking and comprehending is nature's most beautiful gift.
Albert Einstein,"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it."
Albert Einstein,"To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate made me an authority myself."
Albert Einstein,Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
Albert Einstein,I don't believe in mathematics.
Albert Einstein,There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle; you can live as if everything is a miracle.
Albert Einstein,Dancers are the athletes of God.
Albert Einstein,"He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice."
Albert Einstein,Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
Albert Einstein,"Desire for approval and recognition is a healthy motive, but the desire to be acknowledged as better, stronger or more intelligent than a fellow being or fellow scholar easily leads to an excessively egoistic psychological adjustment, which may becom"
Albert Einstein,"There is no logical way to the discovery of these elemental laws. There is only the way of intuition, which is helped by a feeling for the order lying behind the appearance."
Albert Einstein,"If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture, let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies... It would be a sad situation if the wrapper were better than the meat wrapped inside it."
Albert Einstein,"The American lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European. Life for him is always becoming, never being."
Albert Einstein,Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem -- in my opinion -- to characterize our age.
Albert Einstein,Common sense is nothing more than a deposit of prejudices laid down in the mind before you reach eighteen.
Albert Einstein,Common sense is merely the deposit of prejudice laid down in the human mind before the age of 18
Albert Einstein,Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age
Albert Einstein,"A photograph never grows old. You and I change, people change all through the months and years, but a photograph always remains the same. How nice to look at a photograph of mother or father taken many years ago. You see them as you remember them. But as people live on, they change completely. That is why I think a photograph can be kind."
Albert Einstein,Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem - in my opinion - to characterize our age
Albert Einstein,"I thought marketing this product to kids ages four and older is outrageous,"
Albert Einstein,"Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking."

Albert Einstein,"If A equals success, then the formula is: A = X + Y + Z, X is work. Y is play. Z is keep your mouth shut"

Albert Einstein,Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people .
Albert Einstein,"Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value."

Albert Einstein,"Since I do not foresee that atomic energy is to be a great boon for a long time, I have to say that for the present it is a menace. Perhaps it is well that it should be. It many intimidate the human race into bringing order into it's international af"
Albert Einstein,The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action.
Albert Einstein,"Thought is the organizing factor in man, intersected between the causal primary instincts and the resulting actions."
Albert Einstein,All such action would cease if those powerful elemental forces were to cease stirring within us.
Albert Einstein,Human beings must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.
Albert Einstein,"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings"
Albert Einstein,But their intervention makes our acts to serve ever less merely the immediate claims of our instincts.
Albert Einstein,Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.

Albert Einstein,"All these primary impulses, not easily described in words, are the springs of man's actions."
Albert Einstein,"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent"
Albert Einstein,The world is a dangerous place. Not because of the people who are evil; but because of the people who don't do anything about it.
Albert Einstein,"A man has to work so hard so that something of his personality stays alive. A tomcat has it so easy, he has only to spray and his presence is there for years on rainy days."
Albert Einstein,The value of achievement lies in the achieving.
Albert Einstein,"Once you can accept the universe as being something expanding into an infinite nothing which is something, wearing stripes with plaid is easy."
Albert Einstein,"Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them."
Albert Einstein,"Academic chairs are many, but wise and noble teachers are few; lecture-rooms are numerous and large, but the number of young people who genuinely thirst after truth and justice is small."
Albert Einstein,By academic freedom I understand the right to search for truth and to publish and teach what one holds to be true. This right implies also a duty: one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true. It is evident that any restriction.
Albert Einstein,The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion
Albert Einstein,"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one."
Albert Einstein,It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.

Albert Einstein,"Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them!"
Albert Einstein,"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."
Albert Einstein,"We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."
Albert Einstein,The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.
Albert Einstein,"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer."
Albert Einstein,I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty.
Albert Einstein,When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That's relativity.
Albert Einstein,Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
Albert Einstein,"That deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God."

Albert Einstein,"â€œIf men as individuals surrender to the call of their elementary instincts, avoiding pain and seeking satisfaction only for their own selves, the result for them all taken together must be a state of insecurity, of fear, and of promiscuous misery."
Albert Einstein,"Science is the century-old endeavour to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thorough-going an association as possible. To put it boldly, it is the attempt at a posterior reconstruction of existence by the process of conceptualisation. Science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgements of all kinds remain necessary."
Albert Einstein,Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.

Dwight D. Eisenhower,There is no victory at bargain basement prices.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Dollars and guns are no substitutes for brains and will power
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"I have found out in later years that my family was very poor, but the glory of America is that we didn't know it. [On his childhood]"

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"We seek peace, knowing that peace is the climate of freedom."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"We have heard much of the phrase, ''peace and friendship.'' This phrase, in expressing the aspiration of America, is not complete. We should say instead, ''peace and friendship, in freedom.'' This, I think, is America's real message to the rest of the world."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,I think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it. (31 August 1959)

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Leadership is a word and a concept that has been more argued than almost any other I know. I am not one of the desk-pounding types that likes to stick out his jaw and look like he is bossing the show. I would far rather get behind and, recognizing the frailties and the requirements of human nature, would rather try to persuade a man to go along, because once I have persuaded him, he will stick. If I scare him, he will stay just as long as he is scared, and then he is gone."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"You don't lead by hitting people over the head-that's assault, not leadership."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"You do not lead by hitting people over the head -- that's assault, not leadership."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Pull the string, and it will follow wherever you wish. Push it, and it will go nowhere at all."

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Every gun that's made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms...is spending the genius of its scientists, the sweat of its laborers,"
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Neither a wise nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait for the train of the future to run over him.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"I like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote peace than our governments.  Indeed, I think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Without God there could be no American form of government nor an American way of life. Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first the most basic expression of Americanism.

Dwight D. Eisenhower,What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight; it's the size of the fight in the dog
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"The spirit of man is more important than mere physical strength, and the spiritual fiber of a nation than its wealth"
Dwight D. Eisenhower,What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight; it's the size of the fight in the dog.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,The sergeant is the Army.

Dwight D. Eisenhower,Any man who wants to be president is either an egomaniac or crazy.

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"No one should ever sit in this office over 70 years old, and that I know."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Some years ago I became president of Columbia University and learned within 24 hours to be ready to speak at the drop of a hat, and I learned something more, the trustees were expected to be ready to speak at the passing of the hat."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,There is no person in this room whose basic rights are not involved in any successful defiance to the carrying out of court orders.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,I can think of nothing more boring for the American people than to have to sit in their living rooms for a whole half hour looking at my face on their television screens.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Well, when you come down to it, I don't see that a reporter could do much to a president, do you?"
Dwight D. Eisenhower,I thought it completely absurd to mention my name in the same breath as the presidency.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"If a problem cannot be solved, enlarge it."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,It is far more important to be able to hit the target than it is to haggle over who makes a weapon or who pulls a trigger.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,I shall make that trip. I shall go to Korea.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"If the United Nations once admits that international disputes can be settled by using force, then we will have destroyed the foundation of the organization and our best hope of establishing a world order."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,We will bankrupt ourselves in the vain search for absolute security.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"The world moves, and ideas that were once good are not always good."

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"When you put on a uniform, there are certain inhibitions that you accept."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Don't think you are going to conceal thoughts by concealing evidence that they ever existed.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you're a thousand miles from the corn field."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,We are tired of aristocratic explanations in Harvard words.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"From behind the Iron Curtain, there are signs that tyranny is in trouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is hard."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Ankles are nearly always neat and good-looking, but knees are nearly always not."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,The purpose is clear. It is safety with solvency. The country is entitled to both.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"There is nothing wrong with America that faith, love of freedom, intelligence, and energy of her citizens cannot cure."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,I have only one yardstick by which I test every major problem -- and that yardstick is: Is it good for America?
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Here in America we are descended in blood and in spirit from revolutionists and rebels -- men and women who dare to dissent from accepted doctrine. As their heirs, may we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Only Americans can hurt America.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"I have found out in later years [that] we were very poor, but the glory of America is that we didn't know it then."

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Few women, I fear, have had such reason as I have to think the long sad years of youth were worth living for the sake of middle age."
Dwight D. Eisenhower,"Our real problem, then, is not our strength today; it is rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow"
Dwight D. Eisenhower,A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,I think that people want peace so much that one of these days government had better get out of their way and let them have it.
Dwight D. Eisenhower,Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.
Michael Eisner,"And just in the nick of time, ... Next week, I couldn't take credit for it."
Michael Eisner,"I don't worry about the stock price, ... I worry about what we do and how we do it, and if we do it well and if people like what we do, they'll come to our properties. If they come to our properties, we'll do well financially and the stock market reflects that."
Michael Eisner,"I am pleased with the strength of our results in the first quarter, ... Once again, Parks & Resorts proved itself to be an extraordinary driver of higher earnings. Significantly, these earnings came not only from our established theme park businesses, but from our new cruise line business as well."
Michael Eisner,"We have the assets, we have the management, we have the size to chart our own course, ... I think we will be very successful."
Michael Eisner,enthroned himself as the omnipotent and infallible monarch of his personal Magic Kingdom.
Michael Eisner,"Net income for the first three quarters of 2005 is nearly equal to all of 2004,"
Michael Eisner,"We've had a bright year, ... We are seeing improvement across key financial measures, but we are not where we want to be yet."

Michael Eisner,"We have a great new CEO, ... I've known him a decade and he understands broadcasting. He understands the creation of product."
Michael Eisner,We have a great new CEO. I've known him a decade and he understands broadcasting. He understands the creation of product.
Michael Eisner,The competitive factors that initially compelled us to establish a separately traded class of common stock tied to our Internet operations have fundamentally changed.
Michael Eisner,"Movies.com will be a new distribution channel that provides consumers with an unequalled level of flexibility, quality and choice and we are excited to be at the forefront of this new entertainment medium,"
Michael Eisner,We cannot escape that Hollywood is in the middle of a wave of technological change. The current angst over all the implications of new entertainment technology is nothing new.
Michael Eisner,"Over time, the product we produce has been consistently successful here in America and around the world. Apparently, we are doing something right."
Michael Eisner,"A company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company. We don't isolate the family. We don't make rides that say, 'Hey mom, dad, you go sit on the bench.'"
Michael Eisner,My strength is coming up with two outs in the last of the ninth.
Michael Eisner,"Well, when you're trying to create things that are new, you have to be prepared to be on the edge of risk."
Michael Eisner,There's no good idea that can't be improved on.
Michael Eisner,"If it's not growing, it's going to die."
Michael Eisner,Succeeding is not really a life experience that does that much good. Failing is a much more sobering and enlightening experience.
Michael Eisner,"If you're soft and fuzzy, like our little characters, you become the skinny kid on the beach, and people in this business don't mind kicking sand in your face."
Michael Eisner,It is rare to find a business partner who is selfless. If you are lucky it happens once in a lifetime.
Jason Elam,"We were flying under the radar for a long time. Nobody gave us a whole lot of chance. It feels good to get a little respect, but we know we have a lot of work to do."
Jason Elam,"I'm always nervous, ... I was really nervous on that last one. You never feel calm. You just have to trust your swing and let it go. If you miss, you miss, you just have to keep your confidence."
Jason Elam,"You're never feeling comfortable out there, ... You just try to trust your swing and let it go. If you miss, you miss. You've just got to have confidence that you're not going to miss."
Jason Elam,"I was really nervous. . . . You sort of trust your swing and let it go. We had to have it. Hopefully, it's going to give us some swagger back, get us some confidence back. Miami just physically beat us, we had to get some confidence back."
Jason Elam,"I'm always nervous. I was really nervous on that last one. You never feel calm. You just have to trust your swing and let it go. If you miss, you miss, you just have to keep your confidence."
Jason Elam,"It crosses your mind every once in a while that it's the AFC championship, but it's not any different. It's that whole thing that pressure's a perception, not a reality. It's what you allow to be put on yourself."
Jason Elam,"Jake's doing a great job,"
Jason Elam,"You really hope and pray it's not you if it comes down to that. But ultimately you know you're going to miss some kicks, and you hope it's not the big ones. You line up, and all I do is trust my swing and let it go. And you have to be willing to live with the outcome."
Jason Elam,"I didn't see a minute of it because I took my son shopping. When I came home, my phone lit up, and I made sure I saw the highlights."
Jason Elam,"It's exactly like golf,"
Jason Elam,"That's a good thing, ... And if we're settling for field goals, we might not have won the last two, especially the Washington game. It was big our offense came through."
Jason Elam,"The Super Bowl hat. Those are really fun. With the ring to go along with it, too."
Jason Elam,I think Jake tried to make a fashion statement. But it hasn't really caught on yet.
Larry Elder,"I don't believe this is going to cause any more violence in the inner city,"
Larry Elder,"The Social Security trust fund doesn't consist of any real assets. The government borrows fund money for other federal spending, replacing it with IOUs."
Larry Elder,"You must remember to compare benefits versus costs. For the foreseeable future, the only affordable alternatives are coal, natural gas, oil or nuclear. Renewable sources - solar, wind, etc. - so favored by the left remain prohibitively expensive. A nation becomes weaker, not stronger, by artificially overspending on costly, inefficient alternatives to fossil fuels."
Larry Elder,A goal without a plan is just a wish.
Larry Elder,"Under Ronald Reagan - who cut the top tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent - black income, business development and business growth exploded."
Larry Elder,A woman who demands further gun control legislation is like a chicken who roots for Colonel Sanders.
Larry Elder,"According to the Social Security Administration, in 1945, 41.9 workers supported each individual retiree, while today only 3.3 workers support each retiree. This system cannot continue."
Larry Elder,"Welfare distorts behavior, makes one less personally responsible and reduces the role of private charity. This principle applies to corporate welfare."
Larry Elder,Only in Washington does a decrease in the proposed increase equal a spending cut.
Larry Elder,"In the last 1,000 years, the Arabs have translated as many books as Spain translates in just one year."
Larry Elder,"This battle for 'common-sense' gun control laws pits emotion and passion against logic and reason. All too often in such a contest, logic loses. So, expect more meaningless, if not harmful, 'gun control' legislation. Good news - if you're a crook."
Larry Elder,"Outsourcing and globalization of manufacturing allows companies to reduce costs, benefits consumers with lower cost goods and services, causes economic expansion that reduces unemployment, and increases productivity and job creation."
Larry Elder,"Consider the CEO who refuses to outsource, believing - as does Mr. Dobbs - this hurts America. His competitor, however, wants to increase profits. When he can, he lowers costs by outsourcing, using the savings to put back into his business. The CEO who refused to outsource now must explain to his finicky customers why he intends to charge them more."
Andrew Eldritch,"In the beginning, everybody that gets to work with me, thinks I'm nice. But three weeks later, they hear a bell ringing. Then they realise I meant everything I said during that first week. It's not my fault people are not taking me serious from the first moment."
Andrew Eldritch,I've never got on with the British press because they've always given me such a hard time. Once they build a band up they just want to do people down. They shouldn't concentrate on the colour of someone's shirt they should listen to the music.
Andrew Eldritch,I've been in Hamburg for about ten years and I just feel at home.
Andrew Eldritch,I'm not sure it pays to do anything remotely public in Britain. It's such a spiteful society. People seem to enjoy making your life hard for the sake of it.
Andrew Eldritch,"I think that's one reason why football is so popular again - it's a game which the citizen can focus on, where the rules are defined."
Andrew Eldritch,"I still like being in North of England and I keep a place there. But there are a lot of things about the Continent that are to be preferred. The social institutions work better, women have a better position in society and the food is another thing."
Andrew Eldritch,"I don't want people to come and see our gig because of the magnificent things I'm doing with my hips, but it's their evening, you know. They have to have fun. I'm a little bit naive."
Andrew Eldritch,I don't trawl record shops anymore. I usually hear music in bars or at friends' houses.
Andrew Eldritch,"I don't like doing gigs. We're pretty good at it, but it takes too much time and energy. Time and energy I'd rather spend on other things."
Andrew Eldritch,I don't enjoy British shows as a rule because British audiences are strange.
Andrew Eldritch,"But for every hour and a half on stage, you have a five hour long bus ride, waiting for five hours at the airport, five hours of interviews... I know, it's part of the job, but that doesn't imply I have to like it."
Andrew Eldritch,"Apparently, I have a totally different sense of humour."
Danny Elfman,"My education in film music came from watching tons of films,"
Danny Elfman,"For me, writing something in the spirit of Halloween is like Mother Teresa writing on charity and sacrifice. It's just second nature to me."
Danny Elfman,"You're allowed to rip-off another score so close that it's ridiculous. In my opinion it's ridiculous, how closely one can just rip-off a score that happened a year or two earlier."
Danny Elfman,"You hear the beginning of a melody, you should kind of know it's going to lead down this path. It should start feeling like a friend, like familiar."
Danny Elfman,"You have to write a good score that you feel good about. At least, you're supposed to. But, if the director hates it, it ain't going to be in the movie!"
Danny Elfman,"You have to nail the right tone because sometimes when you just see his films cold, you're not quite sure. It's the same in - I'm trying to think of other directors with a similar sense - David Lynch's films, Tim's films, some of Cronenberg's stuff."
Danny Elfman,Without the music it was kind of hard to tell. People were very confused whether you're allowed to laugh at the stuff that was happening.
Danny Elfman,What Brian laid out was something that felt really uneasy and bordering on feeling like I was on a boat or something. So I went with that feeling.
Danny Elfman,"There's kind of a cool feel that happens every now and then. I guess that feel is the thing that makes the score its own score. But, I don't know exactly what that is. So, it's hard for me to answer that question."
Danny Elfman,"The beauty of a main title is that you establish your main theme and maybe a bit of your secondary theme. You plant the seed that you're going to go water later in the score. And so, having that removed just made it so much more difficult."
Danny Elfman,"That still has to be there. And so, it's kind of an interesting question you brought up. Because, on the one hand, yeah, it'd be lovely. I certainly don't see that happening. In fact, I see the opposite happening."
Danny Elfman,"Sometimes you get real close, sometimes you don't. Sometimes they drive you crazy. I think every composer does that. That's a big part of the job."
Danny Elfman,Sometimes I like them artificial and sometimes I like them real. And the reason is because sometimes I like a real close sound. And I like a very specific snare sound and I can't get that in the big room.
Danny Elfman,"So, it becomes an exercise in futility if you write something that does not express the film as the director wishes. It's still their ball game. It's their show. I think any successful composer learns how to dance around the director's impulses."
Danny Elfman,"So I've learned in the past, if a company approaches me and they want something like this, or something like that that I've done and I turn them down, they're going to do it anyhow."
Danny Elfman,Or certainly I would need time - which I would love to have but there almost never is on a film - to just spend a week with a roomful of guys laying down these patterns.
Danny Elfman,"Oh see, first off you gotta realize - everything for me is a reconstruction or deconstruction. I would actually say deconstruction. Mission: Impossible would be the exception. That would be a reconstruction- deconstruction."
Danny Elfman,"Most often the music does end up in the movie, and sometimes there's a point where I wish that it wasn't, just because I think the score would be more effective if there was less of it. But, again, that's not my call."
Danny Elfman,"It's just hard. I wish the studios felt there was more value in these themes and these pieces of material - that they're worth protecting more. Because then it just wouldn't happen. If the studios cared, the stuff would be stopped in a second."
Danny Elfman,"It's hard to get a film, you know, you need a very special film to be able to get that experimental. But, I would love to see that happen. I would love the opportunity to be more experimental than I am."
Danny Elfman,"In Tim's films, more than most, if you miss the tone, you don't get the film."
Danny Elfman,"In Tim's films the tone is the most important thing that the score can do. In any unusual film, finding the tone makes such a big difference."
Danny Elfman,"In some types of music I'm working out all the chords one bar at a time - the whole structure, because it's about that. And there are other pieces which are really about - okay, the melody is going to start here and play through to here."
Danny Elfman,"I'm trying to interpret the film through the director's head, but it all comes out through me. So, a composer is kind of like a psychic medium."
Danny Elfman,"I'm looking for a feel and I have to find what that feel is before I can move on from there. I'm not necessarily catching stuff in such a simple way - I don't need to. So, I'm going for something else."
Danny Elfman,I'll look back and I'd be better to answer that in about three months from now. Or when the movie comes out and I see it. I don't even know what it is yet. I've still been in the middle of it.
Danny Elfman,"I'll just start laying out the melody exactly where I want it to fall. And then I'll go back and fill it out. Whereas, in other pieces I'm really just going a couple bars at a time."
Danny Elfman,"I would have to say I might do some stuff, but it's the film that's appealing. I was raised on film. My musical experience is all via film, it's not from classical music."
Danny Elfman,"I think that's one of the things that has always put me in kind of an odd niche. It's that all of my understanding of orchestral music is via film, not via classical music like it's supposed to be. To me it's the same, it doesn't make any difference."
Danny Elfman,"I think that there's a lot more freedom in the low budget, the independent films where, unfortunately, you don't have the money, necessarily, to get the orchestras in there to play a lot of stuff. But, you have a lot more freedom, very often."
Danny Elfman,"I really liked doing a number of the projects and directors, and etc., etc., I knew about half-way through that I would never be doing that again. It's just not me. I really am happy as a part-time film composer, not a full-time film composer."
Danny Elfman,I like creating these rhythmic patterns. These interlocking rhythmic things are really fun.
Danny Elfman,"I had to do this very aggressive, big score in a very short time, and knowing that in the beginning, middle, and end would be this very, very famous theme, but I still had to weave a score around it and make it work as a score was really challenging."
Danny Elfman,I don't see myself necessarily having a burning desire to write a symphony.
Danny Elfman,"I can't get that live and I don't have the time to take the tape, after I've finished recording it, into a little studio somewhere else where I can get a different kind of percussion sound."
Danny Elfman,"Having ten melodies was also a huge challenge, because I usually have three - sometimes just one or two, but often three that I'm using."
Danny Elfman,"Doing Tim's film is always going to be the most pleasure. Let me just put it that way. So, without drawing favorites one way or the other, getting back with him and doing Mars Attacks! was certainly a special treat."
Danny Elfman,"But, when it comes to all the other little instruments, of which there's a lot in the stuff I've done the last couple of years, I do it all myself."
Danny Elfman,"But, really it was finding a kind of a vibe and letting that vibe carry the movie. And did I bring anything new to the mix? I don't know."
Danny Elfman,"The first thing I do is lay out that melody and figure out how it has to hold here and then finish to land here, because you know in advance you're going to want the melody to catch four things in the action."
MaryEllen Elia,"We are definitely seeing improvement. When we see improvement across the board, that's the way we want to be going."
MaryEllen Elia,"Luckily, in this community, we have a pretty good working relationship with all of those entities."
MaryEllen Elia,It is critical that we work to ensure the success of our public school children in a highly competitive and global marketplace.
Patrik Elias,We had a lot of opportunities. We would've been in trouble if we couldn't score on those chances. It was just one of those nights where everything went in for us.
Patrik Elias,"I'm more nervous than excited, actually. I felt okay the past couple of days, no pain, no problem. I feel good conditioning-wise and hockey-wise. It's going to take awhile. I'm a little too quick for my hands right now. My hands are not that good."
Patrik Elias,"I think that's the ultimate individual honor. If you're lucky enough to stay with one team, that's awesome."
Patrik Elias,We had a lot of [power-play] opportunities. But on a couple of goals we got some bounces. It was a good start for us.
Jan Eliasson,"What we have been trying very energetically during these two days to convey to the Iraqi side is that for them to have a better hearing...for their grievances, they would be very wise in...coming back to the situation before October 29."
Jan Eliasson,I have a masochistic pleasure to put in 14-hour days.
Jan Eliasson,We have problems ahead of us. I will not hide the fact that the management issues are very difficult and we face a polarization of the membership.
Jan Eliasson,not only to recall the grievous crimes committed in human history but also to reaffirm our unfaltering resolve to prevent the recurrence of such crimes.
Jan Eliasson,"We will not achieve our collective goals for development, peace and security and human rights if we do not take concrete action to enhance women's participation in decision-making in governments, parliaments, international organizations, academic life and the private sector."
Jan Eliasson,This is a major step toward preventing genocide in the future.
Jan Eliasson,"The best birthday gift to our Organization is for all of us, the members of the global community, to translate our leaders' commitments at the 2005 World Summit into concrete action to the benefit of the peoples of the world,"
George Eliot,"There is much pain that is quite noiseless; and vibrations that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying existence. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder; robberies that leave man or woman for ever beggared of peace and joy, yet kept secret by the sufferer /committed to no sound except that of low moans in the night, seen in no writing except that made on the face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears. Many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into no human ear."
George Eliot,"She was no longer wrestling with the grief, but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts."
George Eliot,"We women are always in danger of living too exclusively in the affections; and though our affections are perhaps the best gifts we have, we ought also to have our share of the more independent life -- some joy in things for their own sake. It is piteous to see the helplessness of some sweet women when their affections are disappointed -- because all their teaching has been, that they can only delight in study of any kind for the sake of a personal love. They have never contemplated an independent delight in ideas as an experience which they could confess without being laughed at. Yet surely women need this defense against passionate affliction even more than men."
George Eliot,"I should like to know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out"
George Eliot,"Our instructed vagrancy, which has hardly time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the tropics, and is at home with palms and banyans --which is nourished on books of travel, and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi."
George Eliot,"Be courteous, be obliging, but don't give yourself over to be melted down for the benefit of the tallow trade"
George Eliot,"Our virtues are dearer to us the more we have had to suffer for them. It is the same with our children. All profound affection entertains a sacrifice. Our thoughts are often worse than we are, just as they are often better."
George Eliot,Each thought is a nail that is driven In structures that cannot decay; And the mansion at last will be given To us as we build it each day.
George Eliot,Wear a smile and have friends; wear a scowl and have wrinkles. What do we live for if not to make the world less difficult for each other?
George Eliot,"Speech is often barren; but silence also does not necessarily brood over a full nest. Your still fowl, blinking at you without remark, may all the while be sitting on one addled egg; and when it takes to cackling will have nothing to announce but that addled delusion."
George Eliot,"I like not only to be loved, but to be told that I am loved; the realm of silence is large enough beyond the grave"
George Eliot,"Iteration, like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of progress"
George Eliot,It is seldom that the miserable of the world can help regarding their misery as a wrong inflicted by those who are less miserable.
George Eliot,"Here undoubtedly lies the chief poetic energy: --in the force of imagination that pierces or exalts the solid fact, instead of floating among cloud-pictures."
George Eliot,"Perspective, as its inventor remarked, is a beautiful thing. What horrors of damp huts, where human beings languish, may not become picturesque through aerial distance! What hymning of cancerous vices may we not languish over as sublimest art in the safe remoteness of a strange language and artificial phrase! Yet we keep a repugnance to rheumatism and other painful effects when presented in our personal experience."
George Eliot,"Perspective, as its inventor remarked, is a beautiful thing. What horrors of damp huts, where human beings languish, may not become picturesque through aerial distance!"
George Eliot,"With memory set smarting like a reopened wound, a man's past is not simply a dead history, an outworn preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose from the life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing shudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame."
George Eliot,"Our passions do not live apart in locked chambers but dress in their small wardrobe of notions, bring their provisions to a common table and mess together, feeding out of the common store according to their appetite."
George Eliot,"There is much pain that is quite noiseless; and vibrations that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying existence. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of murder; robberies that leave man or woman for ever beggared of peace and joy, yet kept secret by the sufferer --committed to no sound except that of low moans in the night, seen in no writing except that made on the face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears. Many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into no human ear."

George Eliot,What is opportunity to the man who can't use it?
George Eliot,The responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the wider vision
George Eliot,"Of a truth, Knowledge is power, but it is a power reined by scruple, having a conscience of what must be and what may be; whereas Ignorance is a blind giant who, let him but wax unbound, would make it a sport to seize the pillars that hold up the long-wrought fabric of human good, and turn all the places of joy as dark as a buried Babylon."

George Eliot,Knowledge slowly builds up what Ignorance in an hour pulls down
George Eliot,"The happiest women, like the happiest nations, have no history"
George Eliot,"Children demand that their heroes should be freckleless, and easily believe them so: perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is less revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for us in maturer life."
George Eliot,"Formerly, his heart had been as a locked casket with its treasure inside; but now the casket was empty, and the lock was broken. Left groping in darkness, with his prop utterly gone, Silas had inevitably a sense, though a dull and half-despairing one, that if any help came to him it must come from without; and there was a slight stirring of expectation at the sight of his fellow-men, a faint consciousness of dependence on their goodwill."
George Eliot,"A supreme love, a motive that gives a sublime rhythm to a woman's life, and exalts habit into partnership with the soul's highest needs, is not to be had where and how she wills."

George Eliot,"I at least have so much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe."
George Eliot,"The presence of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character."

George Eliot,The desire to conquer is itself a sort of subjection
George Eliot,"How could a man be satisfied with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances? No more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he's chosen from among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison."
George Eliot,"I like not only to be loved, but also to be told that I am loved. I am not sure that you are of the same kind. But the realm of silence is large enough beyond the grave. This is the world of literature and speech and I shall take leave to tell you that you are very dear."
George Eliot,"Consequences are unpitying. Our deeds carry their terrible consequences, quite apart from any fluctuations that went before--consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves."

George Eliot,The desire to conquer is itself a sort of subjection.
George Eliot,"I've never any pity for conceited people, because I think they carry their comfort about with them."

George Eliot,". . . for the stress of circumstances, Fred felt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the constructive power of suspicion."

George Eliot,"The most solid comfort one can fall back upon is the thought that the business of one's life is to help in some small way to reduce the sum of ignorance, degradation and misery on the face of this beautiful earth."

George Eliot,"Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the blot? I know no speck so troublesome as self."

George Eliot,"There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little fire; it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp despondency of uneasy egoism."

George Eliot,How unspeakably the lengthening of memories in common endears our old friends!

George Eliot,It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral deficiencies hidden under the ''dear deceit'' of beauty.
George Eliot,"There are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools of themselves in various styles... but there is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not only of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of women. It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief --a beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you."

David Elkind,It's certainly part of the same group-think. They're doing the same thing -- branding -- with universities. We see economic values being weighed much more heavily than human values.

Steve Elkington,"I've always had a good head for golf,"
Steve Elkington,"Major-championship golf, you're just really concentrating on more or less the shot you're trying to hit, ... If you get too far ahead of that, you don't seem to do too well."
Steve Elkington,"When I first saw the course 18 years ago, it was so intimidating. It was a new style of golf, a new concept. So it took some time for guys to learn to like it. It's a great venue, because it's the most precise golf we have to play all year. You have to hit fairways and greens there. There's none of this hit-four-out-of-14-fairways-and-still- shoot-68 on that golf course."

Missy Elliot,The biggest surprise with the show is I didn't think it was gonna be that emotional. I thought it was just gonna be a regular reality show.
Missy Elliot,My Struggles is a record close to me. It's about what I went through at home living with an abusive father.
Missy Elliot,"It's just that back then we didn't know that was considered being a coproducer. I would sit on the side and say what I wanted musically, but at the time we thought if you aren't the one playing it, you don't get the credit. Now you'll start seeing my name listed as producer."

Albert Ellis,"If I had been a member of the academic establishment, I could have done other experiments."
Albert Ellis,"I'm very happy. I like my work and the various aspects of it-going around the world, teaching the gospel according to St. Albert."
Albert Ellis,"I wrote several articles criticizing psychoanalysis, but the analysts weren't listening to my objections. So I finally quit after practicing it for six years."
Albert Ellis,"I would have liked having children to some degree, but frankly I haven't got the time to take the kids to the goddamn ballgame."
Albert Ellis,"I thought foolishly that Freudian psychoanalysis was deeper and more intensive than other, more directive forms of therapy, so I was trained in it and practiced it."
Albert Ellis,I think the future of psychotherapy and psychology is in the school system. We need to teach every child how to rarely seriously disturb himself or herself and how to overcome disturbance when it occurs.
Albert Ellis,I started to call myself a rational therapist in 1955; later I used the term rational emotive. Now I call myself a rational emotive behavior therapist.
Albert Ellis,I hope to die in the saddle seat.
Albert Ellis,"I get people to truly accept themselves unconditionally, whether or not their therapist or anyone loves them."
Albert Ellis,"Freud had a gene for inefficiency, and I think I have a gene for efficiency."
Albert Ellis,"The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny."
Albert Ellis,There's no evidence whatsoever that men are more rational than women. Both sexes seem to be equally irrational.
Albert Ellis,The art of love is largely the art of persistence.
Albert Ellis,People could rationally decide that prolonged relationships take up too much time and effort and that they'd much rather do other kinds of things. But most people are afraid of rejection.
Chris Ellis,"I think losing all those games humbled us. But winning these two makes us understand where we can go as a team. Already, we've gone from zeroes to bracket-busters."
Chris Ellis,Fitness is definitely an important category for us.
Chris Ellis,"Coach (Skip Prosser) tells me not to hesitate, he tells me just to let it ride. That was a momentum-changer for us."
Chris Ellis,"He was a superior athlete in the rec league. He was a superior athlete in high school. And he'll be a superior athlete here. You know how pilots like to fly and doctors like to save people's lives? Well, Xavier likes to play football."
Jerry Ellis,"Look, I'm still living under a bridge by Del Taco, I can't worry about what I'm going to wear to a job interview."
Jerry Ellis,That's our family secret. We don't force the running as a strict routine. The girls enjoy being active kids but the running and sometimes resulting difficulty helps them learn the mental aspect of life ? mind over matter.
Jerry Ellis,"It's a slang expression, a street expression, but we should have known better not to use it. I am supposed to read every word. Sometimes it's busy or I am lazy. We are working on a retraction."
Mark Ellis,"Being from Maine, which is a blue state, I think he understands ... trying to elect candidates that are more suited for a red state."
Mark Ellis,That's always been one of the problems with our team. We haven't had a lot of depth. This is the first time since I've been here that we've actually had depth on our team. It's a credit to our management and it also says that we're ready to win. We want to win now and we want to go deep in the playoffs.
Mark Ellis,"If this painstaking experiment in international humanitarian law succeeds, the tribunal will ensure that individuals responsible for atrocities, having been fairly tried and convicted, are held accountable for their actions."
Mark Ellis,"He's done a nice job. I'm not sure what he wants to do, that's one of the key things, but the last three years, look at our record."
Mark Ellis,He's very valuable. When I got hurt he stepped in and did a great job. Last year when Bobby got hurt he did a great job. You have to have guys like that on the team.
Mark Ellis,"When you put in a lot of hard work, you hope to see results, and right now it's satisfying."
Mark Ellis,"If I could figure this team out, I would be a genius. We're all either swinging it well at the same time or we're all not. Hopefully, we'll stay like this for a while. It doesn't matter who is pitching. You could have Cy Young out there or the worst guy in the league, it doesn't matter."
Mark Ellis,"If I could figure out this team, I'd be a genius. We're all either swinging the bat well at the same time, or not."
Mark Ellis,"I try to figure this team out, and if I could, I'd be a genius. We're all swinging the bats well at the same time, or we're all not swinging the bats well at the same time."
Mark Ellis,We haven't been able to play together a lot yet. Hopefully we'll be out there for a lot of games. You can do all you want during batting practice but you have to get out there in game situations. We need to start playing together.
Mark Ellis,"Even as a young guy, he takes control. That's his infield out there, and that's the way it should be."
Mark Ellis,"Giving birth to a new medspa takes a tremendous amount of labor pain, knowledge and expertise. Just because someone may know how operate a successful business doesn't mean they can make money in the medspa business. That is why we do so well in providing assistance through the initial phases of the medspa birth process. Due to our expertise, clients pay us an ongoing monthly support fee to assist them on multiple fronts. In other words, getting you there is one thing and keep you running smoothly once you're there is another. This ongoing support fee represents a monthly recurring revenue stream for the company,"
Mark Ellis,"I kind of knew that it would take a while at the beginning of the season because I hadn't played for a whole year, ... I was hoping things would progress and my arm would get stronger as the year went on, and everything I've expected to happen has happened so far."
Mark Ellis,You look at Frank's numbers and he's amazing. He's already a presence around here. You couldn't be a baseball fan in the '90s and not follow Frank Thomas. He's as good as there was in the game.
Mark Ellis,"This year, all I need to do is prepare for the season. I'm ready to play baseball."
Mark Ellis,"[Mark Ellis, the films sports coordinator, notes that it helped that the actor both wanted the action to be as real as possible and had the athletic chops to pull it off.] Sandler is such a competitor, ... He works hard and the audience is really gonna believe this guy. This is the real deal."
Mark Ellis,"[Mark Ellis, the filmâ€™s sports coordinator, notes that it helped that the actor both wanted the action to be as real as possible and had the athletic chops to pull it off.] Sandler is such a competitor, ... He works hard and the audience is really gonna believe this guy. This is the real deal."
Steve Ellis,"We have a clear example here that earmarks caused harm. Because we siphoned off funds to go to parochial projects, we have put people in harm's way and exposed them to greater risk. Congress needs to put its house in order and target their funding to where there's the greatest need,"
Steve Ellis,"There is little doubt by making it safer to develop in high risk areas by promising to fund people to rebuild through flood insurance, we have made people feel it is safe to move into these areas."
Steve Ellis,"It's passing the buck, literally. There are no profiles in courage in the Senate on this."
Steve Ellis,The Corps of Engineers and Congress are partners in crime. We have this process where the pork barrel dictates that we spread the money over the 535 mouths to feed that are Congress rather than putting our resources where it makes the most sense.
Steve Ellis,Congress and the SBA appeared to be more interested in shoveling the money out than they were in actually making sure that they were helping people affected by the 9/11 attacks.
Steve Ellis,"We have real needs that we have to meet for rebuilding in the Gulf Coast, and with our tight budgets, this is almost a zero-sum game. And now we're taking about moving a railroad that's been rebuilt already? That doesn't make sense."
A.J. Ellison,"It's just like with any other sport, if you want to get to that next level, you have to sacrifice a lot. You almost have to be selfish."
A.J. Ellison,My junior year was a stepping stone to my senior season. That was my first full season running. I knew I was going to be better my senior year.
A.J. Ellison,"I couldn't wait for Friday and Saturday to come around. When you're in good shape, you want to race all the time, because when you peak, it's only for a couple weeks."
A.J. Ellison,I am a little surprised. You have a lot of military kids coming in and out. It would be nice to see someone challenge it and have the same opportunities I had.
A.J. Ellison,"In the fall, I still ran cross country. In the winter you had indoor, in the spring you have track and in the summer I competed in Europe."
A.J. Ellison,Cross country was something that started off as a punishment from my father for low grades. I guess he didn't realize it would take off so well. It gave me something to do with my free time and it taught me to be accountable.
A.J. Ellison,"Training hard was not just going to the track at 3:30 and running hard. It was going to bed at the right time, eating the right food and going to bed at the right time. Training was all day long. Track became my life. It really became more of a science to me. Track literally became when to get up, what to eat and when to go to bed."
A.J. Ellison,I had a little bit of anxiety. Being one of the top runners in Kansas and you get to Tulsa and everyone is a state champion somewhere. So not knowing whether or not I'm going to be as successful was a big part of it.
James Ellroy,"Rock and rollers can get you the youth buzz, and younger people are fanatical readers."
James Ellroy,I have a very intense marriage.
James Ellroy,"I am the most well-adjusted human being I know. I started out this investigation as a very happy man with a great career. I've got the life people dream about: I am rich, I am famous, I've got a fabulous marriage to an absolutely, spell-bindingly brilliant woman."
Jacques Ellul,"(Propaganda) proceeds by psychological manipulations, character modifications, by creation of stereotypes useful when the time comes - The two great routes that this sub-propaganda takes are the conditioned reflex and the myth"
Jacques Ellul,"Thinking has become a superfluous exercise... purely internal, without compelling force, more or less a game."
Jacques Ellul,"The orchestration of press, radio and television to create a continuous, lasting and total environment renders the influence of propaganda virtually unnoticed precisely because it creates a constant environment."
Jacques Ellul,"The intellectual who wants to do her work properly must today go back to the starting point: the woman whom she knows, and first of all to herself. It is at that level, and at no other, that she ought to begin to think about the world situation."
Jacques Ellul,"The Holy Spirit alone can do this, the Holy Spirit alone can establish this link with one's neighbor."
Jacques Ellul,The goal of modern propaganda is no longer to transform opinion but to arouse an active and mythical belief.
Jacques Ellul,"Modern technology has become a total phenomenon for civilization, the defining force of a new social order in which efficiency is no longer an option but a necessity imposed on all human activity."
Jacques Ellul,Mass media provides the essential link between the individual and the demands of the technological society.
Jacques Ellul,It is the emergence of mass media which makes possible the use of propaganda techniques on a societal scale.
Jacques Ellul,"In sum, thought and reflection have been rendered thoroughly pointless by the circumstances in which modern men and women live and act."
Jacques Ellul,For the word is dialectical in itself and at the same time is integrated into the whole of existence. By this I mean that the word is intended to be lived.
Jacques Ellul,"All human language draws its nature and value from the fact that it both comes from the Word of God and is chosen by God to manifest himself. But this relationship is secret and incomprehensible, beyond the bounds of reason and analysis."
Jacques Ellul,Prayer holds together the shattered fragments of the creation. It makes history possible.
Jacques Ellul,"(Propaganda) proceeds by psychological manipulations, character modifications, by creation of stereotypes useful when the time comes -  The two great routes that this sub-propaganda takes are the conditioned reflex and the myth"
Ernie Els,"Today was a tough day. I looked at my putting stats and I'm down in the bottom half of the field, so I guess that is where my problem is this week."
Ernie Els,We've got the technology out there. It's how you use it.
Ernie Els,"He's there all the time. The rest of us, we're in and out the rest of the time. So yes, he's winning. But there is competition."
Ernie Els,This is one of my favorite golf courses. I felt comfortable and the greens were perfect.''
Ernie Els,It's a great test. I think to have different winners like that shows you how good the golf course is.
Ernie Els,It was a nice round of golf and I needed this. (The knee is) not going to be 100 percent for another six months. I'm just thankful to be walking.
Ernie Els,"He just makes this place better every year. The golf course keeps improving, the quality of the way they present the golf course gets better all the time, and I think this year is no different. It's just great playing on a golf course like this. He runs a great show."
Ernie Els,"Thanks for bringing that up, I never thought of it. When you play golf tournaments you never think about it. When you are playing you try and be ready with your total game and when that is well groomed and practiced you are ready for the tournament. That has always been my philosophy."
Ernie Els,You can't really look at the rest of the field. You have to play the golf course and play your score and try and put something decent on the scoreboard and hope that it is good enough.
Ernie Els,"I still don't think that my doctors told me exactly how bad it was. They told my wife. They tried to keep it away from me and keep me very positive, but it was badly messed up."
Ernie Els,I kept my concentration well and got over the bad spells. I was not as sharp as the second round but if I shoot something under 70 tomorrow it will be difficult to beat me.
Ernie Els,"It is easy to blame it on the schedule and it seems like, especially in America, the journalists have been playing a lot on that,"
John Elway,You learn a lot more from the lows because it makes you pay attention to what you're doing.
John Elway,"We're down in Miami, and if we play like we're capable, we're going to win the game. And it's a 50 percent chance of rain the whole time."
John Elway,"We get done with the game, and it's an absolute downpour 30 minutes later. That's when I thought God was telling me that's enough-time for you to go do something else."
John Elway,"There have been openings, but I have not interviewed for any jobs, nor do I want to right now."
John Elway,"There are a lot of people who might not get another chance to win a Super Bowl, not just me."
John Elway,The Arena League is the best thing that could have happened to me because I get to run the whole process. I'm seeing not only the football side but the business side.
John Elway,It's really been a better situation for me being with the Crush than it would if I were with the Broncos because this has given me a lot more broad range.
John Elway,It's all about putting the best team together - not just in the front office but the players on the field.
John Elway,I've experienced the highest of highs and lowest of lows. I think to really appreciate anything you have to be at both ends of the spectrum.
John Elway,I've been able to run an organization the best way I think that I should. Winning a championship makes me think we did something right.
John Elway,I've always joked about Joe Montana not appreciating his Super Bowls nearly as much as I do because he never lost one. We lost three before we got one.
John Elway,I'm happy with the Arena Football League right now. I'm happy in Denver.
John Elway,"I'm getting the basics with the AFL, but the NFL is a different animal."
John Elway,I would hope this experience would help me if that NFL opportunity were to arise. But I also know that it's a totally different league. There's a lot more to it.
John Elway,I would have loved to have played for Joe Gibbs. Look at his record of winning three Super Bowls.
John Elway,I was so lucky to walk away with two Super Bowls and know that the last year was positive.
John Elway,I look at my career and it's still hard for me to believe the way things turned out and how things happened. I've been so blessed.
John Elway,I had a great time doing Vegas. It's just that it takes a lot of time.
John Elway,I don't know if I like being the sentimental favorite.
John Elway,I don't have any pangs to where I want to be with the Broncos.
John Elway,I can't compare quarterbacks as apples and oranges in my mind because everybody's in a different system.
John Elway,I always believe there's a reason why you go through everything.
John Elway,"How ironic, to be my last game that I ever played would be against Dan in a Super Bowl. The thing I always was afraid of was playing in a Super Bowl when it was raining. I can't throw a wet ball."
John Elway,Being thrown into the fire and getting the thing turned around in a hurry made it more difficult. Things have been done the hard way. I think you learn better when things are done the hard way.
John Elway,As football players you have all the experience on the field. You don't have the experience off the field.
John Elway,"A guy as great as Brett Favre has been for the length of time he's been, you would hope that he would be able to leave the game with a positive flavor in his mouth."
Keith Emerson,You've got to keep things flying.
Keith Emerson,"What we're doing is a retrospective, a refined look at how far we've come in what's known as progressive music and investigate and explore that."
Keith Emerson,What can you do? You've gotta move on.
Keith Emerson,We'll be presenting a broad spectrum of the music and looking at how the younger guys can carry it on.
Keith Emerson,"We set the stage worldwide to go into the new millenium. I have all the music. Carl Palmer loves the music, he wants to play it."
Keith Emerson,"We manage to bounce ideas off one another. Every band fights, but at the end of the day, we're very positive about the way we fight. At least we come out with a result."
Keith Emerson,"They were keen for me still to play the piano, which I was going to, but 45 minutes of piano would be extremely boring. I like a bit of light and shade."
Keith Emerson,"There's a clip where he had someone miming me running around from keyboard to keyboard. Oh dear, I am sure a lot of people didn't know what he was going on about."
Keith Emerson,The best thing about this band is I'm the leader!
Keith Emerson,"Since this our first show, I think they'll see us sweat a lot."
Keith Emerson,"Next year I'm going to be a guesting soloist with orchestras all over Europe, to start off with."
Keith Emerson,"My sons are into German music, but they are into all kinds of music."
Keith Emerson,"My mother had all these scrap books she kept and the reviews, I was also fortunate to have a list of every gig I've ever played in my life."
Keith Emerson,"If you're a good parent, see the changes that are happening in your kids."
Keith Emerson,"If we didn't do the tour, it would have been disastrous."
Keith Emerson,"If they want a photograph, then just take it."
Keith Emerson,"If it wasn't good, I wouldn't be going back out on tour."
Keith Emerson,I've never written a book before.
Keith Emerson,"I'm proud of my kids, they are doing what they want to do."
Keith Emerson,"I'm probably too forgiving sometimes. You have to understand that when you have a commitment to do a tour, you have to keep everything on an up level."
Keith Emerson,"I'm not a rich man, and Greg Lake is certainly not. I don't know how he can survive. I don't know how he can be that suicidal. But having said that, I'd love to be there to help Greg."
Keith Emerson,I remember that I used to mix with my friends who had brothers and sisters. I was an only child.
Keith Emerson,"I love my mother dearly, but it wouldn't be suitable for me to live with her all the time."
Keith Emerson,"I had written movie scores, television series, played with other people. Carl had done the same with Asia, with other bands, everything. We weren't about to entrust Greg automatically with a production credit."
Keith Emerson,"I guess when Rick is finished with his Journey to the Centre of the Earth, then we might have a go at something. We'd like to, we're open to it, and we've been talking about it."
Keith Emerson,"I don't regard myself as a great classical or jazz pianist. I like country music, but I'm not a great player. I just like music. Drums 'n' bass is pretty exciting and I'd love to explore it."
Keith Emerson,"I don't care who I play to, as long as they enjoy listening to what I play."
Keith Emerson,I consider everything I compose a gift.
Keith Emerson,"Find a good teacher, as I found for my sons. I feel the worst thing you can do is to try and teach your own children yourself, because there is a natural rebellion that occurs."
Keith Emerson,"At the Isle of Wight, the sound went out and kind of kept on going. And I wasn't... when I came off stage I was kind of unhappy about how we had played. But now, I listen back to those recordings and it's not bad."
Keith Emerson,"I was always playing the Hammond Organ back to front even during the days of the Nice, going back to 1968. Really what I was doing there, was choosing notes at random and trying to make some sense of them, improvising back to front."
Keith Emerson,We can all put weight on or lose weight.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,There is a time when a man distinguishes the idea of felicity from the idea of wealth; it is the beginning of wisdom.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,Life is a festival only to the wise.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,"Wisdom is like electricity. There is no permanently wise man, but men capable of wisdom, who, being put into certain company, or other favorable conditions, become wise for a short time, as glasses rubbed acquire electric power for a while."

Ralph Waldo Emerson,"Wealth is in applications of mind to nature; and the art of getting rich consists not in industry, much less in saving, but in a better order, in timeliness, in being at the right spot."

Ralph Waldo Emerson,Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,No man should travel until he has learned the language of the country he visits. Otherwise he voluntarily makes himself a great baby-so helpless and so ridiculous.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,"I am not much an advocate for traveling, and I observe that men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own, and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places. For the most part, only the light characters travel. Who are you that have no task to keep you at home?"
Ralph Waldo Emerson,Traveling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,"The greatest meliorator of the world is selfish, huckstering Trade."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,"These times of ours are serious and full of calamity, but all times are essentially alike. As soon as there is life there is danger."

Ralph Waldo Emerson,Thought makes every thing fit for use.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,"Society is a masked ball, where every one hides his real character, and reveals it by hiding."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,Society is a hospital of incurables.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,"I dip my pen in the blackest ink, because I am not afraid of falling into my inkpot."

Ralph Waldo Emerson,Our expenses are all for conformity.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,The virtue in most request is conformity.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,"One lesson we learn early, that in spite of seeming difference, men are all of one pattern.

The gods loved him because men hated him."

Ray Emery,"I had three weeks to prepare for one game. You'd like to think when you have the opportunity to prepare for three weeks, I could go out and make some big saves. The other guy outplayed me. I feel accountable to the other guys. We're fighting for first place. It's disappointing."
Ray Emery,They want to see wins and it was a tough night. It's understood you don't want to get booed but they were cheering when I was winning so that's part of being a fan.
Ray Emery,I just want to play as well as I can each and every night and take it one step at a time. I haven't gotten ahead of myself. I just want to look forward to the next game and let Dom's situation and the rest take care of itself.

Ray Emery,"We won tonight but I made more mistakes than I did in some of the past games. When you lose as a goaltender you're definitely under a magnifying glass.

Ray Emery,"The boys actually got a bit more talkative between the second and third. It was pretty quiet at the start and then the guys started saying, 'We've got to do this,' and, 'We've got to start playing with a bit more desperation.' It was exciting to see it because we talked about it and we actually went out and did it."

Eminem,"Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion."
Eminem,"Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you're always going to find a hip-hop tape; that's all I buy, that's all I live, that's all I listen to, that's all I love."

Eminem,"I am whatever you say I am; if I wasn't, then why would you say I am."
Eminem,"Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned. They're only powerful when you got your back turned."

I'm sure it will be surprising to very few people that I now feel it is time to move on to creating a new chapter in my life."
Roger Enrico,"In really good companies, you have to lead. You have to come up with big ideas and express them forcefully. I have always been encouraged -- or sometimes forced -- to confront the very natural fear of being wrong. I was constantly pushed to find out what I really thought and then to speak up. Over time, I came to see that waiting to discover which way the wind was blowing is an excellent way to learn how to be a follower."

Paul Epstein,If you can tell me where this is going you're worth a zillion dollars. I've never felt the need for a crystal ball as much as I have now. Things are changing at such a breakneck rate. It's not just the technology. It's the financial underpinnings of that technology.

Robert Epstein,"The beauty of the Internet,"
Theo Epstein,"It was a fair trade because there was tremendous talent on both sides.

Theo Epstein,"said a beaming Faxon, his smile Kennedy-like in its width and charismatic luster, ''which I don't really care about."

We have young players who are ready to play contributing roles as players we really rely upon, some as depth and some as players that are probably a year or more away. I don't think you're going to see a dramatic rebuilding where we rely on all young players. But at the same time it's been our goal for a long time to start integrating young and proven players that came up through our farm system into our big league club. I think you'll see more of that next year."

It's what we do the rest of the way."

Theo Epstein,A situation may arise where he's a better option than what we have. There aren't too many guys you can bring in under these circumstances and be sure they won't be afraid.
Theo Epstein,"It's been less than an ideal year, but under the circumstances he's made significant contributions."
Theo Epstein,I don't think you ever want to see your team struggle. I think the fact that we had to overcome adversity during the regular season probably helped us.
Rassie Erasmus,We are just trying out some tactical things. It all depends on what tactics we'll use against the Bulls. At this stage we are just testing some players to see what patterns they fit into and what they are comfortable with.
Rassie Erasmus,We can't complain. The weather has been cool and near perfect for training. The players should peak on Friday night.
Rassie Erasmus,What worries me is that we have managed only one log point in two home matches.
Rassie Erasmus,In the last three games the conditions were very wet and this has not allowed us to play our backline ploys that we have put in place so we are hoping for dry weather and a chance for our backs to prove their worth.

Saeb Erekat,we will continue to see this government's policy of stealing (land) and wasting time.
Saeb Erekat,"They control the water, the sky and the passages. How can you say occupation is over?"

Mark Ernst,We believe that it is prudent to take a cautious view of the fourth quarter.
Darin Erstad,"Those are fun games. We keep playing till the end. They're a dangerous team, and they're a tough team to keep down. It's pretty much Murderer's Row when you're going against them. Fortunately, we've got good pitching."
Darin Erstad,"They're pitching well, that's for sure. We're just going to keep fighting. That's what we do. We grind it out."

Julius Erving,"When handling the ball, I always would look for daylight, wherever there was daylight."

Julius Erving,"One of the commitments that I personally have now is to a diverse approach to buying businesses, and the operation of those businesses."

Melissa Etheridge,"Instead of taking five or six of the prescriptions, I decided to go a natural route and smoke marijuana."
Melissa Etheridge,"I had a lot of self-loathing, ... I've been self-sustained since I was 11. I've always been the one making the money, and to be flat on my back and ... so vulnerable and then be completely loved. To have my wife be there, 110% supportive. To have my children say, 'It's OK, Mom.' To have the people that I work for say, 'It's OK.' To have my fans go, 'It's all right.' It's like, what was I afraid of? I'm going to get healthy now, and I'm not going to carry that baggage anymore."
Melissa Etheridge,I stand before you a totally healthy person.

Kevin Eubanks,I love both my parents dearly.

Kevin Eubanks,"I can pay my rent now. I guess I could always do that, but now I can get an apartment with heat."
Kevin Eubanks,I am blessed to have Mom and Dad.
Kevin Eubanks,"Dad made it to Gold Shield Detective, so he always busted Robin, my oldest brother, and me. Always got caught, whatever we were doing."
Kevin Eubanks,"Being as versatile as I am, I take offense to the notion that no serious musician would not be doing a late night talk show gig. One has to be open enough in other areas to be able to contribute to a show like this."
Kevin Eubanks,After a while I thought it didn't make any sense to use a pick. It's kind of like typing with one finger on each hand instead of using all your fingers.

My situation was so out in the open, but [alcohol abuse] is a much bigger problem than people will admit, and it is everywhere.
