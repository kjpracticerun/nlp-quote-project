Li Ka-Shing,"Information and communications technology unlocks the value of time, allowing and enabling multi-tasking, multi-channels, multi-this and multi-that."
Li Ka-Shing,"Vision is perhaps our greatest strength... it has kept us alive to the power and continuity of thought through the centuries, it makes us peer into the future and lends shape to the unknown."
Li Ka-Shing,"The future may be made up of many factors but where it truly lies is in the hearts and minds of men. Your dedication should not be confined for your own gain, but unleashes your passion for our beloved country as well as for the integrity and humanity of mankind."
Li Ka-Shing,"We are approaching a new age of synthesis. Knowledge cannot be merely a degree or a skill... it demands a broader vision, capabilities in critical thinking and logical deduction without which we cannot have constructive progress."
Marwan Kabalan,"If you hand over these people, you would contribute to undermining the regime. The Syrian government might think that sanctions are a better alternative at the end of the day."
Marwan Kabalan,"Nobody listens, nobody reads. You have a very small circle of decision-makers in charge of decisions in the country. What do you expect?"
Marwan Kabalan,"Syria can't be important unless it plays its regional cards. This country is not wealthy and it doesn't have enough oil to be influential. We are playing the role of a bad student at school. If you don't make trouble, no one will pay attention to you."

Jaroslaw Kaczynski,I hope we will manage to create a coalition. I have reasons to believe this is a realistic perspective.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,I'm convinced this will allow us to slowly build a majority in parliament and allow backing for the government until 2009.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,"In our relations with Russia you need to be patient and avoid provocations, but if events like the recent ones take place, you have to tell the truth -- cowardice is only an encouragement."
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,We will submit this motion (to dissolve parliament) shortly so that elections could take place before the Pope's visit to Poland (on May 25-28).
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,Russia needs to accept that Poland is an independent player in this part of Europe and no doubt this will be a long and difficult process.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,"This was the first conversation, we will hold further meetings."
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,"We have won. Everything indicates that we have won, but this is only the beginning."
Jaroslaw Kaczynski,"We just signed an agreement that I am deeply certain will lead to the creation of a lasting majority in parliament, which will rule until (the term ends) in 2009."
Pauline Kael,"The words Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which I saw on an Italian movie poster, are perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of movies"
Pauline Kael,"Watching old movies is like spending an evening with those people next door. They bore us, and we wouldn't go out of our way to see them; we drop in on them because they're so close. If it took some effort to see old movies, we might try to find out which were the good ones, and if people saw only the good ones maybe they would still respect old movies. As it is, people sit and watch movies that audiences walked out on thirty years ago. Like Lot's wife, we are tempted to take another look, attracted not by evil but by something that seems much more shameful -- our own innocence."
Pauline Kael,"Brando represented a reaction against the postwar mania for security. As a protagonist, the Brando of the early 50's had no code, only his instincts. He was a development from the gangster and the outlaw."
Pauline Kael,Just about the best Hollywood musical of all time.
Pauline Kael,"In this country we encourage creativity among the mediocre, but real bursting creativity appalls us. We put it down as undisciplined, as somehow too much."
Pauline Kael,A book might be written on the injustice of the just.
Pauline Kael,Trash has given us an appetite for art
Pauline Kael,Trash has given us an appetite for art.
Pauline Kael,The first prerogative of an artist in any medium is to make a fool of himself.

Pauline Kael,"A mistake in judgment isn't fatal, but too much anxiety about judgment is."
Pauline Kael,"It seems likely that many of the young who don't wait for others to call them artists, but simply announce that they are, don't have the patience to make art."
Pauline Kael,"In the arts, the critic is the only independent source of information. The rest is advertising."
Pauline Kael,The critic is the only independent source of information. The rest is advertising.
Pauline Kael,Kevin Costner has feathers in his hair and feathers in his head. The Indians should have called him 'Plays with Camera.'
Pauline Kael,This movie is a toupee made up to look like honest baldness.
Pauline Kael,"I see little of more importance to the future of our country and of civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist. If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him."
Pauline Kael,One of the surest signs of the Philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down.
Pauline Kael,"Where there is a will, there is a way. If there is a chance in a million that you can do something, anything, to keep what you want from ending, do it. Pry the door open or, if need be, wedge your foot in that door and keep it open."
Pauline Kael,Citizen Kane is perhaps the one American talking picture that seems as fresh now as the day it opened. It may seem even fresher.
Kato Kaelin,"Thoughts would go in and out of my mind, but I didn't want to believe that he could have done it."
Kato Kaelin,"The circumstance is the incredible part, but I always knew in my heart that something was going to be out there, just for the world to notice me. It sounds so cocky, but it's happening."
Kato Kaelin,"Sometimes people who get wealthy when they are very, very young, it's a curse to them. They don't realize it."
Kato Kaelin,Sometimes people just want you to fail. Except your really good friends. I've always known who my best friends were.
Kato Kaelin,"People should realize that I shot a Coke commercial back in 1986. So, you know, I've been around a long time. I carry my Screen Actors Guild Card."
Kato Kaelin,Never live with someone that won the Heisman.
Kato Kaelin,It's incredible when I'm out in these towns. I have people telling me they were waiting for hours just to meet me and get my autograph. I feel so guilty. I always feel like I have to give them more than just Kato Kaelin.
Kato Kaelin,"If there's something that you hear on TV about me, just call me and I'll tell you if it's true."
Kato Kaelin,"I'm the guy, I'm kind of like the, uh, Everyman, so I think people just relate to that."
Kato Kaelin,"I'm not going to just fade out, I know."
Kato Kaelin,I'm not afraid of O.J. now.
Kato Kaelin,I'm doing comedy development at National Lampoon.
Kato Kaelin,"I was never OJ's closest pal, and the media would say that over and over, but I wasn't his enemy either."
Kato Kaelin,I was at an acting academy for seven years prior to the trial.
Kato Kaelin,I want people to realize that the domestic abuse charges happened in 1989. I didn't meet any of them until 1993.
Kato Kaelin,"I thought it was possible that O.J. could have done something. It crossed my mind. I was thinking about the events of everything and going, Why did I hear that? I was going, No, it can't be, and just all that stuff was adding up."
Kato Kaelin,I think the prosecution had all the evidence in front of them to have won the case.
Kato Kaelin,I think that money is the root of all evil. I've seen it happen.
Kato Kaelin,I have contact with no one involved in the trial.
Kato Kaelin,I ended up living at OJ's because Nicole bought a home that no longer had a guest house. OJ offered his guest house to me. Anybody in LA looking for a place knows the best places to live are guest houses.
Kato Kaelin,"I don't want to be Kato, the trial guy. It's like everything I do is under a microscope."
Kato Kaelin,I believe in my heart Simpson is guilty.
Kato Kaelin,"At the time that I knew them, they were not living together. They began dating again after their divorce, so I didn't really see fighting."
Kato Kaelin,"It's a show where I go across America, I knock on doors of the unsuspecting and invite myself in to spend a weekend with the family,"
Franz Kafka,"In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite."
Franz Kafka,Now I can look at you in peace; I don't eat you anymore
Franz Kafka,"All human errors are impatience, a premature breaking off of methodical procedure, an apparent fencing-in of what is apparently at issue."
Franz Kafka,"In the fight between you and the world, back the world."
Franz Kafka,"I can prove at any time that my education tried to make another person out of me than the one I became. It is for the harm, therefore, that my educators could have done me in accordance with their intentions that I reproach them; I demand from their hands the person I now am, and since they cannot give him to me, I make of my reproach and laughter a drumbeat sounding in the world beyond."
Franz Kafka,"Don't despair, not even over the fact that you don't despair"
Franz Kafka,"From the true antagonist, illimitable courage is transmitted to you"

Paul Kagame,"We cannot turn the clock back nor can we undo the harm caused, but we have the power to determine the future and to ensure that what happened never happens again."
Paul Kagame,There are some who are scared by unity and by building a country on the basis of ideas.
Paul Kagame,I firmly believe that these two issues ... constitute the ultimate solution to the conflict. We are more than willing to resolve this issue once and for all.
Paul Kagame,Let no one think that flexibility and a predisposition to compromise is a sign of weakness or a sell-out.
Andy Kahan,"The rest of their lives, they're pegged and targeted."
Andy Kahan,"I think that's a big difference. If the ones in the program aren't coming back to society, what's the purpose? If you're going to do it, do it for the ones that are coming out."
Andy Kahan,"You're asking the most cunning, secretive and diabolical type of felon to be part of the honor system. It's always been befuddling to me."
Andy Kahan,"There is no authority, there is no certain agency that monitors these types of offenders."
Andy Kahan,I certainly would endorse and support any legislation that would give those types of offenders the ability to appeal their registration process.
Brewster Kahle,"If a band posts restrictions as to what materials can be put on the archive, there is a self-appointed sense of making sure the that the band's wishes are observed,"
Brewster Kahle,"More and more people are expecting access, and they are making do with what they can get easy access to. Let's make it so that they find great works rather than whatever just happens to be on the [Internet]."
Brewster Kahle,"The opportunity before all of us is living up to the dream of the Library of Alexandria and then taking it a step further -- universal access to all knowledge. Interestingly, it is now technically doable,"

Brewster Kahle,Other projects talk about snippets. We don't talk about snippets. We talk about books.
Alfred Kahn,"It's like saying, 'We've got 95 percent of the benefits of deregulation -- why bother going for the rest?'"
Alfred Kahn,It turned out that their problems were far more fundamental (than September 11).
Alfred Kahn,"We are very excited about partnering with Microsoft to share the 'Viva Piâ€“ata' universe with the world. The potent combination of the Microsoft Game Studios and 4Kids will ensure that the 'Viva Piâ€“ata' world, including the video game, television series and merchandising program, attracts a worldwide audience."
Alfred Kahn,The increasing status of Xbox 360 as the premiere next generation digital gaming and entertainment system makes this the perfect time to introduce a carefully orchestrated licensing program that expands the Xbox brand.
Alfred Kahn,"We have built an impressive roster of captivating and successful children's entertainment properties. Given the increased number of brands that we are representing that focus on an older audience, we felt it would be beneficial to organize a new subsidiary primarily devoted to the marketing and licensing of these brands. We believe that we can successfully utilize our marketing and licensing expertise to build brand value for properties targeting an older consumer that are not necessarily media or character driven."
Alfred Kahn,"Nobody could fly an airplane commercially on any route without specific permission from the Civil Aeronautics Board, and price competition, cutting prices, was illegal."
Oliver Kahn,"We are Bayern Munich and English teams always have trouble as soon as they leave the island,"
Oliver Kahn,I'll have to do everything I can to make sure that I can take the pitch pain-free.
Oliver Kahn,"We are a really good group now, we were unlucky not to score against Latvia and we'll get luck on our side too,"
Oliver Kahn,"We played well, but we had a little bit of luck today. We can't take our lead over Bremen too seriously -- these things change fast in football."
Oliver Kahn,"We lacked determination and we weren't completely in the game,"
Oliver Kahn,"Bremen are really playing well at the moment, despite the defeat to Lyon, ... They are making a very strong impression on me and we are really going to have to be at our best next week."
Oliver Kahn,Perhaps this defeat will make us more aggressive and we will react by turning in a fantastic display in Milan.
Oliver Kahn,Maybe this defeat will make us aggressive and lead us to such a reaction that we can produce a great game in Milan.
Oliver Kahn,"I have a contract until 2006 which I would like to fulfil but certain circumstances occur again and again and we have reached a solution (with Bayern),"
Oliver Kahn,"To think that this might be to our advantage would be the dumbest things to do, ... It may be a bluff, anyway."
Richard Kahn,The combination of risk factors doesn't add up to a more significant or higher cardiovascular risk than the individual components.
Richard Kahn,"The combination of risk factors doesn't add up to a more significant or higher cardiovascular risk than the individual components,"
Richard Kahn,We greatly support the idea of helping people with diabetes better manage their disease. We also are concerned with information about a person's individual medical condition becoming publicly known.
Kasey Kahne,This is a great victory. The guys did an awesome job. They gave me the best car out there. I've always loved coming to Texas and racing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans out there. It's one of the best places we go all season long. ... This is awesome.
Kasey Kahne,"I really don't regret it at all,"
Kasey Kahne,The car was perfect through the entire race.
Kasey Kahne,"This is behind us now. As a team, our focus is on the upcoming events and the future."
Kasey Kahne,These are definitely the hardest cars I've driven -- ever.
Abdul Kalam,The product being internationally competitive it is able to service a large market with availability in time and state of the art performance at reduced costs per unit.
Abdul Kalam,Science leads to development of technologies. Availability of technologies leads to products.
Abdul Kalam,not to allow problems to rule you.
Abdul Kalam,"Nuclear power generation has been given a thrust by the use of uranium-based fuel [which US is set to supply to India if the deal comes through]. However, there would be a requirement for ten-fold increase in nuclear power generation even to attain a reasonable degree of energy self-sufficiency for our country."
Abdul Kalam,There are forces in life working for you and against you. One must distinguish the beneficial forces from the malevolent ones and choose correctly between them.
Abdul Kalam,"You have done a wonderful job,"
Abdul Kalam,"On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, I would like to convey to you and to the people of Pakistan our heartfelt sympathies."
Abdul Kalam,To line only for some unknown future is superficial.
Abdul Kalam,"We need to create brand institutions. In the fortune 500 companies, 5 Indian companies are named while 15 are from China though we have similar kind of populations."
Abdul Kalam,My government is committed towards creating such an environment so that the latent potential of our people can blossom and create a new India of our dreams.
Abdul Kalam,"India must achieve the real goal?that is energy independence or an economy which will function well within total freedom from oil, gas or coal imports."
Abdul Kalam,"The entire country is with you,"
John Kaleo,"I started the game and played about halfway through the game. To get hurt in the 3rd quarter and watch in the 4th quarter was tough, ... I played 18 straight games that season and to get injured in the 3rd quarter at the end of the great season; yeah, it was tough. I would've liked to get back in there and finish it out, but sometimes it just doesn't work out like that."
John Kaleo,"I think Shane is one of the most promising young guns in arena football, ... I think it's just a matter of time before he experiences winning a championship in his career and I don't think he's even reached his full potential yet. He's not young like he used to be, but I think he's just getting in to his best years now and I expect a lot of great things out of Shane Stafford."
John Kaleo,"I'd like to give coaching a try, either in the arena league or at the college level and get into that in some capacity, ... I have some options to consider, I've had a career in real estate outside of football for the past few years so I could always fall back on that."
Al Kaline,You've got to get good habits of working hard so that when that play comes up during the regular season that you're able to complete it and do it the right way.
Al Kaline,What gets me upset about with the newer players is their lack of intensity. They tend to go through the motions a little bit. They don't understand that you've got to practice the way you play.
Al Kaline,Switching to the outfield was the best break I ever got.
Al Kaline,It hurt me a great deal. It put a lot of pressure on me because I was at a young age and the writers around here and throughout the league starting comparing me to Cobb. It put a lot of pressure on me.
Al Kaline,I'll never forget that first night with the team. Going to the ballpark on the bus was the hardest 30 minutes of my life. I had to walk down that aisle between all the players. I really didn't know too much about the Detroit Tigers at that time.
Al Kaline,"I was very, very shocked about Cooperstown. I thought my chances were fairly good, but I tried to stay low key about it, not too high and not too low. That was the way I played, too."
Al Kaline,I started in for the ball but I just couldn't get it. I should have caught it because I was used to catching everything on the sandlots. But they hit the ball a lot harder in the major leagues and I just couldn't reach the ball this time.
Al Kaline,"I didn't know who was on the team, but I saw every eye as I walked down the aisle. It looked like a thousand eyes were staring right at me saying, 'Who is this young punk?' I just kept my eyes straight ahead."
Al Kaline,"As the days went on, I didn't mind the games. In fact, I looked forward to them. That was the easiest part of all. I couldn't wait to get to the ballpark I'd be the first one there and I was willing to do anything. I think that's why the veterans liked me."
Al Kaline,All of a sudden I'm in the major leagues and we're traveling from town to town. I see the other players dressing different every day. I've got only one suit and I keep wearing it over and over. I'm really embarrassed.
Jacques Kallis,We'll have a peaceful night away from the game and we'll decide tomorrow morning what we want to do and what the plan is for the day.
Jacques Kallis,"It's now up to the players to repay the good faith of the selectors and produce the results, even though four months of playing Australia does wear you out and the bodies are tired."
Jacques Kallis,There may be a few nerves before his first over in test cricket but he seems a relaxed sort of guy so hopefully he can put in a big performance. He couldn't ask for a better stage than at the SCG.
Jacques Kallis,It does give the guys a lot of confidence going into the next few Test matches. We know they'll bounce back. The (Perth) wicket was pretty flat.
Jacques Kallis,It has given the guys a lot of confidence.
Jacques Kallis,"It's a difficult place to get in, it takes a few extra balls because of the bounce."
James Kallstrom,"There was no finding that any of those charges were valid. From my knowledge, the two investigations were voluminous and took literally years to complete."
James Kallstrom,"It would probably not be an efficient use of these resources, minus specific information,"
James Kallstrom,This'll be reflective of the times we live in. The consequences of attacking here could have more significance to the terrorists. It has a lot of symbolism. It's going to be extremely well protected.
Kamal,"The four ministerial candidates are gathering more and more support,"
Kamal,"There is no evidence to support this, ... This is just an unlikely assumption. If that were the case, then there would have been gunmen with the suicide bombers. There were no gunmen."
Kamal,"It's part of Test cricket, you can get out on a good first ball or you get out on the 300th delivery,"
Kamal,"As notebook PCs become ubiquitous for computing, entertainment, and communication, the need for improved visual performance and longer battery life become paramount, ... The innovations by BOE HYDIS clearly point to a future where brighter, higher contrast, and wider viewing angle displays are possible while keeping both the cost and power consumption down."
Dean Kamen,"It's up to you to work with them to make it interesting for them to want to pursue engineering. You need to instill the passion for tools and science, as much as they now have for nonsense."
Dean Kamen,"The goal is to create in the culture passion among kids to do something. I think the trouble is our culture does create a passion for kids, but their passion is related to one of two industries: entertainment or sports."
Dean Kamen,"Innovation needs to be nurtured throughout an organization. Management is doing things right, whereas leadership is doing the right things."
Dean Kamen,"I don't know what innovation is, but I can give a guide to rude realities and somewhat serious suggestions about innovation and how to approach it."
Dean Kamen,"One of my biggest fears before we went public was, people would think of this as a toy, ... We think it's much more than that."
Dean Kamen,"We can't live any more in a world which is based on stuff and not ideas. If you want to live with the world of stuff, we're all doomed."
Dean Kamen,"To me, innovations are the wheel, fire, language, movable type. There are not 3 million innovations; there are 3 million inventions."
Dean Kamen,"There is just so much stuff in the world that, to me, is devoid of any real substance, value, and content that I just try to make sure that I am working on things that matter."
Dean Kamen,Sometimes we crash and burn. It's better to do it in private.
Dean Kamen,"People take the longest possible paths, digress to numerous dead ends, and make all kinds of mistakes. Then historians come along and write summaries of this messy, nonlinear process and make it appear like a simple, straight line."
Dean Kamen,"New ideas in technology are literally a dime-a-dozen, or cheaper than that."
Dean Kamen,My biggest worry is I'm running out of time and energy. Thirty years ago I thought 10 years was a really long time.
Dean Kamen,My biggest failure is I have too many to talk about.
Dean Kamen,"Most of the time you will fail, but you will also occasionally succeed. Those occasional successes make all the hard work and sacrifice worthwhile."
Dean Kamen,"In some cases, inventions prohibit innovation because we're so caught up in playing with the technology, we forget about the fact that it was supposed to be important."
Dean Kamen,"If you're going to fail, you might as well fail at the big ones."
Dean Kamen,"If history is any indication, all truths will eventually turn out to be false."
Dean Kamen,I'm a human entropy producer.
Dean Kamen,"I think an education is not only important, it is the most important thing you can do with your life."
Dean Kamen,"I started realizing that I wasn't so dumb; rather, most people simply didn't know the answers to the questions that I was interested in-or they didn't care."
Dean Kamen,"I do not want to waste any time. And if you are not working on important things, you are wasting time."
Dean Kamen,I consider high-speed data transmission an invention that became a major innovation. It changed the way we all communicate.
Dean Kamen,Everybody has to be able to participate in a future that they want to live for. That's what technology can do.
Dean Kamen,"As we move towards 8 or 10 billion people on the planet, there's a little less gold per capita. Each one of us will continue to be fighting over an ever smaller percentage of total resources. This is not a happy thought."
Dean Kamen,"An innovation is one of those things that society looks at and says, if we make this part of the way we live and work, it will change the way we live and work."
Dean Kamen,"A patent, or invention, is any assemblage of technologies or ideas that you can put together that nobody put together that way before. That's how the patent office defines it. That's an invention."
Dean Kamen,The city needs a car like a fish needs a bicycle.
Dean Kamen,I don't want to think about how many people have thought or still think that I'm crazy.
Dean Kamen,I don't work on a project unless I believe that it will dramatically improve life for a bunch of people.
Dean Kamen,"Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections."
Dean Kamen,You have teenagers thinking they're going to make millions as NBA stars when that's not realistic for even 1 percent of them. Becoming a scientist or engineer is.
Dean Kamen,I'd rather lose my own money than someone else's.
Bob Kane,What I read is so distorted that I cannot believe that the person they are talking about is myself.
Bob Kane,"This sounds like my autobiography, but I thought this would be a good time to sound off about myself, as I think that I have been silent too long about my views and opinions."
Bob Kane,"There are certain characters Bill Finger created, aside from my main characters' and many other characters that I created, including the Batmobile."
Bob Kane,The New Look of Batman is more illustrative and realistic.
Bob Kane,"Much is written about the Batman because he is publicly exposed in print. Very little is known personally about his creator, because I haven't given out that many interviews."
Bob Kane,"It's been 25 years now, and truthfully, time sometimes blurs the memory."
Bob Kane,It took them a while to catch on that Batman would be the greatest.
Bob Kane,"It is difficult to separate, at times, the myth from the truth."
Bob Kane,"In the Golden Age of Batman, I penciled, inked, and lettered my strip by myself."
Bob Kane,"If you ever want to get the facts straight about me or the Batman, please write to the original source, myself, for the truth, instead of second guessing."
Bob Kane,"If Bill Finger created Batman, where is Bill Finger's byline on my strip? It is conspicuous by its absence."
Bob Kane,"I've often been asked, do I like the New Look Batman better than the old look. My answer to that question is, Emphatically, no!!"
Bob Kane,I was involved with the Batman. There are two sides to every story. Now you've heard my side.
Bob Kane,I intend to explode the myths about myself and get down to the real truth about the legend that is Batman.
Bob Kane,I feel that my original style was much more unique and individual and was much more the real me. It had much more zing and schmaltz.
Bob Kane,I didn't have the time to literally write and draw the strip at the same time.
Bob Kane,"I created the title, masthead, the format and concept, as well as the Batman figure and costume. Robin, the boy wonder, was also my idea."
Bob Kane,I created Batman about 10 years before Ian Fleming created James Bond.
Bob Kane,I am planning a one-man art show of original Batman oil paintings that I will show in New York City.
Bob Kane,I am also a writer. That is a fact not known by the public in general.
Bob Kane,How can an article about me or the Batman be the true story when I am not consulted or interviewed?
Bob Kane,Batman has been acknowledged as a legend in my lifetime.
Bob Kane,"Although Bill Finger literally typed the scripts in the early days, he wrote the scripts from ideas that we mutually collaborated on. Many of the unique concepts and story twists also came from my own fertile imagination."
Bob Kane,"After it is said and done about who does what on the Batman assembly line, I do not underestimate all of the help I've received."
Bob Kane,When I first drew him I had eyes in there and it didn't look right.
Bob Kane,"The trouble with being a ghostwriter or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without credit. If one wants the credit, one has to cease being a ghost and become a leader or innovator."
John Kane,"Dirk's a guy that's very capable of doing that any night. He's slowly been playing a lot better. If he can stay there and the rest of us can keep up, then hopefully we'll have a better third of the season."
John Kane,The public interest is best served by the free exchange of ideas.
John Kane,We just fouled too much tonight. We hurt ourselves. We would get a little momentum and then we would send them to the free-throw line.
John Kane,"We have to take a vote, ... Im only one commissioner, but absolutely, it would be my desire to have it annually."
John Kane,"We have to take a vote, ... Iâ€™m only one commissioner, but absolutely, it would be my desire to have it annually."
John Kane,"We just want to remind them of our agreement with the board,"
Matt Kane,"We made some bad defensive mistakes. We got caught flat-footed early on. At times, though, we were dominant."
Matt Kane,I thought we were going to be a lot better. I think the kids thought we were going to be a lot better. It just didn't happen.
Matt Kane,We just had some bad defensive mistakes and were caught flat a few times and gave up a few goals. I thought we actually played better throughout the game and dominated parts of it but we can't give up bad goals and win and not score.
Matt Kane,Paul has been a nice surprise. He grew up playing goalie and brings a lot of experience.
Patrick Kane,"We're in this together. We're tied together in our economic futures. Our economic futures, the development of our health care, are all tied together."
Patrick Kane,"When we find a problem, we have service excellence teams that work through them."
Patrick Kane,I believe it. Everyone wants to solve that one. But who is a more likely candidate to do this than him?

Khieu Kanharith,"China is a powerful country, especially in economics, and it also plays a big role as member of the UN."
Khieu Kanharith,"We will take legal action. They want a confrontation, a clash, but it is better to take legal action against the leader, not crack down on the people."
Immanuel Kant,"No-one can compel me to be happy in accordance with his conception of the welfare of others, for each may seek his happiness in whatever way he sees fit, so long as he does not infringe upon the freedom of others to pursue a similar end which can be reconciled with the freedom of everyone else within a workable general law  i.e. he must accord to others the same right as he enjoys himself."
Immanuel Kant,Perpetual Peace is only found in the graveyard

Immanuel Kant,"Happiness is not an ideal of reason, but of imagination."
Immanuel Kant,What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?
Immanuel Kant,"All the interests of my reason, speculative as well as practical, combine in the three following questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?"
Immanuel Kant,"All thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters, relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us."
Immanuel Kant,To be is to do.
Immanuel Kant,Nothing is divine but what is agreeable to reason.

Immanuel Kant,"The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason."
Immanuel Kant,In law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others. In ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.
Immanuel Kant,It is beyond a doubt that all our knowledge that begins with experience.
Immanuel Kant,"Man must be disciplined, for he is by nature raw and wild"
Immanuel Kant,He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.

Immanuel Kant,May you live your life as if the maxim of your actions were to become universal law.

Robert D. Kaplan,It is a cliche these days to observe that the United States now possesses a global empire - different from Britain's and Rome's but an empire nonetheless.
Robert D. Kaplan,"What happened on September 11th is at least, theoretically, small stuff compared to what can happen."
Robert D. Kaplan,The most important thing I learned as a foreign correspondent in about 80 countries is that it takes a very shallow knowledge of history to think that there are solutions to most problems.
Steve Kaplan,"The case revolves around four types of evidence. (The man who gave the tip) having intimate knowledge of the incident, the description of the incident, incriminating statements Mr. Poole made to the authorities, and the other crimes Mr. Poole has been charged with."
Steve Kaplan,I made some bad judgments. I hurt many feelings and I'm sorry for that.

Steve Kaplan,Justice had been delayed by (MacLean's) fraudulent action claiming he was too ill to face trial. Justice has not been denied.
Gabe Kapler,"That's probably the best perspective in the park. My favorite one was the strike three pitch he threw Giambi that kind of went straight, cut in and then ran back on the plate for a strike."
Gabe Kapler,"It was an amazing performance because it's not easy to sit through a long rain delay and have the same intensity. It's not easy to start and stop, and that's what Matt did successfully. When you start and stop, it's easy to bow out of the situation, but he didn't do it. And he was rewarded for it."
Gabe Kapler,"As an athlete, you have to have that feeling that you can beat the odds, come back sooner than expected. Otherwise, the guys who are like, 'What's going to happen?', those guys it takes three months longer. It's better to have the reverse attitude."
Gabe Kapler,This team has done something the past two days that should go down in history as an incredible accomplishment. And what David Ortiz has done is miraculous. He's carried us on his shoulders.
Mitch Kapor,"Well, I was fortunate enough to be able to self-fund to start, but I had no intention of self-funding forever, and so I needed a model that would be sustainable."
Mitch Kapor,"I think there are questions about whether there will continue to be a real basis for innovation and open platforms. If they don't permit true innovation and true openness, it will not provide maximum benefit to the people."
Mitch Kapor,The organizational design for OSAF came about as a result of thinking about how to create an organization that could make these products and bring them into the world and help start something in which they could thrive in the long term.
Mitch Kapor,"We've already gotten a significant grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and a university consortium. I think the whole sector of Foundations, potentially with government support, is promising - more than promising, I think, it's substantial."
Mitch Kapor,"That's why it has to be a nonprofit, because a nonprofit is required to take monies it receives and use them for the purposes for which it's chartered by the government. It can't be pocketed."
Mitch Kapor,"I was trying to figure out what to do next, I'd been accumulating ideas for productivity tools - software people could use every day, particularly to help organize their lives."
Mitch Kapor,"Well, I had a lot of help from my father with the soldering and so on, and he was very good at math and was fascinated with computers, and so I was fortunate enough to have a bunch of exposure going all the way back to high school - this was in the 1960s."
Mitch Kapor,I actually built a tiny computer as a junior high school project.
Mitch Kapor,"No, my family is Russian, Georgian, via Ellis Island."
Mitch Kapor,"The culmination of all of that was the decision to start a company, which became Lotus, to do a product, which became 1-2-3. By the time I reached that point it had been four years, and it felt like a lifetime, but really it was kind of evolutionary."
Alex Kapranos,"For years, I felt miserable about being an outsider, but then I suddenly embraced it, ... I saw the value of being an outsider. It was liberating. You didn't have to worry about trying to fit in or losing your insider status. It also encouraged you to challenge and provoke the status quo."
Alex Kapranos,"It's easy to get discouraged sometimes when you listen to American rock radio because everything is so bland, so self-referential,"
Alex Kapranos,"I want to make music that will make the blood surge in your veins, music that will get people up and dance."
Alex Kapranos,"You're letting such a fragile side of yourself out when you're creating or writing music. To do that with people who are almost strangers would seem very strange to me. I think that we're very lucky that we're quite close. To us, it's almost like the band is the grandest possible adventure you can go on with your friends. It's really really exciting."
Alex Kapranos,"[The Kinks'] Ray Davies had that great symbiotic relationship between the music and the emotional content of the lyric. Think of 'Waterloo Sunset.' It had all those great backing vocals, and that change of key from major to minor that gives it such soaring poignancy."
Alex Kapranos,The speaker is not always the author. [In 'Michael'] I was writing about an erotic situation between two male friends. It didn't strike me as that odd. It seemed like a good subject for a song.
Alex Kapranos,It would be great to get the Christmas number one. I suppose we could even write something special for Christmas. I think Santa Loves Franz Ferdinand sounds pretty good.
Alex Kapranos,"But I've heard so many great bands from America over the years that I know there's an audience for something else, and that's what we feel at the shows a hunger for that."
Alex Kapranos,"You can always have it better. If you try. That's the attitude of the group at the moment. Never to feel satisfied, always to want to do something better."
Alex Kapranos,"But I've heard so many great bands from America over the years that I know there's an audience for something else, and that's what we feel at the shows â€” a hunger for that."
Ryszard Kapuscinski,"First you destroy those who create values. Then you destroy those who know what the values are, and who also know that those destroyed before were in fact the creators of values. But real barbarism begins when no one can any longer judge or know that what he does is barbaric."
Ryszard Kapuscinski,Our salvation is in striving to achieve what we know we'll never achieve.
Ryszard Kapuscinski,There is a lack of critical assessment of the past. But you have to understand that the current ruling elite is actually the old ruling elite. So they are incapable of a self-critical approach to the past.
Ryszard Kapuscinski,The extent of one man's guilt may be defined by how much of it is experienced by the party he injured.
Ryszard Kapuscinski,"Although a system may cease to exist in the legal sense or as a structure of power, its values (or anti-values), its philosophy, its teachings remain in us. They rule our thinking, our conduct, our attitude to others. The situation is a demonic paradox: we have toppled the system but we still carry its genes."
Ryszard Kapuscinski,"In a society of little economic development, universal inactivity accompanies universal poverty. You survive not by struggling against nature, or by increasing production, or by relentless labor; instead you survive by expending as little energy as possible, by striving constantly to achieve a state of immobility."
Ryszard Kapuscinski,Do not be misled by the fact that you are at liberty and relatively free; that for the moment you are not under lock and key: you have simply been granted a reprieve.
Ryszard Kapuscinski,When is a crisis reached? When questions arise that can't be answered.
Ryszard Kapuscinski,"In the tropics the white feels weakened, or downright weak, whence comes the heightened tendency to outbursts of aggression. People who are polite, modest or even humble in Europe fall easily into a rage here, get into fights, destroy other people. . ."
Donna Karan,"I love oils â€” I'm oil-obsessed, ... I really do think oils are the purest essences there are â€” unspoiled, untainted, luxurious."
Donna Karan,"Today, fashion is really about sensuality - how a woman feels on the inside. In the eighties women used suits with exaggerated shoulders and waists to make a strong impression. Women are now more comfortable with themselves and their bodies - they no longer feel the need to hide behind their clothes."
Donna Karan,Everything in life... has to have balance.
Donna Karan,"Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul."
Donna Karan,Evening is a time of real experimentation. You never want to look the same way.
Donna Karan,"Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable."
Donna Karan,Delete the negative; accentuate the positive!
Donna Karan,Accent your positive and delete your negative.
Donna Karan,I feel very strongly about dresses on every level - a dress feels like underpinning.
Donna Karan,We've come a long way. Power dressing now is designed to let the woman inside us come through.
Donna Karan,I'd rather promote New York than anything else in this world because New York to me means the world.
Donna Karan,"I love building spaces: architecture, furniture, all of it, probably more than fashion. The development procedure is more tactile. It's about space and form and it's something you can share with other people."
Abdul Karim,"I've been looking forward to seeing the trial of the criminal, ... I feel that my sister's soul will not go wasted if I could see Saddam dead."
Abdul Karim,"I'll say yes, yes to the constitution with all 10 of my fingers, ... My daughters were so excited, and I wanted the new generation to see democracy."
Abdul Karim,Even a teenager here can identify pure gold. So we cannot afford any cheating.

Islom Karimov,"When there is life and mankind, a person will live striving for good deeds, liberty and a bright life, and wish that goodness and justice will reign in the world."
Islom Karimov,I say there is not more happiness for me than the freedom of my Homeland.
Islom Karimov,Your destiny is my destiny. Your happiness is my happiness.
Paul Kariya,"I didn't really think about the breakaway situation much because I was just trying to settle the puck down. But it was nice to help the team win. I didn't think I played good overall, but it was nice to get the two points."
Paul Kariya,They are a great hockey club and a very disciplined hockey club. With our speed we got some more power plays today and that was crucial.
Paul Kariya,"When you have a game like that, you just figure you have to learn from your mistakes. We've just got to get better. It was a bad effort all the way around."
Paul Kariya,"I saw Marty score top glove, so that was in the back of my mind. We still want to get home ice in the playoffs, so there's plenty of work to do."
Paul Kariya,I think part of it is luck. Some years you just happen to get injured and other years you don't. I don't think I've done anything different.
Paul Kariya,"When a team's down, you've got to keep them down and not give them any life. We didn't do that and it's something that throughout the year we have to improve upon."
Paul Kariya,That's why home-ice is so important.
Paul Kariya,"They showed a commitment to me that I was the guy they wanted to bring to Nashville, and I was very excited about their hockey club."
George Karl,"When you have Ruben Patterson and Reggie Evans out there? When you don't know what play to run, just let them play? Let them go into the backyard, lower the fence and let the dogs go do it."
George Karl,"I don't think I was as vocal with the four-letter words as I normally am, but I still got a few in there."
George Karl,"There were a lot of nice words, ... It helps keep your spirits up."
George Karl,"I do give Kenyon some understanding that he's going through a tough year. I know he's very frustrated. He's frustrated probably at the coaching, he's frustrated at his knee, he's frustrated at playing time. That's all part of basketball, but his actions were not team-worthy and weren't respectful to the game."
George Karl,That's probably been my No. 1 trait this season: I haven't lost my cool. I think I've been more understanding than angry. It might be time to get angry.
George Karl,Sometimes I think we try to overcomplicate it. Truth of the matter is you probably should just vote the honest way. I think you have to reward the guys who you think are All-Stars.
George Karl,"The truth of the matter is, we're not far away from where we should be. We can complain about the problem or we can go out and solve the problem. I choose to go out and try to solve the problem."
George Karl,We've always worked through it. We've always picked ourselves up. I trust this team is going to do the same thing on Thursday.
George Karl,"If we make that extra pass, we'll find the 3-pointer and hit them. At times, we don't trust that extra pass. But you can say the same thing about 25 of the other 30 teams in the league."
George Karl,"I don't think there's anything other than a hard hit to the head. He had trouble getting his equilibrium back, but I think he's going to be fine."
George Karl,It's a bad hand you're dealt when your best player is in foul trouble and you're down 15 and 20 points.
George Karl,"They're going to get their minutes from foul trouble, 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes. They've got to learn how to play that way. That's what they're going to get early in their careers. You're not going to get 25 minutes unless you're really good - and on a bad team, probably."
George Karl,"The one strength of this team is when it's been down, it fights back, and when its back is against the wall, it plays stronger and more together. It's hard to even evaluate the (past) two games because of the lack of commitment in so many areas of basketball were lacking."
George Karl,"It's scary when you undergo something like that. But I did a lot of research, so I knew what I was getting into. And then it becomes less scary."
George Karl,"I would never predict a run like that. Last season, that's beyond reality. I think we can go 25-14. I think we can play 10 games over .500, even more than (that) over .500, and that would be a great run. Any time you go 30-15 or something like that, that's pretty incredible basketball."
George Karl,I like the way we played. It was the most complete offensive performance we've had all season.
George Karl,"I think it's probably a list of five or six things. It's pain, it's not scoring, not being more involved in the offense, not playing more minutes. The list is incredibly long, probably."
George Karl,"He felt it would guarantee that it would remove the pain. Eddie has been playing so well and been such a factor with his defensive aggressiveness, he wants to continue at that level."
George Karl,"I think from a coaching standpoint, this season had a lot of magic to it. There were also a lot of issues."
George Karl,"He's a young kid who is going to be asked great questions, and he's not always going to have knowledge to answer them. But he wants to be a leader. I really like that."
George Karl,Pat Riley has lost three of four in the first round. I guess [Rivers has] got to study history a little more.
George Karl,"A lot of times, I hate to say this, I've realized in time that there's lots of times coaches have to go, and there are times in basketball that players need to be moved."
George Karl,"We were a happy team, but not a serious team. They were a playoff-serious team who knew they had to win this game."
George Karl,We had a 68-60 lead and the next eight points were gifts. We could never get the momentum back.
George Karl,This was as intense a game as we've had all season long. There is an intensity between these two teams as a result of the playoff series a few years ago.
George Karl,It's my Chinese fortune cookie. The year of the rabbit. The year of the cat. It's the year of the Nuggets. Forget about last year. Let's learn from what happened last year. Let's move on to 2006 and have a great 2006.
George Karl,"In January, he put this team on his back and saved the season when we had every excuse and every reason to give into the schedule, to give into the situations. Surviving January was an incredible statement by Carmelo."
George Karl,"Last year we had a different mentality of a honeymoon, excitement, enthusiasm. This year we've had very good moments. In general, I would say we've had a very good year, but we have to become more consistent."
George Karl,I thought our energy and focus were good tonight.
George Karl,"Kenyon wears his emotions on his sleeve. Sometimes I probably still do it, too. I don't know what (happened). I support Kenyon and I support the league. The league is trying to police and control actions (of players). This (the fine) will probably be good for (Martin)."
George Karl,It's a huge disappointment. This is not a team looking to play in the right direction.
George Karl,"My determination is to get this team ready for a playoff run, and a good playoff run, ... I think we're in position to do that."
George Karl,"I thought we had to win out (before Wednesday). Right now, our destiny is going to be difficult."
George Karl,I love New Orleans. I hope it recovers. I think the NBA has shown its desire and spirit to support the fans and the citizens of the city.
George Karl,"He needed help. He needed someone else to help space the court, space the defense away from him. We never could find that guy."
George Karl,"I was surprised at how many came from out of the country, ... They came from Sweden, New Zealand, Australia, Germany. . . . There is an energy to the whole process of staying positive, and staying up is important. I thought Denver fans did more than I thought they would."
George Karl,It was not a give-and-take conversation.
George Karl,"I thought in that 45-minute conversation, we moved towards each other."
George Karl,We've got to slow them down. We've done some good things. Consistency would be good there. I would take just shooting the league average on open shots tonight.
George Karl,"We're seeing a team in the fourth quarter that doesn't have the confidence to finish up a game. Last year, we were a great fourth-quarter defensive team."
George Karl,"I'm tired of excuses. I think it's playing with your heart, playing with intensity and playing with a commitment that, even if you lose, you can be proud of."
George Karl,He's been very professional. He's a quiet guy anyway but he's been great. He's been a first-class citizen professionally. Yesterday's practice he and Julius (Hodge) were the two best players on the basketball court.
George Karl,"The circumstances that happened will energize us or de-energize us. I'm hoping we'll all stay strong and stay together and hang together. My gut tells me we're going to do that, but only Thursday night will tell us the answer to that."
George Karl,"There's a point in (every NBA season when) talent stops being important and chemistry and character become more important, and I think Phoenix is probably in that stretch. It's a situation that's got to be handled and probably once it's handled you're happy about it. There's some growing pains to it. There might be a loss that you might not have had, but in the same sense he might win a playoff game that the (team) would've lost."
George Karl,"He's a superman and a super-human athlete, but I just know how hard it is to score points in our game."
George Karl,I want Kenyon Martin healthy for him and maybe for the Denver Nuggets. It's got to be a mutual agreement.
Martha Karolyi,"Without this program, we cannot say we have a national program. We definitely are fighting to stay on the very top and be on the podium. The competition is getting tougher ... but we feel like our system worked very well."
Martha Karolyi,"I am thinking it's possibly workable. The FIG will have to see how it turns out in the competition situation, and I'm sure they will be doing some small adjustments because it's a big departure from what we've had before."
Martha Karolyi,Strength of character . . . I cannot stress how important it is. She has all the chances. She's a world-class gymnast.
Martha Karolyi,"I'm one of the people who, from the beginning, said that it's not bad that we will be counting the difficulty skills. This system also gives extremely big importance to the precise execution."
Martha Karolyi,I was pleased because we are at the beginning of the season. For this time of the year they did an excellent job.

John Kasich,"The president's finally caught up to us on that, ... We want to save every dime for Social Security -- we're going to need it to create individual retirement accounts and keep Social Security from melting down. So that's a good proposal."
John Kasich,"It is our mission in this city to ship power, money and influence back to the people, ... The more money we have in our pockets, the more power we have."
John Kasich,"there's no question about it, we can set aside a very large amount -- the most in modern history -- to save Social Security, and we can also give the American people a tax cut."
John Kasich,"[Calling the president's plan a] lame-duck budget, ... The president said the era of big government is over, but he keeps sending us things ... kind of like Santa Claus."
Marc Kasowitz,"You really have an unfair, ironic and outrageous situation here, ... The one company that had the courage and took the steps of breaking with the entire industry ? is now in a position where it's going to be bankrupt if the settlement is enacted."
Marc Kasowitz,The Port Authority is confident it will prevail.
Marc Kasowitz,"To hold the Port Authority twice as liable as the terrorists for the 1993 bombing stands logic, rationality and reason on its head."
Marc Kasowitz,"The Port Authority respects the jury's findings but in this case the jury was egregiously incorrect. On February 26, 1993, the World Trade Center bombing was an act of terrorists for which terrorists alone are responsible."
Marc Kasowitz,The plaintiffs want to blame the Port Authority for the murderous acts of fanatical terrorists who schemed for years and traveled thousands of miles
Marc Kasowitz,"The Port Authority respects the jury's findings but in this case the jury was egregiously incorrect. On February 26, 1993, the World Trade Center bombing was an act of terrorists for which terrorists alone are responsible,"
Darius Kasparaitis,"We want to have a gold medal. That's what we want. And when we win that, then we're going to remember we beat Canada."
Darius Kasparaitis,It was shocking to lose a game like that. We played solid for 55 minutes.
Darius Kasparaitis,"I expected maybe a hit, but not coming like that, hitting me with punches. Fighting is not my game and I'm not going to beat Brashear anyways. By dropping my gloves I'm only going to get beat up."
Darius Kasparaitis,"It will keep us at our highest concentration level. As long as there's no injuries, I don't think there's a downside."
Darius Kasparaitis,"He talks even when he fights. He's a great guy, great character."
Joe Katich,"The second half we decided just to let it all out and run up and down the floor. Trying to match them basket for basket - we did it, but the problem was we had an eight-point deficit at halftime."
Joe Katich,"This is the only place we've had trouble at all year. Unfortunately, we had to win a big game on their floor and we just couldn't get it."
Joe Katich,"He was under control, he was making 3-point shots. He was the difference in the first half."
David Katz,"We think the recent sell-off has created some tremendous opportunities in the money center banks and the brokers, ... We'd be putting money into J.P. Morgan, which has had some lending to many of these companies that have had [accounting] problems. Citibank, we think, is going to do quite well and Morgan Dean Witter. So play off this negativity, buy some of these very good companies at very good prices."
David Katz,I didn't want to make a fool of myself. I said that I would be who I am and not play a role.
David Katz,It helps Yahoo! users make more informed decisions about what they want to view and gives networks and studios more information about what users are really most interested in.
David Katz,"They've grown earnings at about 15 percent a year for the last decade, ... They're always gaining market share. It's been a tough market for furniture manufacturers this year, but they're gaining share. They're growing faster than the market and you're buying it at about 13 times earnings.

I believe in playing it straight to the hilt."
Andy Kaufman,Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It's the real performers on the street who can hold people's attention and keep them from walking away.

Walter Kaufmann,The problem of suffering is: why is there the suffering we know?
Walter Kaufmann,"The great artist is the man who most obviously succeeds in turning his pains to advantage, in letting suffering deepens his understanding and sensibility, in growing through his pains."
Walter Kaufmann,"The first function of a book review should be, I believe, to give some idea of the contents and character of the book."

Walter Kaufmann,"Life ceases to be so oppressive: we are free to give our own lives meaning and purpose, free to redeem our suffering by making something of it."
Walter Kaufmann,Job's forthright indictment of the injustice of this world is surely right. The ways of the world are weird and much more unpredictable than either scientists or theologians generally make things look.

Walter Kaufmann,"It is widely assumed, contrary to fact, that theism necessarily involves the two assumptions which cannot be squared with the existence of so much suffering, and that therefore, per impossibile, they simply have to be squared with the existence of all this suffering, somehow."

Kenneth Kaunda,Ambition never comes to an end.
Kenneth Kaunda,The power which establishes a state is violence; the power which maintains it is violence; the power which eventually overthrows it is violence.
Kenneth Kaunda,"When that young comrade Yoweri Museveni has made mistakes, I have told him without making issues public.

Patrick Kavanagh,Malice is only another name for mediocrity.

Guy Kawasaki,"I think the crisis part is over. Certainly, we still have a lot of hard work to do."
Guy Kawasaki,"It would have taken great courage to do that because at the time, the Macintosh was selling well. You're making $700 gross margin on a Mac and now you're going to go make $35 gross margin on a (software) license? I wish we had, but we didn't. We didn't for that reason."

Bud Keene,We set some high goals. We wanted to sweep everything. We came really close. If Kelly had landed on her feet on that last run we would have swept.
Bud Keene,Mason's future is wide open. He reacted very well to the pressure and was so close to getting on the podium.
Bud Keene,We just shook it out and got all the negative energy out.
Bud Keene,I wouldn't say that they're gym rats. But there's an awareness that these things are important.

Garrison Keillor,"We had a bevy -- literally a bevy -- of queens on our show, representing every agricultural product, ... They were quite self-possessed young women. They had poise, which is the one thing that royalty most requires. The swine queen probably had more poise than anybody else. You would have to, in order to be 'Miss Swine.'"

Garrison Keillor,"In your 50s, instead of panicking about the income you need to build up in the next 15 or 20 years, your best move is to concentrate on getting your costs down. If you will need less to live on in retirement, then you won't need to risk desperate accumulation strategies now. Right? That's a pretty basic point that everyone seems to miss. I want you to make cost reduction Plan A in your Late-Start Retirement Strategy."
Garrison Keillor,"Humor, a good sense of it, is to Americans what manhood is to Spaniards and we will go to great lengths to prove it. Experiments with laboratory rats have shown that, if one psychologist in the room laughs at something a rat does, all of the other psychologists in the room will laugh equally. Nobody wants to be left holding the joke."
Garrison Keillor,"It's an honor to be taken off the air. I had to wait until I was 63. You are nobody in radio until you've been fired at least once, and I've never been fired. At least it's vindication."

Garrison Keillor,A book is a gift you can open again and again.
Garrison Keillor,Beauty isn't worth thinking about; what's important is your mind. You don't want a fifty-dollar haircut on a fifty-cent head.
Garrison Keillor,"Nothing you do for children is ever wasted. They seem not to notice us, hovering, averting our eyes, and they seldom offer thanks, but what we do for them is never wasted."

Harvey Keitel,maybe make some sort of peace with this place.

John Keker,The law doesn't permit Kai-Fu Lee from working in his beloved China.

Helen Keller,"''Knowledge is power.'' Rather, knowledge is happiness, because to have knowledge -- broad, deep knowledge -- is to know true ends from false, and lofty things from low.

Helen Keller,The welfare of each is bound up in the welfare of all.
Helen Keller,"I can say with conviction that the struggle which evil necessitates is one of the greatest blessings. It makes us strong, patient, helpful men and women. It lets us into the soul of things and teaches us that although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcomings of it. My optimism, then, does not rest on the absence of evil, but on a glad belief in the preponderance of good and a willing effort always to cooperate with the good, that it may prevail."
Helen Keller,"Doubts and mistrust are the mere panic of timid imagination, which the steadfast heart will conquer, and the large mind transcend."

Helen Keller,College isn't the place to go for ideas.
Helen Keller,The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.
Helen Keller,"As the eagle was killed by the arrow winged with his own feather, so the hand of the world is wounded by its own skill."

Helen Keller,"Security is mostly a superstition.  It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing."
Helen Keller,Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature.

Jim Keller,(Katrina) will have an effect on all grain movement in some fashion.
Kasey Keller,It's a reality check for a few guys.
Kasey Keller,"I don't see it happening with this team. It's been solid throughout. You look at the Gold Cup. We had so many injuries, so many different players, and we still go out and win the thing. There's a lot of confidence right now."
Kasey Keller,"Not just Mexico. Columbus should be the home of any big game. There's absolutely no doubt about that.To be able to play in front of a decidedly pro-American crowd for both Mexico games, and to win them both 2-0, is fantastic for everybody."
Thomas Keller,"Then, as the day progresses, depending on how the product is coming in - for instance, the fish man will fax us and say black bass is great - throughout the day, we'll also make judgment calls and adapt to what's available."

Thomas Keller,"I drank more wine when I wasn't working as much, to be honest."
Thomas Keller,"Once you understand the foundations of cooking - whatever kind you like, whether it's French or Italian or Japanese - you really don't need a cookbook anymore."

Thomas Keller,Some of the recipes in the book have evolved for us. Many haven't.
Thomas Keller,"Now the restaurants have begun to catch up with the wine-making; there are numerous great restaurants in Napa Valley, and it's wonderful because the people are there for just that: great food and great wine."
Thomas Keller,But once in a while you might see me at In and Out Burger; they make the best fast food hamburgers around.
Thomas Keller,My childhood wasn't full of wonderful culinary memories.
Thomas Keller,"It wasn't about mechanics; it was about a feeling, wanting to give someone something, which in turn was really gratifying. That really resonated for me."

Tre' Kelley,"You could see it in their eyes, you could see it in their games that they were ready to play. And when you see the seniors playing like that, there's no reason not to follow."
Tre' Kelley,"He's yelling, but he's yelling with excitement and with a smile on his face. There's no way for us to go in there (to games) tight. He'll have a smile on his face the whole practice, almost. He's slapping fives, stuff he doesn't do during the regular season."
Tre' Kelley,"Yes, I believe so. We got our first SEC win."
Tre' Kelley,We played all 40 minutes of that basketball game. We held them.
John Harvey Kellogg,You cannot work with men who won't work with you.

John Harvey Kellogg,I think I am the oldest member and have been in good standing longer than any other member of this church.

John Harvey Kellogg,I believe that the end of things man-made cannot be very far away - must be near at hand.
John Harvey Kellogg,"I believe just what I have believed for the last forty years, and I am standing by everything I have stood by. I have not changed."
John Harvey Kellogg,"I am, I think the only surviving member of the original Battle Creek church. The church was disbanded, with the exception of thirteen members, in 1870."
John Harvey Kellogg,"Do you know, that is the root of the whole trouble - has been one of the roots at any rate - is people hearing things and then imagining some more and magnifying it and multiplying it."
John Harvey Kellogg,"But sometimes in the midst of worry, anxiety and hard work, it has been pretty hard to bear all these false reports going about the country - to see my friends alienated and being made to believe things that were absolutely false."
John Harvey Kellogg,"Brother Jones is not my product, and I am not responsible for anything he writes or says."

Brian Kelly,All the bands are here to support a worthwhile cause.
Brian Kelly,"They still have Daunte Culpepper. He didn't lose any strength in his arm, and he is still a big-time passer."

Brian Kelly,"I don't regret the fact that I came back and signed a contract [with Tampa Bay] when I signed it because I felt that was my value, at that time,"
Brian Kelly,We have made real progress. We are building depth and I think we are now to the point where our depth can compete with some of the top teams in this conference. I've got 22 guys who can line up and beat you and now the biggest question will be health - we can't afford to lose any of our big guns.
Brian Kelly,We have to be prepared for them to use all their weapons. This is an opportunity for them to look at all their kids and find out what direction they want to go with their offense heading into their Big Ten schedule.
Brian Kelly,"We came with all 11 men, our Desperado package. We went all out after the kick. It was indicative of our effort for the entire game."
Brian Kelly,"It will be a great honor for me to play against Joe Paterno, (but) we would like to win the game."

Brian Kelly,"The North Bay is a very prosperous region, and deposit growth is very strong here. This is no secret, and for this reason there will always be a steady flow of startup banks that fill the much-needed role of community banker."
Brian Kelly,"We'll probably be an underdog for the first eight games,"
Brian Kelly,"Hey, (PSU) has a heck of a football team. But I'm very disappointed in the way we played. We were ready and excited for this opportunity and we failed to take advantage of it."

Brian Kelly,We were going to run the football. We knew it. They knew it. Everybody knew it.
Brian Kelly,"I have a great deal of faith and trust in our judicial system. These young men will be given the opportunity to have a fair trial... However, as student-athletes, they are held to a higher level, and will remain suspended until further information becomes available."
Brian Kelly,"I have a great deal of faith and trust in our judicial system. These young men will be given the opportunity to have a fair trial, and because of our system of justice, are innocent until proven guilty. However, as student-athletes, they are held to a higher level, and will remain suspended until further information becomes available."
Brian Kelly,We're excited about Charley joining our staff. He brings a great deal of experience in the MAC and specifically within the passing game. He is a well-respected individual in the coaching profession and has a bright and innovative mind.
Brian Kelly,"Absolutely, without a doubt, ... What we do out there and what we've been doing for the last couple of years, you can look at other tandems and try to compare their numbers to ours. I think our numbers are better and just the performance that we bring to the team. I definitely think we're the best tandem."
Brian Kelly,The good signs were on defense. We did some things on defense that we can build on. We feel the defense can make an impact now where in the past we didn't feel that way.
Brian Kelly,I consider Kelly/Shorts to be a premier stadium of its size in the country. It's definitely part of the vision we had for our program.
Brian Kelly,"It's a matter of being at the right place at the right time and having the right conversation. There were a number of Big 12 teams that were in the mix there. Ontario was a late qualifier, academically. And we stood by him. Four days prior to our Indiana game he had not been certified by the NCAA, so sometimes you have to hang in there with a young man and build that trust, and we built that trust with him, and he rewarded us with some great play here and ultimately signing with us."
Brian Kelly,We're in control. It's always good to have some control over things this time of year.
Brian Kelly,It's a nice swagger we have right now. There's a lot of confidence in this locker room.
Brian Kelly,"(Miami) has tradition, a level of confidence where each and every week they believe they're going to win, and they're very talented, ... Add great speed and athleticism to an Indiana team, is the way I look at it. I'd rather be playing Indiana again, quite frankly. We think that much of Miami."
Brian Kelly,I thank all three of them for their commitment and loyalty to the Central Michigan University football program. I wish them the best in their future endeavors.
Brian Kelly,"We had to overcome the adversity of having two coaches leave during the recruiting process, so everybody on the staff had to pick up the slack. We had a lot of coaches in areas that are not normal for them, but I thought the commitment of our staff throughout the process was outstanding."
Brian Kelly,"It further damages the state's ability to attract and retain job creators, because it is essentially a tax on small businesses."

Chris Kelly,It is a fantastic achievement for Mark to have been given this opportunity. I have no doubt that he will fulfil his new role expertly and we wish him the best of luck. We have some highly qualified umpires to replace Mark ... all of whom have plenty of experience and expertise in the field.

Craig Kelly,"I don't ride ski areas all that much, and I don't do contests and I don't go in snowboard shops and I rarely read the snowboard magazines."
Craig Kelly,I didn't really get that into backcountry riding until about eight or 10 years ago and the main reason for it is the ski areas are more crowded.
Craig Kelly,"For Oakley, I'm basically a media vehicle for them to promote the product. For me, it's both, I get a salary from them, but I also get great products so it just kind of works, continues on."
Dan Kelly,"We have no choice but to pick up what the state has refused to fund,"
Dan Kelly,It's been a goal of ours to have a multiple state champion. Glad it happened with him. He's never missed a match. He's never been hurt in four years. He's Mr. Dependable.

Dan Kelly,"I think it's the rich getting richer, ... They're taking advantage of a bad situation and punishing our wallets."
Dan Kelly,Most fire departments are not very familiar with propane accidents because they happen very infrequently.
Dennis Kelly,"We are committed to, at a minimum, honoring the agreement we have. If we don't negotiate an agreement that's much more sustainable from our perspective, then we'll choose to not continue the exhibit and study pandas."
Dennis Kelly,The large turnout and strong vote reflects the deep frustration that educators feel over not having a contract for nearly two years.
Dennis Kelly,The Zoo Atlanta family is elated at the news of twin gorilla babies. We are proud to do our part to support a species that is experiencing such catastrophic decline in the wild.
Dennis Kelly,"It's crazy. These bears, year-round, are some of the most pampered animals on the planet. We measure everything that goes in. We measure everything that goes out."
Gary Kelly,"We've been concerned about the costs in the past, but they've done a remarkable job in bringing costs down, ... It's now a highly regarded, very efficient airport."
Gary Kelly,"There's a very large opportunity in Denver,"
Gary Kelly,We are unaware of any other International Singles Golf Tournament ever having been held. We have aggressively searched the Internet and not found a single reference to this sort of event.

Gary Kelly,Baby boomers find dating online is the most efficient way.
Gary Kelly,"I think you can push fares only so far, and there'll be a negative effect and a backlash by customers."
Gary Kelly,It's a very exciting opportunity for one of the fastest-growing areas of the country.
Gary Kelly,"You say, 'Is it getting crowded?' but this is a big country. There's bound to be some competition in the future, but right now there's relatively little overlap."
Gary Kelly,"We realized two things. Golf is a male-dominated sport, and the fastest growing age group online is those who are 40-plus, especially women. It seemed a natural match."
Gary Kelly,Mike and I believe our ultimate success lies in our ability to attract women 45-55.
Gene Kelly,I wanted to invent some kind of American dance that was danced to the music that I grew up on: Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart and Irving Berlin. So I evolved a style that certainly didn't catch on right away - but I had some good mentors in New York who encouraged me.
Gene Kelly,I got started dancing because I knew it was one way to meet girls
Gene Kelly,"My mother had gotten a job as a receptionist at a dancing school and had the idea that we should open our own dancing school; we did, and it prospered."

James Kelly,"We view management's long-term guidance of double-digit EPS growth through 2010 as laudable from a company morale and motivation standpoint, but difficult to achieve from an investor's perspective."
James Kelly,"We think the pension issue is very important for both our people and the future of our company, but as I said, there is no one or two single issues that will determine whether or not we're able to reach agreement."
James Kelly,"It's hurt us. Hurt our employees. And it's hurt our customers. We have lost business. We've had customers who have told us they will not be back. We're gonna work as hard as we can to get every customer back,"
James Kelly,There is a false notion in this town that America loses in any such discussion.
James Kelly,"Reality is that direct contact may be helpful, or they may be neutral. Awkward absence (of contact) undercuts support among Asians and provides a handy excuse for North Korea to delay."
Jim Kelly,"I've been told he has the tools, the talent and the skills."
Jim Kelly,"If we have 800 parents withhold tuition payments that's $500,000 that they won't be getting. If we withhold the June 1 one also, it will be a total of $1 million. We would like to see how they respond to that."

Kevin Kelly,"Everybody was telling me to stay relaxed, stay focused, don't worry about the first or second one, eventually you are going to get a third one. I was upset after I missed the first one, but I was upbeat after I missed the second one because I figured what are the chances of missing three in a row."
Kevin Kelly,"This year, Mardi Gras is a shadow of its former self, because its only 1/3rd of the city back, the rest of us are spread around the country such as myself. So it's good that they got together and held the celebration because it's a holiday, although it's not respected nationally, but like I said it's a shadow of its former self."
Kevin Kelly,"We had some roof damage in three warehouses, but moved the nearby coffee to dry areas in those buildings. We have no odors, no unusual humidity or toxicology problems, and suffered no losses in our seven coffee warehouses."
Kevin Kelly,All imaginable futures are not equally possible.

Scott Kelly,"LovelyBySurprise.com and TheNeverything.com are each designed for a distinct audience that shares an important element with the other: a mindset that looks to the Web as a place to work, shop, and play. We think people will be intrigued by the characters in the stories, and return every week to learn more -- ideally clicking through to learn more about our great new Lincoln and Mercury products."
Scott Kelly,We notice there tend to be more accidents when there are patchy dense spots.
Tim Kelly,"I certainly can appreciate the out-and-back course and how it saves on manpower. The race is always well organized and I give a lot of credit to the race directors. That said, I would have to rate the original course as my favorite, though I really appreciated the flat courses on years I didn't train much."
Tim Kelly,"Warren is still 20 percent undeveloped, but the township is buying up the land more quickly than we can sell it to people who want to develop it."

Tom Kelly,The prime minister believes in free trade.
Tom Kelly,In general terms it will come up. But the detailed negotiations are for the commission. We fully support the commission and the commissioner in trying to sort this out.
Tom Kelly,In music that's how they refer to it. I didn't know anything about it and I'm sure the people that approved the ad didn't.
Tom Kelly,It is entirely a matter for the media organizations to decide what they want to do within the law. It is for people to reach their own judgments.
Tom Kelly,"This is understanding a complex situation and applying your knowledge to it. Moving from not just what you know, but what you can actually do -- that's broadening the application of e-learning."
Tom Kelly,"He made my life a joy. I was just fortunate to come along at the same time he did. Let's be honest. I rode the coattails and a lot of coaches did and fans did, and a whole bunch of people got on board and rode that train right with him, and he was driving."
Tom Kelly,"It's a health and safety issue, and that's why it's there."
Tom Kelly,"I did what I could for 17 years for the Fire Department. It got me into this trouble. They don't want me anymore, and under these conditions, it stinks."
Tom Kelly,"Some parents and local snowboarding organizations came to us for help. They wanted to know how to organize events and get TV coverage, which is what we do."
Tom Kelly,Our Rotary Mardi Gras was voted the Best of Yuma entertainment for the past several years.
Tom Kelly,"Engineering this technology for tractors is more straightforward. But as a leader in the heavy-duty vocational truck market, we're committed to getting this technology in the hands of mixer and dump customers as soon as possible. We targeted mixers initially per customer demand. But we're working very hard with our partner Bendix on other vocational applications as well, to make the technology available across the board in the very near future."
Tom Kelly,"With the industry trend shifting to more automatic transmissions, particularly in heavy-duty mixer and dump applications, we saw the opportunity to partner with Allison in their EDGE Program as an effective way to take full advantage of this trend and, more importantly, to offer our customers a greater overall value."
Tom Kelly,"The doctors said that if he has good luck, he'll be all right. You have to keep the faith."
Tom Kelly,Nuclear energy has got to be part of that debate. The prime minister sees this as a priority and as an issue he is pursuing.
Tom Kelly,"It took a big leap of courage to bring Antonio in. I give (Carp) a lot of credit for doing that. In Antonio, he had someone with experience in successfully building digital imaging businesses."

Susette Kelo,"This battle against eminent domain abuse may have started as a way for me to save my little, pink cottage, but it has rightfully grown into something much larger  the fight to restore the American Dream and the sacredness and security of each one of our homes."
Susette Kelo,What is happening to me should not happen to anyone. Congress and state legislatures need to send a message to local governments that this kind of abuse of power will not be funded or tolerated.

Jack Kemp,"My appetite is whetted,"
Thomas Kempis,"FIRST keep thyself in peace, and then shalt thou be able to be a peacemaker towards others. A peaceable man doth more good than a well-learned. A passionate man turneth even good into evil and easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all things into good. He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to be quiet. He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth what it were more expedient for him to do. He considereth to what duties others are bound, and neglecteth those to which he is bound himself. Therefore be zealous first over thyself, and then mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour."
Thomas Kempis,"It is no little wisdom for you to keep yourself in silence and in good peace when evil words are spoken to you, and to turn your heart to God and not to be troubled with the judgment of others."

Tysen Kendig,They thought this would be the best way to participate in community-service-oriented activities in King's memories. People weren't burdened with having to miss class time to participate in these activities.
Tysen Kendig,But helping a number of people contribute to their communities without the burden of missed class time is worth the trade-off.
Tysen Kendig,The university fully supports the right to free speech on campus and has never taken any action to abridge or circumvent that right.
Andy Kennedy,He had the same issues as most freshmen. It was just immaturity and not completely understanding how hard it is to be successful at this level. He had always gotten by on his ability.
Andy Kennedy,I met with Mike this morning and we talked about a number of issues and he was great understanding my position and granting me permission to speak with other people.
Andy Kennedy,"I need the truth to be told and the truth to be told is we can't give one league nine bids. So to every coach in the Big East, today was a frightening day."
Andy Kennedy,"Since I've been here, he has as much talent as any walk-on we've had here. He's a talented kid. He's strong."
Andy Kennedy,I'm hopeful Gerry McNamara's one-footed running 3-pointer doesn't erase everything this team has accomplished.
Andy Kennedy,It's just the way we've chosen to deal with it. What's there to talk about? The reality is that we're undermanned in a lot of areas. We're in the best league in the country. We don't have to read the paper to know that all the teams we play are quality teams.
Andy Kennedy,"It's just hard to believe, really, the way he looked out there. Here's a kid who is a potential freshman All-American and for him not to play with the life he needs to play with is a bit disconcerting."
Andy Kennedy,It's just hard to believe how he looked out there. Here is a kid who's a potential freshman All-American. For him to not play with the life that he needs to play with is a big concern.
Andy Kennedy,"Between Cedric, Eric, James and Devan, we have to have a pretty good performance out of, if not all of them, the majority of them, and it just didn't happen across the board. It snowballed, and then you get out of character and before you know it, you look up and you get what you deserve."
Andy Kennedy,The biggest strength of this team is our resiliency. They've just been terribly resilient through all the obstacles that have been thrown at them. They continue to fight and find a way.
Andy Kennedy,There?s no question in my mind that we?re one of the 34 best at-large teams in the country.
Andy Kennedy,I just watched that game again. We played about as poorly - even worse than Sunday (against Pittsburgh) - as we have.
Andy Kennedy,I thought we were a little listless. How can you be listless playing on national television in Freedom Hall against your number one rival?
Andy Kennedy,"How can we be listless, playing in Freedom Hall in front of 20,000 people against [our] No. 1 rival on national TV."
Andy Kennedy,Talk about a reversal of fortune.
Andy Kennedy,"We came out flat. A couple of guys are fighting the flu, me included. Jihad Muhammad was the difference in the game, with his energy on the ball."
Andy Kennedy,You cannot be tentative against pressure. They sensed that fear and they jumped on it like great teams do and took us right out of the action.
Andy Kennedy,They sensed our tentativeness. They sensed that fear -- and I hate to use that word -- and they jumped on it.
Andy Kennedy,"I hate to use the word fear, but they sensed it and took us right out of it. It's very uncharacteristic of our team."
Andy Kennedy,We have suspended the players indefinitely for failure to meet the standards set forth by the NCAA and the men's basketball program at the University of Cincinnati.
Andy Kennedy,"I appreciate that. I went into this with my eyes open. I signed a one-year contract. That's what I expect. For me, it's about trying to get this team to the NCAA tournament. I thought we let a golden opportunity slip through our fingers tonight."
Andy Kennedy,It's hard for this team to play catch-up against a quality team in this environment. I thought our shot selection was a little bit poor. We're dependent on making perimeter jumpers and those things come and go.
Andy Kennedy,We dropped our heads again. The emotion we thought we had found was taken away.
Andy Kennedy,"He was lobbying the doctors to get back into the game, but he was out of it (at halftime). He always looks a little crazy, so it was hard to tell."
Andy Kennedy,"Obviously, that's a formula for disaster, if you turn it over that many times. If memory serves, it led to 36 points for Louisville. Certainly our margin for error is such that we can't give teams 36 points off our ineffectiveness."
Andy Kennedy,I'm the interim coach. That means today and I guess the rest is up for debate.
Andy Kennedy,"We had a conversation, because of the fact we're playing, (Boone) is sensitive to not disrupt anything."
Andy Kennedy,"We did not do the things we needed to do and as a result, we have to accept the consequences."
Andy Kennedy,"The intensity was really high. I think Sean (XU coach Miller) has a tremendous team, without question an NCAA Tournament team. We had our chances in regulation and in overtime and just did not make enough plays."
Andy Kennedy,Anybody that thinks I'm a better coach than him has been out to lunch too long.
Andy Kennedy,They are definitely a group of fighters. They've been terribly resilient through a myriad of circumstances which they are currently under. I'm proud of the team and the way we have grown together as a group. We're certainly looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead.
Andy Kennedy,"Once you get to this point in the season, regardless of the circumstances, it does become a bit of a grind. With our numbers this year, I do sense a little bit of frustration. I get disappointed that I can't help this group more. But we are who we are. We've got to stay together and continue to fight."
Andy Kennedy,"They play five or six guys, it's a different set of circumstances, obviously. Unfortunately we're both dealing with a numbers issue. I'm not just saying this, I have a tremendous amount of respect for what they've done because it's very, very difficult to churn away when you're not being rewarded with wins. To their credit, they continue to fight and they'll be ready to play."
Andy Kennedy,"The competitive spirit takes over and you want to win, regardless of the circumstances. That's what we saw Friday and hopefully we'll see it again (tonight)."
Andy Kennedy,"I don't have a choice. I mean this sincerely, it would be a disservice to everybody who supports this program if I talk about what we can't do. You're not going to hear that from me. I'm really confident we're going to get this right on Sunday, and then we're going to try to steal a couple on the road."
Andy Kennedy,"I think Angelo Craig is a monster athlete, that's what everyone's told me."
Andy Kennedy,"Until we get our aggression back, and until we start approaching the game differently, we're not going to like the results. I realize that and I'm trying to get these kids to realize that. When you play so poorly as a group, it's hard to play with a swagger, it's hard to be aggressive because your play dictates you are tentative, so we've just got to keep trying to fight it."
Andy Kennedy,"People realize that we're certainly faced with an abnormal amount of adversity. The Cincinnati faithful is still going through a healing process with what transpired with Coach Huggins in the fall. But over the 20 games they've seen this team, I think they appreciate the fact that this team continues to fight, even though they're not always happy with the result."
Andy Kennedy,We had our opportunities. We just didn't take advantage of them. We got some good looks and couldn't knock the shots down and we turned the ball over too much.
Andy Kennedy,"We had our opportunities and we didn't take advantage of them. When you give a team like Syracuse and you let Gerry McNamara have a window of opportunity, unfortunately sometimes you have to live with the feeling we currently have."
Brian Kennedy,"Everybody has the same goal â€“ I find that of particular value, ... Iâ€™ve learned a lot myself."
Brian Kennedy,We're not looking to get rich. We're not trying to break anybody's bank.
Brian Kennedy,All three defenders have played the past three seasons together. So they understand our systems and know how to play with each other.
Brian Kennedy,They've basically told us that they have the money. They just feel that they're paying us more than what we're worth as it is.
Brian Kennedy,We go into every game with the idea that we're going to win. They're all intense from the get-go. We'll see what happens.
Brian Kennedy,"It's always great to watch them learning and having fun. We go to museums sometimes, but I think they are a bit more comfortable doing these things in their own school."
Brian Kennedy,It was totally awesome. This was even better this year than last. It?s fun to work as part of a team to achieve our goals. It really tested my skills.
Brian Kennedy,"We had a meeting a couple of weeks ago and we had the fire department, we had the sheriffs there, we had our security people. We kind of went through what we are going to do with the show and how are we going to make this safe for everybody."
Brian Kennedy,"If the chairman could have loaded the family into a helicopter to go to all of these meetings and all of these parks for $5,000, he would have."
Brian Kennedy,"You bet his family was with him, of course. What better way to see and judge the visitor experience of a national park?"
Brian Kennedy,Illegal immigration has become a dominant issue in this race. It's another example of where people see a lack of leadership in Washington.
Brian Kennedy,"Fear is a big factor (for people) when doing their taxes. People start to doubt, that with their deductions and calculations, they're doing it right."
Brian Kennedy,Four nothing but our defense played well. The offense just couldn't get the job done. We weren't getting the movement off-ball that we needed. We played a much better game on Saturday than we did today.
Brian Kennedy,"I'm sure the Pentagon has on the shelf plans to invade Canada or Mexico, but they don't have any plans to do so, ... It's very safe to say the chairman has no interest in, and no intention of, introducing legislation that would sell national parks."
Brian Kennedy,I cannot accept the statements made by the Rugby Football Union claiming that a clear agreement was in place.
Brian Kennedy,The next Scotland coach needs to be someone with great ability and can get the best out of limited resources. It is going to have to be someone who can really take players and make them punch way above their weight in rugby terms.
David Kennedy,"It's not hard to maintain it. It just simply has to be done. The problem is the work isn't the normal work of any of these agencies. So unless there is a meaningful commitment from the executive levels, it naturally falls through."
David Kennedy,"Syria has been on the wrong side of history. Increasingly, the rest of the Middle East is moving towards democracy and freedom. On the other hand, Syria has always supported terror."
David Kennedy,"Defensively, the last couple of days, it's been mental mistakes. Our concentration is not at the right level."

Jackie Kennedy,"I'll be a wife and mother first, then First Lady."

Ted Kennedy,Help! Mom! There Are Liberals Under My Bed.
Tim Kennedy,"She wasn't really running - just walking fast, screaming and flailing her hands."
Tim Kennedy,"I have nothing against a mall, but it's just a place. Why do they have to take away this golf course? They (were considering) messing with the quality of life. That just doesn't seem right."
Tim Kennedy,"My whole adult life, my dream was to live on a golf course. Now I'm not going to have a golf course ... the city is going to take it away from me."
Tim Kennedy,"The thing we learned with large customers is one size does not fit all. Some want to run on mainframe, Unix, Linux, or Windows. It's hard to get a census of exactly what they want to run on."

Matt Kenseth,"If it had gone green until the end, I was making some progress and I probably would have finished third,"
Matt Kenseth,"If (Stewart and Johnson) don't have any problems, they're the guys to beat."
Matt Kenseth,I hate green-white-checker finishes just because they are so nerve-wrecking. I spun the tires a little and they said 'Jimmie is outside' and I was just holding on trying to get a run off the corner.
Matt Kenseth,"Winning's hard. We were second to Tony at Indianapolis this year and we did everything possible to win. They could have made that race worth 10,000 points and we couldn't have tried any harder."
Matt Kenseth,I felt like it was Christmas.
Matt Kenseth,"[Kenseth, the 2003 series champion, was happy just to get a crack at his second title.] I'm relieved, but I'm more than relieved. I'm excited, ... We were way behind two months ago. We just kept digging and digging. I feel like we have some momentum."
Matt Kenseth,I still think it's a stretch with all of those cars in between. We just have to try to lead some laps and win some races.
Jeff Kent,"That was incredible. I'd quit just to come race with you guys every weekend. I've raced a motorcycle, and that was unbelievable. I love motorcycles, but this is amazing. These guys are incredible. When I got in the car, I couldn't really fit. They wanted me to get back more, and I couldn't get my shoulders back, but around the second turn, I was back in the headrest. That was amazing. I don't know how these guys can do 500 miles, 240 miles an hour, in and out of traffic, wheel-to-wheel and against the walls in front of 400,000 people. It blows my mind."

Jeff Kent,"I had no strength to pick up a bat. It'll be sore, but I can play through the pain. If I have enough strength to pick up a bat, I'll be in there. I'd say 50-50 by tomorrow [a travel day], 75-25 by Friday."
Jeff Kent,"I played behind Roy for two years, and that's the best chance you have of getting the kid is to get him before he gets warmed up, ... He quick-pitched us a lot, as he normally does, but a lot of his pitches were balls. He put himself in a hole by getting behind in the count."
Jeff Kent,"We were taking advantage of the situation, ... It makes it easier for hitters when a pitcher's not throwing strikes. The kid (Williams) was having a hard time making adjustments and before we knew it, we had a bunch of runs."
Lori Kerans,"I think Brianna had the great fortune of playing at A&M and playing for (former A&M coach) David Fitzgerald, so her transition there was pretty smooth. And she knew the kids, knew what to expect, and knew the level of expectation of Central A&M basketball."
Lori Kerans,"One of the things we're really working on is chemistry and comfort and how things fit together, especially when a team zones us."
Lori Kerans,"You hope to have capable backups, but the comfort level or familiarity of the team with each other is usually just not there. I remember telling Lindsay 'Just do your best.' I had no idea that she would be the kind of kid that would lead us to a title."
Rick Kerby,"Bob Fosse was such a genius, I'm not going to tinker with his brilliance, but I've put my own spin on it."
Rick Kerby,We've listened to our community. That's where our patrons want us to be.
Rick Kerby,None of it is done with make-up. Dean is aware of his body and very coordinated. He is a handsome man playing a distorted figure.
Rick Kerby,I was moved by it then. I'm attracted to dark stories about acceptance.
Steve Kernkraut,"The September numbers were generally on track, there were pockets of strength and there were some weaknesses. The numbers overall were not horrendous, but overall certainly the outlook could have more of a negative backlash from the higher oil prices."
Steve Kernkraut,"I think you're seeing strength in the department stores, but more so than just the department stores, the specialty apparel stores that have a more focused brand."
Steve Kernkraut,"I think they made a lot of fashion changes, but there's been a general malaise in women's fashion apparel. What's somewhat concerning here is that Nordstrom has transitioned totally to fall earlier. Is their fashion not on target, or is the consumer really concerned about the rising gas prices?"
Steve Kernkraut,"I think they made a lot of fashion changes, but there's been a general malaise in women's fashion apparel. What's somewhat concerning here is that Nordstrom has transitioned totally to fall merchandise. The question is, is the earlier fashion not on target, or is the consumer really concerned about the rising gas prices?"
Steve Kernkraut,They must do something that's going to leverage traffic in the mall. They can't get totally away from fashion. They've got to come up with something else whether its making the jewelry area bigger or making the denim area bigger.
Steve Kernkraut,"It's going to shape up to be a real messy Christmas season. It's very hard to read. Some companies had a very strong Thanksgiving weekend, others weak."

Brian Kerr,I just have to wait and see what comes about but I definitely want to work. I don't know where that's going to be.
Brian Kerr,The team gave as good as they can. It was a very committed and organised performance. But it was not enough.

Brian Kerr,"I don`t think any of the previous matches will have any influence,"
Brian Kerr,"To get through in tournaments you generally have to get points in your home games,"
Brian Kerr,"I don't see myself working in Ireland again but I see myself in football,"
Brian Kerr,"Three of the top four teams are completely in control of their own destiny,"
Brian Kerr,I believe that sport is a catalyst in terms of heightening awareness to social issues. Sport always gave me the opportunity to meet people who were not the same as me. I have always been positive towards this and education is central to all of this. Sport can help in that regard.
Brian Kerr,"I would like him to be playing regularly in the Celtic team. Aiden's got fantastic ability, but he needs to get the strength to play international football."
Cristie Kerr,"Annika is definitely going to be motivated by all this. She's enjoyed her position of being on the top of the rankings. Her wanting to be No. 1 in the world is not going to change, but there's going to be a lot more challenges."
Cristie Kerr,"I'm going to keep believing in myself,"
Cristie Kerr,People don't realize how difficult it is to win. Winning is a learned behavior. That's what I did today. I relied on my experience and my patience and I was able to hang on.
Kevin Kerr,It's a worldwide flight-to-quality instrument.
Kevin Kerr,"Gold is exploding, and silver isn't far behind."
Kevin Kerr,This makes the short side of the market very nervous and as we see gold drop we also see it turn and then move higher twice as fast.
Robert Kerr,"The risk is on the upside, because the market knows that we are at the end of the earnings cycle, it's just that earnings are not turning as fast as many had hoped."
Robert Kerr,"This is legal. I kind of like it because I plan on -- when I get out of here -- I plan on like, starting a new business, or something like that."
Robert Kerr,We found the rationale for the raid flimsy. The stated reason was that there was information threatening national security that was about to be revealed. Yet we have seen no evidence that this is actually the case.
Robert Kerr,We'll make sure there's enough in that account to purchase health insurance coverage.
Robert Kerr,The recent volatility reflects the debate in the market but I think we may well have touched bottom in the current cycle.
Steve Kerr,"It's like that Jerry Seinfeld line about sports, that we're all just cheering laundry. I don't care who plays for Arizona. I'm going to cheer like crazy for them. People have strong connections to these teams, and whatever your connection is, it stays regardless of who is wearing the uniform."
Steve Kerr,"It's quicker. The quality is every bit as good, if not higher. And it can be done in less time for less money."
Steve Kerr,We have watched the progress they put those up in a couple of days and they got to watch different people in the community work together and volunteer their time for somebody else.
Steve Kerr,"Robert feels strongly about the principles of not tearing up an existing contract and not making that a precedent for the organization. He wants to model the franchise after the Spurs and Detroit, teams that have spent wisely and made responsible choices."
Steve Kerr,I learned that people everywhere are basically the same and have similar goals that we do. They want health and happiness and the opportunity to provide for their families.
Bob Kerrey,"Many of the things that are being said, if they are believed by the American people as the truth, will cast a pall of illegitimacy over the vice president if he ends up being the person that wins,"
Bob Kerrey,"[Former senator Bob Kerrey made the point well when he told his fellow 9/11 commissioners and the television audience that] this document of Fox News, ... this is a background briefing. And all of us that have provided background briefings for the press before should beware. I mean, Fox should say 'occasionally fair and balanced' after putting something like this out. Because they violated a serious trust. ... So I object to what they've done, and I think it's an unfortunate thing they did."
Bob Kerrey,"There's democracy in India and South Africa. We have to put the spotlight on those places that demonstrate if you're willing to work hard and sustain the effort through the disappointment of failure... but if you have people willing to sustain the effort, people who believe humanity has a good side, you can make it work."
Bob Kerrey,"They're both helping (the reform issue) by bringing it into their campaign. The debate about Social Security is likely to increase the chances that next year, or soon after, Congress will take action."

Nancy Kerrigan,They would often put hockey gear on me and have me play goalie for their street hockey games. It didn't bother me a bit! I actually loved it!
Nancy Kerrigan,"There is no age, height, or weight requirement to skate. It is good exercise no matter what your age is. If you want to be competitive, most start young. But, I practice with many adult competitors."

Nancy Kerrigan,Even now I can't describe why I love skating so much.
Nancy Kerrigan,"But it seems that the judging maybe they shouldn't at least see the practices all week long. That can taint the way they go into the judging and the outlook of what's going to happen, instead of just watching those four minutes and judging on those minutes alone."
Nancy Kerrigan,But after a few minutes of convincing myself that I really wanted to go - telling myself that I love skating and that my coach is there waiting for me - I would get up and go. And my mother would always get up and eat breakfast with me!
Nancy Kerrigan,And I love what I do and I love skating.
Nancy Kerrigan,"My parents never pressured me to skate. They always said I could quit if I wanted to. They only expected me to skate when they had already paid for the expensive lessons. But, otherwise they said I could do what I wanted to do."

Jason Kidd,"I think he gives guys the freedom to express themselves or go out there and try something. If it fails, he's not going to point you out and say it was your idea, not his. He'll take the blame. And I think that shows he's with us, win or lose."
Jason Kidd,"We'll let Detroit and Miami carry all that, let them be the guys fighting for the Eastern Conference title. We'll just continue to play, try and get better, see what happens."
Jason Kidd,"You heard so many horror stories, ... There was a gentleman holding onto his family and onto a pole. His wife was saying, 'Let us go.' There was nothing he could do but he held on and did everything he could to save his family."
Jason Kidd,"I think the emotion of the game, the adrenaline was going, and he was up there, he was sky high. So it's just a matter of trying to keep it even and not get up too high or get down too low."
Jason Kidd,He's had the upper hand. I've got to find a way to take away his comfort.
Jason Kidd,"When you give a team like that comfort shots, they're going to wear you. I think we just didn't execute well enough the game plan. It's not just coach. It falls on the players for not going out there and execute."
Jason Kidd,"It showed a lot a character, again. You look at getting in late after an emotional win. You felt, 'Hey, we can keep it close, make it respectable, then we did our job.' But we came out and we wanted to win this game, and that showed."
Jason Kidd,"It showed a lot of character. Getting in late after an emotional win, we could have just made it respectable but we did our job and wanted to win and that showed."
Jason Kidd,"I never play 82 games, not with the way I play. My body takes such a pounding. When I came in this league and didn't play 82, so it's not that important to me now."
Jason Kidd,He enjoys going against the best. He's one of the best players in this league. Vince gets out of bed with 20 points. Everything after that is when he really starts to play.
Jason Kidd,"I don't know what's going to happen. The business always gets in the way of basketball. If there wasn't any business and it was just strictly basketball, then there would be no issue, it would probably be done by now. But the team has to protect itself."
Jason Kidd,"Yeah, I play a lot of their games. Going way back to Bulls vs. Lakers to the later Live stuff, I go at it quite a bit. More than anything tough, I play Madden."
Jason Kidd,"When I was a little kid I used to play with guys twice my age, so, I was the last one picked, so if I picked I knew that I had to get the ball to the scorer if I wanted to stay on the court, so that was pretty much my job."
Jason Kidd,There's always room for improvement. We have a nucleus that's pretty good. You want players that will help.
Jason Kidd,"There are many really good teams in our conference this season. Miami, Indiana and Detroit will be our fiercest opponents this year. But we just have to focus on our game and be patient with the realistic hope that we'll be on top after all is said and done."
Jason Kidd,The business always gets in the way of basketball.
Jason Kidd,"The 76ers currently play very good basketball, and we don't. However, we are still only one win behind them. If we continue to improve, we should be on the top of our division at the end of the regular season."
Jason Kidd,"Oh, I think, watching Magic, him being one of my... I'm one of his biggest fans, and just trying to emulate what he did, going out on the playground, and also playing with older guys."
Jason Kidd,"If there wasn't any business and it was just strictly basketball, then there would be no issue, it would probably be done by now. But the team has to protect."
Jason Kidd,"I've got to play free agency out, and I've got to look at all of my options."
Jason Kidd,I'm a high-risk taker on the court in the sense of trying to squeeze things in there.
Jason Kidd,"I'm a football guy at heart; maybe I should have played football for a living instead, because I play a lot of football videogames, I'm really into them."
Jason Kidd,"I think that realistically we can shoot for the title this year. If we stay healthy and be persistent throughout the season, I think we have good chance to go all the way."
Jason Kidd,"Hard work does pay, and you just have to continue to work, and you got two guys, when you're talking about Gary and myself, we have a God-given talent, but we worked at it and we're happy to be where we are today."
Jason Kidd,"A lot of late nights in the gym, a lot of early mornings, especially when your friends are going out, you're going to the gym, those are the sacrifices that you have to make if you want to be an NBA basketball player."
Jason Kidd,We're going to turn this team around 360 degrees.
Jason Kidd,I think we're going in the right direction.
Jason Kidd,Kobe enjoys that situation. Stepping up and making the big basket or being involved in a key play.
Jason Kidd,He was the tallest thing out there so he had the advantage.
Jason Kidd,"That would be good if (Frank) can get 100. That is an accomplishment. But the players, we just want to put a mark in the left column."
Nicole Kidman,"I am glad he is here to support the movie,"
Nicole Kidman,"I can't fall in love with anyone, I make men believe what they want to believe."

Nicole Kidman,I've never been so excited to have people walk all over me for the rest of my life.

Nicole Kidman,"[President Robert Mugabe 's government has attacked the suspense thriller] The Interpreter, ... Zimbabwe's enemies did not rest."
Nicole Kidman,Dealing with these emotions as an actress is like being a boxer put into the ring.
Nicole Kidman,"Every day there is a compromise. Living with somebody requires a lot of understanding. But I love being married. I really love it. Sometimes I try to downplay it a bit because people are like, 'God you guys.' I just feel so fortunate that I have found someone who will put up with me and stay with me."
Nicole Kidman,I hope that this will be a lifelong commitment for me.
Nicole Kidman,"You've just got to have a sense of respect for the person you have children with. Anger doesn't help anybody. Ultimately you have to say forgiveness is important, and honoring what you had together is important. But it's easy to say and harder to do."
Nicole Kidman,"When you're learning any language, whether it be a make-believe language or French or Italian, the agility of your mind is what's interesting."
Nicole Kidman,"That goes against what I believe morally. That's adultery, and if I'm accused of that, no, that's not right. I have two kids who see that and remember that and judge me. It didn't happen, and it's not to be reported that way."
Nicole Kidman,My life collapsed. People ran from me because suddenly it was 'Oh my God! It's over for her now!' (On her split with Tom Cruise).
Nicole Kidman,My choices in films are spontaneous.
Nicole Kidman,"If you're going to be with someone, you're with them, you're committed to them. I'm not sort of flitting around."
Nicole Kidman,I'm at a time in my life that for me to go back to work it has to be something I feel really passionate about; otherwise I'm not as interested.
Nicole Kidman,"I'm a woman, a mother, a daughter, a sister. I'm a real person operating in the world. For me to discuss the most private thing feels wrong. It feels like I'm betraying myself and my children."
Nicole Kidman,"I wouldn't want to be married to me, but luckily Tom Cruise does."
Nicole Kidman,"I was so sick of playing the serious sort of roles. But now I feel I can go back to them. Though once you're hooked, you're hooked."
Nicole Kidman,"I think at some stage, I would love to have another child. I would love to settle into a relationship that was really important to me. I actually am not good at the balance at that."
Nicole Kidman,I refuse to let what happened to me make me bitter.
Nicole Kidman,I just want to be nominated; beggars can't be choosers.
Nicole Kidman,I don't believe in having body doubles for a film.
Nicole Kidman,"Honestly, people have said everything under the sun. I just want to do my work, raise my kids, and hopefully find somebody who I can share my life with again."
Nicole Kidman,Salary stories are intrusive. Do you ask your neighbour what they earn for their job?
Nicole Kidman,"Having gone through all of this, I feel in some ways calmer now. It's strange, but sad. I think I'll always be sad."
Nicole Kidman,I think it's important that we don't all have to hold our heads high all the time saying everything's fine.
Nicole Kidman,"I believe that as much as you take, you have to give back. It's important not to focus on yourself too much."
Nicole Kidman,What's the point of doing something good if nobody's watching.
Nicole Kidman,"I have a little bit of a belly, a tiny bit of pooch. It's the one thing I don't want to lose. I just like having some softness. If I lose that, then Tom might leave me."
Nicole Kidman,"I love acting, but it's much more fun taking the kids to the zoo."
Nicole Kidman,You're not anyone in America unless you're on TV.
Nicole Kidman,"Even from a very early age, I knew I didn't want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous."
Nicole Kidman,I have a different approach. I don't file lawsuits because I really don't care.
Anthony Kiedis,"You know I love pot, and I love beer, but I am totally sober, just because it completely stopped working for me."
Anthony Kiedis,"We've just learned how to balance ourselves a little better so that we're happier way more of the time than not, and, you know, being happy is a radical and desirable act if you ask me."
Anthony Kiedis,"We're able to breathe in each other's space at this point, and it was never really like that before, even when we were hyper best friends."
Anthony Kiedis,"We'll have these people hang out with us while we're doing our touring, and talk to them and let them speak their piece to the world."
Anthony Kiedis,"We did that with people like Chris Rock, Woody Harrelson, and the environmentalist Julia Butterfly Hill."
Anthony Kiedis,Sometimes life's so much cooler when you just don't know any better and all the painful lessons have not hammered your head open yet.
Anthony Kiedis,My feeling is that what somebody like us does is much better expressed and conveyed and related to as a policy of attraction rather than promotion.
Anthony Kiedis,"It seems like the chaos of this world is accelerating, but so is the beauty in the consciousness of more and more people."
Anthony Kiedis,"In terms of having high hopes that the level of consciousness will get higher and higher, yeah."
Anthony Kiedis,I would consider him definitely one of my very best friends and I know he feels the same about me. We have a lot of love and respect.
Anthony Kiedis,I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.
Anthony Kiedis,"But then when he left, I realized that it was harder to write songs and feel spiritually connected to art and music as a band. When he came back I felt it again, instantaneously."
Anthony Kiedis,"Also, we're all actually different blood types and we have one represented by each guy in the band."

Soren Kierkegaard,I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both.

Soren Kierkegaard,"If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of potential -- for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible.  Pleasure disappoints; possibility never."
Soren Kierkegaard,"If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!"
Soren Kierkegaard,"At one time my only wish was to be a police official. It seemed to me to be an occupation for my sleepless intriguing mind. I had the idea that there, among criminals, were people to fight: clever, vigorous, crafty fellows. Later I realized that it was good that I did not become one, for most police cases involve misery and wretchedness -- not crimes and scandals."
Soren Kierkegaard,"Pleasure disappoints, possibility never"

Soren Kierkegaard,"Patience is necessary, and one cannot reap immediately where one has sown."
Soren Kierkegaard,"People commonly travel the world over to see rivers and mountains, new stars, garish birds, freak fish, grotesque breeds of human; they fall into an animal stupor that gapes at existence and they think they have seen something."

Soren Kierkegaard,"The most terrible fight is not when there is one opinion against another, the most terrible is when two men say the same thing -- and fight about the interpretation, and this interpretation involves a difference of quality."

Soren Kierkegaard,That is the road we all have to take - over the Bridge of Sighs into eternity.
Soren Kierkegaard,"It is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand, and what those things are. Human understanding has vulgarly occupied itself with nothing but understanding, but if it would only take the trouble to understand itself at the same time it would simply have to posit the paradox."

Soren Kierkegaard,How ironical that it is by means of speech that man can degrade himself below the level of dumb creation -- for a chatterbox is truly of a lower category than a dumb creature.
Soren Kierkegaard,It requires courage not to surrender oneself to the ingenious or compassionate counsels of despair that would induce a man to eliminate himself from the ranks of the living; but it does not follow from this that every huckster who is fattened and nourished in self-confidence has more courage than the man who yielded to despair.
Soren Kierkegaard,There is peace and rest and comfort in sorrow
Soren Kierkegaard,Since my earliest childhood a barb of sorrow has lodged in my heart. As long as it stays I am ironic -- if it is pulled out I shall die.

Soren Kierkegaard,"A man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him."
Soren Kierkegaard,"It was completely fruitless to quarrel with the world, whereas the quarrel with oneself was occasionally fruitful and always, she had to admit, interesting."
Soren Kierkegaard,Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.
Soren Kierkegaard,"Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift; in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate."
Soren Kierkegaard,"What our age lacks is not reflection, but passion."
Soren Kierkegaard,Not just in commerce but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.
Soren Kierkegaard,During the first period of a man's life the greatest danger is not to take the risk.
Soren Kierkegaard,One can advise comfortably from a safe port.
Soren Kierkegaard,"Adversity draws men together and produces beauty and harmony in life's relationships, just as the cold of winter produces ice-flowers on the window-panes, which vanish with the warmth."

Krzysztof Kieslowski,Interior liberty is universal.
Krzysztof Kieslowski,The films should be influenced by the individual commandments to the same degree that the commandments influence our daily lives

Krzysztof Kieslowski,We're always looking at this love through the eyes of the person who is suffering because of this love.
Krzysztof Kieslowski,"In ten phrases, the ten commandments express the essential of life. And these three words-liberty, equality, and fraternity-do just as much. Millions of people have died for those ideals."
Krzysztof Kieslowski,"Do people really want liberty, equality, fraternity? Is it not some manner of speaking?"
Krzysztof Kieslowski,"In believing too much in rationality, our contemporaries have lost something."

Craig Kilborn,"In Massachusetts, scientists have created the first human clone. The bad thing is that in thirty years, the clone will still be depressed because the Boston Red Sox will still have not won a World Series."
Craig Kilborn,Did you see the statue topple? Bill Clinton got nostalgic seeing something that big in a beret go down.
Craig Kilborn,"Happy birthday to former First Lady Barbara Bush, who turned seventy-seven this week. Unfortunately, where her granddaughters helped blow out the candles on her cake, it exploded."

Lemmy Kilmister,"One thing I am very glad of is that I went through the sixties. People who didn't really don't know what they missed.

Lemmy Kilmister,"My earliest memory is shouting: at what and for what reason, I don't know. Probably a tantrum; or I may have been rehearsing. I was always an early starter."

Joe Kines,"He doesn't talk much around anybody. Maybe he does when he's not in the (football) building. What he does say, though, matters. You need to listen when he talks."
Joe Kines,"I thought it was a real solid class. It was a class that met needs. With the package we're playing now (with extra defensive backs), we'll probably load the field with guys who have that kind of ability."

B.B. King,Our passing gave us open looks.

Ben E. King,"When we took on the name The Drifters, we became the new Drifters, and signed a contract to be put on salary, which I think was like a hundred dollars a week, a piece, five hundred dollars for all five of us."

Ben E. King,"The movie is actually from a book by Stephen King called The Body. When they were gonna put it to a motion picture, they found the story was a bit too strong for the title The Body, based on a young kid's movie. It would be too heavy."
Ben E. King,The industry now wants to be in charge of everything.

Ben E. King,"Of course, the kids who had never heard of a person called Ben E. King were then aware of the name associated with the song. That gave a tremendous lift to me as an artist."
Ben E. King,Many times I've gone on tours with Paul Anka. He would have someone sitting behind him to keep people from even talking to him. You were almost in a little restricted area there.

Ben E. King,"But, to complete a song could take weeks."
Ben E. King,"At that time, we were in charge. We didn't ask. We just did. We just did what was in our heart."
Ben E. King,"And, because there was an honesty about all that was going on. It connected with the people in the street."
Ben E. King,We were doing things with a hundred per cent feeling. It wasn't programmed. It wasn't asked for. It wasn't structured. It was just there. It was very raw. I don't think the industry would allow that to happen again.

Billie Jean King,"Be bold. If you're going to make an error, make a doozy, and don't be afraid to hit the ball."

Billie Jean King,"When they take surveys of women in business, of the Fortune 500, the successful women, 80% of them, say they were in sports as a young woman."

I think it's three weeks where he could go up and down, not three weeks where he could play in a game. I think he should have optimism, but it's something I'll talk to his agent about and we'll go from there."

David King,Shareholders benefit either way. I view it as a low-risk situation.
David King,"The development of NEC's Remote Management and Threat Management services is a direct result of the fundamental need of all businesses to provide a reliable and secure network. We believe that our customers benefit from their relationship with a single solutions provider who not only designs and deploys converged networks, but also manages and secures those networks."
David King,"[First Selectmen David King said the town would be very interested in their ideas to correct the problem, and suggested they contact the Maine Department of Transportation (MDOT) to share their ideas.] It sounds like a logical fix to the problem, ... You have our blessing and our thanks."

David King,You know who is coming in and who keeps coming back. You can also test different elements of Web advertising.
Florence King,"Any discussion of the problems of being funny in America will not make sense unless we substitute the word wit for humor. Humor inspires sympathetic good-natured laughter and is favored by the ''healing-power'' gang. Wit goes for the jugular, not the jocular, and it's the opposite of football; instead of building character, it tears it down."

Florence King,Golf is an exercise in Scottish pointlessness for people who are no longer able to throw telephone poles at each other

Florence King,"America is not a democracy, it's an absolute monarchy ruled by King Kid. In a nation of immigrants, the child is automatically more of an American than his parents. Americans regard children as what Mr. Hudson in ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' called ''betters.'' Aping their betters, American adults do their best to turn themselves into children. Puerility exercises droit de seigneur everywhere."
Florence King,"People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they're all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error."
Jason King,"For many women, getting ready to go out is a ritual not to be rushed, with a third of women luxuriating for over an hour to prepare for an evening out - and most aren't off to the Oscars."
Jason King,"It wasn't bad, ... I've got all winter to rest up. I'm not really concerned with pitch counts at this point. You just do whatever it takes to win."

Mark King,There is nothing that has arisen during consultation meetings to date that would require any extension of our due diligence process. We are comfortable with the process.

Martin King,"When we look at modern man, we have to face the fact that modern man suffers from a kind of poverty of the spirit, which stands in glaring contrast with a scientific and technological abundance.

Martin King,All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.
Martin King,The ultimate solution to the race problem lies in the willingness of men to obey the unenforceable.

Martin King,"The arm of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."

Martin King,"It is my hope that as the Negro plunges deeper into the quest for freedom and justice he will plunge even deeper into the philosophy of non-violence. The Negro all over the South must come to the point that he can say to his white brother: ''We will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering. We will meet your physical force with soul force. We will not hate you, but we will not obey your evil laws. We will soon wear you down by pure capacity to suffer.''"

Martin King,"We shall have to repent in this generation , not so much for the evil deeds of the wicked people, but for the appalling silence of the good people"
Martin King,He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.
Martin King,A good many observers have remarked that if equality could come at once the Negro would not be ready for it. I submit that the white American is even more unprepared.

Martin King,Nothing in the world is more dangerous than a sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.
Martin King,"If you lose hope, somehow you lose the vitality that keeps life moving, you lose that courage to be, that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all. And so today I still have a dream.The Trumpet of Conscience"
Martin King,"Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question, 'Is it politic?' But conscience asks the question, 'Is it right?' And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular but because conscience tells one it is right."
Martin King,"Success, recognition, and conformity are the bywords of the modern world where everyone seems to crave the anesthetizing security of being identified with the majority."
Martin King,"Compassion and nonviolence help us to see the enemy's point of view, to hear their questions, to know their assessment of ourselves. For from their point of view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers and sisters who are called the opposition"

Martin King,"I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."
Martin King,"The limitation of riots, moral questions aside, is that they cannot win and their participants know it. Hence, rioting is not revolutionary but reactionary because it invites defeat. It involves an emotional catharsis, but it must be followed by a sense of futility."

Thomas Kinkade,"I blend time frames in my paintings. I tend to like things without the reference of time. A garden could be now, it could be 100 years ago. It's a garden. When I paint hometown settings, things like that, there is a sense of embracing an older life, but I have to say I like to mix time frames. I like to paint what could be now, if the right cars were on the street."
Thomas Kinkade,It is easy to have a lot of paintings or projects hanging around that are 'almost done.'

Steve Kinser,I had to work the whole race tonight. I was struggling to get around the bottom. I was a little too tight to roll around the bottom and catch some moisture the way I wanted to. I got a little bit of a rhythm going. Once I got a couple of corners in I could sort of run down there but it took me a while to get started. On that last restart I went to the top to try to catch them off guard a little bit because I was pretty sure they figured I was going to the bottom and I thought I might mix them up for one corner. Then I just tried to hit my spots and it worked out well.
Steve Kinser,"Being second you have a little bit of an advantage because you can see line and move around to see if you can pick up ground anywhere, ... That's what Danny did. He found the bottom and he beat us down there tonight. He was pretty good once he got in front in clean air. That was the advantage I had while leading was the clean air. Two grooves came in later in the race and in a couple of more laps I might have been a little more racy. It was definitely a fun track, a fast track."
Nastassja Kinski,"But because of these different experiences, and often because of their pain, older people's lives are very fascinating to me."

Henry A. Kissinger,Moderation is a virtue only in those who are thought to have an alternative.
Henry A. Kissinger,Art is man's expression of his joy in labor.
Tom Kite,I didn't think it would be a multiple-shot victory. You had a three-way tie at the top and everybody bunched right behind them. I really thought it would come down to the last hole. David obviously played well.
Tom Kite,"I think they really hurt the higher handicapper. In our case, the bunkers are way too short and we drive over them, or they're too long for us to drive over them. It's a funny golf course."
Tom Kite,"This is definitely the best golf I've played in a long time. My golf swing is great, my putting stroke is great. It's fun to play well and I'm hoping to build on it. ... There is no question about it. To come out and win with this field on this golf course was pretty good."
Tom Kite,You're always going to have some individual incidents that aren't going to show off the Ryder Cup in the true form and spirit that it was made.
Tom Kite,"We went around and looked and talked to a lot of foundations with those charities and decided upon the Children's Hospital. They had a golf tournament at the time, but it was a small event that didn't raise a significant amount of money."
Tom Kite,"The corporate outings were fun, but after doing them for 25 years, they got to be a little old hat."
Tom Kite,"River Place has been a tremendous supporter of the Kids Classic through the years and, hopefully, that relationship will be able to continue."
Tom Kite,"Now the Kids Classic is one of the major fund-raisers for Children's Hospital. Since we started seven years ago, we've raised more than $1 million for the hospital."
Tom Kite,It's fun to get out in the field. I really enjoy that. It's fun creating.
Tom Kite,"It's a piece of property that, if you're going to have a development out here, you need to have a golf course because you need to take care of the effluent water being created by the development."
Tom Kite,Golf course design is exciting.
Tom Kite,But I'd say that probably 70 percent of the bunkering is more to give you an idea of the direction that you want to go or to save your ball from going into worse places.
Tom Kite,A lot of the bunkering is designed more to save you than it is to penalize you.
Tom Kite,"Fear comes in two packages fear of failure, and sometimes, fear of success."
Tom Kite,"You still remember the bad rounds here, but they don't stay with you as long. The Champions Tour is great, it's competitive and it's a wonderful show, but it's not the real big league. The real big league is the PGA Tour, and we all know that."
Tom Kite,You can always find a distraction if you're looking for one.
Tom Kite,Never have a club in your bag that you're afraid to hit.
Tom Kite,Give luck a chance to happen.

Tom Kite,"When I woke up Sunday morning at the Open and stepped outside and felt the wind and rain in my face, I knew I had an excellent chance to win if I just took my time and trusted myself."
Jon Kitna,"It was a weird game. You felt like they were trying to hurry up and get the game over with, so they could get to (the playoffs)."
Jon Kitna,"That was an invitation, to me, to put my best foot forward. That's who I am. I love competitive situations."
Jon Kitna,"I don't see that rookie quarterback glaze in his eyes. I just don't. He's very confident. He knows where he wants to go with the football and most of the time he's right. He's handled it very well, and I think he's going to be as good as advertised."
Ron Kittle,It's the truth. I don't lie. I tell it as it is. It's unfortunate it happened. And I didn't bring it up to sell the books.
Ron Kittle,I have the utmost respect for the man.
Ron Kittle,"Damnedest thing I ever saw in my life. I believe Joe Carter might have taken the centerpiece of the ball. The umpire didn't know what to do, so they gave him a single."
Ron Kittle,"He's such a good player that people hope it's not true. But all the evidence keeps pointing in his direction. I really don't think he should be allowed to play this year ... banished, absolutely."
Ron Kittle,"If it weren't pertaining to my charity, I probably would have cared less and just said he was a jerk. But when there is a chance for me to do something or for his signature to do something for charity, I won't stand for that. It's ironic that his dad (former big-league star Bobby Bonds) died of cancer too."
Ron Kittle,"Obviously, I'm not gonna read the book. Hey, I didn't even want to read my book."
Robert Kiyosaki,"Remember to dream big, think long-term, underacheive on a daily basis, and take baby steps. That is the key to long-term success."
Robert Kiyosaki,The most life-destroying word of all is the word tomorrow
Robert Kiyosaki,"The poor, the unsuccessful, the unhappy, the unhealthy are the ones who use the word tomorrow the most."
Robert Kiyosaki,"Money is kind of a base subject. Like water, food, air and housing, it affects everything yet for some reason the world of academics thinks it's a subject below their social standing."
Robert Kiyosaki,"A lot of people are afraid to tell the truth, to say no. That's where toughness comes into play. Toughness is not being a bully. It's having backbone."
Robert Kiyosaki,We go to school to learn to work hard for money. I write books and create products that teach people how to have money work hard for them.
Robert Kiyosaki,Academic qualifications are important and so is financial education. They're both important and schools are forgetting one of them.
Robert Kiyosaki,"Face your fears and doubts, and new worlds will open to you."
Robert Kiyosaki,"I have a problem with too much money. I can't reinvest it fast enough, and because I reinvest it, more money comes in. Yes, the rich do get richer."
Robert Kiyosaki,"I still consider myself a little, fat kid from Hawaii."
Robert Kiyosaki,"If you want to go somewhere, it is best to find someone who has already been there."
Robert Kiyosaki,You have to be smart. The easy days are over.
Robert Kiyosaki,"When people are lame, they love to blame."
Robert Kiyosaki,A game is like a mirror that allows you to look at yourself.
Robert Kiyosaki,The size of your success is measured by the strength of your desire; the size of your dream; and how you handle disappointment along the way.
Robert Kiyosaki,Inside of every problem lies an opportunity.
Robert Kiyosaki,"Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow"
Larry Klayman,"will now allow Reno to claim she is doing a vigorous investigation of campaign financing, when in reality Judicial Watch's public depositions show she is not. Not even John Huang's secretary has been questioned by Justice investigators; nor has any other Commerce official. Commerce is at the center of the Clinton Administration's illegal fund-raising. In short, the plea agreements are sadly predictable."
Larry Klayman,Vice President Cheney broke the law.
Larry Klayman,She was in fear of bodily injury.
Larry Klayman,"The plea agreement negotiated by Janet Reno's Justice Department with Nora, Gene and Trisha Lum is a hoax. It allows two key players in the campaign finance scandal to plead to lesser offenses and effectively concludes a serious investigation that, if taken to a conclusion, could have seriously affected the Clinton Administration's claim that it committed no illegalities in the campaign finance scandal. Nora Lum was a close confidant of Ron Brown and remains close to John Huang. Trisha Lum, her daughter, worked for Brown at the Commerce Department and worked on trade missions."
Gary Kleeblatt,"But if you look at the overall system, including the quality of homes we have and the increased permanency and services in the home, we think we're making strides."
Gary Kleeblatt,"The department wants to move to a different mode for these kinds of services. Because the governor set this direction, we thought it was the right time."
Gary Kleeblatt,Under these circumstances where a judge sets bail it is because they have decided that a child either presents a serious risk to themselves or the public's safety.
Gary Kleeblatt,That is not shaken by the fact that there are going to be challenges.
Allen Klein,"The hardest thing you can do is smile when you are ill, in pain, or depressed. But this no-cost remedy is a necessary first half-step if you are to start on the road to recovery."
Allen Klein,Humor does not diminish the pain - it makes the space around it get bigger
Allen Klein,"Zen teaches that once we can open up to the inevitability of our demise, we can begin to transform that situation and lighten up about it."
Allen Klein,"You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it."
Allen Klein,"While most of us know that we feel better after a good hearty laugh, science, in many cases, is yet to prove why."
Allen Klein,"Whether planned or not, humor takes our mind off of our troubles."
Allen Klein,"When you think about advertisements, it makes sense that they want to hold and retain our attention."
Allen Klein,"When you do find humor in trying times, one of the first and most important changes you experience is that you see your perplexing problems in a new way - you suddenly have a new perspective on them."
Allen Klein,"When we can find some humor in our upsets, they no longer seem as large or as important as they once did."
Allen Klein,"When times get tough, at some point, people instinctively know they need to lighten up in order to get through it."
Allen Klein,"Today's business and health care climate may not be pleasant. Cutbacks, pay cuts and layoffs do not make anyone's job easy. But that does not mean that the humor need stop."
Allen Klein,"To a child, often the box a toy came in is more appealing than the toy itself."
Allen Klein,"The tragedy of September 11th was so sudden, so enormous, and so horrendous, both in terms of lives lost and global consequences, that this country and the world went into immediate and prolonged shock."

Allen Klein,"Now, a recent study from cardiologists at the University of Maryland, has shown that laughter may have a beneficial effect on the heart."
Allen Klein,"Laughter, and the broader category of humor, are key elements in helping us go on with our life after a loss."
Allen Klein,Laughter can help relieve tension in even the heaviest of matters.
Allen Klein,Laughing is also good for your respiratory system.
Allen Klein,It is still not clear from this study how laughter can directly help the heart but other studies have shown that laughter is beneficial for every system in the body.
Allen Klein,Humor can help you cope with the unbearable so that you can stay on the bright side of things until the bright side actually comes along.
Allen Klein,"A little perspective, like a little humor, goes a long way."
Allen Klein,"Like sheep that get lost nibbling away at the grass because they never look up, we often focus so much on ourselves and our problems that we get lost."
Allen Klein,"And, unlike the earlier bombing on the World Trade Center, a major landmark and symbol of the strength of the financial world was, not just damaged but, totally destroyed."
Allen Klein,"Your attitude is like a box of crayons that color your world. Constantly color your picture gray, and your picture will always be bleak. Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor, and your picture begins to lighten up."
Allen Klein,Kids can amuse themselves with almost anything.
Allen Klein,"In looking for humor, keep in mind this guideline: Sometimes it takes a little time to see the humor in your upsets; you may not find something to laugh about immediately."
Allen Klein,"I contend that not only can you laugh at adversity, but it is essential to do so if you are to deal with setbacks without defeat."
Allen Klein,Humor expands our limited picture frame and gets us to see more than just our problem.
Allen Klein,Humor can be one of our best survival tools.

Allen Klein,Humor does not diminish the pain - it makes the space around it get bigger.
Allen Klein,Humor can alter any situation and help us cope at the very instant we are laughing.
Allen Klein,It has been said that 80% of what people learn is visual.
Joel Klein,This acquisition would lead to higher ticket prices and worse service for the over four million passengers traveling on the routes dominated by the two airlines.
Joel Klein,"The fact that you're going to see the development of monopoly power is perfectly understandable, ... That's what intellectual property is all about. It gives people the incentive to take big risks so that they can make big rewards. We just don't want them to make those rewards over and over again because they as the past victor have a 10-yard advantage in future races."
Joel Klein,humility is not a prescription for abdicating responsibilities.
Joel Klein,"We are determined to see that competition is maintained,"
Joel Klein,"Let me make clear we are not looking for any financial penalties, ... We're concerned with competition."
Joel Klein,"The lawsuit we have just filed is designed to accomplish one thing -- to protect competition in the airline industry which, in turn, will lower prices and expand choices for our traveling public,"
Joel Klein,"Our action today demonstrates that we're not going to give carte blanche approval to mergers in the defense industry, ... While industry downsizing can be desirable, or even necessary, we will do what it takes to preserve effective competition."
Ralph Klein,"That support was not what I anticipated, nor is it strong enough for me to stay on as long as I had intended."
Ralph Klein,"It is an absolute poison and a scourge on society and it is time to talk about it,"
Ralph Klein,exposed to activities and toxic chemicals that put their lives at risk.
Ralph Klein,"It's my hope that this auditorium, along with the hundreds of other centennial projects, will spur Albertans to even greater heights in the next 100 years. That's the power and the purpose of a legacy, to inspire those that are touched by it,"

Ralph Klein,"The animal that was diseased was taken immediately out of the human food chain, ... If they had that tracking system relative to tracking down terrorists, I think they'd be caught a long time ago."
Ralph Klein,"Our only hope is that it [the endowment fund] will help Canadians who need it to achieve their dreams,"
Ralph Klein,"I had the chance to take a look at the impact and reach of the spill on the lake and along the shoreline, ... Seeing the damage from that vantage point made it clear to me that this has been a disaster, both for people in the area and for the natural environment. Its heartbreaking."
Ralph Klein,"Randy Travis would be good here, too. I'm a real country and western fan,"
Ralph Klein,We're the only G8 country that doesn't have a national transportation plan.
Ralph Klein,"When that happens, there are choices we can make about how surplus funds can be used strategically and deliberately to invest in Alberta's future, ... They will be made throughout the year as our financial forecasts are updated."
Ralph Klein,"It will give government the power to rescue, defend and shelter these children, ... These children are being exposed to activities and toxic chemicals that put their lives at risk."
Ralph Klein,"Then the price of oil went down and the rest of Canada, of course, were wringing their hands in glee saying, 'Oh well, you deserved it.'"
Ralph Klein,"It's important to travel the country, to understand that what's good for Alberta is good for the rest of Canada in terms of the taxes we pay and the contributions to the rest of Confederation."
Ralph Klein,"These scholarships are a small way of expressing Albertans' thanks to Canada for 100 years of being part of the best country in the world,"
Ralph Klein,It is a young man's game and it is a blood sport.
Ralph Klein,"After all, we're gearing up to have one heck of a birthday party on Sept. 1."
Robert Klein,What the litigation has done is coalesced even further support from individuals who are outraged that the opposition would take to the court to try to defeat the will of the people.
Robert Klein,"Stem cell research in California has officially begun. We will win in this fight against a small and politically motivated minority, step by step. They will not keep medical research from improving the lives of millions of people. We owe it to the voters, we owe it to patients, we owe it to the families of California."
Robert Klein,"As we developed that reputation, the volume has increased, ... Being a new facility and having high visibility, we felt that it was a product line that we wanted to focus on."
Robert Klein,"I applaud Senator Feinstein and Governor Schwarzenegger who are part of the growing bipartisan coalition of leaders determined to give hope to patients and families suffering from chronic disease and injury. However, the Brownback bill in the United States Senate would prohibit a technique that allows critical patient-specific stem cell research. If passed, this would have overwhelming and devastating consequences to the advancement of medical science here in California and around the world, severely harming our research funding program in California and undermining the basic right of families in this country to gain access to ethical therapies to help their loved ones. We owe it to the future of California and the nation to follow the vision of hope for patients."
Robert Klein,uncharted leap of blind faith.
Robert Klein,"The '50s were terrifying with nuclear bomb stuff but boring in a social way and then the '60s were happening, and remember, there was no AIDS."

Robert Klein,My son has been a class clown and it sort of ran in the family.
Robert Klein,I was a class clown.
Robert Klein,"But to do it professionally is a quantum leap difference and my father had to be persuaded by these kind of Ivy League professors that I should go to the Yale Drama School, another one of the stories in there."
Robert Klein,And the only studies were - Rodney Dangerfield was my mentor and he was my Yale drama school for comedy.
Robert Klein,"But I think the other is a little more like bullfighting, a little more daring and although I appreciate good acting and I liked being versatile my whole career, it kept me working."
Robert Klein,The Broad research center represents the highest quality model of what Proposition 71 should be funding.
Ross Klein,still red hot and white hot for innovation. W Las Vegas will definitely be a laboratory for a lot of what we are doing.
Ross Klein,"In true W Hotel fashion, we have positioned this brand in a way that has resonated with developers. Our first five partners are ready to ease on down the road, bringing a sassy, refreshing oasis to the market."
Ross Klein,"When devastating events like Katrina hit, we discover a new level of leadership and determination. We are extremely proud of Marcus and Leon, and the entire W team in New Orleans for their strength and spirit."
Ross Klein,"Hotels are probably the best design showrooms for beds and home furnishings that exist right now. People can experience luxury with us for a night or two, then decide what they want for their home. You know, it's awfully hard to spend the night at Bloomingdale's."

Grenville Kleiser,"As you put into practice the qualities of patience, punctuality, sincerity, and solicitude, you will have a better opinion of the world around you"
Grenville Kleiser,"People who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others have idled, have persevered while others gave up in despair, and have practiced early in life the valuable habits of self-denial, industry, and singleness of purpose. As a result, they enjoy in later life the success often erroneously attributed to good luck."
Grenville Kleiser,Do not let trifles disturb your tranquility of mind. . . . Life is too precious to be sacrificed for the nonessential and transient. . . . Ignore the inconsequential!

Gerard Kleisterlee,"Underlying performance in our businesses has improved as a result of cost controls and better operating efficiencies, which is fundamental as we do not see much of an economic improvement in the near future,"
Gerard Kleisterlee,"Thanks to solid underlying performance during the quarter, we are on track with our financial targets and delivering on our commitments."
Gerard Kleisterlee,It's a good step in that direction.
Gerard Kleisterlee,"There is a lack of value creation, particularly around consumer electronics,"
Juergen Klinsmann,"This is something I can't do anything about, so I don't really worry about it. We are focusing on the sporting side. We know what this team is capable of. ... We are following our course and we are also trying to have fun."
Juergen Klinsmann,"He could have stumbled his way through but only at about 70 or 80 percent of his usual performance, and would have then needed surgery afterwards."
Juergen Klinsmann,"The title is not an illusion. Otherwise, Greece would have been an illusion too."
Juergen Klinsmann,Italy gave us a lesson. When they scored two goals in the first (seven) minutes we didn't know how to respond. We made too many errors and weren't able to put Italy in danger. My compliments to Lippi and Italy.
Juergen Klinsmann,Mike has impressed us for some time as he's found his game and used goal chances with enormous energy and the right instinct.
Juergen Klinsmann,We've learned from it. You get to know where your enemies are.
Juergen Klinsmann,The 4-1 defeat in Italy was not as bad as some people said it was and this 4-1 victory against the United States may not be as good as some people will say.
Juergen Klinsmann,The media criticism from the past weeks has been below the belt for most parts and had nothing to do with the sporting side of things. I think it was tremendously important for us to win tonight.
Juergen Klinsmann,Greece is a hardship case and more shocks will be coming. It's a blow for the whole country after Euro 2004 and personally I'm very sorry.
Jurgen Klinsmann,"I do swear a lot, but the advantage is that having played abroad, I can choose a different language from the referee's."
Jurgen Klinsmann,Everything is possible in football and you can never tell what might happen as far as injuries are concerned over the next few weeks.
Jurgen Klinsmann,We can now concentrate completely on the football.

Jurgen Klinsmann,"I really have no desire to make everyone happy,"
Jurgen Klinsmann,"Personally, I need a high level of physical fitness in order to feel at ease."
Tom Kloza,We know how well appeals to personal sacrifice work.
Tom Kloza,We're seeing a race against the clock with logistics.
Tom Kloza,"Even though the EIA data is what one would say is bearish, you have to put it into perspective."
Tom Kloza,We're at the magic 100 days right before the year ends when gas prices drop.
Tom Kloza,"Normally the strife and rhetoric in Nigeria are standard background noise for the industry as there are always labor issues and rebel threats in that ... country. However, this time it seems a bit more serious, and it's likely to spark a surge in prices early this week."
Tom Kloza,"It's one thing to sort of send the prices up for gold or silver. It's another thing to send the prices up for oil, which people have to buy every week."
Tom Kloza,if for no other reason than these numbers are harsh enough they will force most carriers to start canceling some flights.
Tom Kloza,"Throughout the last decade, we've seen February fire sales on gasoline that represented the 'perishable' winter blends that had limited shelf life."
Tom Kloza,This is speculation and fear about what is more or less a typical September event. It really underscores how maniacal the entire oil trading business has become.
Tom Kloza,The story of the (oil) market these days is wild swings. Geopolitical events could surface at any moment that could lead to a temporary spike.
Tom Kloza,This is a crisis. You are going to see some runs on supply.
Tom Kloza,"We can now describe this as a fuel crisis, and specifically in regard to gasoline. We are no longer dealing with anything resembling stability in the supply sector."
Tom Kloza,"What we're dealing with is not a crude-oil crisis â€” it's a gasoline crisis, ... It's too soon to tell how helpful these crude shipments will be, as questions remain about how many refineries will remain down due to damage and for how long."
Tom Kloza,"What we're dealing with is not a crude-oil crisis -- it's a gasoline crisis. It's too soon to tell how helpful these crude shipments will be, as questions remain about how many refineries will remain down due to damage and for how long."
Tom Kloza,What we're dealing with is not a crude-oil crisis ? it's a gasoline crisis.
Tom Kloza,These are pretty threatening circumstances.
Tom Kloza,"Refineries are flooded, don't have power, are under very, very dire circumstances,"
Tom Kloza,These are pretty challenging circumstances.
Tom Kloza,One thing we learned after Katrina is the public doesn't have that type of appetite for prices above $4 a gallon.
Tom Kloza,"America topped its tanks, and then the knee-jerk reaction was, 'I'm not going to pay $3.19 a gallon for gas,'"
Alexander Kluge,"You cannot limit yourself to one area of specialized craft. Instead, regardless of craft, you have to charge all forms of expression that lead to the community, to other people, with meaning."
Alexander Kluge,"When I think of the library of Alexandria and of the fact that, although it burnt down, people continue to sort the letters of the alphabet according to that tradition, then that makes certain expressions of modernity, even of interventions on the textual level, possible."
Alexander Kluge,"We don't perceive a contradiction between writing books, making films or producing a television program. These days you can't choose how you want to express yourself anymore."
Alexander Kluge,"We are not just representing the cultural magazines here, but also an investigative journalistic position which is part of the classic public sphere."
Alexander Kluge,"The one thing about program television that's absolutely incompatible with any concept of art is that all decisions have to be made by program directors, whereas art is autonomous. It may be dependent, but it knows no superiors."
Alexander Kluge,"Similar to the telescope or the telephone, television enables us to see or hear things we never dreamed of. When you look at the details, a concrete scene between people is really something incredibly unlikely, something subtle that requires extended description."
Alexander Kluge,"If they had Mozart today, they couldn't work with him, although he was a very adaptable man."
Alexander Kluge,"I don't pay attention to target audiences and therefore I often hear that I am a ratings killer, somebody who fundamentally doesn't care whether one person is watching or an entire soccer stadium."
Alexander Kluge,"Hidden in a long text, there are perhaps three lines that count."
Alexander Kluge,"As soon as you judge communication a little more rigorously, there is a possibility that the message will not be democratized. I have to say what I believe to be right. I have to spread out the statement among all the means of expression available to us at present."
Jack Klugman,"It worked. It really worked, ... It was a successful night. But more importantly, it was Tony's way of building my confidence."
Jack Klugman,The reason is simple. It's my love for Tony. But you know what? I still enjoy meeting people who respect my career. Trips like this remind me how much I love show business.
Jack Klugman,"He told me the show always made his father laugh, particularly at a time when laughter was necessary in his life. Meetings like that keep you on the road for a long time,"
Jack Klugman,It wasn't that kind of relationship.
Jack Klugman,"I was reluctant to take the TV role, ... How does a TV series follow a classic Broadway comedy?"
Jack Klugman,Suddenly it was gone. I'd lost more than my voice and my career. I'd lost my best friend.
Jack Klugman,"I'm being asked why, at my age, I'm going on this tough road tour to promote a book,"
Patrick Kluivert,"With wings, the space between the lines is less, ... we had to run so much while on the defensive that we came up short offensively."
Patrick Kluivert,"I have come to Valencia to score goals and not to go to parties, people are soon going to realize that."
Patrick Kluivert,"I feel good, I have a place in the Newcastle team and I am scoring goals -- what else do I have to do to get my place back?"
Chad Knaus,"Just because I wasn't at those race tracks doesn't take anything away from what we've been doing. When I wasn't here, I was just as happy for this team winning races as I was today."
Chad Knaus,"There's fear at first, but you only understand what's happening for a split second. Then, it's over. Plus, if you hit something hard enough, it'll rattle your head, which means you don't really remember anything from the crash."
Chad Knaus,"Drivers don't know what' going in these race cars, ever. Jimmie isn't really into knowing what is going on with the race cars. He shows up and drives and gives his feedback and goes home."
Chad Knaus,We were testing too close to an event. We didn't have time to react once we got the cars back to the shop to make changes of any substance.
Chad Knaus,"It's hard to place blame on anybody when you're racing in a pack that is that close with the speeds those guys are running out there. For the most part they all do a pretty good job. All it takes is one little slip-up by somebody or by two or three people, you're going to have a heck of a crash. It's just unfortunate."
Chad Knaus,"In the face of adversity, this team fights so strong. We've got the best race car driver, the best team, the best engine, the best everything."
Chad Knaus,"Everybody does whatever they can to find an advantage, ... Maybe we found a small advantage there, and maybe they're upset about it. But we're not pushing gray areas, that's a misconception."
Chad Knaus,"You get a team that goes out there and they find a little bit of something ... that advantage is going to seem larger then it is if the rules were not as tight because it's harder for other people to find whatever that advantage may be. I'm not saying [points leader Tony Stewart] has a huge advantage. What they've got is that they are hitting everything exactly right. When they have everything working just right, that's how it shows to be dominant."
Mike Knezevich,"It is a common tragic irony that the loudest people are rarely the ones who are the smartest or most correct, yet they are more often than not the ones with the most unsolicited advice on how everything should be."
Mike Knezevich,"It is a common tragic irony that the loudest people with the least education or variety of life experiences are rarely the ones who are the smartest or most correct, yet they are more often than not the ones with the most unsolicited advice on how everything should be."
Mike Knezevich,"At times, some are able to make up for what they lack in skill or ability by a sincere and genuine desire to simply do the right thing."
Evel Knievel,"You come to a point in your life when you really don't care what people think about you, you just care what you think about yourself."
Evel Knievel,"Well, I ride just a couple times a week."
Evel Knievel,"This is a year and a few months after the transplant. Before I had it my doctors told me that it would be the biggest thing that I ever had to face and believe me, when they take your liver out of ya and put another one in it's like replacing a football in your stomach."
Evel Knievel,The other thing I wanted but never got to do had something to do with Liz Taylor but she's getting a little old and a little fat.
Evel Knievel,"Riding a motorcycle on today's highways, you have to ride in a very defensive manner. You have to be a good rider and you have to have both hands and both feet on the controls at all times."
Evel Knievel,"My wife and I, we like to ride where there's not much traffic."
Evel Knievel,"My own judgment of how the world is gonna end is that there will be a country led by a madman that will build a nuclear bomb with so much force, so much power, that it will be dropped somewhere on the face of this earth and that the earth will lose it's place."
Evel Knievel,"I've been in a treatment center for drinkin'. I stayed for two days, then escaped."
Evel Knievel,"I've been asked to do a TV reality show where I'd pick the greatest daredevil in the world. I'm giving it some serious thought, too."
Evel Knievel,I thought I was bulletproof or Superman there for a while. I thought I'd never run out of nerve. Never.
Evel Knievel,"I think through education, belief in God, and good engineering, our children become a lot better at what they're doing than we did, and that starts with the very first sign of life on the face of this earth."
Evel Knievel,"I recently have had a full hip replacement and a liver transplant, and I'm getting used to the medication."
Evel Knievel,"I really think we should pass a law in every state, I don't care whether it takes the independence away from an old person or not. You shouldn't be driving a car if you're over the age of 80. Maybe even less than that."
Evel Knievel,I love the feeling of the fresh air on my face and the wind blowing through my hair.
Evel Knievel,Harley-Davidson is the finest company in the world.
Evel Knievel,But you come to a point in your life when you can't pull the trigger anymore.
Evel Knievel,There are a lot of myths about my injuries. They say I have broken every bone in my body. Not true. But I have broken 35 bones. I had surgery 14 times to pin and plate. I shattered my pelvis. I forget all of the things that have broke.
Evel Knievel,"I think these shows with the young kids doing these jumps, doing these fantastic back flips, I think they're absolutely great. They did what I never did."
Evel Knievel,I did everything by the seat of my pants. That's why I got hurt so much.
Evel Knievel,When I hit that pavement at 70 or 80 mph those suits just ripped.
Evel Knievel,The Harley's got a little too much torque when it comes to jumping.
Evel Knievel,"If I'm out trailriding, I have a favorite motorcycle. Riding on the road, I've got a favorite. If I'm jumping, I have a favorite, and if I'm racing, I have a favorite."
Evel Knievel,I think I coulda landed on a dime. I really do.
Evel Knievel,I know that I'm very lucky to be alive. For 35 or 40 years I've spilt my blood and broke my bones and spent years in hospitals.
Evel Knievel,I know guys in my hometown that drive by feel and sound.
Evel Knievel,I guess I thought I was Elvis Presley but I'll tell ya something. All Elvis did was stand on a stage and play a guitar. He never fell off on that pavement at no 80 mph.
Evel Knievel,I foresee the Chinese ruling the world. What are you going to do to stop it? No president of the United States will ever have enough power to stop the Chinese when they want to take over the world.
Evel Knievel,"I am a lucky, lucky person."
Bobby Knight,"If my primary purpose here at Indiana is to go out and win ballgames, I can probably do that as well as anybody can. I would just cheat, get some money from alot of people around Indianapolis who want to run the operation that way, and just go out and get the best basketball players I can. Then we'd beat everybody."
Bobby Knight,"Everyone wants to be on a winning team,but no one wants to come to practice"
Bobby Knight,"We don't have any physical description. We don't know how many subjects were involved, which is mind boggling, with all those people around,"
Bobby Knight,"Well, I think it's pretty much established that I just didn't have any interest in coaching in the pros."
Bobby Knight,The key is not the will to win... everybody has that. It is the will to prepare to win that is important.
Bobby Knight,"If I came in to recruit your son, I would tell you, your wife, and your son, that I will be the most demanding coach your son can play for."

Bobby Knight,I don't intend to retire.
Bobby Knight,"As I've said, basketball has been, I think, a real cooperative venture. There have been a lot of people that have been involved in it: coaches, administrators - not recently - fans and nobody, nobody any more so than students over the years."
Bobby Knight,"And I would be the first to admit that probably, in a lot of press conferences over the time that I have been in coaching, indulging my own sense of humor at press conferences has not been greatly to my benefit."
Bobby Knight,"People change over the years, and that changes situations for good and for bad."
Bobby Knight,Walking has been ridiculous in college basketball the past 15 years.
Bobby Knight,I don't have to wait until the next morning to regret something I did that was kinda dumb.

Bobby Knight,"You don't play against opponents, you play against the game of basketball."
Phil Knight,"I was very aware of shoes when I was running track. The American shoes were offshoots of tire companies. Shoes cost $5, and you would come back from a 5-mile run with your feet bleeding."
Phil Knight,"They have done great things within what you would call established American sports. Freddy has the potential to bring soccer almost for the first time into the public's consciousness. Soccer in the United States isn't really part of the culture. What it needs, I think, is a superhero, and he clearly could be it. Now, that's putting a lot of pressure on him, but the kid's got all the potential to do that."
Phil Knight,"We're not in the fashion business, as the Wall Street Journal wrote the other day. We're in the sports business, and there's a big difference."
Phil Knight,"At first, we couldn't be establishment, because we didn't have any money. We were guerrilla marketers, and we still are, a little bit. But, as we became No. 1 in our industry, we've had to modify our culture and become a bit more planned."
Phil Knight,"We could see that he was a charismatic guy who jumps over the moon and is very competitive, but nobody could have predicted what he would become to our culture."
Phil Knight,"Our business practices are no different than those of our competitors, but we are bigger, and thus more visible, so we get more flack."
Phil Knight,"You can't explain much in 60 seconds, but when you show Michael Jordan, you don't have to. It's that simple."
Phil Knight,"Sports is like rock 'n' roll. Both are dominant cultural forces, both speak an international language, and both are all about emotions."
Phil Knight,"Ultimately, we wanted Nike to be the world's best sports and fitness company. Once you say that, you have a focus. You don't end up making wing tips or sponsoring the next Rolling Stones world tour."

Shirley Knight,"I don't think you want her around too often, she kind of takes over,"
Shirley Knight,The only people you can really share certain things with in secret are your girlfriends.
Shirley Knight,"There are things that you cannot talk to your mother and father about, there are things that you cannot talk to your children about."

Suge Knight,You got good and bad people everywhere.
Suge Knight,The best revenge in the world is success.
Suge Knight,"I'm passionate about everything, like my family and friends. Anybody I am talkin' to is gonna be bona fide real. There is no substitution for happiness. Period."
Suge Knight,I never seen no shootin'. I only know what I heard and what I read. I had no involvement.
Suge Knight,"I like Biggie. Like 'Pac, he was one of the best rappers in the business. Why would I try to do something to him?"

Suge Knight,I cook my own breakfast on my hot plate.
Suge Knight,"I can only spend $140 a month in here. I'm saving, like, $10,000 a day."
Suge Knight,How could you be from the ghetto and be a rat?
Suge Knight,"Basically, people are never happy enough because they want more money."
Suge Knight,"As far as anybody in the rap game ever tryin' to assassinate my character, that's impossible. You talkin' about a man who has always walked the walk and talked the talk."
Suge Knight,"There is a difference between me and most, which is that I am fresh off the block. I don't look for no special privileges. I'm a man who paid my does."
Suge Knight,People don't know how hard it is to have your own business.
Suge Knight,No person ever gave me nothing but God.
Suge Knight,My thing was to be the man who makes his little 30 or 40 million a year and still get a cheeseburger and fries and don't worry about an autograph.
Suge Knight,My kids get everything they want and are raised well.
Suge Knight,"If you wanna cross somebody, then do that. Don't act like it wasn't you."
Suge Knight,"If you always been my enemy, it's still that way."
Suge Knight,"If I stay in here until I am 100 years olds, I will still be a man."
Suge Knight,"Anytime you have somebody doing positive stuff and just doing their time and minding their own business, people will sit up there and lie."
Keira Knightley,"There were three women standing there with their bums facing me, ... Talk about a surreal moment. You're literally choosing the best bum in the bunch."

Keira Knightley,"When I was about 5 I think, I desperately wanted to be a pirate and have the hat and everything."

Mark Knopfler,"Everybody has their own ideas of Shangri-La ... I tried to teach myself to enjoy the present, enjoy the now,"
Mark Knopfler,Emmy brings such a wealth of experience that it's like a director having the finest actress for a film. What is on the page is given a real living dimension and a character who you can see.
Mark Knopfler,"As soon as you hear her taking the line, you see the character. She's not just a girl singing anymore; she's much more representative of something female. I think that's a depth that comes from her massive experience and ability."
Mark Knopfler,"I'm not a collector, however, and I have no desire to own 50 or 60 guitars."
Mark Knopfler,"I'm also getting an Ovation Legend, because I like them so much."
Mark Knopfler,"I was into playing American music, especially the blues."
Mark Knopfler,"I love Gibsons, and Nationals, too. There's something magical about them."

Mark Knopfler,"I finally got a job teaching English in a college, which I was delighted to have because it proved to be a real steadying influence."
Mark Knopfler,"I even played bass for a while. Besides playing electric guitar, I'd also get asked to play some acoustic stuff. But, since I didn't have an acoustic guitar at the time, I used to borrow one from a friend so I could play folk joints."
Mark Knopfler,"I don't really think of Dire Straits as a sound, you know. It. just depends on the song, and the stuff we're doing is so varied."
Mark Knopfler,"I don't like definitions, but if there is a definition of freedom, it would be when you have control over your reality to transform it, to change it, rather than having it imposed upon you. You can't really ask for more than."
Mark Knopfler,"I bad a piano long before I bad a guitar, and the practice I got just playing those three chords in a basic 12-bar blues song was very important."
Mark Knopfler,Every guitar I own gets used and has its purpose.
Mark Knopfler,"Each song has its own secret that's different from another song, and each has its own life. Sometimes it has to be teased out, whereas other times it might come fast. There are no laws about songwriting or producing. It depends on what you're doing, not just who you're doing."
Mark Knopfler,"And another thing: Stay responsive to any environment that comes along, and try to reflect what you feel in a wide variety of styles and songs."
Mark Knopfler,"After a while, though, the group just wasn't a good vehicle for the songs I'd written."
John Knowles,I'm leery about trying to prohibit them at the current location.
John Knowles,"The novel has one peculiarity for a school novel: It never attacks the place; it isn't an expose; it doesn't show sadistic masters or depraved students, or use any of the other school-novel sensationalistic cliches. That's because I didn't experience things like that there."
John Knowles,An abscess on his leg developed and he was in so much pain.
John Knowles,"Young people in my generation were sort of in lockstep, and it wasn't just the '40s, either. In the '30s and in the '50s it was the same. No one ever dropped out unless he got sick or got kicked out."
John Knowles,"Exeter was, I suspect, more crucial in my life than in the lives of most members of my class, and conceivably, than in the lives of almost anyone else who ever attended the school."
John Knowles,"My father was in the coal business in West Virginia. Both dad and mother were, however, originally from Massachusetts; New England, to them, meant the place to go if you really wanted an education."
John Knowles,The summer of 1943 at Exeter was as happy a time as I ever had in my life.
John Knowles,"There are simply more young people than there ever were. You get this feeling of strength. Also, large numbers can be a drawback, making it difficult to lose one's anonymity."
John Knowles,The best teaching I ever experienced was at Exeter. Yale was a distinct letdown afterward.
John Knowles,Teenagers today are more free to be themselves and to accept themselves.
Henry Knox,"We imagined that the mildness of our government and the wishes of the people were so correspondent that we were not as other nations, requiring brutal force to support the laws."
Henry Knox,"We have arrived at that point of time in which we are forced to see our own humiliation, as a nation, and that a progression in this line cannot be a productive of happiness, private or public."
Henry Knox,"Unless this is done, we shall be liable to be ruled by an arbitrary and capricious armed tyranny, whose word and will must be law."
Henry Knox,"This dreadful situation, for which our government have made no adequate provision, has alarmed every man of principle and property in New England."
Henry Knox,"The powers of Congress are totally inadequate to preserve the balance between the respective States, and oblige them to do those things which are essential for their own welfare or for the general good."
Henry Knox,The frame of mind in the local legislatures seems to be exerted to prevent the federal constitution from having any good effect.
Henry Knox,"That taxes may be the ostensible cause is true, but that they are the true cause is as far remote from truth as light from darkness."
Henry Knox,"Men at a distance, who have admired our systems of government unfounded in nature, are apt to accuse the rulers, and say that taxes have been assessed too high and collected too rigidly."
Henry Knox,"Having proceeded to this length, for which they are now ripe, we shall have a formidable rebellion against reason, the principle of all government, and against the very name of liberty."
Henry Knox,"Every friend to the liberty of his country is bound to reflect, and step forward to prevent the dreadful consequences which shall result from a government of events."
Henry Knox,"But we find that we are men,-actual men, possessing all the turbulent passions belonging to that animal, and that we must have a government proper and adequate for him."
Kris Kobach,"This is a mistake that could cost Utah taxpayers money. Last time I checked, Utah was not a state that supported high-stakes gambling."
Kris Kobach,"A law that very specifically said no state can give in-state tuition to illegal aliens unless that state gives in-state tuition to all U.S. citizens, regardless of where they come from."
Kris Kobach,The number one group that suffers when illegal aliens enter the United States en masse is the lower income U-S citizen worker.
Kris Kobach,Article II will trump anything Congress tries to do through statute.
Masuhisa Kobayashi,"Given that producer prices have risen more than 2 percent over the past few months, we have to consider that in Japan's corporate environment inflation is already mounting. Producer price inflation is highly likely to translate into consumer price increases."
Masuhisa Kobayashi,Japan's growth prospects look more promising and we are on the threshold of an end to deflation. Yields are set to increase.
Masuhisa Kobayashi,The fact that BOJ acted in the face of resistance from certain government officials and politicians means the market must now focus its attention on the central bank rather than the government.
Masuhisa Kobayashi,"Although some government officials and ruling bloc lawmakers remain reluctant toward an early policy shift, there are nearly no objections in the private sector, including the banking industry, the insurance industry and business lobbies."
Masuhisa Kobayashi,"As the government is growing increasingly receptive to the idea of a policy shift, the central bank could very well change policy as early as March 9."
Masuhisa Kobayashi,Giving a super-clear predictability on the course of monetary policy will not be good for any central bank.
Masuhisa Kobayashi,"As the data show, the gap between domestic supply and demand is clearly narrowing, which should create the environment for prices to rise stably."
Alexander Koch,The worst in retail sales should be behind us. A recovery of private consumption is in the cards this year.
Alexander Koch,One should not translate the increase one-on-one into future hard data.
Alexander Koch,"The current economic situation should improve the overall labor market situation in the course of the year. However, the creation of new jobs will fall short of the dynamic in business investment."
Janeen Koconis,I looked at the greeting-card industry and saw that there was so much potential in it.
Janeen Koconis,"You know, I kind of fixated on D.H. Lawrence at one point. So I kind of look at what I'm into. Sometimes I'm looking at visual information -- very graphic -- and other times I'm kind of deep into text."
Janeen Koconis,I don't like getting sucked into the fashion of the moment.
Helmut Kohl,"I do not consider it necessary to call a meeting of G7 leaders, but also do not rule out a meeting, ... I do not think a summit would help at the moment."
Helmut Kohl,"These measures contribute significantly to increasing the confidence of foreign investors, ... Germany will support the reform process with great commitment."
Helmut Kohl,"The army is under orders to defend every place,"
Herb Kohl,"As all of us with any involvement in sports knows, no two umpires or no two referees have the same strike zone or call the same kind of a basketball game."
Herb Kohl,"She made the point that it was at a different time for a different purpose, ... And (she said) we should not read too much into that in terms of where she might be on the issue of privacy, and a woman's right to choose."
Herb Kohl,"If (Roberts) had been nominated, as he was originally, to replace Justice O'Connor, then his confirmation would have moved the Court to the right, ... That would have a much more difficult decision. It is my hope that the White House recognizes this concern when they choose their next nominee."
Herb Kohl,"Judicial excellence involves candor before confirmation. We are being asked to give the nominee enormous power, so we want to know how he or she will exercise this power and how they see the world. And we need and deserve to know what is in your mind and in your heart."
Herb Kohl,"Those kinds of decisions emanate from the GM, I don't know if it's something that happens in the second year of a deal. I find that hard to believe."
Herb Kohl,"When the President makes something a priority, we see action."
Andrew Kohut,There's not as much economic optimism as might be warranted by hard economic indicators.
Andrew Kohut,"If there's less violence there generally and our people are not getting hurt and there is some feeling that this is a better place than it was, there might be some benefit for Bush -- or at least stop the bleeding."
Andrew Kohut,"What moves public opinion are big events; things just don't happen. If things were to go swimmingly in Iraq, or if the economy were to take off like a rocket, that might silence Bush's critics."
Andrew Kohut,"I think that to really move the needle on Iraq, events there on the ground are going to have to change. Fewer casualties, things like that."
Andrew Kohut,This wasn't a definitive debate. Bush didn't put Gore away; Gore didn't put Bush away.
Andrew Kohut,this has not been one of the issues at the forefront of debate about the Supreme Court.
Andrew Kohut,"People do make a distinction between what someone does in his personal life and his ability to do his job. However, if this involved perjury or obstruction of justice, which speaks to his role as president, the public has not come to any conclusion on that yet."
Jeff Koinange,I can only see two police officers.
Jeff Koinange,peace is literally just around the corner.
Jeff Koinange,"Their intention is to block off the main western access to the airport,"
Jeff Koinange,You can hear rumblings in the distance. It looks like the cease-fire is dead in the water. When the delays were going on you knew one of the sides was not going to sign -- and it turned out to be the government.
Jeff Koinange,In typical Robert Mugabe fashion he doesn't want to be outdone by any of these countries. He just wants to go ahead and withdraw his country from the Commonwealth.
Jeff Koinange,"But in terms of the counting itself, so far there have been no complaints."
Junichiro Koizumi,swallowed his own words.
Junichiro Koizumi,exchange of harsh words.
Junichiro Koizumi,"I tried to make it (the policy speech) as concise as possible. I wanted to concentrate on what I wanted to say,"

Junichiro Koizumi,"I offer deep prayers from my heart to those who were killed,"
Junichiro Koizumi,"Koizumi wants to go out when he is at his peak and basking in glory - that way he can avoid dealing with the chronic problems plaguing Japan like the pensions crisis, the social welfare nightmare and our battered relations with China and Korea, a problem directly caused by Koizumi's insensitive brand of nationalism."
Junichiro Koizumi,"With many issues postponed into the future, the situation has not reached a stage to conduct a sufficient evaluation, and so its performance has to be described as being only halfway along its path."
Junichiro Koizumi,I think the conclusion should be reached from the viewpoint of food safety.
Junichiro Koizumi,"I went with various feelings, including wishes for Japan's peace and prosperity,"
Junichiro Koizumi,We must not be swayed by these temporary events.

Junichiro Koizumi,"With the cooling U.S. economy and a series of profit warnings from tech firms both at home and abroad, high tech shares appear too risky at the moment to handle,"
Junichiro Koizumi,The pains felt by Asian countries are our own pains. Disaster in Asia is nothing but ours as well.
Junichiro Koizumi,"There is an argument that if U.S.-Japan relations are too good, Japan could lose its direction,"

Junichiro Koizumi,to the best of its ability.
Oskar Kokoschka,"I used to be too subjective, and I was always tempted to find my inner self in the exterior and dissipate my imagination on other people and on life."
Oskar Kokoschka,"In the midst of the confusions of nature one person trusting eternally in another, and making himself and the other secure through faith."
Oskar Kokoschka,"The most fundamental in me is coming uppermost, and the transient, the sensational, is dispersing, because it can't adversely influence what is essential to me."
Jim Kolbe,they have got to turn up the heat?. The president has got to work on building up support for this.
Jim Kolbe,The bill before us today does nothing to solve the real problems of immigration. It's worse than nothing because it tries to fool the public. It pulls the wool over their eyes. It pretends we are doing something to secure our border when in fact we are doing nothing except throw words and money at the problem.
Jim Kolbe,"Now there's going to be buying power over these plans and it's going to force the prices down, so it's going to effect their profit line a little bit on the bottom line. It's going to cut off a little of their profits, if there's the competition we think there's going to be."
Jim Kolbe,"Through free trade, we have exported our principles, as well as our products - sharing America's freedom and democracy with the world,"
Jim Kolbe,A free trade agreement with Malaysia is about more than economics.
Jim Kolbe,"I'm looking forward to the day when we have a free trade agreement (with New Zealand),"
Ram Kolluri,Their lives are a lot different from ours. We want to gain an understanding of their daily lives.
Ram Kolluri,"The earnings have been good, and that's given the stock market some underlying support."
Ram Kolluri,"The numbers have been good, and due to the strength of the global economic recovery, I contend that the second, third and fourth quarter earnings will be better than what people are currently expecting,"
Ram Kolluri,"The street was expecting a strong confirmation from Wal-Mart saying, 'Yes, we had a terrific Thanksgiving sales,'"
Ram Kolluri,The market is behaving as is we are going into a recession. Retail sales were off and so the market is worrying that the consumer is tapped out. IBM's earnings were off and so we're worried that the earnings will slow.
Ram Kolluri,"They're saying they don't know if this is the time to take a risk. They have close to a trillion dollars in post-tax cash, and it's not doing any good for anybody."
Ram Kolluri,"We're so stretched out, so oversold at this point, that we have no idea what a potential snap back could be. This is like a hot, dry forest and one good spark is all we need for it to really take off."
Ram Kolluri,The techs have been beaten up for the past few months because the so-called tech spending recovery has not met expectations.
Ram Kolluri,"The techs have been beaten up for the past few months because the so-called tech spending recovery has not met expectations,"
Ram Kolluri,We're back to the wonderful world of optimism. You have to be cautious what you do here. The question is: 'Are we getting ahead of ourselves?'. Will we see some volatility? You bet.
Ram Kolluri,The earnings growth is a positive. The problem is that the ten-year note yield is currently standing at 4.85 percent and is pushing toward 5 percent and our friends at the Fed are not telling us when rate hikes are done.
Ram Kolluri,"Some sectors like retail are bracing themselves for a slowdown in the economy in the second half. So you can see some of the weakness in retail stocks. But corporate earnings are looking good. They are afraid of the Fed and that is still in the minds of people. Once burned, twice shy."
Ram Kolluri,"You've got the warm and toasty economy, or the Goldilocks economy, still in place,"
Ram Kolluri,"The economy is growing reasonably well, but it is sending all kinds of mixed signals, ... The market doesn't like the two steps forward one step backward."
Ram Kolluri,"In the spring, the worry was that the economy was slowing down. Now it's summer and we can see the economy is on track and earnings are looking good."
Ram Kolluri,"You've got the warm and toasty economy, or the Goldilocks economy, still in place."
Ram Kolluri,"The stock market is on one side saying earnings and the economy are going to improve, while the bond market and the Fed and the recent economic data are on the other, saying:"
Ram Kolluri,"Oil prices are one foot forward, one foot back. We are dancing around $40 a barrel. At the moment the oil prices are forming an equilibrium around $40 a barrel."
Ram Kolluri,"If we see improvements in earnings outlooks, some kind of resolution in the Middle East, and improvements in consumer confidence we'd see a significant rally. But, I don't know when that's going to happen."
Ram Kolluri,"The only big curve ball I see through the end of the year will be the somewhat lackluster Christmas sales that retailers are looking for. Unfortunately, the impact of higher heating bills on sales is going to be felt."
Ram Kolluri,"With technology stocks the watch-word is caution. What's happening now is that their valuations are reaching their earnings. Until we have those earnings catch up, any disappointments are creating huge volatility in the sector."
Ram Kolluri,"If there's military action, it's going to have to be soon. The heat is oppressive come March, April, May in that part of the world. In the desert it can reach 120 degrees. So I have a feeling something will happen in February."
Kim Komando,"It is clear that the judge is concerned not to stop the technology completely but to try and work some middle line,"
Kim Komando,"It has opened our eyes and minds to possibilities. Now that we're not tied to offices and wires and poles, now what can we do?"
Kim Komando,"Obviously even before the events of September, the industry was in an interesting place and everyone was hurting a little bit in terms of attendance. But we felt we've tracked pretty well,"
Paul Konerko,[Dye] had a heck of an at-bat in front of me to get on base. I was just trying to let them come to me and not try to do too much. I just tried to stay up tall and let it come to me and swing hard in case I hit it.
Paul Konerko,"I was trying to just resist the urge to think that he was going to walk me and start over with the next guy because when you do that, you usually let a good one go,"
Paul Konerko,"I feel good. Hitting, you're trying to find it. Or if you have it, you're trying to keep it. You just want meaningful hits."
Paul Konerko,"You're trying not to get a read on whether he's coming after you or not coming after you,"
Paul Konerko,He might be one of the guys I can beat in a race.
Paul Konerko,It?s been a race for a few weeks in my opinion. But that doesn?t mean we have to lose just because we have lost so much ground or they have gained so much. I think it?s a combination of both.
Paul Konerko,He's a real knowledgeable guy. Both he and Walker have the same philosophy on hitting.
Paul Konerko,"They're off to a good start, and it's not just a good start. People see that they're a good team. They're built very well. You look position by position and their starting staff, the bullpen, they're going to be there all year. I really believe that."
Paul Konerko,"Like the Red Sox last year, I think blocking out what's happened to the organization in the past is key,"
Paul Konerko,"It's the second-best feeling I've had all week, ... The baby born Tuesday night ... that's first for the week."
Paul Konerko,"There was an instance where it showed the wrong call was made last night and there was another instance where it was shown to be the right call,"
Paul Konerko,I had a baby born Tuesday night. That's first for the week. That one (grand slam) is second.
Paul Konerko,"I got a couple of good mistakes to hit, and I didn't miss. That's what you have to do against a guy like that. He's got real good stuff."
Paul Konerko,There are a lot of emotional things involved there. Frank is his own man and can do what he wants.
Paul Konerko,"When we came in after it was tied, no one was down. I think the overall kind of theme in the dugout was, everybody loves Bobby, we're not going to let him go home feeling bad about this. We're going to pick him up and we're not going to let this happen. We're going to get this win."
Paul Konerko,Everybody has their ideas of what a leader is and everybody is entitled to their opinion. It's unfortunate because I liked Carl and had nothing but a good time with him. He was good for our team and he'll make Seattle a better team. I got nothing bad to say about the guy.
Paul Konerko,"You know it's going to hurt for a couple of days -- but you've gotta keep the game moving, I've had a million of these, but this one got worse. If this isn't a break (it wasn't), I don't ever want one."
Paul Konerko,"All you can hope is that when some crazy stuff happens your on the good side of it. Sometimes you're not, sometimes you are,"
Paul Konerko,"Home runs happen when you least expect it, and that was definitely the case there."
Paul Konerko,"He went all season, six months without hitting a home run. Now he's got two in the postseason, a huge one right there, ... That's as big a home run as you can ever hit."
Paul Konerko,"You always want to deliver meaningful home runs,"
Paul Konerko,It really didn't feel that great. Home runs happen when you least expect them.
Paul Konerko,"He went all season, six months without hitting a home run. Now he's got two in the postseason, a huge one right there. That's as big a home run as you can ever hit."
Paul Konerko,"We're going to try and track him down. At the end of the year, he might have more home runs than the rest of us put together, but we'll give it our best shot."
Paul Konerko,"I think we've done a good job of not worrying about the history of the organization or what different teams haven't done and why they haven't won, ... I think that's what the Red Sox did last year. They had to block all that out. It took a group of guys saying 'Why can't we win?' I think in so many words that's what our team has done. We sat around and looked at each other and said 'We can play.'"
Paul Konerko,It's like playing ourselves out there. These guys have a lot of heart. You don't go away.
Paul Konerko,"It's tough when your playing them (one-run games) that often,"
Paul Konerko,"Games against them, you're going to lose some games. You can't put too much stock into it if they blow you out because they have the team to do that."
Paul Konerko,It was one of those games where you almost feel you should have seen a no-hitter. He had that kind of stuff. He was coming right at them.
Paul Konerko,He said before the game that he was going to hit a homer tonight. But he says that before a lot of games.
Paul Konerko,He's a force. I got a front row seat on-deck.
Paul Konerko,It makes you want more. It's just one game. We have to keep our eyes on the prize.
Paul Konerko,"We just had, ... a second boost of energy."
Paul Konerko,kind of an out-of-body thing.
Paul Konerko,"It's feeling like the beginning of the year, where you have a different guy showing up and chipping in each day,"
Paul Konerko,It feels sore and a little weak. Nothing since I've ever played baseball have I taken one swing and halted activity after a swing. Ever. Unless a guy hit me with a pitch in the hand or the face or whatever.
Paul Konerko,"They are definitely playing the best of any team in baseball. And we wanted to take two out of three, so it's disappointing,"
Paul Konerko,Anyone who knows baseball knows the story.
Paul Konerko,I've never seen any team in baseball rooting like they did for him.
Paul Konerko,Anytime you put a baseball player in a suit and take him out of his element its uncomfortable.
Steve Koonin,We are delighted to bring the first season of this top-notch show to a close by giving viewers even more of what they have come to love about the show.
Steve Koonin,"Original programming is the riskiest thing you do in television, ... The failure rate is so high."
Steve Koonin,"When we did 'Bull,' we did not have a brand. Our belief was we had to build the foundation."

Jeff Koons,I try to be a truthful artist and I try to show a level of courage. I enjoy that. I'm a messenger.
Jeff Koons,"I love the gallery, the arena of representation. It's a commercial world, and morality is based generally around economics, and that's taking place in the art gallery."
Jeff Koons,"I'm always trying to create work that doesn't make viewers feel they're being spoken down to, so that they feel open participation."
Jeff Koons,I believe in advertisement and media completely. My art and my personal life are based in it. I think that the art world would probably be a tremendous reservoir for everybody involved in advertising.
Jeff Koons,"Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the word a better place."
Jeff Koons,"I believe that my art gets across the point that I'm in this morality theater trying to help the underdog, and I'm speaking socially here, showing concern and making psychological and philosophical statements for the underdog."
Jeff Koons,"I'm basically the idea person. I'm not physically involved in the production. I don't have the necessary abilities, so I go to the top people."
Jeff Koons,I think about my work every minute of the day.
Alan Kopit,"Regularly using liquid savings to cover normal expenses may indicate you are not planning properly. If you find yourself doing that, you should reassess your overall budget strategy."
Alan Kopit,"Three to six months' worth of savings for living expenses is the minimum every household should have, no matter its income. Any less can leave people vulnerable to serious financial woes if they hit unexpected difficulties, like a job loss or medical problem. It's a good habit for all working people to put away a reasonable portion of their take-home pay into some form of liquid savings."
Alan Kopit,"There's no question that there's been a trend towards do-it-yourself divorces, and do-it-yourself law in general, in the past decade. More people are turning to the Internet -- many sites have very complete forms."
Alan Kopit,"With recent reforms in U.S. bankruptcy law making it more difficult than ever to erase debt, it's important to protect yourself. If you face financial challenges, seek the advice of a lawyer or professional financial advisor to explore alternatives."
Jeffrey Koplan,"It's been the pattern throughout the world that men have started this and women have joined in later. It just means that having smoked like men, they will die like men."
Jeffrey Koplan,"We're trying to answer all those questions, ... We're collecting that information now and analyzing it."
Jeffrey Koplan,"The recommendations will help communities and health care systems choose interventions that work and are well matched to their needs and capabilities,"
Jeffrey Koplan,"We have demonstrated that prevention works and deserves support, ... Nevertheless, as in most areas of public health, support for prevention is frequently more rhetorical than substantive."
Jeffrey Koplan,"Our intention at this time, and that of the Department of Health and Human Services, is to have enough vaccine available so that anybody who needs it will get it, ... Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer."
Jeffrey Koplan,"It's a good example of a system working at all levels. In this case, the important thing was we were able to take the public health steps to protect the community first."
Jeffrey Koplan,The evidence is stacking up that indicates it is not environmental.
Jeffrey Koplan,"The evidence is stacking up that indicates it is not environmental,"
Jeffrey Koplan,"Overweight children are at risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other health problems, ... They're part of an epidemic of overweight and obesity that must be addressed so that they can lead healthier lives."
Jeffrey Koplan,Young people need to know that they can significantly reduce their risk of getting skin cancer later if they start protecting their skin from the sun now.
Jeffrey Koplan,"There is reason to feel optimistic about many of the trends in risk behavior among our young people. However, we have much left to do. Too many of our children are still engaging in activities that put them at risk for health problems now and into adulthood."
Jeffrey Koplan,"Today more than ever, smokers have a number of resources available to improve their ability to quit."
Sheldon Kopp,"The guru, if he is gifted, reads the story as any bilingual person might. He does not translate-he understands."

Sheldon Kopp,All of the significant battles are waged within the self.
Ken Korach,"I think he was the greatest sportscaster who ever lived. I try to put it into words, and I don't know how this even sounds, but I liked myself when I worked with Bill. He was one of the last of the colorful characters, a one-in-a-million kind of character. There's no chance there will ever be anybody like Bill."
Ken Korach,"There is nobody better at, or better-prepared for, what he does than Bill King. He's the gold standard."
Ken Korach,"I think he was just a member of the family for almost 50 years in the Bay Area. He was the greatest sportscaster I ever heard. He brought an immense amount of passion and dedication to every broadcast and touched so many people. They remember certain times in their lives because of him. For over 50 years, he was a constant in people's lives."
Michael Korda,"Very well observed and touching story, wonderful eye for detail and a pleasure to read,"
Michael Korda,"The freedom to fail is vital if you're going to succeed, most successful men fail time and time again, and it is a measure of their strength that failure merely propels them into some new attempt at success."
Michael Korda,Luck can often mean simply taking advantage of a situation at the right moment. It is possible to make your luck by being always prepared.
Michael Korda,"The more you can dream, the more you can do."
Michael Korda,The purely agitation attitude is not good enough for a detailed consideration of a subject.
Michael Korda,To succeed it is necessary to accept the world as it is and rise above it.
Michael Korda,"The fastest way to succeed is to look as if you're playing by other people's rules, while quietly playing by your own."
Michael Korda,"This is true enough, but success is the next best thing to happiness, and if you can't be happy as a success, it's very unlikely that you would find a deeper, truer happiness in failure."
Michael Korda,Men naturally resent it when women take greater liberties in dress than men are allowed.
Michael Korda,"Your chances of success are directly proportional to the degree of pleasure you desire from what you do. If you are in a job you hate, face the fact squarely and get out."
Michael Korda,An ounce of hypocracy is worth a pound of ambition.
Michael Korda,"Never walk away from failure. On the contrary, study it carefully and imaginatively for its hidden assets."
Michael Korda,Success has always been easy to measure. It is the distance between one's origins and one's final achievement.
Michael Korda,Never reveal all of yourself to other people; hold back something in reserve so that people are never quite sure if they really know you.
Michael Korda,"One of the first rules of playing the power game is that all bad news must be accepted calmly, as if one already knew and didn't care."
Michael Korda,An once of hypocrisy is worth a pound of ambition.
Michael Korda,"Success on any major scale requires you to accept responsibility... in the final analysis, the one quality that all successful people have... is the ability to take on responsibility."
Michael Korda,What you hear repeatedly you will eventually believe.
Michael Korda,"The biggest fool in the world is he who merely does his work supremely well, without attending to appearance."
Michael Korda,"Act well at the moment, and you have performed a good action for all eternity."
Michael Korda,One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals.
Michael Korda,"The fastest way to succeed is to look as if you're playing by somebody else's rules, while quietly playing by your own."
Fred Korematsu,"It may take time to prove you're right, but you have to stick to it."
Fred Korematsu,"If you have the feeling that something is wrong, don't be afraid to speak up."
Fred Korematsu,"I'm an American and just as long as I'm in this country that I will keep on going and if there is a chance of reopening the case, I will do it."
Fred Korematsu,"I was just living my life, and that's what I wanted to do."
Fred Korematsu,I thought what the military was doing was unconstitutional.
Fred Korematsu,All of them turned their backs on me at that time because they thought I was a troublemaker.
Kyle Korver,"It all starts with Shaq. We're all so conscious of him, where he is at and trying to double-team him. We're trying to help, we are trying to front him, trying to do everything. It all just rolls off him."
Kyle Korver,I wasn't about taking responsibility because things just came to me. I got a lot of free throws.
Kyle Korver,"We wanted to make a little statement, but it didn't happen. It was all about pride. We didn't want to get blown out on our home court, or on TV. We fought back, but we're not taking any moral victory out of losing to Miami by seven. We wanted to win this game."
Kyle Korver,"People are trying to divide us, saying that we don't want to play with Allen. That's not the case. Allen provides so much for this team. There's this perception that we don't like playing with him ... We love playing with Allen and Chris [Webber]."
Kyle Korver,(Webber) played huge. He stepped up. That's what leaders do.
Kyle Korver,"We kind of went through that stretch where we lost some leads. We went through stretches where we lost and where we lost the lead and still won, and now we've put a couple teams away."
Kyle Korver,"This team has heart. I think a lot of people have kind of been questioning us, but I don't know how you really can. We're not always doing it right, but we're trying hard."
Kyle Korver,We've just been a little more focused. We're not giving up easy baskets like we were. A lot of it was just we weren't paying attention to details. We just have a new fire. We just accepted playing a different style of basketball a little bit.
Kyle Korver,"I went to games as a spectator and I saw the fun that it was. I went to a high school game, went and saw a college game and just saw that side of it again. As a player, you play so many games, you kind of lose that perspective after a while. I think once I saw that side again, it was like this is a fun game, it?s the game of basketball, I get paid to do this, let?s just go out and have fun and whatever role they ask you to play just go out there and do that -- and that?s what I?m trying to do."
Kyle Korver,"It was just to have some team fun. We don't have fun around here right now. It seems like every time we go to practice, it's so uptight and everyone's worried about stuff or whatever. We just needed to have some fun."
Kyle Korver,I really needed to get away. I'm back now. I'm not trying to force it. I'm not trying to prove I belong in a certain spot.
Kyle Korver,"Whatever we need to do to get this team winning. I'm not here with any big ego if [Cheeks] thinks it helps for me to come off the bench, then we'll try that."
Kyle Korver,"It is a step in the right direction. A few days ago, I don't think anyone was talking playoffs with us. We were falling off and now, it's a little bit better."
Kyle Korver,"I don't think there's anybody not wanting to [play defense], but maybe, subconsciously , we haven't been completely focused. Tonight we kind of got caught up with the officials a little bit; we weren't completely focused in the second half."
Kyle Korver,"He's by far the most laid-back coach I've ever had,"
Kyle Korver,"That was a crazy, ugly, exciting basketball game. It seemed like it was up and down, with turnovers, long rebounds we weren't getting. I don't really know how we won, to be honest. I thought we were kind of sloppy, but we found a way to win."
Kyle Korver,"It's just playing together. When we do that, we are a good basketball team. When we don't, we are not a good basketball team. It's as simple as that. That's all there is to say."

Larry Kostelac,"An interesting game, no doubt about it. Reading Holy Name is a tough team to play against because of the way that they play. They did nice job and their big kids are bigger that we were. I'm very happy to get out of here with a win and we are now guaranteed another three games and most teams are not in that situation."
Larry Kostelac,"After a rough start, We changed some things up and did a better job of getting more body on them and that was a key to our defense."

Janica Kostelic,She deserves the gold medal. She's won everything now.
Janica Kostelic,The course was maybe set a bit too complicated. When I heard so many girls went out I decided to ski too careful. You all know I am not the bravest girl in the world. But it was the wrong approach. The only really troublesome gate was one on the last pitch near the finish.

Anna Kournikova,"Well, I'm playing for the fans so whenever they come and ask for autographs I always try to give it to everybody because I'm out there for the people."
Anna Kournikova,It's true I always try to be as seductive as possible but I wouldn't be here if I couldn't play tennis.
Anna Kournikova,I don't know what better teenage life you could get than going around the world doing what you love to do.
Anna Kournikova,"A court is like a scene, people want to see attractive people."
Anna Kournikova,"I think that tennis is a lady's sport, so we should look out there like ladies."
Anna Kournikova,I'm like an expensive menu... you can look but you can't afford!
Anna Kournikova,"Like any young person, I do what I want."
Anna Kournikova,"God gives all to those, who get up early."
Anna Kournikova,"When I was 12, every little girl in Russia was trying to wear her hair like mine and playing tennis."
Anna Kournikova,It's that I have a good personality and am a good tennis player.
Anna Kournikova,"I enjoy every win that I have. Every win gives me satisfaction, because all the girls are competitive and the tour is so even and tough."
Anna Kournikova,"There are a lot of pretty girls. I am a tennis player first of all, that is why I am here, and if wasn't producing results no one would notice me."
Anna Kournikova,My manager wants me to dress like a nun and I want to dress like a teenager.
Anna Kournikova,Boyfriends have to understand me and my needs. They have to know what I want out of my life and about my strict regime. I go to bed at 10pm and not later. I separate my professional and private lives.
Anna Kournikova,"I am beautiful, famous and gorgeous."
Anna Kournikova,"I've just done a commercial in the U.S. in which I talk about stocks, shares and bonds. Everyone is amazed. They ask me: 'You really know about that stuff or did you just learn it for the commercial?' I tell them I wouldn't do it unless I understood and had an interest."
Anna Kournikova,"I have a lot of boyfriends, I want you to write that. Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend. And I kiss them all."
Anna Kournikova,"At this year's Open, I'll have five boyfriends."
Alex Kovalev,I'm trying to land the puck on top of the net. I once did it three times in a row in Pittsburgh.
Alex Kovalev,That was an accident. I didn't know where to go so I closed my eyes and made a move.
Alex Kovalev,"We just ran out of energy. When you take so many penalties, it's going to cost you eventually."
Alex Kovalev,"I wasn't expecting a Christmas card, but maybe a phone call."
Alex Kovalev,The first game means nothing. The second game is the test of character.
Alexei Kovalev,They used their power to try to get it to the crease and jam it. We tried to use the pass and our speed.
Alexei Kovalev,"This tournament is all about mistakes. If you see every game, a team makes a mistake and the other team scores. All the turnovers because the ice surface is so wide â€“ you have so much space to make a play."
Alexei Kovalev,"This tournament is all about mistakes. If you see every game, a team makes a mistake and the other team scores. All the turnovers because the ice surface is so wide you have so much space to make a play."
Alexei Kovalev,Skill and power don't mean anything. You need heart and you need everyone on the team believing that they can win.
Alexei Kovalev,"We're fighting for the eighth spot in the playoffs, we knew how important this game was."
Alexei Kovalev,Keeping the same emotion and energy we had against Toronto definitely was hard to do. But it's something we had to try to do because we still need to play better and better each night to make the playoffs.
Bruce Kovner,"If you personalize losses, you can't trade."
Bruce Kovner,At a certain point I realized that it would be better to make this collection available to the rest of the world rather than to keep it under a mattress.
Bruce Kovner,I started collecting just for the personal pleasure of being close to these icons of the greatest musical achievements in Western music.
Bruce Kovner,It has been great fun to find these manuscripts and pull them together into this collection. I trust that what we are doing at the school will make it possible for Juilliard students and scholars to delve into the compositional processes of these great composers and share them with the rest of the world.
Jo Koy,"That's one thing I pride myself on, that I'm Asian. All I really know is my Asian heritage."
Jo Koy,"That's my man right there. He really took my comedy to the next level. I think it was a sense of urgency ... now I gotta feed this kid, I gotta buy him clothes!"
Jo Koy,"This is my 11th year (doing comedy). That's the whole thing -- if you wait 10 years, pay your dues and do your time, it'll come."
Jonathan Kozol,"When I was teaching in the 1960s in Boston, there was a great deal of hope in the air. Martin Luther King Jr. was alive, Malcolm X was alive; great, great leaders were emerging from the southern freedom movement."
Jonathan Kozol,"What I tell these young people is, the world is not as dangerous as the older generation would like you to believe. Anyone I know who has ever taken a risk and lost a job has ended up getting a better one two years later."
Jonathan Kozol,"The primary victims of Katrina, those who were given the least help by the government, those rescued last or not at all, were overwhelmingly people of color largely hidden from the mainstream of society."
Jonathan Kozol,"The ones I pity are the ones who never stick out their neck for something they believe, never know the taste of moral struggle, and never have the thrill of victory."
Jonathan Kozol,"Nationally, overwhelmingly non-white schools receive $1,000 less per pupil than overwhelmingly white schools."
Jonathan Kozol,"Many of those who argue for vouchers say that they simply want to use competition to improve public education. I don't think it works that way, and I've been watching this for a longtime."
Jonathan Kozol,"Instead of seeing these children for the blessings that they are, we are measuring them only by the standard of whether they will be future deficits or assets for our nation's competitive needs."
Jonathan Kozol,"In the book, I write about children in first grade who were taught to read by reading want ads. They learned to write by writing job applications. Imagine what would happen if anyone tried to do that to children in a predominantly white suburban school."
Jonathan Kozol,"If you grow up in the South Bronx today or in south-central Los Angeles or Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, you quickly come to understand that you have been set apart and that there's no will in this society to bring you back into the mainstream."
Jonathan Kozol,"If we allow public funds to be used to support our relatively benign, morally grounded schools, we will have to allow those public funds to be used for any type of private school."
Jonathan Kozol,I think a lot of people don't have any idea of how deeply segregated our schools have become all over again. Most textbooks are not honest in what they teach our high school students.
Jonathan Kozol,I am opposed to the use of public funds for private education.
Jonathan Kozol,During the decades after Brown v. Board of Education there was terrific progress. Tens of thousands of public schools were integrated racially. During that time the gap between black and white achievement narrowed.
Jonathan Kozol,"But for the children of the poorest people we're stripping the curriculum, removing the arts and music, and drilling the children into useful labor. We're not valuing a child for the time in which she actually is a child."
Jonathan Kozol,"An awful lot of people come to college with this strange idea that there's no longer segregation in America's schools, that our schools are basically equal; neither of these things is true."
Jonathan Kozol,You need massive recruitment to tell the poorest of the poor what is possible.
Jonathan Kozol,"Apartheid does not happen spontaneously, like bad weather conditions."
Jonathan Kozol,"Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win."
Robert Kraft,I left a message with Adam just to thank him for all of his contributions during the past 10 years. I was proud of the way he represented the franchise ... He is a true champion. Adam will always be remembered for his many game-winning kicks and overall accomplishments as a Patriot.
Robert Kraft,"I think when you spend up to $10 million, that's real money,"
Robert Kraft,Are you going to the game?
Robert Kraft,"That makes it inclusive. With the issues we're facing in the future, it's very important that everyone feels they have input into the selection of the commissioner."
Robert Kraft,"I know what I dont know, ... I hire competent people and let them make decisions. In Bills case, he was someone who Id gotten to know as one of the smartest people Id ever met."
Richard Krajicek,I felt like I was going to throw up. I couldn't even see the ball because my eyes were burning.
Richard Krajicek,I may have exaggerated a bit when I said that 80 per cent of the top 100 women are fat pigs. What I meant to say was 75 per cent of the top 100 women are fat pigs.
Richard Krajicek,"You know, you're smelling the hot dogs and people were shouting during the points to each other or something,"
Diana Krall,"So much of what we do as artists is a combination of personal experience and imagination, and how that all creeps into your work is not so linear."
Diana Krall,I think that I was being much more uptight about those things before. I feel like I really don't have to prove anything at this point other than what I'm doing.
Diana Krall,"But the greatest thing about music is putting it out there for people to figure out. You want the listener to find the song on their own. If you give too much away, it takes away from the imagination."
Diana Krall,"You're creating an intimacy that everybody feels, that it's their experience, not yours. I'll never introduce a song and say, now this song is about 'my' broken heart."
Diana Krall,"The album is a definite departure. I haven't written original material before, except for one song on my first album, but Elvis and I did six songs together on this one."
Diana Krall,Sometimes I can't get out of the character because the story is very intense.
Diana Krall,"It was probably when I met Jeff Hamilton, the drummer I've been working with for the last 20 years. He's the one who brought Ray Brown to hear me sing at a restaurant in my hometown."
Diana Krall,"I mean, I don't think I would call Claus to do an album of big band tunes. You know, just like arrangers write for the artist they have in mind; you have to keep in mind if you're going to work with Claus Ogerman. You invite him to do what he does."
Diana Krall,I love music so much I love what I do. I work very hard at being the best musician I can be because I love it.
Diana Krall,I'm not really on a mission to tell anybody anything. I'd rather be figured out.
Diana Krall,"You know, I've sung a lot of emotional songs in my life, but when you're writing it yourself, it's very difficult to decide what to reveal."
Diana Krall,When you drive by Radio City and you see your name up there and it's only 'your' name. I just went 'ooh'. I thought this is really like looking at another person.
Diana Krall,"Well, you know, it's been interesting because an album is just a snapshot of where you are at that time. Not all pictures of everybody are just in jeans and a 'T' shirt, or a ball gown. You have many different sides and this is a snapshot of where you are at that time."
Diana Krall,"There were some things that I found I really enjoyed singing about; like, on the title track, there's this film-noir character of a woman who's sort of losing it in a room."
Diana Krall,"That's why these songs have lasted as long as they have because they're just about feelings that don't change. They are love songs, they are not specific, those kinds of feelings don't change."
Diana Krall,"I like to interpret 'Call me a River', as if I'm saying, 'Now you're telling me you love me after all that, and I'm telling you to shove off.' That's my interpretation. But I would never 'say' that because somebody else might interpret the song in another way."
Eddie Kramer,"This was an experiment - expanding the band and trying to make the music communicate in a different sort of way. Maybe that part of it didn't happen. But his performance is so stunning when you watch what he is actually doing. When we cut the film together in the present form, in the correct order, better angles, and you really focus on Jimi, ... you see what he is doing. He's conducting the orchestra. He's playing lead and rhythm at the same time. He's smoking a cigarette. He's doing five things at once. It's incredible."
Eddie Kramer,"The take (of 'Hey Joe') that we're listening to on the box set has an earlier version of the backup singers singing a little out of key and not quite what they wanted,"
Eddie Kramer,"There was a guy onstage filming the whole bloody thing. Who's this guy? Where did he come from? We tracked him down. He was a student. His parents had given him some money to buy an open reel video recorder, ... It shows some wonderful moments that were not captured by the other cameras."
John Kramer,Hopefully the lawsuit gets cleared up and we can progress.
John Kramer,"If they (the pledgers) all live up to their promises, we'll have more than enough money to cover the remaining bills. But the event happened in July and here it is September. This is not good."
John Kramer,"But we'd hope to get going earlier; we needed this six months in advance. If that had happened, the pledges would be in hand and we would not be embarrassing ourselves to the Heritage Inn and others."
John Kramer,"We agreed to be a pass-through organization, which we've done before for other events."
John Kramer,"I think you'll see a lot of action in some of those states by this fall or next winter, ... But, in a couple of those states, this fall's governors races are going to be important on the issue."
Kris Krane,"They should be allowed to stay in school so they can become productive, tax-paying members of society. If they drop out, it's more likely they'll live in the streets and become drug addicts."
Kris Krane,It's become increasingly apparent that the law has become unpopular.
Kris Krane,"Students are already suffering the consequences through probation, fines, criminal record and punishment through their own schools."
Lee Krasner,"With Jackson there was quiet solitude. Just to sit and look at the landscape. An inner quietness. After dinner, to sit on the back porch and look at the light. No need for talking. For any kind of communication."
Lee Krasner,"Well, let's say we acknowledged the School of French Painting - the Paris School of painting as the leading force and vitality of the time. I think that was understood and felt and experienced."
Lee Krasner,"Well, I'd say that the beginning of this thing came through with Art of This Century, Peggy Guggenheim's, where she opened this gallery and began showing some things that caused a little talk, amongst a lot of other things."
Lee Krasner,"The procedure was that an artist got a mural and then he would have anywhere from two to ten assistants depending on the size of the mural and how many assistants he needed, or she needed."
Lee Krasner,The Jumble Shop would be one place where we'd sometimes accumulate down in the Village. I think it might be just a place that's unknown that was right around the corner from wherever it was that we met.
Lee Krasner,"Painting... in which the inner and the outer man are inseparable, transcends technique, transcends subject and moves into the realm of the inevitable."
Lee Krasner,My studio was on 9th Street between University and Broadway.
Lee Krasner,"My own image of my work is that I no sooner settle into something than a break occurs. These breaks are always painful and depressing but despite them I see that there's a consistency that holds out, but is hard to define."
Lee Krasner,In the late 30s the name Pollock was totally unknown and unheard of.
Lee Krasner,I have never been able to understand the artist whose image never changes.
Lee Krasner,"As I say, I as an abstract artist was active politically."
Lee Krasner,"You were told how much space so it was a matter of whether you could send in two paintings or three paintings, you know, pending where the show was being held. You did submit work to be accepted. Once you were accepted that was it. You did your own selection of what went in."
Lee Krasner,"At that point it certainly would be called abstract. That is to say, you had a model and there'd be one or two or three people there drawing the model but otherwise you had abstractions all around the room, even though the model was in front of you."
Lee Krasner,"I knew de Kooning and I went to his studio so I knew about de Kooning's work. But only a little handful knew about it, you know. Maybe there were ten people that knew about it."
Karl Kraus,"This is something that I cannot get over -- that a whole line could be written by half a man, that a work could be built on the quicksand of a character."
Karl Kraus,A woman occasionally is quite a serviceable substitute for masturbation.
Karl Kraus,An aphorism can never be the whole truth; it is either a half-truth or a truth-and-a-half.
Karl Kraus,An aphorism never coincides with the truth: it is either a half-truth or one-and-a-half truths.
Karl Kraus,Stupidity gets up early; that is why events are accustomed to happening in the morning.
Karl Kraus,He who sleeps half a day has won half a life.
Karl Kraus,"Progress, under whose feet the grass mourns and the forest turns into paper from which newspaper plants grow, has subordinated the purpose of life to the means of subsistence and turned us into the nuts and bolts for our tools."
Karl Kraus,"Progress celebrates victories over nature. Progress makes purses out of human skin. When people were traveling in mail coaches, the world got ahead better than it does now that salesmen fly through the air. What good is speed if the brain has oozed out on the way? How will the heirs of this age be taught the most basic motions that are necessary to activate the most complicated machines? Nature can rely on progress; it will avenge it for the outrage it has perpetrated on it."
Karl Kraus,The immorality of men triumphs over the amorality of women.
Karl Kraus,"Language is the mother of thought, not its handmaiden"
Karl Kraus,Newspapers have roughly the same relationship to life as fortune-tellers to metaphysics
Karl Kraus,Adults who still derive childlike pleasure from hanging gifts of a ready-made education on the Christmas tree of a child waiting outside the door to life do not realize how unreceptive they are making the children to everything that constitutes the true surprise of life.
Karl Kraus,The psychoanalysts pick our dreams as if they were our pockets.
Karl Kraus,"The discovery of the North Pole is one of those realities which could not be avoided. It is the wages which human perseverance pays itself when it thinks that something is taking too long. The world needed a discoverer of the North Pole, and in all areas of social activity, merit was less important here than opportunity."
Karl Kraus,The devil is an optimist if he thinks he can make people meaner
Karl Kraus,Curses on the law! Most of my fellow citizens are the sorry consequences of uncommitted abortions
Karl Kraus,My unconscious knows more about the consciousness of the psychologist than his consciousness knows about my unconscious
Karl Kraus,"The press, that goiter of the world, swells up with the desire for conquest and bursts with the achievements which every day brings. A week has room for the boldest climax of the human drive for expansion."
Karl Kraus,"Corruption is worse than prostitution. The latter might endanger the morals of an individual, the former invariably endangers the morals of the entire country."
Karl Kraus,Democracy divides people into workers and loafers. It makes no provision for those who have no time to work.
Karl Kraus,No ideas and the ability to express them - that's a journalist
Karl Kraus,It is the style of idealism to console itself for the loss of something old with the ability to gape at something new.
Karl Kraus,Experiences are savings which a miser puts aside. Wisdom is an inheritance which a wastrel cannot exhaust.
Brian Krause,"Dude, that horn has been with him since high school,"
Brian Krause,"Dude, that horn has been with him since high school. It made him famous in Coppell and, of course, apparently made him famous (at A&M). His enthusiasm about everything is the high point of his personality."
Brian Krause,This fool never runs out of energy.
Tom Krause,Life isn't about living without problems.Life is about solving problems.
Tom Krause,Getting what you want is not nearly as important as giving what you have.
Tom Krause,Your purpose in life is to use your gifts and talents to help other people. Your journey in life teaches you how to do that.
Tom Krause,If you don't want it bad enough to risk losing it- you don't want it bad enough.
Tom Krause,There are no failures; just experiences and your reaction to them.
Tom Krause,When life knocks you down you have two choices- stay down or get up.
Tom Krause,If you only do what you know you can do- you never do very much.
Henry Kravis,"The Asian markets will have a pivotal global influence in the coming decades and will offer significant investment opportunities for both KKR and our existing portfolio companies, ... As the role of private equity in Asia grows and is further defined, KKR will carefully assess the landscape and determine the most appropriate ways to be a leading participant in that process."
Henry Kravis,"It's a lucky find, ... When I first saw the painting I was overwhelmed by its beauty and its condition."
Henry Kravis,"You only have one thing to sell in life, and that's yourself."
Henry Kravis,"The trouble, in my opinion, with corporate America today, is that everything is thought of in quarters."
Henry Kravis,"So I picked a field where I had a little exposure. Where I thought I could have an enormous challenge, and have a chance to really do some good, to be a pioneer in an area, and not just be like everyone else."
Henry Kravis,"Since we formed the firm in 1976, we've bought some 38 different companies, and we spent about $65 billion, buying these different companies."
Henry Kravis,"Our job really begins the day we buy the company, and we start working with the management, we start working with where this company is headed."
Henry Kravis,"One, I love the creativity. I love the ability to create a capital structure that is appropriate for a company, no matter what field it happens to be in."
Henry Kravis,"My next summer I worked in the research department of Goldman Sachs, and my last summer I was in institutional sales and corporate finance."
Henry Kravis,My father wanted me to go into the oil business. He was in the oil and gas business as a consulting petroleum engineer up in Tulsa.
Henry Kravis,"Maybe its because my father was so successful in a totally different field, but I found working in a small environment just a great joy."
Henry Kravis,"Look, don't congratulate us when we buy a company, congratulate us when we sell it. Because any fool can overpay and buy a company, as long as money will last to buy it."
Henry Kravis,"It's one of the most important things at the end of the day, being able to say no to an investment."
Henry Kravis,"It's not just buying the company. Sure, we picked the right companies, and we picked the right management and, most importantly, we've given them the right incentive to perform."
Henry Kravis,"In hindsight, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's been just a phenomenal career for me so far, and I don't see any reason why I should change."
Henry Kravis,"If you have something at risk, you think differently."
Henry Kravis,"If you don't have integrity, you have nothing. You can't buy it. You can have all the money in the world, but if you are not a moral and ethical person, you really have nothing."
Henry Kravis,"If you build that foundation, both the moral and the ethical foundation, as well as the business foundation, and the experience foundation, then the building won't crumble."
Henry Kravis,"If we can just take a few companies, and use those as models, as examples, to show the rest of corporate America how they can become more competitive, that's what I'd like to do and that's what I hope to do."
Henry Kravis,"I was an economics major in college, and every summer after school, I would drive my car from California, from Claremont men's college at the time, to New York. And I worked on Wall Street."
Henry Kravis,"I want people who will stand up to me. People who are not afraid to say exactly what's on their minds, even though that's probably not what I want to hear. That's what I want."
Henry Kravis,"I thought at the time that I wanted to go into institutional sales, selling stocks and bonds to institutions. In those days, which was the 1960s, the institutional salesman was making about $100,000 a year. I thought that was just an enormous amount of money."
Henry Kravis,"I love the ability to work with very good managers, and to provide the right incentives for them, and truly become a partner with that management, and make that management take a long view."
Henry Kravis,"I have, in my partner George Roberts, a person who is the most wonderful man in the world to me. He's like a brother to me. Creating with him, being side by side with him, in whatever we try to do, is a real pleasure to me."
Henry Kravis,"I always like to refer managers in corporate America as the renters of the corporate assets, not the owners."
Henry Kravis,"But once you buy a company, you are married. You are married to that company."
Henry Kravis,As I said there is nothing wrong with failing. Pick yourself up and try it again. You never are going to know how good you really are until you go out and face failure.
Henry Kravis,And make sure that capital structure we have in place is the right capital structure. I think that's the reason that we've been successful.
Henry Kravis,"I've been in a hurry all my life. I've been in a hurry to succeed, and in a hurry to prove myself."
Lenny Kravitz,You're never promised your next breath.
Lenny Kravitz,You can be around 100 people and be completely alone. People don't realize what it's really like.
Lenny Kravitz,"When I was a kid and I bought a record, I ripped that thing open, I wanted to know who was playing what, what studio it was cut at, who was the string arranger, who was the engineer."
Lenny Kravitz,"We're getting so pulled in by computers and technology, and our kids have their face in the computers all day. The human relationship is being diminished by this."
Lenny Kravitz,"We weren't put here to be miserable. We were put here to do the best we can, and we should take our energy and improve our state of being."
Lenny Kravitz,"Today, people are more into the glitz and the glamour of everything. We don't even read the inside of records anymore."
Lenny Kravitz,They think I'm being serious when actually I'm a very big clown. But you have to know me to see that. I'm constantly cracking up and cracking everybody else around me up.
Lenny Kravitz,"There's definitely an old school element to my music, but I also think it's modern."
Lenny Kravitz,There are so many people that don't believe in themselves and don't have faith.
Lenny Kravitz,"The story that I wanna tell is pretty much about the way I grew up. Being bi-racial, growing up in a big city and being an artist."
Lenny Kravitz,"The loyalty rate isn't that high. I could have a big hit, then put out the next single, and they say, Oh yeah, who are you? Prove it again."
Lenny Kravitz,"The image that the public gets is whatever they perceive it to be. Everybody has an opinion, everybody has their own vision, so I don't know what my public image is. I have no idea."
Lenny Kravitz,The image is an image.
Lenny Kravitz,That's a big gift when people say to you that a song helped them or brought them to some place in their life where they needed to be.
Lenny Kravitz,"People see my photos and think I labor over my image and I'm this cool, brooding artist. But I'm just having fun with it."
Lenny Kravitz,Oasis are not just influenced by the Beatles; they actually take stuff. Then they get praised.
Lenny Kravitz,"My mother gave lots of good advice and had a lot to say. As you get older, you realize everything she said was true."
Lenny Kravitz,My career has been a gradual climb. I think that's part of the reason why I've had longevity.
Lenny Kravitz,"Music is my life, it is a reflection of what I go through."
Lenny Kravitz,It's very important to vote. People died for this right.
Lenny Kravitz,It's like a dream to come to Spain and stay for a couple of years and get somebody to teach me Spanish music.
Lenny Kravitz,It's a trip to have a Greatest Hits record. It's a trip.
Lenny Kravitz,"It was amazing to me that, all of a sudden, I was hearing my music on the radio and coming out of cars."
Lenny Kravitz,"If you listen to a lot of old funk records, the drums are really small. But you don't perceive it like that because the groove is so heavy."
Lenny Kravitz,"If you ask a hundred people, they all give you different answers."
Lenny Kravitz,"If I were white, I'd get less criticism."
Lenny Kravitz,"If I had to associate myself with one song, it would probably be Let Love Rule. It's so simple and to the point. It speaks for itself."
Lenny Kravitz,I've woken up from dreams and the whole song is there. I'm listening to it in my dreams. I consciously have to wake myself up and get a tape recorder because I hear it like a record.
Lenny Kravitz,"I've had to work very hard, and I don't really have a category or fit into any niche, so each time I come out with a new record, it's like, I'm a new guy."
Lenny Kravitz,"I've been compared to hundreds of artists, which just goes to show you that I'm not any one thing at all."
Lenny Kravitz,"I've always been into films. I've been offered lots of films but they've always been these very stereotypical roles. They wanted me to play some gangster or street guy, or pimp, drug addict."
Lenny Kravitz,I'm more hungry now than I was 11 years ago. Which is great because I see a lot of artists that have been out for a long period of time. They get kind of fat.
Lenny Kravitz,I'm in this for the long haul. I've been making music my whole life.
Lenny Kravitz,"I'm half Jewish, I'm half black, I look in-between. I dress funny. I play all these different styles of music on one record. It's like, What is he doing?"
Lenny Kravitz,"I'm always sort of reflecting on what I do on what I've done. Usually before I make a new album, I'll listen to the previous albums just to see where I've been."
Lenny Kravitz,I wouldn't play together with someone who likes to control everything like me.
Lenny Kravitz,"I wasn't the kind of person that liked waiting for autographs or following them, I just liked to go to the shows, study their records, driving many, many hours to different states to go to concerts."
Lenny Kravitz,"I was taught by my grandfather that anything that your mind can conceive, you can have. It's a reality."
Lenny Kravitz,I think it'd be a real nightmare to put a record out and sell 20 million copies and then that's it.
Lenny Kravitz,"I never sit down to write. When I'm moved, I do it. I just wait for it to come. You just hear it. I can't really describe writing. It's in my head."
Lenny Kravitz,"I mean, there are only so many notes. What makes something original is how you put it together."
Lenny Kravitz,I made the record that my life had me make. Each one is like a diary.
Lenny Kravitz,I knew what I wanted to do from the time I was 5.
Lenny Kravitz,"I knew Slash in high school, but not very well. Just knew him as this kid that used to hang out in the hallway. Pretty much looked then the way he does now."
Lenny Kravitz,I just need to know that I did the very best I could and that I was true to myself.
Lenny Kravitz,I have a great time with my band and on the stage we get along well.
Lenny Kravitz,I feel like I'm only in the beginning of my career. I've only made five albums. It's not a lot.
Lenny Kravitz,I don't think about the styles. I write whatever comes out and I use whatever kind of instrumentation works for those songs.
Lenny Kravitz,I don't play the tuba.
Lenny Kravitz,"I couldn't tell you what I am going to do next 'cause I have no idea, but I am open to anything."
Lenny Kravitz,I am trying to get closer to God.
Lenny Kravitz,"I am still into the people I listened to growing up, so I completely remember what is like to be a fan, I haven't changed."
Lenny Kravitz,"I am not trying to change the world. I am just offering my gift that God gave me, and if somebody is moved by it, that's beautiful."
Lenny Kravitz,"God is always in my life, and that's the most important thing to me."
Lenny Kravitz,God gave me the gift to be able to play instruments and I have to play.
Lenny Kravitz,God forbid you sing about love. It's a lost concept.
Lenny Kravitz,"For the last few years, it's been so chic for everybody to be miserable. Like if you're in with the cool crowd, you can't be happy."
Lenny Kravitz,"Every night is different, you never know what it's going to be like. I remember every night. I don't like to compare them."
Lenny Kravitz,Confusion makes people uncomfortable. They can't put their finger on me.
Lenny Kravitz,Change is growth. For me it has been a very spiritual and musical rebirth.
Lenny Kravitz,A lot of people pretty much only listen to the chorus.
Lenny Kravitz,"A lot of people don't listen to the lyrics, really."
Lenny Kravitz,My dream is to become a farmer. Just a Bohemian guy pulling up his own sweet potatoes for dinner.
Lenny Kravitz,People feel they have to live that stereotypical lifestyle in order to be a rock star. You don't have to shoot heroin and act a certain way to be a rock and roll musician.
Lenny Kravitz,"My first guitar, a Fender Jazz Master, I traded it in for a Les Paul Deluxe."
Lenny Kravitz,I identify with women more than men. I guess I have a strong feminine side.
Lenny Kravitz,"A dramatic thing, the first time you stand up to your dad."
Lars Kreckel,European markets still have a safety buffer from relative valuations that will protect equities from any downward pressure from rising interest rates.
Lars Kreckel,"The case for German equities does not rest on the outcome of the election. For more than a year now, change in Germany has been driven by the corporate sector, while government reform momentum has slowed down."
Lars Kreckel,The market is beginning to price the end of the (Fed) rate hiking cycle in.
Andrew Krepinevich,"If they're not ready to provide security, there could be a regression."
Andrew Krepinevich,The near-real-time history being written hasn't been particularly kind to Rumsfeld.
Andrew Krepinevich,A lot of these tough choices are kind of kicked down the road.
Carson Kressley,"Show's going well. New season starting, we're on the road."
Carson Kressley,I was into Barbie and designer jeans.
Carson Kressley,"I am not much about rules, I like to break 'em and don't like to make 'em."
Carson Kressley,We did a whole fraternity house. We made them over.
Carson Kressley,"One of my co-workers at Ralph Lauren heard about the show, and when she got back to the office, said; Carson, you have to call Bravo. They're doing a show. You're perfect for it."
Carson Kressley,"On our show, I've only reached out and touched about 55 guys. I think there's still about 40 million."
Peter Kretzmer,"The overall weaker GDP number coming from the trade data does give you a more bullish feeling on Treasuries,"
Peter Kretzmer,The huge U.S. trade deficit may finally be stabilizing.
Peter Kretzmer,"That's consistent with the idea that labor market conditions are not really improving yet. They're not getting worse, either, but they've only stabilized."
Peter Kretzmer,"If crude oil prices keep on rising, the chances that consumption is going to be hurt further down the line rises. That means the Fed could be more gradual in raising rates."
Peter Kretzmer,"Rising home prices, higher mortgage rates and declining affordability are starting to affect housing demand. Evidence continues to mount that the housing market is cooling off."
Peter Kretzmer,"[When Greenspan feels the market has misinterpreted his remarks,] he has a history of trying to spin things a little different way, ... But he probably feels pretty happy with the market reaction [this time]."
Peter Kretzmer,"This factor alone would tend to push consumer spending below trend (near 2% growth) in the year's final quarter. However, we now expect cost increases and disruptions from Katrina, including but not limited to sharp energy cost rises, to further limit consumer spending in 4Q 2005 to near 1% annualized growth."
Peter Kretzmer,"This factor alone would tend to push consumer spending below trend (near 2% growth) in the year's final quarter, ... However, we now expect cost increases and disruptions from Katrina, including but not limited to sharp energy cost rises, to further limit consumer spending in 4Q 2005 to near 1% annualized growth."
Peter Kretzmer,The price of gold is not particularly well explained by monetary policy.
Peter Kretzmer,"The economy looks strong, as does the industrial base."
Joe Krier,"If you had said to me, 'You get 4,100 jobs', I would have said, 'Boy, that's fabulous'. But if you said to me, 'And you get to pick what kinds of jobs they are', we couldn't have picked better stuff in terms of the industries we're trying to grow."
Joe Krier,Thank goodness. We're long overdue for this.
Joe Krier,All of the candidates we interviewed had tremendous credentials. I don't think she (Sculley) can make a bad choice.
Kris Kristofferson,"I'm sure it gave him satisfaction to be out there knocking out a room full of kids,"
Kris Kristofferson,"I'm not worried about Dakota at all, ... She has a real family, a real loving family. That probably has a lot to do with who she is now. That's probably why she's so grounded."
Kris Kristofferson,It's hard to believe that it's been a year. It's still painful that he's gone. I think about him a lot.
Kris Kristofferson,Tell the truth. Sing with passion. Work with laughter. Love with heart. 'Cause that's all that matters in the end.
Kris Kristofferson,"You don't paddle against the current, you paddle with it. And if you get good at it, you throw away the oars."
Kris Kristofferson,"If God made anything better than women, I think he kept it for himself."
Kris Kristofferson,Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.
Kris Kristofferson,"If you can't get out of something, get into it."
Kris Kristofferson,Johnny Cash has always been larger than life.
Kris Kristofferson,Nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free.
William Kristol,"His numbers have dropped and he is probably not the best messenger to independents and swing voters, but in terms of managing an argument, he is good at it and his style lends itself to it."
William Kristol,"He is a strong president ... but he has never really focused on the importance of good execution. I think that is true in many parts of his presidency,"
William Kristol,"In the first term things went pretty well, you have to say. So I don't really put the blame on Andy; he's doing what he's always done."
William Kristol,"To the degree that Bush was enamored of a stealth strategy, I have got to believe he has learned there is a real downside."
Wayne Krivsky,"I would hope by the time we have our organizational meetings at the end of October that we have a better sense of who we are, that we have a sense of where we're going, that we set a game plan, which I wasn't able to do, obviously, this year. This whole year's going to be an evaluation process of a lot of things."
Wayne Krivsky,He's a pro. Tony knows he's got to stay ready. He's professional. He works hard. He wants to play. He works as hard as anyone we have.
Wayne Krivsky,We didn't have anyone at that game. We had some scouts ... that liked him.
Wayne Krivsky,If anything made sense in any phase of the game - like with (obtaining Brandon) Phillips as an example - I wouldn't hesitate. But we're just out of spring training. You'd kind of like to settle in and let the guys play for a while before you start making all kinds of moves.
Wayne Krivsky,"I really wanted to take a gamble on a guy like this, with his athletic ability and being a defense-oriented middle infielder who I think can help us this year and in the future. He's still a young guy."
Ray Kroc,"Luck is a dividend of sweat. The more you sweat, the luckier you get"
Ray Kroc,"The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it."
Ray Kroc,None of Us is as Good as All of Us.
Ray Kroc,We take the hamburger business more seriously than anyone else.
Ray Kroc,Creativity is a highfalutin word for the work I have to do between now and Tuesday.
Ray Kroc,The quality of a leader is reflected in the standards they set for themselves.
Ray Kroc,Its easy to have principles when you're rich. The important thing is to have principles when you're poor.
Ray Kroc,"If you work just for money, you'll never make it, but if you love what you're doing and you always put the customer first, success will be yours."
Ray Kroc,"As long as you're green, you're growing. As soon as you're ripe, you start to rot."
Ray Kroc,Are you green and growing or ripe and rotting?
Ray Kroc,"When you're green, your growing. When you're ripe, you rot."
Ray Kroc,"While formal schooling is an important advantage, it is not a guarantee of success nor is its absence a fatal handicap."
Ray Kroc,"The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it"
Ray Kroc,All money means to me is a pride in accomplishment.
Ray Kroc,You're only as good as the people you hire.
Ray Kroc,"Luck is a dividend of sweat. The more you sweat, the luckier you get."
Ray Kroc,"We provide food that customers love, day after day after day. People just want more of it."
Chad Kroeger,"How could you take his life away (What made you think you had the right?)/ How could you be so full of hate (To take away somebody's life?)/ When I heard you let him die and leave the world, I wondered why/ I sat and home and on my own, I cried alone and scratched your name in the side of a bullet."
Chad Kroeger,"[Paul volunteered to play on the song, so Kroeger overnighted him the tape and encouraged him to record a new drum track over the one played by NICKELBACK drummer Daniel Adair .] He thought about it for a while, ... then he decided that Daniel had done such an amazing job that we should leave it the way it was. That's when he sent the guitar parts from 'Vulgar Display of Power' and 'Far Beyond Driven' , which we used for the solo."

Neelie Kroes,Financial support must truly target market failures or support the delivery of broadband in rural and remote areas. The Commission will ensure that state aid does not distort competition to an extent contrary to the common interest by crowding-out private initiative.
Neelie Kroes,We have to follow the rules.
Neelie Kroes,"Consolidation in the skiing equipment industry cannot be allowed to lead to higher prices, lower quality or less innovative products,"
Neelie Kroes,Both gas and electricity markets are still largely national.
Neelie Kroes,"Most gas and electricity markets remain highly concentrated. This reflects the old market structure of national or regional monopolies. Incumbents often retain a firm control of the liberalized markets, each of them within its own traditional territory."
Neelie Kroes,I am determined to ensure that member states do not stand in the way of mergers falling within the commission's exclusive competence.
Neelie Kroes,The E.U.-U.S. Open Aviation Area agreement therefore envisages the establishment of a broadly similar cooperation framework between the Commission and the Department of Transportation.
Reed Kroloff,"The creation of this sugarplum fairy vision of what a city looks like or can look like is an unnecessary, and I think, slightly insulting view of human intelligence."
Reed Kroloff,"New Orleans - along with San Francisco - is the greatest collection of 18th-, 19th- and early-20th-century residential architecture in the United States. You're talking about miles and miles of historic properties. But saving the historic context does not mean necessarily rebuilding everything in it. I don't think you build a bad 21st-century copy of a brilliant 19th-century building."
Reed Kroloff,"This is the only place in America where the historic neighborhoods aren't the exception, it's the non-historic neighborhoods that are the exception."
Ralph Krueger,There's no question the top seven are far above the rest.
Ralph Krueger,"The team is mature. You're going to see that here, we've by far not reached our goals yet. We have Germany tomorrow. There's no time to sit on this. They can look back on this period for the rest of their life and they should do that with pride but they're not going to do that right now. I know that."
Ralph Krueger,"He brings a calmness on the puck to our power play. Off the ice, he brings passion and fire."
Ralph Krueger,Without continuity and without the core of players bringing a lot of experience to this tournament we would have had no chance. We have an average of 100 national team games among our 22 players.
Ralph Krueger,It took a lot of courage to do this by some players who were asking for autographs from those players a few years ago.
Ralph Krueger,"Both goalies were on the top of their game, but Gerber had the shutout against Canada fresh in his head."
Ralph Krueger,"With all of Canada watching, this happening at 35 years of age, my God, that's a great story."
Barbara Kruger,"You know, one of the only times I ever wrote about art was the obituary of Warhol that I did for the Village Voice."
Barbara Kruger,"What makes the production of my work so expensive? The whole installation thing - the construction, the objects, the technology. It really adds up."
Barbara Kruger,Things change and work changes. Right now I like the idea of enveloping a space and getting messages across that connect to the world in ways that seem familiar but are different.
Barbara Kruger,"There's a moment of recognition. It's that white-light kind of stuff that just works. I love that. And you know it when it happens, whether it's a movie, music, a building, a book."
Barbara Kruger,"There are so many moments and works that influence us in what we do. Movies, music, TV and, most importantly, the profound everydayness of our lives."
Barbara Kruger,"Prominence is cool, but when the delusion kicks in it can be a drag. Especially if you choose to surround yourself with friends and not acolytes."
Barbara Kruger,"Look, we're all saddled with things that make us better or worse. This world is a crazy place, and I've chosen to make my work about that insanity."
Barbara Kruger,Listen: our culture is saturated with irony whether we know it or not.
Barbara Kruger,"It's good to keep in mind that prominence is always a mix of hard work, eloquence in your practice, good timing and fortuitous social relations. Everything can't be personalized."
Barbara Kruger,"If most American cities are about the consumption of culture, Los Angeles and New York are about the production of culture - not only national culture but global culture."
Barbara Kruger,"I've always thought that it's good to watch the news to find out what everybody else is looking at and believing, if only because that's how consensus is constructed."
Barbara Kruger,"I'm trying to deal with ideas about histories, fame, hearsay, and how public identities are constructed."
Barbara Kruger,"I'm living my life, not buying a lifestyle."
Barbara Kruger,I'm an artist who works with pictures and words. Sometimes that stuff ends up in different kinds of sites and contexts which determine what it means and looks like.
Barbara Kruger,"I'd always been a news junkie, always read lots of newspapers and watched the Sunday morning news shows on TV and felt strongly about issues of power, control, sexuality and race."
Barbara Kruger,I want people to be drawn into the space of the work. And a lot of people are like me in that they have relatively short attention spans. So I shoot for the window of opportunity.
Barbara Kruger,"I try to deal with the complexities of power and social life, but as far as the visual presentation goes I purposely avoid a high degree of difficulty."
Barbara Kruger,I think what I'm trying to do is create moments of recognition. To try to detonate some kind of feeling or understanding of lived experience.
Barbara Kruger,"I think there are different ways of being rigorous, and I am asking people to be as rigorous in their pleasure as in their criticism."
Barbara Kruger,I think that every so-called history book and film biography should be prefaced by the statement that what follows is the author's rendition of events and circumstances.
Barbara Kruger,I think people have to set up little battles. They have to demonize people whom they disagree with or feel threatened by. But it's the ideological framing of the debate that scares me.
Barbara Kruger,"I think I developed language skills to deal with threat. It's the girl thing to do-you know, instead of pulling out a gun."
Barbara Kruger,"I mean, making art is about objectifying your experience of the world, transforming the flow of moments into something visual, or textual, or musical, whatever. Art creates a kind of commentary."
Barbara Kruger,I just say I'm an artist who works with pictures and words.
Barbara Kruger,I had to figure out how to bring the world into my work.
Barbara Kruger,"I feel uncomfortable with the term public art, because I'm not sure what it means. If it means what I think it does, then I don't do it. I'm not crazy about categories."
Barbara Kruger,I don't necessarily think that installation is the only way to go. It's just a label for certain kinds of arrangements.
Barbara Kruger,Do you know why language manifests itself the way it does in my work? It's because I understand short attention spans.
Barbara Kruger,"Direct address has been a consistent tactic in my work, regardless of the medium that I'm working in."
Barbara Kruger,"As with the Princess Di crash, which sent the media on the most insane feeding frenzy. From the moment of the crash, the pornography of sentiment never let up."
Barbara Kruger,"Although my art work was heavily informed by my design work on a formal and visual level, as regards meaning and content the two practices parted ways."
Barbara Kruger,"All the gossip and craziness becomes a kind of sustained narrative which, in turn, can become history. It's scary."
Lon Kruger,Great job. This group is understanding what they need to do and I think we're growing as a team.
Lon Kruger,"It wasn't getting any better. From one game to the next, it was gradually getting worse. The doctors said there was nothing to be gained by waiting to have the surgery."
Lon Kruger,That (surgery) is a possibility. We'll see what happens and listen to what the doctors tell us.
Lon Kruger,Nobody wants to be known as the son-of. . . . It's more difficult on the son than it is the dad when the two are on the same team.
Lon Kruger,"No question that when Louis makes his free throws, it helps everything. He's going up to the line believing he can make his free throws."
Lon Kruger,Wink's been playing really well. He's handled things with good composure and he's playing with good aggressiveness.
Paul Krugman,"unsustainable situations usually go on longer than most economists think possible. But they always end, and when they do, it's often painful."
Paul Krugman,"When they eliminated the bond, it was already obvious that the prospect of paying off the debt was evaporating before our eyes."
Paul Krugman,Social Security is a social insurance program - it is not designed to be the same thing as a 401(k).
Paul Krugman,Can we break the machine that is imposing right-wing radicalism on the United States? The scariest part is that the media is part of that machine.
Paul Krugman,"The problem isn't that people don't understand how good things are. It's that they know, from personal experience, that things really aren't that good."
Larry Krystkowiak,It's important. We'll approach it like we do the rest of them. We need to start clicking on all cylinders here.
Larry Krystkowiak,"He's a specimen. I think he's got a really, really bright future and will probably be playing for quite a bit of money someday."
Larry Krystkowiak,"It hasn't been fun, this little bit of a roller-coaster we've been on. I really want the program to be the focus, and our kids to be the focus. Unfortunately, some of that's been lost with what I've got going on."
Larry Krystkowiak,We can't lose sight of the fact that there's no doubt in anybody's mind involved in this game that they were a better team than us. We have to have the stars align and we have to hit open shots.
Larry Krystkowiak,It was a great game on his (Strait) part. I can't say I believe this game would have ended up the way it ended up without him being that efficient.
Larry Krystkowiak,"We were sniffing around, at least at halftime, and got a taste of what some big-time basketball is all about."
Mike Krzyzewski,"We got in foul trouble and we had to massage those last four minutes of the first half. A lot of times, I'd let them go back in, but with (how) the pace of the game was going today, we couldn't chance starting the second half with either one of those guys in foul trouble."
Mike Krzyzewski,"This is going to be a matter of collective responsibility,"
Mike Krzyzewski,"He can erase mistakes. Offensively, he's a definite low-post threat. And because of their 3-point shooting, he's usually isolated there one-on-one. And with his length and width, he has a chance to score really well. ... [He's] a low-post presence both offensively and defensively. Every team would love to have that, and they do."
Mike Krzyzewski,He's their shot blocker. He can erase mistakes.
Mike Krzyzewski,"For me, this is the ultimate honor in coaching,"
Mike Krzyzewski,"It's always an honor to be ranked high, but whatever is said about you, you take it and then take a realistic look at yourself and who you are. I would look at us and say we've got a chance (to win it all)."
Mike Krzyzewski,"One, I think it showed that the game was really important, but secondly, how that was handled was maybe the best thing that happened today. It was so darn good. This has been the classiest league in the country since its inception."
Mike Krzyzewski,"[But the Hall of Fame coach refused Friday to comment any further.] That has not been finalized yet, obviously because we haven't had a press conference or whatever, ... I've been in serious discussions, but it's not ready for an official announcement."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I thought at that time that 1992 would be my ultimate Olympic experience and it was a pretty darn good one, ... I'd like for this to be the ultimate Olympic experience."
Mike Krzyzewski,"When my two freshmen are playing like that, it brings everybody together. They were playing with such enthusiasm. They have such good game personalities, that when they allow themselves to show it, we're just better."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I've never seen this here at Duke, where with 13 guys you get [one player] with 40 points. He's off the charts with his focus and commitment. Nobody has had more or done it better here."
Mike Krzyzewski,"There aren't many kids like him. He's one of the best players in the country. He has high, high energy and he's at that position that we've used so well for 20 years - the mismatch at the four."
Mike Krzyzewski,"It's neat to coach a kid like that. Everyone knows he's going to take the three, and everyone knows he's going to make it."
Mike Krzyzewski,"We weren't going to win the basketball game, the game was basically over, so why put those kids in harm's way? It's an unfortunate situation. I'll let the powers that be handle it in front of everybody."
Mike Krzyzewski,"It is a chance to represent the United States at this elite level of basketball. I am honored to be chosen and look forward to the opportunity to develop this team that will represent our great country in its own sport, both on and off the court."
Mike Krzyzewski,"With me and basketball, it became part of me."
Mike Krzyzewski,"When I was growing up, there weren't any Little Leagues in the city. Parents worked all the time. They didn't have time to take their kids out to play baseball and football."
Mike Krzyzewski,"When I had troubles, I'd go out - with basketball, you can do it by yourself, too. So you'd go out and shoot, and you'd fantasize."
Mike Krzyzewski,"To me, teamwork is the beauty of our sport, where you have five acting as one. You become selfless."
Mike Krzyzewski,"The thing I loved the most - and still love the most about teaching - is that you can connect with an individual or a group, and see that individual or group exceed their limits."
Mike Krzyzewski,"The person who has inspired me my whole life is my Mom, because she taught me commitment. She sacrificed."
Mike Krzyzewski,The other thing I knew I had was a high level of competitiveness.
Mike Krzyzewski,"The life expectancy of a team is about eight months. Then the next year, it's a whole new team."
Mike Krzyzewski,"That's what I do now: I lead and I teach. If we win basketball games from doing that, then that's great, but I lead and teach. Those are the two things I concentrate on."
Mike Krzyzewski,"That's another thing, we made up games. We didn't have equipment. When it snowed, we would play slow motion tackle football. We would play hockey, but we wouldn't skate. We just made things up. I loved doing that."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Playing sport was somewhat frivolous, but I liked it. I rebelled a little bit, and wouldn't go to music lessons and things like that, but I would go and play ball. My parents learned to love it because they saw how much I got out of it."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Parents can really help, but they can also really hinder the development of their youngsters."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Once you win a National Championship, how do you do that again? How do you get the passion to do that again? We won it again right away, the next year. A lot of it had to do with the fact that I didn't give myself an opportunity to enjoy the first one."
Mike Krzyzewski,"My ambition in high school was to be a high school coach and teacher, and that's still what I do: teach."
Mike Krzyzewski,"In high school, in sport, I had a coach who told me I was much better than I thought I was, and would make me do more in a positive sense. He was the first person who taught me not to be afraid of failure."
Mike Krzyzewski,Imagination has a great deal to do with winning.
Mike Krzyzewski,"If you win a National Championship, or you win two, people think you have not only seen the Holy Grail, but you've embraced it. Basically, I do what a lot of people do, but I've been able to win."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I've tried to handle winning well, so that maybe we'll win again, but I've also tried to handle failure well. If those serve as good examples for teachers and kids, then I hope that would be a contribution I have made to sport. Not just basketball, but to sport."
Mike Krzyzewski,I've been so fortunate in my life that my family has never been jealous of my success. They have shown true love and commitment to me by being supportive. They shared in it.
Mike Krzyzewski,"I'm still not a great reader, but my wife is and my daughters are, and I envy them. I think I got into a bad habit of trying to do something all the time, instead of trying to sit down and take my time a little bit."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I'm fortunate now that I coach at Duke University and we've won a lot. I have some kids who haven't failed that much. But when they get to college, they're going to fail some time. That's a thing that I can help them the most with."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I wasn't a great player in college, but I was a very good high school player. It really shaped a lot of what I do as a basketball coach now."
Mike Krzyzewski,I think you're not a human being unless you have doubts and fears.
Mike Krzyzewski,"I think some parents now look at a youngster failing as the final thing. It's a process, and failure is part of the process. I would like it if the teacher and the parents would connect more. I think that used to be, but we're losing a little bit of that right now."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I probably shouldn't say this, but I was not much of a book person. I loved to learn, but I learn by doing. I learn from my experiences."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I have a rule on my team: when we talk to one another, we look each other right in the eye, because I think it's tough to lie to somebody. You give respect to somebody."
Mike Krzyzewski,I hated to lose.
Mike Krzyzewski,"I had a really bad temper, when I was growing up. Sport helped me channel that temper into more positive acts."
Mike Krzyzewski,"I always won in my imagination. I always hit the game-winning shot, or I hit the free throw. Or if I missed, there was a lane violation, and I was given another one."
Mike Krzyzewski,I always wanted to teach.
Mike Krzyzewski,"First of all, what happens is, when you're good at something, you spend a lot of time with it. People identify you with that sport, so it becomes part of your identity."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Everybody wants to take responsibility when you win, but when you fail, all these fingers are pointing."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Even though we want huge individual egos, our collective ego is unbelievable."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Each group and each youngster is different. As a leader or coach, you get to know what they need."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Actually, the Kentucky moment was better than winning the two National Championships, because it was the epitome of what I try to get from a team in a crisis situation."
Mike Krzyzewski,"A basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist. That's how I want you to play."
Mike Krzyzewski,"My parents didn't really understand too much about sport. At that time, we were in a Polish community in the inner city of Chicago, and I was the youngest of a bunch of cousins. Polish families are real big, with cousins and aunts and uncles."
Mike Krzyzewski,"Basketball was not my main sport in grade school, or even the first year of high school."
Mike Krzyzewski,The truth is that many people set rules to keep from making decisions.
Mike Krzyzewski,It was a great individual accomplishment.
Mike Krzyzewski,This is the first team we played all year that could really block shots like that. Their ability to block shots made us change some shots inside. And I don't know if we ever adjusted to that.
Mike Krzyzewski,"Throughout my life, my mom has been the person that I've always looked up to."
Gary Kubiak,"Oh, yeah, I was a worrier when I was a player. So I don't really tell players not to worry. I tell them to study, to do the work and just play."
Gary Kubiak,"I'm going to make (Carr) successful, I'm confident of that. He's a great kid. We have to go to work and get it done... I'm a fan of his. There is no reason he can't succeed. That's my job, my challenge."
Gary Kubiak,His workout was super. He did a great job. He put on a show. He made every throw.
Gary Kubiak,He's very competitive and got in an environment where everybody wanted to see him operate. He did a great job.
Gary Kubiak,"I look forward to working with David. As long as he knows that's the direction we want to head, I know he'll do his part. I know he's a great kid, a great young man. And that's all you can ask for - a great kid that's willing to work."
Gary Kubiak,"He's a tremendous athlete, and as coaches in this league, you look for guys who can bail you out, so to speak. [Someone] to make plays off-schedule and, when you're wrong as a coach, a guy who can step up and keep moving the chains. Vince is an extremely gifted young man. The plays he can make off-schedule are probably second to none."
Gary Kubiak,"He's got tremendous ability, and we all know he's a great kid. He'd be a joy to work with, and he's got some weapons around him to make him better. Through a lot of hard work, there's another level there for him to reach."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"How do geese know when to fly to the sun? Who tells them the seasons? How do we, humans know when it is time to move on? As with the migrant birds, so surely with us, there is a voice within if only we would listen to it, that tells us certainly when to go forth into the unknown."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,Should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the true beauty of their carvings
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"Dying is something we human beings do continuously, not just at the end of our physical lives on this earth."

Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"Those who have the strength and the love to sit with a dying patient in the silence that goes beyond words will know that this moment is neither frightening nor painful, but a peaceful cessation of the functioning of the body."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"As far as service goes, it can take the form of a million things. To do service, you don't have to be a doctor working in the slums for free, or become a social worker. Your position in life and what you do doesn't matter as much as how you do what you do."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"Live, so you do not have to look back and say: 'God, how I have wasted my life.'"
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"We need to teach the next generation of children from Day One that they are responsible for their lives. Mankind's greatest gift, also its greatest curse, is that we have free choice. We can make our choices built from love or from fear."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"I didn't fully realize it at the time, but the goal of my life was profoundly molded by this experience - to help produce, in the next generation, more Mother Teresas and less Hitlers."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences, all events are blessings given to us to learn from."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"There are no mistakes, no coincidences. All events are blessings given to us to learn from."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"I believe that we are solely responsible for our choices, and we have to accept the consequences of every deed, word, and thought throughout our lifetime."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"It's only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on earth - and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up, we will then begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"I say to people who care for people who are dying, if you really love that person and want to help them, be with them when their end comes close. Sit with them - you don't even have to talk. You don't have to do anything but really be there with them."
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,Should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the true beauty of their carvings.
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,"People are like stained - glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within."

Dennis Kucinich,"We show our support and love the troops, whatever our opinion,"
Dennis Kucinich,Everyone should have health insurance? I say everyone should have health care. I'm not selling insurance.
Dennis Kucinich,"Roman is a truly remarkable person. While working in my office, Roman showed tremendous dedication, intelligence and a real desire to give back to his community. No task was too small and no challenge too large for Roman to handle. He was a true asset to my office and my constituents. In a time when many pro athletes fail to live up to their commitments to their communities, Roman has represented the very best of the NFL both on and off the field."
Dennis Kucinich,"But despite that, Mayor Campbell, through a tremendous amount of skill and dedication and heart, has been able to maintain quality city services for the people of Cleveland, ... I know, I live in Cleveland, and I can tell you we're proud of the fact she's been able to keep city services up during this very difficult period."
Dennis Kucinich,Let's sink this rotten proposal that will destroy jobs in this country.
Dennis Kucinich,reclaim our environment from those who would destroy it with their predatory economic behavior.
Dennis Kucinich,"Dialogue is good, ... America used to talk to Iraq all the time. Members of Congress don't have any special skill in weapons inspection. However, if members could be accompanied by weapons inspection experts, that could be a step in the right direction."
Dennis Kucinich,"This is a sad day for America, the world community, and the people of Iraq,"
Lisa Kudrow,"I always felt like I could be funny, but there was a part of me that always judged actors so harshly... I thought all actors were dumb-that they must have serious emotional problems. Even if they don't, that's the perception I had of them. I didn't want anyone to see me that way."
Lisa Kudrow,"In college I castrated 21 rats, and I got pretty good at it."
Lisa Kudrow,"Since I had the baby I can't tolerate anything violent or sad, I saw the Matrix and I had my eyes closed through a lot of it, though I didn't need to. I would peek, and then think, oh OK, I can see that."
Matt Kujovsky,We had trouble stopping their counter.
Matt Kujovsky,We made too many mistakes and missed too many opportunities. It just ended up lop-sided.
Matt Kujovsky,We've been very confident in Jared. He's a super athlete and a great kid.
Toni Kukoc,"I didn't sleep for a long time, especially knowing we had a chance to go all the way to the end and win a championship. We got stuck in the seventh game against New York, but just from seeing how disappointed the players were and the coaching staff, not going all the way, I realized everybody was going to be motivated. Fortunately for us, it happened three times."
Toni Kukoc,"There's no relaxing. The more intensely you can get into the game, the better you are going to play. So I would keep intensity as much as I can and just pour all your energy into that game. We've got three or four days until the playoffs, so if we win we can sleep two days in a row."
Toni Kukoc,It is playoff time. Whoever responds and changes quicker is going to win four games and then go to the next round. So I think it's pretty much time for us to respond and make some different decisions and then win the game.
Toni Kukoc,It's very hard. It's such a long season ... it's very hard to maintain the consistency and play well.
Milan Kundera,"Woman is the future of man. That means that the world which was once formed in man's image will now be transformed to the image of woman. The more technical and mechanical, cold and metallic it becomes, the more it will need the kind of warmth that only the woman can give it. If we want to save the world, we must adapt to the woman, let ourselves be led by the woman, let ourselves be penetrated by the Ewigweiblich, the eternally feminine!"
Milan Kundera,"A route differs from a road not only because it is solely intended for vehicles, but also because it is merely a line that connects one point with another. A route has no meaning in itself; its meaning derives entirely from the two points that it connects. A road is a tribute to space. Every stretch of road has meaning in itself and invites us to stop. A route is the triumphant devaluation of space, which thanks to it has been reduced to a mere obstacle to human movement and a waste of time."
Milan Kundera,"We can never establish with certainty what part of our relations with others is the result of our emotions -- love, antipathy, charity, or malice -- and what part is predetermined by the constant power play among individuals."
Milan Kundera,Optimism is the opium of the people.
Milan Kundera,Nothing requires a greater effort of thought than arguments to justify the rule of non-thought.

Milan Kundera,Happiness is the longing for repetition.
Milan Kundera,Business has only two functions - marketing and innovation.
Milan Kundera,"A worker may be the hammer's master, but the hammer still prevails. A tool knows exactly how it is meant to be handled, while the user of the tool can only have an approximate idea."
Milan Kundera,Nudity is the uniform of the other side... nudity is a shroud.
Milan Kundera,Solitude: a sweet absence of looks.
Milan Kundera,"The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs; or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the non-essential. If a person is still crazy enough to write novels nowadays and wants to protect them, he has to write them in such a way that they cannot be adapted, in other words, in such a way that they cannot be retold."
Milan Kundera,Listening to a news broadcast is like smoking a cigarette and crushing the butt in the ashtray.
Milan Kundera,"I think, therefore I am is the statement of an intellectual who underrates toothaches."
Milan Kundera,I think therefore I am' is the statement of an intellectual who underrates toothaches
Milan Kundera,"A gesture cannot be regarded as the expression of an individual, as his creation (because no individual is capable of creating a fully original gesture, belonging to nobody else), nor can it even be regarded as that person's instrument; on the contrary, it is gestures that use us as their instruments, as their bearers and incarnations."
Milan Kundera,"True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power."
Milan Kundera,Eroticism is like a dance: one always leads the other.
Milan Kundera,"High culture is nothing but a child of that European perversion called history, the obsession we have with going forward, with considering the sequence of generations a relay race in which everyone surpasses his predecessor, only to be surpassed by his successor. Without this relay race called history there would be no European art and what characterizes it: a longing for originality, a longing for change. Robespierre, Napoleon, Beethoven, Stalin, Picasso, they're all runners in the relay race, they all belong to the same stadium."
Milan Kundera,"There is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels for someone, for someone, pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echos."
Milan Kundera,"Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect mankind has suffered a fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it."
Milan Kundera,"He took over anger to intimidate subordinates, and in time anger took over him."
Milan Kundera,How goodness heightens beauty!
Mila Kunis,I get away with a lot of stuff that no one could get away with in reality!
Mila Kunis,"I love swimming, tennis, and I am taking up golf. I am not serious about it, I just go to the range and practice. Other than that, I enjoy going to the movies and hanging out with my friends."
Mila Kunis,I am the baby on the show.
William Kunstler,"When we talk about justice in America we're really talking about justice brought about by the people, not by judges who are tools of the establishment or prosecutors who are are equally tools of the establishment or the wardens or the police officers."
William Kunstler,We have become the charnel house of the Western World.
William Kunstler,"This is New York, and there's no law against being annoying."
William Kunstler,So May 4th in the labor movement has always been an important date.
William Kunstler,"Our bodies must always be wherever that struggle and the moment we forget that, the moment we become lazy, the moment we sit back, then then the evil ones do their ordained tasks to us."
William Kunstler,"May 4th is a particularly memorable day in American history because 84 years to the day before May 4, 1970, there was another demonstration at the Haymarket Square in Chicago."
William Kunstler,"Four years earlier I had been selected, with Kay Boyle, the writer, and a number of others, to go to Cambodia and come back and prove that there were no sanctuaries in that country."
William Kunstler,"But on the other hand government takes away a certain amount of liberty and in some countries it takes away all of liberty. And it will, everywhere, if people who fight government do not fight government any longer."
William Kunstler,"But he said Blanket Hill should be a national monument. And so we came out of his chambers feeling, though while we had lost to the powers of darkness, we had at least shown one Federal Judge what the right path would have been."
William Kunstler,"At first blush, it seems that the young people who were shot down in the parking lot at the base of Blanket Hill gave up their lives for a dream that died with them."
William Kunstler,A dog is like a liberal. He wants to please everybody. A cat really doesn't need to know that everybody loves him.
William Kunstler,"On the unofficial level it was a glorious moment in our national life because young people decided that this had to stop, that they could no longer stand the shedding of blood in this tragic adventure in Southeast Asia."
Mitch Kupchak,"This is a one-time opportunity to take advantage of this situation, and exercising this will give us greater roster flexibility and the ability to improve our team."
Mitch Kupchak,He said the same thing the first time we hired him. I hope the same thing unfolds.
Mitch Kupchak,What?s that expression? ... Thinking outside the box?
Mitch Kupchak,"I don't see any ego. It's like, 'Mitch, what do you need me to do?' He'll go anywhere. He's always been a worker, so I'm not surprised, but a lot of guys would not have taken that approach. He loves to contribute, and he loves to work."
Mitch Kupchak,"There's a feeling he'll never play again. Anticipating he'll never play again, I don't think there's a doubt he's the premier European player to play in the NBA."
Mitch Kupchak,"We're taking it month-by-month. He's considerably away from being cleared by doctors. A lot depends on the roster situation and where we are as a team. There are certain scenarios where if our roster dictates it and he's ready to go, it's a possibility."
Mitch Kupchak,His playing style was defined by his wittiness and creativity on the court and we think those talents will benefit him in his new off-court career as well.
Mitch Kupchak,they have no choice.
Mitch Kupchak,He's our draft choice. He's in his recovery phase. We want to keep him as close to the organization as possible. He's not under contract. It's really something he does on his own.
Mitch Kupchak,"You have to look at the package, his four years in Washington. Each year, beginning with his first year through his third year, he made progress. And then the fourth year did not go well. It just didn't. It didn't go well on the court, it didn't go well off the court. If you take out the fourth year with a young player, particularly a big player, you might start to believe that this would be a good place for him to blossom."
Mitch Kupchak,"He's still a good player, ... I think he's got a lot of good basketball left in him."
Mitch Kupchak,We did not ask for his approval.
Mitch Kupchak,"We understand that the league has a job to do in enforcing disciplinary action, but we disagree with and are disappointed with their ruling."
Charles Kuralt,Sometimes I would think myself happy never to leave. Every trip must end.
Charles Kuralt,To read the papers and to listen to the news... one would think the country is in terrible trouble. You do not get that impression when you travel the back roads and the small towns do care about their country and wish it well.
Charles Kuralt,"When we become a really mature, grown-up, wise society, we will put teachers at the center of the community, where they belong. We don't honor them enough, we don't pay them enough."

Charles Kuralt,"Since my retirement, I've spent a lot of time trying to help the School of Social Work at the University of North Carolina. A society like this just can't afford an uneducated underclass of citizens."
Charles Kuralt,"Now that I look back on it, having retired from being a reporter, it was kind of romantic. It was a wonderful way to live one's life, just as I imagined it would be when I was 6 or 7."
Charles Kuralt,My parents encouraged me in everything I ever wanted to do.
Charles Kuralt,"My mother, at least twice, cancelled our family's subscription to the newspaper I was working on, because she was so mad about its treatment of my father."
Charles Kuralt,Look for joy in your life; it's not always easy to find.
Charles Kuralt,"Kids are always asked, What are you going to be when you grow up? I needed an answer. So instead of saying, a fireman, or a policeman, I said, a reporter."
Charles Kuralt,"Just by luck, I picked good heroes to worship."
Charles Kuralt,"It's best to leap into something you know you love. You might change your mind later, but that is the privilege of youth."
Charles Kuralt,"It was so much fun to have the freedom to wander America, with no assignments. For 25 or 30 years I never had an assignment. These were all stories I wanted to do myself."
Charles Kuralt,"In television, everything is gone with the speed of light, literally. It is no field for anybody with intimations of immortality."
Charles Kuralt,I wasn't a very discriminating reader. I read just about everything that came along.
Charles Kuralt,"I used to think that driving, sleepless, ambitious labor was what you needed to succeed."
Charles Kuralt,"I think I'd have done better if I had been a little more relaxed-if I had not pressed quite so hard, if I'd not lost quite so much sleep."
Charles Kuralt,I think all those people I did stories about measured their own success by the joy their work was giving them.
Charles Kuralt,"I saw how many people were poor and how many kids my age went to school hungry in the morning, which I don't think most of my contemporaries in racially segregated schools in the South thought very much about at the time."
Charles Kuralt,I remember being in the public library and my jaw just aching as I looked around at all those books I wanted to read. There just wasn't time enough to read everything I wanted to read.
Charles Kuralt,"I recognize that I had a good deal of good luck in my life. I came along at a time when it was pretty easy to get a job in journalism. I went to work at CBS News when I was about 22, and within a year or so was reporting on the air."
Charles Kuralt,"I had a little insight into life that most kids probably didn't have. My mother was a schoolteacher, and my father was a social worker. Through his eyes I saw the underside of society."
Charles Kuralt,"I don't think one should ever come to my stage of life and have to look back and say, Gosh. I wish I hadn't spent all those years doing that job I was never really interested in."
Charles Kuralt,"I don't think I had a reputation as a hard worker, but inside I was always being eaten up by the pressures."
Charles Kuralt,"I don't have any well-developed philosophy about journalism. Ultimately it is important in a society like this, so people can know about everything that goes wrong."
Charles Kuralt,I'm not any kind of social reformer.
Charles Kuralt,I didn't like the competitiveness of big-time journalism.
Charles Kuralt,I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be a reporter. I don't know where I got the idea that it was a romantic calling.
Charles Kuralt,"It does no harm just once in a while to acknowledge that the whole country isn't in flames, that there are people in the country besides politicians, entertainers, and criminals."
Charles Kuralt,"I would love to write something that people would still read 50 or 100 years from now. That comes with growing older, I think."
Charles Kuralt,"I could tell you which writer's rhythms I am imitating. It's not exactly plagiarism, it's falling in love with good language and trying to imitate it."
Charles Kuralt,"I can't say that I've changed anybody's life, ever, and that's the real work of the world, if you want a better society."
Charles Kuralt,I believe that writing is derivative. I think good writing comes from good reading.
Charles Kuralt,Good teachers know how to bring out the best in students.
Charles Kuralt,"For a while there, I was a stringer. The expression comes from the old habit of stringing together the column inches that you had written. They'd measure it and pay you 10 cents an inch for your printed copy."
Charles Kuralt,A country so rich that it can send people to the moon still has hundreds of thousands of its citizens who can't read. That's terribly troubling to me.
Charles Kuralt,"Thanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible to travel across the country from coast to coast without seeing anything."
Charles Kuralt,The everyday kindness of the back roads more than makes up for the acts of greed in the headlines.

Haruhiko Kuroda,"as I have always said, it is desirable for dollar-yen rates to trade in a stable manner."
Haruhiko Kuroda,"We must intensify our efforts to build rails, roads and other cross-border infrastructure and coordinate the associated laws, rules and regulations. Financing will be a major challenge."
Haruhiko Kuroda,"(Long term) rates, if they were to adjust in an abrupt manner, could be a major risk."
Haruhiko Kuroda,"Our regionâ€™s accomplishments in reducing income poverty are now well recognized, but an immense task lies ahead of us,"
Haruhiko Kuroda,This is clearly the worst natural disaster in Pakistan's recent history. The images of ordinary citizens pulling friends and neighbors from the rubble will remain indelibly etched in our minds.
Ray Kurzweil,"Humans feel deeply the suffering of their friends and allies, and easily discount / dismiss the comparable experience of their enemies."

Ray Kurzweil,"By the 2030s, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will predominate."
Ray Kurzweil,"I'm an inventor. I became interested in long-term trends because an invention has to make sense in the world in which it is finished, not the world in which it is started."
Ray Kurzweil,A successful person isn't necessarily better than her less successful peers at solving problems; her pattern-recognition facilities have just learned what problems are worth solving.
Ray Kurzweil,"I consider myself an inventor, entrepreneur, and author."
Ray Kurzweil,"As order exponentially increases, time exponentially speeds up."
Ray Kurzweil,We are beginning to see intimations of this in the implantation of computer devices into the human body.
Ray Kurzweil,"Even by common wisdom, there seem to be both people and objects in my dream that are outside myself, but clearly they were created in myself and are part of me, they are mental constructs in my own brain."
Ray Kurzweil,"We appear to be programmed with the idea that there are 'things' outside of our self, and some are conscious, and some are not."
Ray Kurzweil,"Supercomputers will achieve one human brain capacity by 2010, and personal computers will do so by about 2020."
Rabbi Harold S. Kushner,"I would rather think of life as a good book. The further you get into it, the more it begins to come together and make sense."
Rabbi Harold S. Kushner,Fun can be the dessert of our lives but never its main course.
Rabbi Harold S. Kushner,"The circumstances of your life have uniquely qualified you to make a contribution. And if you don't make that contribution, nobody else can make it."
Rabbi Harold S. Kushner,"In the final analysis, the questions of why bad things happen to good people transmutes itself into some very different questions, no longer asking why something happened, but asking how we will respond, what we intend to do now that it happened."
Ken Kutaragi,"When we initially announced our plans to launch this spring, we had expected the standardization work on all of the technologies to be completed by last August, but there were improvements that were decided on since then."
Ken Kutaragi,We believe that hardware-level security is fundamental. Software solutions may be not fast or robust enough to protect the system and its content when it is connected to the global network environment.
Ken Kutaragi,"Retailers told me that on a dollar base, they expect 70 percent of their sales to come from PlayStation. The remaining 30 percent will come from Nintendo and Xbox but almost all of that will be from Nintendo."

Ken Kutaragi,The hardware was developed with the hard disk in mind.
Ken Kutaragi,"I'm not worried. Good luck, ... the center of gravity."

Ken Kutaragi,"As SCE enters its second decade, we need to reinforce our games development power and create new entertainment experiences that will bring out the best of the technology in platforms such as PSP Â® (PlayStation Â® Portable), PLAYSTATION Â® 3, and beyond, ... PlayStation, favored by 200 million people all over the world, and Phil's strong leadership combined, I am confident that the power of our development studios are further empowered to create more new and innovative titles."
Ken Kutaragi,Computer entertainment systems and applications are leading this trend.
Ken Kutaragi,I'd like to apologize for the delay. I have been cautious because many people in various areas are banking on the potential of the next-generation DVD.
Ken Kutaragi,I'd like to apologize for the delay.
Ken Kutaragi,Improving system response changes the relationship between computers and humans.
Michelle Kwan,"Thinking gold is good. I'm staying positive, feeling good. I'm injury free. So right now, it's just going for it."
Michelle Kwan,"I've learned that it's not about the gold. It's about the spirit of it and about the sport itself. I have no regrets. I tried my hardest and if I don't win the gold, that's OK. I've had a great career. This is a sport. It's beautiful."
Michelle Kwan,"I had to go through my programs. There was no audience, no feedback, so that was difficult. I tried to stay within myself and stay present and go through everything. Today wasn't the Olympics."
Michelle Kwan,"I got a call this morning, and it was from Nancy Kerrigan, wishing me luck. She wished me luck and sent me all her good wishes."
Michelle Kwan,"I was so worried about winning, it was as if I was caught up in my own web."
Michelle Kwan,"I always thought after 2002 that I'd hang up my skates and turn professional and just go on tour and do shows. But I don't know when it is enough. I mean, I still enjoy it. I'm the luckiest girl alive that I get to perform in front of thousands of people, do what I love doing."
Michelle Kwan,"Skating takes up 70 percent of my time, school about 25 percent. Having fun and talking to my friends, 5 percent. It's hard. I envy other kids a lot of things, but I get a guilt trip when I'm not training."
Michelle Kwan,I feel I am one of the best three skaters in America.
Talib Kweli,You have to know when to be arrogant. You have to when to be humble. You have to know when to be hard and you have to know when to be soft.
Talib Kweli,So I just had to step up how I was doing it and the moment that I stepped up and the moment I focused all my energy on that is when things started to happen. So there's a direct relationship between my inspiration and my output.
Talib Kweli,"People consider Black Star a great album, and I think it's a classic album. But the fact is, both me and Mos Def have made better albums since Black Star."
Talib Kweli,"I started rapping because I wanted people to hear what I have to say, I want as many people to hear me as possible, and I do everything in my power to make that pop."
Talib Kweli,"I not only wanted to showcase lyrical skills but also continue to drop knowledge on the hiphop community. I'm looking to elevate through my music, and through my music I educate."
Talib Kweli,I met Mos Def around that time but I didn't hook up with him until I was about 17 or 18.
Talib Kweli,"I listened to a mind joint, and I wanted to do my own version of it, and what you hear on my mixtape is my take on what the whole CD sounds like."
Talib Kweli,Music is not an exact science so depending on the time and the mode and the energy when we do it that will determine what happens with it.
Talib Kweli,I will never do a record without some sense of responsibility.
Talib Kweli,I like the last Scarface album a lot.
Talib Kweli,But you have to be creative on how you sell yourself and market yourself.
Talib Kweli,Woman are complex creatures.
Talib Kweli,"Well if somebody's giving me a script, I'll consider it. But it's not something I'm chasing."
Talib Kweli,The problem with our role is Americans live in a world of illusion.
Talib Kweli,The beautiful thing about hip-hop is it's like an audio collage. You can take any form of music and do it in a hip-hop way and it'll be a hip-hop song. That's the only music you can do that with.
Talib Kweli,"So I think hip-hop is moving and is going to continue to move in the direction of rappers just being honest with themselves, whether you're talking about Common and Mos Def or Nas and 50 cent."
Talib Kweli,Once you're signed to a label you compromise.
Talib Kweli,"Let me finish my music, and let me present it the way I want to present it. And then share it, put it online, do whatever you want to do after that."
Talib Kweli,"I'm not looking to set a standard... but, I believe I have offered a challenge to others with my work."

Talib Kweli,I don't feel comfortable making empty music.
Talib Kweli,Hip-hop isn't as complex as a woman is.
Talib Kweli,Hip-hop is a vehicle.
Talib Kweli,Hi-Tek is on three or four songs on the new record.
Talib Kweli,"Fortunately, artists can live off their works, if you're creative at how you do it. If you just depend on the videos and the radio, you're at a loss."
Talib Kweli,"Even an independent label is looking for a hit, they're not looking for a record that's not gonna do well."
Talib Kweli,But it becomes disrespectful when the artist's process is not respected.
Talib Kweli,"As far as being on a major label, some labels get it and get what they have to do, and some labels don't. I don't think the label I'm on necessarily gets it, but I think over time they're gonna have to."
Talib Kweli,"And you know, art as commerce, doesn't really make too much sense, they don't go together."
Talib Kweli,"Ain't nobody making music to not be heard and the easiest way to be heard is to be on the radio, but you should never compromise who you are, your values or your morals."
Talib Kweli,"A lot of these people, these program directors, just like anybody else in the world, even though they're supposed to be leaders in the world, they're followers. They follow what they think someone else is doing, instead of trying to blaze a trail."
Nguyen Cao Ky,The way Americans understand and treat other peoples almost guarantees that the world will suffer more trouble.
