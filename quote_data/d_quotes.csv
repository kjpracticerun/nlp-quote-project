Chuck Daly,The important thing is to get the right players on the team so Mike can be successful.
John Daly,I actually putted the ball really well today.
John Daly,"[But there were no knocks. From anyone. The pros loved Harding. The fans loved the tournament.] It's unbelievable how many people were out here, ... That's what's great about this game, especially this city. It's so hungry for golf."
John Daly,It's not worth it. This is my last U.S. Open -- ever. I've had it with the USGA and the way they run their tournaments. The USGA loves to embarrass guys who play in their tournaments.
John Daly,"It's not worth it. This is my last U.S. Open -- ever, ... I've had it with the USGA and the way they run their tournaments. The USGA loves to embarrass guys who play in their tournaments."
John Daly,"I can tell you one thing. I've done this my way. I don't have anybody to blame for this win but me, and I love it."
John Daly,"Well, it's a tie and jacket and I just don't travel with one, ... You're not going to put a coat and tie on me for dinner. I'm just being honest. Plus, the wives can't go and I'd rather see the wives be able to go instead of just all the guys. That makes it fun."
John Daly,"The course, I do like it. It's an awfully good golf course. If we could just stay somewhere for a while, it would be nice. Either this one or that one, but let's stop moving."
John Daly,"He's a champion, and he's won so many golf tournaments. I was probably feeling a little bit more heat than he was. You just hate to lose that way, and I know he hated to win that way."
John Daly,"He's a champion and he's won so many golf tournaments,"
John Daly,I had a fantastic weekend of golf - maybe I got started a little too late.
John Daly,"It's a lot of fun, but it's stressful. It's great to be in this position, but it's not the easiest thing to do."
John Daly,It's fun to be able to hit driver and you can score well if you hit it straight.
John Daly,I'm feeling a little weak. But it's no excuse for playing that bad.
John Daly,It's been a horrible putting year. And when you don't have a lot of confidence with your putter -- especially when you have a chance to win -- instead of feeling you are going to make them ... I didn't feel like I was going to make them.
John Daly,"So, ... what do you want for Christmas?"
John Daly,He's tough [Tiger Woods]. I wish I was that tough when I was his age.
John Daly,It can't just be five arbitrary accidents.
Lin Dan,"Only victory could prove my world number one ranking. The final was tough, but I won."
Lin Dan,I wanted to show the stamina and strength of the men's singles game in China so I focused really hard to aim to get one point at a time and when I got to 10-13 I felt much more confident.
Lin Dan,It hurt quite a lot during the last few points and I was getting worried. But I just held on to my lead.
Lin Dan,Even though I did not have my best performance today I kept a good fighting spirit.
Lin Dan,I couldn't control the shuttle in the second game because of the wind. I couldn't play the way I wanted to.
Lin Dan,I want to be the champion. I am confident I can do it.
Lin Dan,I felt good today and controlled the game from the very beginning.

Frank Dane,A liberal is a man who will give away everything he doesn't own.
Frank Dane,"Rome had Senators too, that's why it declined."
Frank Dane,"Some have greatness thrust upon them, but not lately."
Frank Dane,Life is strange. Every so often a good man wins.
Frank Dane,It is not necessary to have enemies if you go out of your way to make friends hate you.
Frank Dane,The way to a woman's heart is through your wallet.
Frank Dane,"Blessed is he who talks in circles, for he shall become a big wheel."
Frank Dane,Get all the fools on your side and you can be elected to anything.

Frank Dane,Where the criminals cover their crimes by making them legal.
Ken Daneyko,My heart went in my throat.
Ken Daneyko,(I thought) maybe I've got a shot. They're not giving me (number) 68.
Ken Daneyko,I've never seen my dad cry in 41 years. And he had tears in his eyes.
John Danforth,"By doing this, we give defendants and potential defendants a way to avoid significant exposure to antitrust and patent cases."
John Danforth,fired at a construction area about 75 feet from the living quarters of the Branch Davidian complex four hours before the fire and ... did not cause the fire.
John Danforth,"The loudest voices we hear are those who advocate conflict, divisiveness."
William Danforth,"I dare you, whoever you are, to share with others the fruits of your daring. Catch a passion for helping others, and a richer life will come back to you."
William Danforth,"It's the kind of thing that really interests him ... preserving the environment and keeping the world inhabitable for his grandchildren,"
William Danforth,"Hidden down in every person is the Divine -- Real faith, dreams and visions. Lift your thoughts above the commonplace and live in the Presence of the Best. Spiritual investments are repaid a thousand fold."
William Danforth,History records the successes of men with objectives and a sense of direction. Oblivion is the position of small men overwhelmed by obstacles.
William Danforth,"I dare you, boys and girls, to make life obey you, not you it. It is only a shallow dare to do the foolish things. I dare you to do the uplifting, courageous things."
William Danforth,"Aspire nobly, adventure daringly, and serve humbly."
William Danforth,I am on a voyage of discovery. I search for those of you who will go on a great adventure . . . if you are one of those audacious few willing to dare and then to share . . . then come with me.

Charlie Daniels,"Some of our friends came and sat in with us, and it was just so much fun. We said, Hey, let's do this once in a while. We did them every year for a while, then we took it on the road. We've done eighteen now, I think."
Charlie Daniels,"We never envisioned this much stuff. I'm overwhelmed by the support out there for the troops, ... only one company that will remain nameless turned us down."
Charlie Daniels,"We can no more blame it on good Middle Eastern citizens than we can blame Hitler on people of German descent,"
Charlie Daniels,I believe you might want to say something. I've never seen you at a loss for words.
Charlie Daniels,"I didn't really fit well with what was going on in Nashville at the time. I was too loud, I was too bluesy, I was too a lot of things."
Charlie Daniels,"I should be the one to say what I do. It's just not done that way anymore in Nashville, and I can't do it the other way. That's how our record label came about."
Charlie Daniels,"Any accolades that anybody puts toward this band really makes me feel good, because I have devoted such a big part of my life to this band, making it what I want it to be."
Charlie Daniels,"Well, I just can't play the game anymore. I'm 63 years old, and I've been in the business for 40 years now. I take good advice and direction really well, but I don't need somebody that finished college two years ago to come in and tell me what I should be recording."
Charlie Daniels,"The funny thing is, the music that I'm writing now is probably some of the most cutting edge we've ever done. The music that I'm thinking about putting on our next album."
Charlie Daniels,We can get rid of red tape.
Charlie Daniels,I just thank God I can make a living doing something I enjoy as much as I do playing music.
Charlie Daniels,"We didn't have a garage to rehearse in. We had to aggravate the folks in the house. But I got a chance to play in a beer joint, and that's how it started."
Charlie Daniels,"I had been on the road for a long time and was not really getting anywhere. Bob Johnston, a friend of mine, had taken over Columbia in Nashville. He asked me if I wanted to come down. I did -- thank God I did."
Charlie Daniels,"A friend of mine, that I had known for some time, came up one day with an old guitar. I don't know where he got it, I don't know how long he'd had it, but he knew about two chords on it. He proceeded to teach them to me, and then we proceeded to go crazy over music."
Charlie Daniels,"Country music has changed tremendously, so what now is considered country was not considered country at that time. We were doing stuff that probably could have been called country music today, but would certainly have not have fit in at that time."
Jeff Daniels,"I never starved. And you know, whatever talent I have, I've relied on that, versus image or star."
Jeff Daniels,"every rest area, historical mile marker and tourist trap between a grocery store parking lot in Mount Union and a hog farm in the alleged center of the United States."
Jeff Daniels,"That isn't the reality, I know, but that's how I approached it: I'm not perfect but here's the best I can do. And hopefully I did the right thing."
Jeff Daniels,"I've got a lot of friends who make $20 million, and I don't, ... I could feel unappreciated. So I fanned those flames [to play the part]."
Jeff Daniels,"I've got a lot of friends who make $20 million, and I don't. I could feel unappreciated. So I fanned those flames [to play the part]."
Jeff Daniels,I'm the guy to call. Look at the resume. I have kids of my own. I have dogs.
Jeff Daniels,"It is what it is. He's trying to make a big family comedy. The characters, even if they're big and broad, don't know they're big and broad."
Jeff Daniels,It's like a second Christmas. I'm not sure I deserve it.
Jeff Daniels,"There's a lot of pain, there's a lot of truth, there's a lot of tragic behavior (in Berkman), but he's also funny,"
Jon Daniels,"There is no trade or pending trade despite reports to the contrary and we expect him to be here this year and at a minimum, next year. Since we acquired him from the Yankees, there has been endless speculation about where he might be headed. We have been consistent in saying that he is a piece of the puzzle we are putting together."
Jon Daniels,"Absolutely not. Including the Florida trade, at no point were we mentioning Hank's name. I didn't bring it up on any occasion. The Marlins deal was a unique opportunity that we had to consider."
Jon Daniels,"He's doing very well. That was a calculated risk ... not putting him on the roster, but he's starting to pitch well. He has a big fastball and one of the best breaking balls in the system. It wouldn't surprise me if we have a need, he could help us this year."
Jon Daniels,"That's the reality, and you can't overlook it. Rod can be a free agent, but we don't want get ahead of ourselves. Rod is the starter now and at some point we'll address that. Rod's got the job and the experience and you hope Gerald learns from him."
Jon Daniels,"Juan had something like six out of eight quality starts at the end of the year, and that's not counting 10 strikeouts earlier against the Yankees. There's no denying the ability. As he continues to mature, we'd like to look at him as someone we can rely on. If you look at the back end of the rotation guys around the league, he could be in the upper echelon."
Jon Daniels,"[Rod] has really entrenched himself as a quality player and a key contributor to this club. Rod is certainly our starter, he's earned that, and he has a bright future with the club, as does Gerald. ... We signed Rod to a one-year deal but it could be a longer fit than that."
Jon Daniels,"Bullpen, I think, is the most unpredictable part of the game, for me. You can build a quality bullpen so many ways. What I want is to slip a few pieces of it in and then bring in a lot of quality arms, then sort it out from there."
Jon Daniels,"By the nature of his injury, it's going to be tough to get him stretched out as a starter."
Jon Daniels,"The last four years have just been a whirlwind learning curve for me, and John has made it a lot easier. It didn't take me long to realize my future wasn't going to be on the field. So this is what I have aspired to for quite a while."
Jon Daniels,We want to let him get a sense of where we're at and the framework of some of the ideas we're going to mull over the next month.
Jon Daniels,There is a hunger level on the team and we want to see what we can do. This is not a perfect roster or win-at-all costs situation. We have the opportunity for the next few years to continue to put out a competitive club.
Jon Daniels,"Jonathan, ... has an intense natural curiosity."
Jon Daniels,"I think the one about not having played is the least relevant [criticism] of all, ... I want to have a relationship with the players. I want to be available to them. But I'm not going to be telling them how to hit a curveball. That's not my job."
Jon Daniels,He will be a source of creativity and ideas now and in the future. I am excited about someone with his knowledge and skills joining our baseball operations staff.
Jon Daniels,"We looked for durability and consistency. In today's game, 200 innings is the benchmark that defines consistency and durability. The inherent value is that it takes you directly from the starters to the back end of your bullpen. It allows you to bypass the more unpredictable parts of the pitching staff."
Jon Daniels,"Phil has come in to camp in great shape, and seems committed to staying there. We've got a commitment there, and we're going to give him every opportunity to make the best of it."
Jon Daniels,The circumstances in the big leagues have changed but the reasons for sending them out haven't. We want to give them a chance to succeed and come at their own pace.
Jon Daniels,"Somebody his age and at the stage of his development, we don't want him sitting around for a long period of time and not playing."
Ray Daniels,It's a groundbreaking statement and very forward thinking. It's the sort of thinking that will help heal our community.
Ray Daniels,"[Boykin was planning to talk about hostility toward homosexuals in the black community, Ray Daniels, communications director for the group, said Friday.] It's a groundbreaking statement and very forward thinking, ... It's the sort of thinking that will help heal our community."
Ray Daniels,"So often we are invisible to people, so we're trying to raise our visibility and raise awareness,"
Ray Daniels,"It was a lot of talk and no action. Farrakhan is trying to have it both ways. He is a charismatic and charming speaker but he doesn't want to alienate anyone, nor does he want anyone to present their specific agenda."
Rick Danko,"Go with your first thoughts; they're usually your best thoughts. Pay attention, stick to your goals and follow those guidelines. It's all right there if you reach for it, unless you want to punch timeclocks and work for somebody. That's what we liked about America, the land of opportunity. All your dreams can come true."
Rick Danko,"You have to remember the band played from 1960 to 1965, every night. You get into a rut playing nightclubs every night, and you didn't want to run it into the ground."
Rick Danko,"I love to play; a stage is a safe place for me to be. It's not that way for most folks, but I'd be lost without it."
Rick Danko,You put a song on the record or on tape and you stop singing it. You just don't sit around and sing it anymore unless you're performing. That's kind of sad.
Rick Danko,"When I was younger, I had big visions of changing the world."
Rick Danko,"When I was a kid a growing up in Ontario, Canada, Lake Erie was so polluted, I never thought it would ever, EVER be turned around where they could start cleaning it out in my lifetime!"
Rick Danko,"When I used to play nightclubs, you had to play Top 40 or favorite oldies that maybe people could relate to."
Rick Danko,"When CD technology first came out, it was just so much waste."
Rick Danko,"Well, it's just always the same. It's the same arrangements. It's the same if I'm playing bass, if I'm playing guitar, if I'm playing piano."
Rick Danko,"Then, there was Greenpeace, I remember that when they first started out with the boats in the waters, and the guys in the boats between the whales and the boats that will hunting the whales with spear guns."
Rick Danko,"The pressures, I don't really like to think about the pressures, I like to solve them, you know what I mean. I could sit here and complain about pressures but nobody wants to hear about pressures."
Rick Danko,"The Band was always famous for its retirements; we'd go and play and get a little petty cash together, and then not see each other till it was time to fill our pockets up again."
Rick Danko,The Band is sounding real good. We've been doing some dates together and they've been going well.
Rick Danko,Paul Butterfield and I had a band together at one point.
Rick Danko,"My first payback to society in life, was The Dolphin Project."
Rick Danko,"Just this last year, I made the statement by hooking up with Greenpeace. By not only contributing money, but by contributing more my time."
Rick Danko,It's hard for me to sit around and discuss what I do - I'm used to hearing other people talk about what I do - It makes me very uncomfortable.
Rick Danko,"I'm here in the mountains, in the foothills of the Catskills."
Rick Danko,"I started working with Bob in 1965. We did go through a lot of changes from 65 to 74, a lot of changes. By 1974, everything had straightened itself out."
Rick Danko,"I saw Ronnie Hawkins play near my hometown, Port Dover, Ontario, and I saw him play there on New Year's Eve and the following spring I booked myself to be his opening act on maybe five shows, and he hired me after the first night."
Rick Danko,I like a lot of bass players. I like a lot of tuba players too.
Rick Danko,"I grew up not far from where Motown was founded, maybe 300 miles from Detroit and I've always liked - I used to like the way they made records. I still do, I just haven't had a chance to hear as much. They used to entertain me."
Rick Danko,"I am using soybean based ink, which is recyclable."
Rick Danko,"Getting older, I realize I've had a very fortunate life. I've had a budget that's allowed me to do just about any silly little thing the mind could conjure up, and I'm still alive and here."
Rick Danko,"Country artists, I met a lot of them when I was five, six years old. I had an uncle who was a country and western singer and I met Lefty Frizzell when I was five or six years old in those shows that would come through Toronto from Nashville."
Rick Danko,"By doing something positive in this world, you're helping people and the future. We're all trying to help the world... make it a better place to live. We're actually still changing the world, aren't we?"
Rick Danko,Bob wrote the song during The Basement Tapes time period; we put it on Music From Big Pink. Richard did a great job singing it in falsetto.
Rick Danko,As time goes on we get closer to that American Dream of there being a pie cut up and shared. Usually greed and selfishness prevent that and there is always one bad apple in every barrel.
Rick Danko,Also a portion of my sales go directly to Greenpeace.
Rick Danko,"After convincing myself that was maybe you should at least help out your neighborhood, I really started to think about it later on in life."
Georges Danton,At last I perceive that in revolutions the supreme power rests with the most abandoned
Georges Danton,"In order to conquer, what we need is to dare, still to dare, and always to dare."
Georges Danton,The tocsin you hear today is not an alarm but an alert: it sounds the charge against our enemies.
Georges Danton,"To conquer [our enemies] we must dare, and dare again, and dare for ever; and thus will France be saved"
Georges Danton,In revolutions authority remains with the greatest scoundrels.
Mark Dantonio,"Tight end is a strength of this team and should be throughout this year, next year and the year after."
Mark Dantonio,"Dave is an individual I have coached with in the past, and someone who I have the utmost respect for as a coach and as a person. He has a tremendous amount of experience at coaching offense at the Division I level, and has ties to the BIG EAST Conference as a player and a coach."
Mark Dantonio,Today will give us a good opportunity to continue evaluating where we are and how we need to get better.
Mark Dantonio,Tony plays so hard and he is so smart. He is a winner who makes plays and has made himself a starter this spring.
Mark Dantonio,"It was very bad for our players. It had a tremendous impact on the game, huge. We're about to score, then they go 98 yards very quickly and it's 18-7 instead of us leading 14-12. I firmly believe that if we had gotten it in the end zone there it's a football game. I don't know if we would have won, but it's a game. Even at that, we were still in it at halftime. But we weren't the same team in the second half."
Mark Dantonio,He plays consistently. We've got to get all of our football team playing like that.
Mark Dantonio,"You'll probably see him play three positions out there (today). That's something that's a positive for him. He's a football player, we just need to find him a role and allow him to grow into that role."
Mark Dantonio,"I firmly believe if we get that ball in there, it's a football game. I don't know if we were going to win, but it's a football game. ... We weren't the same team in the second half."
Mark Dantonio,"It's not just another game, it's a huge game on our schedule. We'll measure our success as a football team against that game, and we always will."
Mark Dantonio,It was as tough an experience as I've had in coaching. It was one that we will remember.
Mark Dantonio,That's not an excuse. We've got to grow up in a hurry.
Mark Dantonio,"This will be their first game in this type of environment. I'm sure they'll be a little wide-eyed, but hopefully we've learned our lesson in terms of young players and how they prepare."
Mark Dantonio,"I think the defense had a little bit to do with that. When the ball got out in space, they got there quick."
Mark Dantonio,They remind me of our Ohio State defense in 2002. Teams are not going to score on them. They don't give up big plays. They pressure the ball and force turnovers.
Mark Dantonio,"I don't think our confidence was shaken at all, I think we came out in the second half prepared to play."
Mark Dantonio,Our guys have worked hard this spring and we have had good competition at a lot of positions.
Mark Dantonio,"Our guys have worked hard this spring and we have had good competition at a lot of positions. I have been pleased with our effort most of the time, yet I know we need to get better in a lot of areas, too. I am looking forward to who comes out ready to play and compete on Saturday, and who plays with toughness and who plays fast."
Mark Dantonio,"I asked him about that. They wanted to make the commitment to play one or the other. I brought up the basketball issue, but there was no interest in doing that. Right now, from an academic point of view, he needs to concentrate on one sport."
Mark Dantonio,I am very excited about this class because we have guys that can contribute now with the young guys that now have experience after one year under their belt.
Mark Dantonio,It's an extremely great class for us. This year's class builds on our previous two and has established a foundation for us to build championships.
Mark Dantonio,"He has great eye-hand coordination. He's a big-body receiver who also played linebacker. He's just a great athlete, with great running ability after the catch. We're very, very excited to get him."
Mark Dantonio,"He certainly played well in the fall. He's a guy with a lot of ability - a big, strong guy."
Andrew Dantzler,Pluto is a treasure trove of scientific information waiting to be discovered.
Andrew Dantzler,"Certain elements of the design should help piece the science together. We don't know the condition of the collectors that hold the science. We'll be learning that in the hours, days, weeks to come."
Andrew Dantzler,This is first-class science and we'll do everything we can to give it the go-ahead.
Glenn Danzig,"You know I take music seriously, right? So I expect journalists to take being a journalist seriously."
Glenn Danzig,"Yeah, now we publish whenever we feel like it."
Glenn Danzig,"Whether I'm doing music or I'm walking down the street or I'm in a record store buying a record or I walk into a comic store and I'm buying comics or having a drink with my friends, it's the same me."
Glenn Danzig,We've had a lot of agencies try and sabotage our tour.
Glenn Danzig,"We're doing Circle of Snakes, we open up with Skin Carver and we are throwing in Skull Forest later on."
Glenn Danzig,"We still have pretty good sales, especially for the art books."
Glenn Danzig,We probably put about four or five comic books out a year and probably about two or three art books and various trade paperbacks - maybe four or five of those a year - and that's what we do now.
Glenn Danzig,"Until the contract is signed, nothing is real."
Glenn Danzig,"So writing a song is much harder than doing a classical piece for me, because in a classical piece, I can just let the mood dictate what's going to happen."
Glenn Danzig,"OK, so instead of doing it that way and actually maybe being more successful and maybe starting to sell out a little, we put the breaks on."
Glenn Danzig,"Of course, I started really being a comics fan with the underground stuff in the '70s."
Glenn Danzig,"It's not like that anymore really, but back in the day, nobody would let the Misfits open up for them, not the Ramones, not the Cramps, nobody."
Glenn Danzig,I'm just saying that at least for the foreseeable future there won't be any more touring.
Glenn Danzig,I'm also going to direct this movie. It's a turn of the century piece called Ge ROUGE. It's got zombies with some early New Orleans voodoo.
Glenn Danzig,I wish the Libertarian Party would get more play in the media but they don't.
Glenn Danzig,I was bringing my attitude as a regular person 'cause this is my attitude.
Glenn Danzig,"I think the key to being a journalist is getting your subject to feel comfortable enough to talk about stuff they want to talk about and the stuff they like and don't like, and still feel comfortable about it."
Glenn Danzig,I know they are going to be doing a box set in Europe of Danzig 5 and 6 and some other stuff.
Glenn Danzig,I just told you I wasn't a Satanist.
Glenn Danzig,"I got tired of complaining about this or that so I just decided to amass, in my opinion, the best artists and some of the best writers."
Glenn Danzig,"I don't think there's a back lot here in Hollywood anymore that has those streets, like a French Quarter."
Glenn Danzig,Comics wouldn't look the way they do right now - and some of the stories you're seeing - would not be the way they are if it wasn't for us.
Glenn Danzig,"But when you get to a song, not only do you have to do a vocal melody, you have to write words and not be redundant and make some semblance of a story."
Glenn Danzig,"But unfortunately, I have to say, one out of every 100 interviews I do, I get a real journalist."
Glenn Danzig,But the Danzig unreleased stuff will be either a single or a double CD.
Glenn Danzig,"In Japan, they have TV sets in cars right now, where you can punch up traffic routes, weather, everything! You can get Internet access already in cars in Japan, so within the next 2 to 3 years it's gonna be so crazy!"

Pam Danziger,"Spending on a gift typically is directly related to feeling and emotions, ... Why People Buy Things They Don't Need."
Pam Danziger,"What we see with those affluent consumers is they bring their middle-class values into the luxury market, so they're really the middle-class luxury class. They are looking for discounts and sales and they buy the majority of their luxury goods on sales or [at] discount. They have this middle-class orientation and they know how to save money."
Frank Darabont,"Of course, horror/fantasy has always been this disreputable stepchild of literature."
Frank Darabont,"You never know where your best intentions will get derailed, where challenges can defeat you."
Frank Darabont,"He's delighted with it, ... And indeed, I think that for him, this really came from the heart, this piece. So to have it represented well to the movie-going audience was quite a pleasure for him."
Frank Darabont,I really don't think that by the time we're trying to get the audience to see Fahrenheit 451 they're going to be confused with Michael Moore's movie at all.
Frank Darabont,"To me, length is an artificial and arbitrary factor in a film."
Frank Darabont,I think once you've finished a movie you really have to detach from it so that you can come back and watch it as an audience member.
Frank Darabont,I am fascinated with times past.
Frank Darabont,"A director shouldn't get in the way of the movie, the story should."
Frank Darabont,"And I don't think I'm giving away any secrets here, but there are a lot of terrible scripts in this town."
Frank Darabont,Some of us have great original ideas and some of us depend on adaptations.
Frank Darabont,I think a story should take as long to tell as it is appropriate to that particular story.
Frank Darabont,Visual storytelling of one kind or another has been around since cavemen were drawing on the walls.

Christopher Darden,"Whenever I travel around the country, somebody always walks up to me and says, 'Mr. Darden, I've always wanted to meet you to tell you that you were wrong about O.J. Simpson. It was the Mafia ... It was anybody but O.J. Simpson,'"

Clarence Darrow,"I have never killed a man, but I have read many obituaries with great pleasure."
David Darst,"These bonds typically mature in six months or less, so an investor is not putting the principal at much risk."

David Darst,We didn't get the Christmas present of a drop in the oil price.
David Darst,Go in and physically meet your financial source of advice.

Charles Darwin,"The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference."
Charles Darwin,"On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we gain no scientific explanation."
Charles Darwin,Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his means of subsistence.

Charles Darwin,"An American monkey, after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it again, and thus is much wiser than most men."
Charles Darwin,The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us; and I for one must be content to remain an agnostic.
Charles Darwin,A moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions and their motives - of approving of some and disapproving of others.
Charles Darwin,My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts.

Charles Darwin,"We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities... still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."

Charles Darwin,I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars.

Charles Darwin,The very essence of instinct is that it's followed independently of reason.
Charles Darwin,How paramount the future is to the present when one is surrounded by children.

Charles Darwin,"False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness."
Charles Darwin,"It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the 'plan of creation,' 'unity of design,' etc.."
Charles Darwin,The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our thoughts.

Charles Darwin,"A scientific man ought to have no wishes, no affections, - a mere heart of stone."
Tom Daschle,"OK, we'll take the first step. This is as crucial as it gets."
Tom Daschle,"I certainly agree with those who have grown impatient with hair-splitting over legal technicalities, ... There is a basic understanding of the standard of truthfulness that the president failed to meet."
Tom Daschle,"But this is irrational, this is wrong, and I believe the more they use the 'R' word, the more trouble we're going to find ourselves in,"
Tom Daschle,"Whether it's in trade, whether it's in a more permanent presence, whether we can find ways to assist in the Kashmiri dispute, I think that there are ways in which the United States can continue to show its gratitude and to be the player it needs to be in this region and certainly with the government of this country,"
Tom Daschle,"President Bush and I both support a tax cut and I am confident that we can agree on a plan that benefits all Americans, not just the wealthy."

Tom Daschle,"As they contemplate these losses, we wish them great strength, strength in knowing that their loved ones committed themselves to a great cause and in so doing created a path to the future that we will continue to celebrate,"
Tom Daschle,"We're still troubled by the CBO analysis that we're using Social Security trust funds, at least $19 billion,"
Tom Daschle,"We have a real problem with regard to Social Security and Medicare,"
Tom Daschle,"The only thing taken off the table -- I think on a bipartisan basis -- is the utilization of the Social Security trust fund,"
Tom Daschle,"Our goal is to make sure that it's done within the context of fiscal responsibility. We've got to recognize that we didn't get here by accident,"
Tom Daschle,"With great regret, I will pull the bill tomorrow, with the offer that should [Republicans] choose at any time to sit down and to sincerely want to find some solution, I am ready, we are ready and we will do that at a moment's notice,"
Tom Daschle,"I question what purpose is served by additional exposure to the salacious details contained in the Starr report, ... We must find a way to proceed and avoid further bombardment of the airwaves and Internet with such material."
Tom Daschle,"The president and his advisers must accept that continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose,"
Tom Daschle,"I don't see what purpose it serves by attacking one another at this point. If ever there was a time for us to present a unified front to Iraq, this ought to be it."
Tom Daschle,highly respected men determined to cross party lines in order to solve our problems.
Tom Daschle,"So I thank the director of the OMB (Office of Management and Budget) for confirming what we said last spring, but it doesn't make the fact that we were right feel any better."
Tom Daschle,"It's helpful for us, as policymakers, to have as good a clear a view of what living conditions are and what the demographics of our country are in a fast-changing world, ... Whether there are questions which are too invasive, I am not prepared to make that judgment today. I know a lot of people think so."
Tom Daschle,He's been silent on the issue. He's been unengaged and showing absolutely no leadership. And I think it's critical that he do so as we go into the busiest and most troubling time of the year from a price perspective.
Tom Daschle,"It is unfortunate that the Russians knew before the leaders did, ... It's unfortunate that a matter of this import would not have been vetted more carefully or completely and with greater care for U.S. foreign policy than this was."
Tom Daschle,"We don't know yet whether laws were broken, but there must be enforcement of the law and if the laws were broken someone needs to go to jail,"
Tom Daschle,"Why mess with success? If the language worked in the House, you would think it would work here in the Senate as well,"
Tom Daschle,"Economic strength is not measured in profit statements, but in jobs,"
Tom Daschle,"I think it's critical that we offer minimum wage limits to all these jobs,"
Tom Daschle,"It is our intention, of course, to try to do all we can to improve that bill, ... We want to ensure that seniors have access to these drug benefits through Medicare itself. We want to make sure they know what it's going to cost. We want to make sure they know what they can count on with regard to the benefits themselves."
Tom Daschle,"There is still improvement that I think can be made and as long as I think that there is a chance that we could make additional improvements, I want to try to do that. I think it is too early to try to give up on making the effort,"

Tom Daschle,"The most important piece of this package is unemployment and health benefits for unemployed workers, ... Nothing more important."

Tom Daschle,"I hate to say I told you so, but we told you so,"
Tom Daschle,"When you look at what John Edwards has done for working families, for people who have been fighting hard all their lives to make ends meet, I can't think of a more qualified candidate than John Edwards,"
Tom Daschle,"Were it not for the fact that we demonstrated good faith today, we would not be able to demonstrate good faith when challenges and difficult circumstances arise."

Tom Daschle,"Rush Limbaugh and all of the Rush Limbaugh wannabes have a very shrill edge. And that's entertainment. We were told that even people who don't agree with them listen because they're entertaining,"
Tom Daschle,And yet he is now asking for health care for the Iraqi people. He's asking for education for the Iraqi children. He's asking for money for an Iraqi highway bill -- highway construction.
Tom Daschle,"I think it is fair to say that there is a growing number of economists that question the stimulus,"
Tom Daschle,"These are difficult issues, ... Economics has always separated our parties philosophically, and to overcome the philosophical differences is something that we are going to try and do."
Tom Daschle,"If we completed the count, there is little doubt you'd be ahead, ... In order to win, you have to get the votes. We think you've got the votes."
Tom Daschle,"There's no doubt that they are struggling. But there is equally no doubt that working together we can survive this and we can put them and all of them associated with air transportation infrastructure in a position of strength,"
Tom Daschle,"is a loss, without a doubt."
Tom Daschle,"There is no doubt that if we have lost that much money in retirement accounts, we lost that much money in the stock market itself, we could lose similar amounts of money in projected surpluses."
Tom Daschle,"Diversity in education is not a waste of time. It should be a national goal, and it's a goal we're going to keep fighting for."
Tom Daschle,"It's really a repulsive and outrageous attack, once again, on those who question the direction that much of the administration has taken with regard to Iraq,"
Tom Daschle,"Before we make commitments in resources, I think we need to have a clear understanding of what the direction will be,"
Tom Daschle,"There is a desire to keep talking and find a way around this impasse, ... I think the five people in the room all expressed a desire to keep talking, and that is what we're doing."
Tom Daschle,"It is our strong desire to continue a presence here, to recognize that we cannot leave with the job half-done. But we'll determine the role and the degree of presence in the coming weeks and months,"
Tom Daschle,"I asked directly if we could delay this so we could depoliticize it. I said: 'Mr. President, I know this is urgent, but why the rush? Why do we have to do this now?' He looked at Cheney and he looked at me, and there was a half-smile on his face. And he said: 'We just have to do this now.'"
Tom Daschle,a revisit back to the early 1980s -- $3 trillion of debt later.
Tom Daschle,"I think that there is an implication here, as they've done throughout this debate on Iraq, that if you oppose the president, your patriotism ought to be questioned, ... Meet the Press."
Tom Daschle,"Their legislation actually creates a singles penalty that I believe will be the subject of further debate ... their amendment lopsidedly favors those at the very top of the economic scale at the expense of the middle class,"
Tom Daschle,"I think there has to be a debate; there has to be some good discussion, ... There has to be some opportunity for the people to be heard. ... Congress needs to be equal and full partners in this discussion, and ultimately in the decision."
Tom Daschle,indicated that he's not really looking for a victory. He just wanted to have a debate.
Tom Daschle,"We feel very strongly that this wasn't the approach in which we would have chosen to debate this incredibly important issue, ... We are having to deal with very unfair and very unfortunate circumstances, so we will present our case through the amendment process."
Tom Daschle,"There are other ways to spend that money, ... In our view, all of these issues are relevant to the debate on the marriage penalty."
Tom Daschle,"Instead of finding a real solution to the growing unemployment crisis, this bill will give millions to those who don't need it and very little to those who do, ... It will add a trillion dollars to our national debt; spend the Social Security trust fund and ultimately lose more jobs."
Tom Daschle,"Our view is that there has to be some way ... to deal with this matter beyond the question of conviction, and we think censure presents that opportunity and we will be planning to propose that at some point,"
Tom Daschle,[Thune told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he] had a very gracious conversation ... offered his congratulations and his assistance.
Tom Daschle,"I'm concerned about international developments that may or may not legitimately have any effect on the consequences of this legislation,"
Tom Daschle,Congress supported the experiment. It was a huge mistake. Deficits skyrocketed. The national debt quadrupled. High interest rates choked American industries. Unemployment soared.
Tom Daschle,The Congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.
Tom Daschle,"Some people say it will take another miracle for this Congress and administration to find a way to work together. As we begin this historic Congress, let us resolve that we will work in good faith with each other to do the people's business. That is our pledge from this side of the aisle,"
Tom Daschle,"I think that it's so critical when you make a request to the Congress to authorize and appropriate $38 billion for homeland security, somebody ought to come up and explain just how you're going to spend it, ... Those issues are going unanswered in large measure because Mr. Ridge refuses to testify. We just have to find a way hopefully without the use of coercion to have those questions answered for the record."
Tom Daschle,ram through divisive provisions and pork spending that could never win the support of Congress on their own.
Tom Daschle,"I think [the Treasury Department report] undermines the credibility of every witness that will be coming before the Congress this week, ... If we've had the kind of sensationalism and erroneous data provided to the committee in the past, it's very likely it'll happen again."
Tom Daschle,"This is a Congress that is much more interested in investigating than legislating,"
Tom Daschle,"There really is no more important issue Congress should be working on this year, and in this time of unprecedented economic growth there is no reason why we shouldn't be,"
Tom Daschle,"We have come up with a delicate, but yes, successful compromise. There is no question all 100 of us could go through this bill with a fine-tooth comb and cherry pick and find improvements... we've got a job to do, the clock is ticking and the work needs to get done."
Tom Daschle,"There is absolutely no room for compromise on that tax cut,"
Tom Daschle,"The new compromise appears to have the votes, so we will vote on it,"
Tom Daschle,"By choosing to oppose the University of Michigan, President Bush called into question his commitment to expanding opportunity for African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students,"
Tom Daschle,Let us respond with the same commitment and resolve in this drought as we would with any other natural disaster.
Tom Daschle,"Instead of passing another big tax cut that we can't afford -- a tax cut that leaves out middle-class families -- we need a fair, responsible tax cut,"
Tom Daschle,"I think Janet Reno deserves commendation, not criticism. She has done an extraordinary job under very, very difficult circumstances, and she deserves our support, and she deserves every bit of the benefit of the doubt here until all the facts are known,"
Tom Daschle,"I know how profoundly concerned [local officials] are to be able to respond to whatever comes in whatever circumstances,"
Tom Daschle,the best we can get under these circumstances.
Tom Daschle,"given the circumstances, the environment, the sense that we were responding to 9/11, and all of the urgency that was created by the rhetoric and cajoling of the administration."
Tom Daschle,"We have no choice but to revisit the question on other bills. Especially given the relationship between guns and schools these days, I think it's a natural assumption that one could make that there could be some amendments which will be offered,"
Tom Daschle,"The president told me about it, and I agree, ... It's unfortunate, but there's no choice. Some people just can't resist talking."
Tom Daschle,"Our tax cut has to fit in within a responsible budget,"
Tom Daschle,"We are awed by their sacrifice and their bravery, and we want them and their families to know that they have the profound respect and gratitude of every American,"
Tom Daschle,"There is no erosion of that support, ... There is extraordinary belief that the vice president and Senator Lieberman have conducted themselves in a way that makes us very proud."
Tom Daschle,"Their plan leaves nothing for Medicare -- not one penny. It explodes in costs just as the Baby Boomers start to retire and Medicare and Social Security come under pressure. It fails to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pay down our debt, to prepare for this coming demographic tidal wave,"
Tom Daschle,"I support the president's authority to make decisions with regard to clemency and pardons. That is a president's right, ... But I must say I am troubled deeply by the lack of remorse, the lack of empathy for the victims on the part of the Puerto Ricans themselves. And based upon that, I intend to vote in favor of the resolution."
Tom Daschle,"If the stories in the media over the past week are accurate, the president has exercised authority that I do not believe is granted to him in the Constitution, and that I know is not granted to him in the law that I helped negotiate with his counsel and that Congress approved in the days after September 11."
Tom Daschle,"This last-minute change would have given the president broad authority to exercise expansive powers not just overseas -- where we all understood he wanted authority to act -- but right here in the United States, potentially against American citizens."
Tom Daschle,to restore his credibility and authority.
Tom Daschle,"what I think they truly are, harsh and right-wing, with absolutely no indication for an appreciation for compassion."
Tom Daschle,a world opinion that now holds America in lower esteem than ever before.
Tom Daschle,"His words were offensive to those who believe in freedom and equality in America,"
Tom Daschle,"America can't afford to keep rewarding the accumulation of wealth over the dignity of work, ... Instead of borrowing even more money to give more tax breaks to companies so that they can export even more jobs, we propose tax cuts and policies that will strengthen our manufacturing sector and create good jobs at good wages here at home."
Tom Daschle,"America can't afford to keep rewarding the accumulation of wealth over the dignity of work,"
Tom Daschle,"[Only] when America is secure at home and our strength abroad is respected and not resented, only then will we have a union as strong as the American people,"
Tom Daschle,"We are going to have to keep the effort to find some mutual agreement at a later date. We're not going to do that today, ... We certainly have to work to extend unemployment benefits."
Tom Daschle,"reasonably optimistic that we can come up with a procedural agreement, certainly in the next 24 hours."
Tom Daschle,I would advise them not to skip anything at this point. They're legally bound to fill out the forms and I think it would be very precarious for anyone to choose to comply or not to comply.
Tom Daschle,"We have an anticipated debt of $400 billion this year, and that's before the first dollar in whatever military action may be required will be expended, ... Without a question, this will exacerbate the debt and complicate our fiscal circumstances beyond anything, I would say, in history."
Tom Daschle,I think it would be premature to consider any other action in Iraq.
Tom Daschle,"Taking the action that the president is being asked to do is the only way that I see that we're going to save the steel industry, ... I don't think [Bush] has any choice ... He's got to do it."
Tom Daschle,"It would not be my assumption that the military course is the only action available to (the president) today,"
Tom Daschle,"On September 14th, we voted unanimously to send our troops into action against the perpetrators of the cowardly and heinous attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. That was our constitutional duty, and it is one that none of us takes lightly,"
Tom Daschle,"I would give this Congress a B for achievement, a D for behavior and the overall assessment of incomplete,"
Ram Dass,"I used to have a sign over my computer that read OLD DOGS CAN LEARN NEW TRICKS, but lately I sometimes ask myself how many more new tricks I want to learn. Wouldnt it be easier just to be outdated?"
Ram Dass,"[Yes. In the 60's, there was a famous slogan,] Be Here Now, ... Be Somewhere Else Now."
Ram Dass,"I used to have a sign over my computer that read OLD DOGS CAN LEARN NEW TRICKS, but lately I sometimes ask myself how many more new tricks I want to learn. Wouldnâ€™t it be easier just to be outdated?"
Ram Dass,"If you think you're free, there's no escape possible."
Ram Dass,"When you are already in Detroit, you don't have to take a bus to get there."
Ram Dass,Only that in you which is me can hear what I'm saying.
Ram Dass,Inspiration is God making contact with itself.
Ram Dass,"It is important to expect nothing, to take every experience, including the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed."
Ram Dass,Your problem is you're... too busy holding onto your unworthiness.
Duffy Daugherty,My only feeling about superstition is that it's unlucky to be behind at the end of the game.
Duffy Daugherty,"Football isn't a contact sport, it's a collision sport. Dancing is a contact sport."
Duffy Daugherty,"I could have been a Rhodes Scholar, except for my grades."
Larry David,"If they were pictures of the Yankees of the past 50 years, I'd do just as well."
Larry David,People have often wondered how they'd feel if they were adopted. I think it's funny.
Larry David,I aspire to be like that character. He's honest. It's the things I'm thinking but not saying.
Bill Davidson,"This is his first true look at tailback, ... We ran him some at split back earlier in the season. Unfortunately a couple of times that we fumbled the ball, we had his number called."
Bill Davidson,"I hope we have a big crowd, ... It's the home opener. There's been some talk going on about us playing Brookhaven. How many times do you get to see a team that's won a state championship?"
Bill Davidson,"We all had immediate love for the company, growing up in the family. The conversations during Christmas and Thanksgiving and at the family get-togethers were all around Harley-Davidson, and at a very young age we were always a part of those conversations. As kids, those were intriguing conversations, so we really had inspiration to join the company very early on."
Bill Davidson,The kids have overcome a huge batch of adversity the last two weeks. I thought they played very hard tonight. A couple plays made a big difference in the football game.
Jim Davidson,I am consistently impressed by this group of women.
Jim Davidson,"These are significant events, major bills introduced and hearings. Unless senators and representatives hear from you and hear how important protection of advertising is, we're not going to win these battles."
Jim Davidson,We want to encourage  all children to have lessons and I hope there will be a time when  every child is able to swim. I think Â£2.60 is cheap at the  price.
Jim Davidson,I do feel like we're getting to the same level that we've enjoyed with the boys as far as that group being able replace the graduating players. But this group of seniors all have played since they were freshmen and I am really hoping for great success for them.
John Davidson,"The PPI numbers look pretty good. I think the important thing to look at is when this thing turns around, and I don't know that we yet have a clear picture that we definitely are in a slowdown mode, although there are some signs that we have slowed down, which sectors are likely to do well. And I think the important thing, if you look past the last two weeks, is that there is really a resurgence of the leadership of technology and biotechnology,"
John Davidson,"When I went to Broadway in the mid-sixties, everybody was trying to emulate Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and here I was kind of the wholesome 'All-American Boy' from the mid-west with the big toothy smile; so I kind of stood out - a rare kind of a thing for that kind of venue."
John Davidson,"I think it's good even to stay invested. We tend to like technology. But if you like technology, you're going to have lots of volatility because that sector is much more volatile than the other sectors. If you don't like the volatility, then it's good probably to balance that with something else, some other sector."
John Davidson,"I think the market is waffling at this point, ... Yesterday, everybody heard what they wanted from Greenspan's speech and you saw a big run up. I think that today there's a little bit of exhaustion from that."
John Davidson,"We like Sun. It's another gorilla in the space. And I think Sun has been very affective in moving to other areas including storage, which I think is one of the themes that we have in our technology fund."
John Davidson,"I think the most significant report for the whole week is the retail sales number tomorrow. You saw the bond market react today in expectation of a strong retail sales report, and I think people will be focused on that tomorrow."
John Davidson,"I think investors need to invest. I think the risk of being out of the market and missing the upturn is important. As we go down the road, I think we're going to get further increases. I don't think you should be investing next week's rent check. But I think your long term investment is going to really grow in the market and technology will lead that."
John Davidson,With thirty bob a week to keep a bride / He fell in love and married in his teens: / At thirty bob he stuck; but he knows it isn't luck: / He knows the seas are deeper than tureens.
John Davidson,"The capacity utilization and industrial production number are forecast to show modest improvement, the housing number won't be as strong as it has been, but it'll still be strong. However, none of these data due tomorrow are really market-moving. I think stocks may be set to drift the rest of this week and into the close of the year."
John Davidson,"We had a run on the gold last year, late last year, and I think there may be some short-term plays there,"
John Davidson,"When you're on the wrong side of the ledger column like that, it's just fate. It's unexplainable."
John Davidson,"I think people are looking beyond the unemployment report and into the future, ... The current economic environment is certainly weak, but maybe there's the assumption that it will get better."
John Davidson,"In this environment, people seem to have gravitated toward natural resources, utilities and materials and away from technology."
John Davidson,"Greenspan talked very little about the current state of the economy and was really admonishing lawmakers, and he made it very clear that there will be no interest-rate cut announced after the meeting on Sept. 24. I think this may have disappointed some investors hoping for a rate cut or something more aggressive to help stocks."
John Davidson,"You've seen how OPEC has had some discipline, and that's helped to support the price of oil, and maybe the gold players are seeing that if they use some discipline as well that that may also affect the gold price and their business."
John Davidson,"The market has now fully reflected its belief in a second-half pick up, but for the kind of rally we've seen to continue, you're going to need to start seeing evidence. The weekly jobless claims number this morning is a start, but it's not enough. We could be bouncing around in the next few weeks."
John Davidson,"Physical activity can get you going when you are immobilized. Get action in your life, and don't just talk about it. Get into the arena!"
John Davidson,"I don't know why people are so surprised by my live performances. My approach is so simple; every song I sing, every story I tell, every move I make, must move the audience to laughter, tears or inspiration. Otherwise, why should I do it?"
Peter Davidson,Are we going to dream up all the problems that might happen and regulate in advance of that or are we going to see if the problem does arise? You can quickly do something that addresses a problem that's real.
Peter Davidson,Are you going to dream up all of the problems that might happen out there and regulate in advance of that? Our approach would be that there would be a commitment [providers] would follow.
Peter Davidson,Captaris widened its lead in 2004 in large part because of its strategy to add workflow and document management products to its RightFax fax server. Captaris is embarking on a future where it sells complete solutions to business entities that solve all their paper problems.
Robert Davidson,"As the dot-com economy collapsed and the Nisqually earthquake occurred, it became clear to people that projects of that scale were not realistic."
Robert Davidson,"I have to give to the community, everybody really stepped up. Everything went real well and we already know some things that we need to sit down and talk about if this happens again."
Robert Davidson,"[The team found large groups gathered in churches and multi-story school buildings. They came across about 60 deaf children huddled inside a school for the deaf with only two adults watching over them.] They were terrified and couldn't communicate with us, ... They were scared at first to get on the boats. They didn't know who we were or where we were going to take them."
Michael Davies,"We gave away a $5,200 toilet. It's just the most fantastic toilet you could ever imagine. It has an infrared signal. It has hoses and vacuums and all kinds of implements that attend to every possible need."
Michael Davies,"It's been this wonderful kind of unifying factor, ... They're just really proud to represent their towns on television."
Michael Davies,There's a freight shortage at the moment. They're going to struggle getting a lot of it over there.
Michael Davies,And he's funny. He's disarmingly funny.
Peter Davies,"Relevance to Alzheimer's? I don't know, ... It's a nice piece of work in the snail model, but any possible link to Alzheimer's is currently obscure."
Peter Davies,Motivation is like food for the brain. You cannot get enough in one sitting. It needs continual and regular top up s.
Peter Davies,Motivation is like food for the brain. You cannot get enough in one sitting. It needs continual and regular top ups.
Peter Davies,We use their affinity for ice as a tool to purify the protein.
Ray Davies,"People take pictures of the Summer, Just in case someone thought they had missed it, And to proved that it really existed"
Ray Davies,"Money and Corruption Are ruining the land Crooked politicians Betray the working man, Pocketing the profits And treating us like sheep, And we're tired of hearing promises That we know they'll never keep"
Ray Davies,"When you are making a record and if you spend too much time over it, you have to record it a tone lower or cut the tones lower because you can't reach some of the notes, I find this. But when you go on stage, you have to put the key up and it really changes the whole thing."
Ray Davies,"When I wrote the song, I had the sea near Bombay in mind. We stayed at a hotel by the sea, and the fishermen come up at five in the morning and they were all chanting. And we went on the beach and we got chased by a mad dog - big as a donkey."
Ray Davies,"What you are saying too, is that it's not only what other people are doing, it's what I'm doing, what I'm feeling. It's a little bit selfish as well."
Ray Davies,"What I try to do probably doesn't come out. What I've worked out what I do - I might not be right - is to do something very personal, and then suddenly I look at it, up in the air. I blow it up and look at it and then I come down again - a better man."
Ray Davies,"Those three chords were part of my life - G, F, Bb - yeh, it is, it is, and I can't help noticing it. But there have been other things nearly as close to it which people haven't noticed, other things we have done."
Ray Davies,"Then I got together with my brother and a friend and we decided to play dates. The more we played, the more we wanted to do it. And it got to a stage where we wanted to do it all the time."
Ray Davies,"People take pictures of the Summer, just in case someone thought they had missed it, and to proved that it really existed."
Ray Davies,"Our repertoire consisted of rhythm and blues, sort of country rhythm and blues, Sonny Terry things."
Ray Davies,"No one can penetrate me. They only see what's in their own fancy, always."
Ray Davies,"Money and corruption are ruining the land, crooked politicians betray the working man, pocketing the profits and treating us like sheep, and we're tired of hearing promises that we know they'll never keep."
Ray Davies,"If I had to do my life over, I would change every single thing I have done."
Ray Davies,I'm susceptible to that sort of thing - to walls and flowers. You can probably get something more from a wall than a person sometimes. It's just put somewhere.
Ray Davies,"I'm easy driving, But I'm not a person who loves living pleasantly above all else. I'm not that way at all. I might think I'm that, but I'm not really that."
Ray Davies,"I was an art student at the time, like thousands of others."
Ray Davies,I think that songwriting changed when groups started spending more time in the studio.
Ray Davies,"I still like to keep tapes of the few minutes before the final take, things that happen before the session. Maybe it's superstitious, but I believe if I had done things differently - if I had walked around the studio or gone out - it wouldn't have turned out that way."
Ray Davies,"I like surfers. Their imagery, it's great."
Ray Davies,I got that idea from being in India. I always like the chanting.
Ray Davies,I don't think England is that gray but India is like a long drone.
Ray Davies,"At one time they've been the most important thing to me. So I can't hear our records on the radio, I can't stand it, because they sound so out of what everyone else is doing."
Ray Davies,"If New Orleans is allowed to die, a crucial part of the world's music heritage will disappear."
Ray Davies,"I've written so many songs about Englishmen, I have to go elsewhere."
Robertson Davies,"I think of an author as somebody who goes into the marketplace and puts down his rug and says, ''I will tell you a story,'' and then he passes the hat."
Robertson Davies,"It isn't everybody who is the hero of his own romance, and when we meet one he is likely to be a fascinating monster"
Robertson Davies,One of the most difficult tasks for the educated and sophisticated mind is to recognize that some clichÃ©s are also important truths
Robertson Davies,The love of truth lies at the root of much humor
Robertson Davies,"Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness."
Robertson Davies,"The world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is, in fact a return to the idealized past"
Robertson Davies,The people who fear humor - and there are many -are suspicious of its power to present things in unexpected lights to question received opinions and to suggest unforeseen possibilities
Robertson Davies,The eyes see only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.
Robertson Davies,In my experience tact is usually worse than the brutalities of truth
Robertson Davies,"For I was a collaborator with Destiny, not one who put a pistol to its head and demanded particular treasures"
Robertson Davies,"Too much traffic with a quotation book begets a conviction of ignorance in a sensitive reader. Not only is there a mass of quotable stuff he never quotes, but an even vaster realm of which he has never heard."
Robertson Davies,"If we seek the pleasures of love, passion should be occasional and common sense continual."
Robertson Davies,"The quality of what is said inevitably influences the way in which it is said, however inexperienced the writer."
Robertson Davies,Extraordinary people survive under the most terrible circumstances and they become more extraordinary because of it.
Robertson Davies,Few people can see genius in someone who has offended them.
Robertson Davies,I do not 'get' ideas; ideas get me.
Robertson Davies,Nothing is so easy to fake as the inner vision.
Robertson Davies,Only a fool expects to be happy all the time.
Robertson Davies,What we call luck is the inner man externalized. We make things happen to us.
Robertson Davies,Canada is not really a place where you are encouraged to have large spiritual adventures.
Robertson Davies,I heard his library burned down and both books were destroyed - and one of them hadn't even been colored in yet.
Robertson Davies,"The great book for you is the book that has the most to say to you at the moment when you are reading. I do not mean the book that is most instructive, but the book that feeds your spirit. And that depends on your age, your experience, your psychological and spiritual need."
Robertson Davies,To be a book-collector is to combine the worst characteristics of a dope fiend with those of a miser.
Robertson Davies,"The people who are always monkeying with these great books to make them fully (comprehensible) have no friend in me, for in their realm the fully comprehensible is not worth comprehending"
Robertson Davies,"If I had my way books would not be written in English, but in an exceedingly difficult secret language that only skilled professional readers and story-tellers could interpret. Then people like you would have to go to public halls and pay good prices to hear the professionals decode and read the books aloud for you. This plan would have the advantage of scaring off all amateur authors, retired politicians, country doctors and I-Married-a-Midget writers who would not have the patience to learn the secret language."
Robertson Davies,I never heard of anyone who was really literate or who ever really loved books who wanted to suppress any of them.
Robertson Davies,Female beauty is an important Minor Sacrament which cannot be received too often; I am not at all sure that neglect of it does not constitute a sin of some kind
Robertson Davies,"Authors like cats because they are such quiet, lovable, wise creatures, and cats like authors for the same reasons"
Robertson Davies,"A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight."
Robertson Davies,Students today are a pretty solemn lot. One of the really notable achievements of the twentieth century has been to make the young old before their time.
Steve Davies,Given the risks involved it is difficult to see why the shares should trade at a higher multiple than this.
Steve Davies,It was a standout performance if I ever saw one.
Steve Davies,They're still outperforming everyone in the food sector and most in the non- food as well.
William Davies,"I turned my head and saw the wind, Not far from where I stood, Dragging the corn by her golden hair, Into a dark and lonely wood."
William Davies,Teetotallers lack the sympathy and generosity of men that drink.
William Davies,"And though I'm sure I see those eyes, I'm not so sure a body's there!"
William Davies,"It was the Rainbow gave thee birth, / And left thee all her lovely hues."
William Davies,As long as I love Beauty I am young.
William Davies,"Good morning, Life -- and allThings glad and beautiful."
Nicolas Davila,"The genuine coherence of our ideas does not come from the reasoning that ties them together, but from the spiritual impulse that gives rise to them."
Nicolas Davila,An ideal society would be the graveyard of human greatness.
Nicolas Davila,"The Biblical prophet doesn't predict the future, but bears witness to the presense of God in history."
Nicolas Davila,Total freedom of expression does not compensate for lack of talent.
Nicolas Davila,Violence is not necessary to destroy a civilization. Each civilization dies from indifference to the unique values which created it.
Nicolas Davila,"Modern man does not love, but seeks refuge in love; does not hope, but seeks refuge in hope; does not believe but seeks refuge in dogma."
Nicolas Davila,"In an age in which the media broadcast countless pieces of foolishness, the educated man is defined not by what he knows, but by what he doesn't know."
Adelle Davis,Nutrition . . . has been kicked around like a puppy that cannot take care of itself. Food faddists and crackpots have kicked it pretty cruelly . . .
Adelle Davis,Thousands upon thousands of persons have studied disease. Almost no one has studied health.
Adelle Davis,"If this country is to survive, the best-fed-nation myth had better be recognized for what it is:  propaganda designed to produce wealth but not health"
Al Davis,"In Texarkana, school integration was approached quietly, because they didn't want to have the problems like those taking place in Little Rock. That didn't mean there weren't problems. In Little Rock, with the integration of Central High, that didn't happen quietly, so here they tried to avoid those problems. I was at Grambling at the time, and we were doing things for the civil rights movement there. We were hitting the streets like a lot of colleges did, so we started going to other campuses and other cities."
Al Davis,"You have to win and you have to win with a vision for the Super Bowl. That's our passion here. I just didn't feel the fit was right, and I think he agreed with me."
Al Davis,"I don't think Sean Payton turned down the job because Sean Payton was never offered the job. Sean Payton has a lot of good credentials, but I don't know if that's the direction we're going."
Al Davis,"I saw greatness in John and he lived up to it. I also saw a tremendous competitor who loved to win. John is a standard bearer, someone that players, coaches, fans and the Raider Nation can all look up to. One of his great virtues, the fire that burned brightest in him, was his love and passion for football, which was seldom ever equaled."
Al Davis,"We must run the ball better. It's unbelievable. I thought one of our standards of gold this year would be our offensive line. We have some bright young players there. And we never did get the toughness, or what I would call the power running, that I thought we were going to get."
Al Davis,I have never forgiven myself ... that I might have made a mistake.
Al Davis,"We've gotta run that football better, we've gotta run it tougher, and people have to understand that they're gonna get knocked. Not what we call zone blocking."
Al Davis,We've got to run the football better. We've got to run it with toughness. This guy (Shell) knows what I'm talking about.
Al Davis,No one could have brought in more personnel than we have to build a football team.
Al Davis,"Mike has always been of interest because he is dynamic, he is not afraid. But there is a fear right there of the physical. I don't know if we are ready to accept that."
Al Davis,It's time John took his rightful place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He certainly brings an excellence to it that no one can deny. I saw greatness in him and he lived up to it.
Al Davis,"There were plenty of role models for us. My mother believed in education and she put all three of us through college at Grambling. She did not have a high school education, but it was something she impressed upon us. After I graduated, I left Texarkana for California, because I knew I could not get a job here. I was in business with certification and accounting, so I figured it was best to go out West. So I went there. It was still tough to get in that field, but things opened up for me."
Al Davis,This organization's not going to turn back. We're going to find a way. I'd like my next head coach to be winning-oriented. I want the right guy.
Al Davis,You don't adjust. You just dominate.
Al Davis,Why should I talk to you? I don't know where you're from.
Al Davis,"Wake up, Carolee, the plane is waiting for us, we have to get to the game."
Al Davis,"Of the three Super Bowls that we won, he was the starting left end. I've had so many great players, but Jerry ranks among the great players."
Al Davis,Jerry Rice made the decision and we honestly tried to accommodate him the best way we can.
Al Davis,"Approximately four years ago, we were told that Jerry Rice would be a free agent and there were people who felt that he no longer could contribute."
Al Davis,"Once a Raider, always a Raider."
Al Davis,"Bill was a great friend, a brilliant performer and an exceptional man. I say this with great admiration and love that Bill becomes one of the people that I give the cloak of immortality. Time never stops for the great ones."
Angela Davis,This is the sports she enjoys the most. She gets so excited about it.
Angela Davis,"These are the rules for the mullet hunt,"
Angela Davis,"We've had a lot of parents ask questions about the program,"
Angela Davis,To understand how any society functions you must understand the relationship between the men and the women
Angela Davis,"You can never stop and as older people, we have to learn how to take leadership from the youth and I guess I would say that this is what I'm attempting to do right now."
Angela Davis,"Well, we see an increasingly weaker labor movement as a result of the overall assault on the labor movement and as a result of the globalization of capital."
Angela Davis,Well of course there's been a great deal of progress over the last 40 years. We don't have laws that segregate black people within the society any longer.
Angela Davis,"Racism, in the first place, is a weapon used by the wealthy to increase the profits they bring in by paying Black workers less for their work."
Angela Davis,"When Bush says democracy, I often wonder what he's referring to."
Angela Davis,We have to talk about liberating minds as well as liberating society.
Angela Davis,Radical simply means grasping things at the root.
Angela Davis,"Racism is a much more clandestine, much more hidden kind of phenomenon, but at the same time it's perhaps far more terrible than it's ever been."
Angela Davis,I decided to teach because I think that any person who studies philosophy has to be involved actively.
Angela Davis,And I guess what I would say is that we can't think narrowly about movements for black liberation and we can't necessarily see this class division as simply a product or a certain strategy that black movements have developed for liberation.
Angela Davis,That's true but I think the contemporary problem that we are facing increasing numbers of black people and other people of color being thrown into a status that involves work in alternative economies and increasing numbers of people who are incarcerated.
Angela Davis,"Now, if we look at the way in which the labor movement itself has evolved over the last couple of decades, we see increasing numbers of black people who are in the leadership of the labor movement and this is true today."
Angela Davis,"Jails and prisons are designed to break human beings, to convert the population into specimens in a zoo - obedient to our keepers, but dangerous to each other."
Angela Davis,I think the importance of doing activist work is precisely because it allows you to give back and to consider yourself not as a single individual who may have achieved whatever but to be a part of an ongoing historical movement.
Angela Davis,I think that has to do with my awareness that in a sense we all have a certain measure of responsibility to those who have made it possible for us to take advantage of the opportunities.
Angela Davis,"First of all, I didn't suggest that we should simply get rid of all prisons."
Angela Davis,But at the same time you can't assume that making a difference 20 years ago is going to allow you to sort of live on the laurels of those victories for the rest of your life.
Angela Davis,To understand how any society functions you must understand the relationship between the men and the women.
Bryan Davis,This is our third league game decided on penalty kicks or controversial calls. But we have to take some responsibility.
Bryan Davis,"When you play a team as good as Carver, you can't afford mistakes and slip-ups. They make you pay."
Bryan Davis,"Ben kept us in it in the first half. He was really on fire, ... We controlled the second half, but we couldn't finish. We had at least four breakaways,                                                                                                                         with nothing to show for it."
Bryan Davis,"Fantasy stories open our eyes to an unseen world and train our minds to see beyond the visible. In the New Testament context, this is where our real battles are fought. Good fantasy will reveal the hidden powers of evil that threaten the hero's life and upset his journey. Good fantasy focuses on how a hero finds victory when he learns that he can't win by himself, so he submits to the higher power in faith and obedience."
Bryan Davis,I am close to the village so there will be lots of eyes on it.
Bryan Davis,"Every time a curtain rises, so does the quality of our lives."
Bryan Davis,"I believe God has instilled in us a craving, a deep desire to run with Him on a fantastic adventure, yet many of us crawl along in life without even a glimpse of our hidden passion. There has to be a reason for living. There must be a Camelot, a hidden Utopia where we can rest from our personal campaigns. Fantasy opens our eyes to a better place, a shining city we do not yet know. And these stories provide a mental bridge to that city as we pursue horizons we could never distinguish with our physical eyes."
Butch Davis,The trade isn't going to be the problem. Negotiating the contract will be.
Butch Davis,"I know people were sad, angry and they were upset. But this was a great opportunity. An opportunity of a lifetime."
Butch Davis,I think he just said what was on his mind.
Butch Davis,"Good riddance, man,'' said a Browns player."
Butch Davis,"When friends would call and say something about this job or that job, I told them, 'The answer is the same as it was three weeks ago, two weeks ago: I am not coaching [elsewhere] next season.'"
Butch Davis,The biggest win you have to win is the locker room. ... And it's very difficult when you inherit a football team - you go someplace and all of a sudden these guys have got seven-year contracts and the coaches have got three.
Butch Davis,"We understand that Butch Davis inherited an awful football team with virtually no talent. However, why do you keep defending the man (and his talent evaluation skills) when he clearly had awful drafts for the Browns?"
Butch Davis,[From 370-pound Texas offensive tackle Leonard] Big ... They don't have any reason to fear me. I'm a nice guy.
Butch Davis,It's a great place. I've got family and friends - but it's a difficult thing. It's unfortunate that Houston's going through a tough time and I wish him the best and want him to win this weekend.
Butch Davis,"In college, there are two or three Saturdays that you can just show up, whether it's Florida playing Vanderbilt or Miami playing Rutgers, and you're going to win. Sundays in this league are like playing Florida and Florida State every week. A two-and-seven team can be as good as anybody you'll play."
Butch Davis,"I think in time, I hope those people in retrospect will look back and see how much adversity we overcame, ... With the exception of SMU [which had its football program suspended for NCAA violations], I don't know many programs that overcame more than we did."
Butch Davis,"I think in time, I hope those people in retrospect will look back and see how much adversity we overcame. With the exception of SMU [which had its football program suspended for NCAA violations], I don't know many programs that overcame more than we did."
Clive Davis,You've got to seize the opportunity if it is presented to you.
Clive Davis,"[BMG North America chairman/CEO Clive Davis says the delay in launching US, which was first announced in 2002, attests to Usher's high standards:] His priorities were finding the right artists, ... and then waiting until he strongly believed they were ready."
Clive Davis,"Unplugged debuting at number one is yet another amazing milestone achievement for Alicia,"
Clive Davis,"Unplugged debuting at number one is yet another amazing milestone achievement for Alicia, ... That makes it three in a row -- three out of three. You just can't beat that! What makes it extra special is the live format of Unplugged for the true musician -- the public really has to be passionate about the artist and the music to buy the album in these numbers."
Dwight Davis,"They're taking a more intimate role, and not depending solely on partners to give that support. It is a response to backlash from customers who wanted Microsoft to have more of a role there, to stand as the ultimate backstop for support."
Dwight Davis,"Telcos and network service providers, ASPs and ISPs, have all been growing as important players in the distribution of software functionality. With Windows 2000, Microsoft clearly thinks it has a much better horse to ride into battle to get these folks as customers. They will emphasize the new ASP channel as one they are especially targeting in that regard. They need a platform that actually runs 24 hours a day, and on bigger hardware configurations."
Dwight Davis,"The basic model of selling software as a hosted service has finally started to get some traction,"
Dwight Davis,"This is just one step closer to reality. Now they've taken it a step further by specifying the services they are going to offer. It's nice that it sort of puts meat on the bones for .NET, but it's still at the vaporware stage. The bulk of the suite is still far from beta (test version)."

It's nice that it sort of puts meat on the bones for .NET, but it's still at the vaporware stage. The bulk of the suite is still far from beta (test version)."
Dwight Davis,"Linux has been somewhat suspect in performance compared to NT 4.0, and if Windows 2000 raises the bar, it raises the bar above where Linux is competing. On the other hand, there's no stopping Linux being the key alternative to Windows 2000 for as far as we can see."
Dwight Davis,"This makes me wonder about the prognosis for Alpha. At Compaq there has been major management shakeups, and this could be something that's fallen by the wayside. It's a very expensive venture and maybe hasn't generated the kind of return Compaq would like to see on it."
Dwight Davis,The whole purpose is to be sure that we're really testing the students knowledge and we want to make sure the computer doesn't serve as an interface.
Dwight Davis,"It comes out at sort of this strange time in the company's product evolution, the last gasp of the DOS line and Windows 98."
Dwight Davis,It does a very hard thing: it makes Microsoft a sympathetic character.
Elmer Davis,"This nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the principle - among others - that honest men may honestly disagree; that if they all say what they think, a majority of the people will be able to distinguish truth from error"
Elmer Davis,"This year [1930], when we all needed something to take our minds off our troubles, miniature golf did it . . . . If we cannot find bread, we are satisfied with the circus."
Elmer Davis,This republic was not established by cowards; and cowards will not preserve it.
Elmer Davis,"The first and great commandment is, don't let them scare you."
Elmer Davis,One of the things that is wrong with America is that everybody who has done anything at all in his own field is expected to be an authority on every subject under the sun.
Elmer Davis,"This nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the principle - among others - that honest men may honestly disagree; that if they all say what they think, a majority of the people will be able to distinguish truth from error."
Elmer Davis,"When a middle-aged man says in a moment of weariness that he is half dead, he is telling the literal truth."
Elmer Davis,This nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.
Elmer Davis,This will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.
Eric Davis,The kids can see that hard work is paying off. They didn't care what people in other towns thought. They believed in the 12 guys in the locker room.
Eric Davis,"In a way it was heartbreaking, but I talked to my Dad (Steve) and he talked me through it. I left it all on the mat. I did my best. He just wrestled a better match tonight. Now I will do the best I can to go out with a win."
Eric Davis,"If you're feeling pressure, then you shouldn't be here."
Glen Davis,He's relentless on the boards and he has a high level of potential.
Glen Davis,"My heart is on the court,"
Glen Davis,"The road to the Final Four was a great experience, and I grew up tremendously experiencing that environment and the people I met. As a team we shared the feeling of being there, and playing that last game was a terrible taste in your mouth that you would never forget. Losing like that in that way is going to affect you, and me being the guy that I am - a competitor - you always want to leave out on top. That altered my decision a lot. Because not only do I want to be the best player, but I also want to win. Being there and not winning was a disappointment, and that made me want to come to back."
Glen Davis,"I feel real light, mobile and agile. I feel I can run longer. My endurance is up."
Glen Davis,"I was analyzing the guys' nonverbal communication. I learned that in sociology. When I see that, when I see fatigue, some negative things, you've got to go straight at them."
Glen Davis,"I never saw this type of game coming, especially (with) the kind of team we are, the kind of character we have. They came out and they just punched us. We didn't recover from it."
Glen Davis,He gave advice to not follow in his footsteps. He had a lot to do with me making my decision.
Glenn Davis,I thought our kids kept fighting and I think our size up front kind of wore on them. I think us going no huddle was something that they didn't expect too much. We hadn't done too much of it in the past but it's something we're doing this year and we tried to give them something they hadn't seen.
Glenn Davis,It's kind of overrated a little bit. Kids sometimes get their feelings hurt by not being on it. But it's not our rule. We're looking for the best players we can find. Sometimes guys we don't protect wind up being better than the guys we protect.
Glenn Davis,"The cafeteria crew worked their tails off for us. They didn't have any electricity, but they had gas, so they were able to cook."
Glenn Davis,"Education is always very important. Ultrasound is, I think, quite a niche market. We know our customers very well. We listen to a lot of feedback â€“ and they're more than happy to tell us their thoughts."
Glenn Davis,There needs to be some cooperation. Someone should turn them [Netscape Communications and Microsoft] over the knee and spank them and say stop with the egos.
Greg Davis,"(Judge) is the best coach around, by far. I want to be good, so its worth (the drive), especially if I want to get a scholarship."
Greg Davis,We are extremely pleased with our new ranking. We have shown a tremendous amount of improvement in the last two weeks. Our ranking shows that this week.
Greg Davis,"Sometimes you design things to think you're going to get explosive plays, but with these guys, we've got an opportunity to make explosives when they're not designed to be that way."
Greg Davis,We don't have the budget to do that.
Greg Davis,"This contract is for the older guys. I started in 2000 and this contract doesn't benefit me in any way at all as far as getting anything new. There's like one more vacation day, but that's about it. The 1.5 percent is the worst thing."
Jonathan Davis,so it's a really surreal kind of mind-twisting video.
Jonathan Davis,"He's very conducive to getting ideas out there,"
Jonathan Davis,"The determination was made by us and Prudential that this project was strong enough that we could go forward on a speculative basis,"
Jonathan Davis,I always felt like I was working for a record company. Now I feel like we have a true partner. I'm looking forward to this new chapter in our career.
Jonathan Davis,"He was a guy who really liked Sinatra, stuck at this alternative-rock radio station, ... So we had the character record his own versions of these (alternative) songs. That was the original inspiration for Cheese."
Jonathan Davis,"It started when I woke up, all I wanted to do is jump out of the window. I didn't want to eat anymore, because I was afraid that I might poison myself somehow."
Jonathan Davis,We're not trying to change the world; just music.
Jonathan Davis,"Be yourself, let you come through."
Jonathan Davis,The music industry can make you feel like a prostitute.
Jonathan Davis,"It is quite annoying that we have to change the sound we invented just to avoid sounding like people who simply copy us, but... it is flattering and of course challenging."
Jonathan Davis,Real friends stab you in the front.
Jonathan Davis,"Some people are desperately looking for scapegoats, they just don't want to see the truth!"
Jonathan Davis,I don't know the true meaning of happiness.
Jonathan Davis,"Sometimes I go out disguised, but people still recognize me, so I find there is no point in even trying. It would be nice to get away from it, from time to time, but the fact is, there is no place on earth where I can go unrecognized."
Jonathan Davis,People die from typewriters falling on their heads.
Jonathan Davis,"You laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at you because you're all the same."
Jonathan Davis,The fans have been really incredible everywhere we've been. You want to make sure you put on the best concert of your life to show them how appreciative you are.
Jonathan Davis,"Issues deals with the issues I had, the fears I had and it isn't a 'nice' album but fears and depressions are not particularly nice."
Jonathan Davis,"I got problems. I freak out, go to a shrink, go through all kinds of therapy and stuff, but I'm learning how to deal with it. That's why I've chosen one hour a night to get all of my aggressions out. to really tell the world the way I feel."
Jonathan Davis,"I don't care what people think or say about me, I know who I am."
Jonathan Davis,"I like reading Ball Tongue lyrics and all that stuff. And they published a book, and I wouldn't give my lyrics, and it's all wrong in the book, and I giggle. It's funny."
Jonathan Davis,"What I absolutely can't do is just sit around, that drives me crazy. I go nuts! I'm far too nervous, too high strung to sit around. It's not my thing; I can't deal with it!"
Jonathan Davis,I don't like painting flowers in my music. I like painting guts and pain.
Jonathan Davis,At first I was queasy; I'll never forget the sound of the scalpel cutting a body open. But it was so cool trying to work out how these people died.
Jonathan Davis,Our fans make the band. What they give we give right back. They're an integral part of us. They ARE us.
Jonathan Davis,"A lot of people don't realize that depression is an illness. I don't wish it on anyone, but if they would know how it feels, I swear they would think twice before they just shrug it."
Ken Davis,"There are no reports of widespread power outages, no problems with heating and that sort of thing. So just stay off the roads and everything should be fine."
Ken Davis,"This is Philadelphia, people are used to (politicians) getting indicted,"
Ken Davis,"It was little scary, ... I didn't know what kind of mood he was in. I didn't want to say anything to him."
Ken Davis,We prayed throughout the building to ask God to make it pleasing to him.
Ken Davis,Most of these girls can do 40 or 50 pull-ups. It's a pretty amazing sport.
Ken Davis,"We look forward to planting the seeds necessary for us to grow and build not only a self-sustaining economy, but also our most valuable resource: the members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa."
Ken Davis,"Natives, we have a great custom of sharing, so great we shared our country with you."
Ken Davis,"I don't think the state of North Dakota has the authority to collect the tax to begin with. I think they're in violation of our sovereign rights, and of federal law."
Kenneth Davis,"Throughout our history, there has been an ebb and flow of one branch being a little more powerful, the president getting a little more power, then congress being more powerful, ... Don't Know Much About History."
Kenneth Davis,"In today's world, these are not funny things. Maybe if you are a professional comic on cable TV, you can get away with it. But not when you are in public life."
Kenneth Davis,"The friends come in here the first few days, ... But after the first week, he's forgotten. Then he's off to (long-term care) Drake, where he will spend his shortened life on a ventilator. His friends don't see what the rest of his life looks like. There's no funeral. He's just gone from the neighborhood."
Kenneth Davis,"The people we see here have problems we can't even imagine, ... They keep going back into that environment."
Kenneth Davis,"But it's that flexibility, that elasticity of the Constitution that allows for that, and so that's part of its extraordinary brilliance that has allowed it to last as long as it has."
Kim Davis,She spent her summer in a way not a lot of high school golfers spend their summers. She really opened up and played in some big tournaments on some really long courses. That's where I see the biggest difference.
Kim Davis,"At the turn, we had had some bad holes, but the girls came back well. Overall, it was a very good day. I'm very proud of the girls."
Kim Davis,We're going to find the best books for Pasco County. I'm not foreseeing any issues.
Lanny Davis,"It's a self-created nightmare. Cheney took a non-story, or a minor story, and created a huge negative story because of his stubbornness and his arrogance."
Lanny Davis,"Tell it early, tell it all and tell it yourself. The rules are the same whether you're a president, a corporate CEO or a baseball player."
Lanny Davis,"The problem with energy taxes is that the poor and middle class subsidize the wealthy, and environmentalists tend to forget that."
Lanny Davis,"In this presumption-of-guilt culture, which is what has come about in Washington in the last 10 or 15 years, there must be a sense of anger there and an inability to manage the facts."
Leonard Davis,"I feel like you should go out and perform here. If you don't, you're wasting an opportunity to be seen by the entire league."
Leonard Davis,"It's a piece of paper, but it's a piece of paper that has meaning and value, just like a marriage certificate,"
Leonard Davis,They came to my house and took me home. They even fed us Wendy's.
Martha Davis,"Our argument is that fathers should have the same right,"
Martha Davis,"We see it as a wholeness of the mind, body and spirit,"
Martha Davis,"We didn't wait for a holiday or a birthday or anything like that to get together. It was just the thing to do on the weekends, be together."
Martin Davis,"Spas associated with golf resorts enable families to take vacations all can enjoy. What's happening is that more and more wives are beginning to take up the game while on holiday, while the husbands are availing themselves of the spa facilities."
Martin Davis,This one is really the gold standard among achievements in sports.
Martin Davis,It's such a monumental achievement. Jones really set what became the standard for all golfers.
Michael Davis,"[The center also has 300 gallons of water stocked up and a generator to provide electricity.] I anticipate Lufkin to lose power on Sunday, so we are preparing be without power, ... A nursing home must maintain electricity as long as possible because many of our patients are on oxygen concentrators and feeding tubes that depend on electricity to run. And there are a lot of meals to prepare."
Michael Davis,Nicholls is in a dead spot with the design.
Michael Davis,I went over to say hi to Rob and he introduced me to Wayne and Fred. I had made a radical purchase of some brown Beatle boots. Wayne was like 'Where did you get those boots! Who is this guy?
Michael Davis,Nothing ever sounds quite the way it does when you're standing right in the middle of it.
Michael Davis,"I think some time after 1969 or so, the band started to lose its light. But I'll tell you what, boy- on the way up, it was happening."
Michael Davis,"We had all these things to deal with- houses full of people and John going to jail, guys from New York saying 'don't worry about anything.' So it was really confusing."
Michael Davis,"When I joined the band, being that I was going to take this up as a profession, I realized that there were no two finer guitar players in the world that I'd rather play with."
Michael Davis,"We had all this kind of freedom and 'get out of your head' kind of stuff and at the same time, we were trying to establish ourselves in the business. These two things are really difficult to bring together."
Michael Davis,I had just broken up with my wife so I was searching for another way to live.
Michael Davis,I started out with nothing. I still have most of it.
Michael Davis,The New Orleans I knew ain't no more.
Michael Davis,I was not a musician at the time. I had an acoustic guitar and I used to sing folk music and Bob Dylan songs. I loved rock and roll though.
Mike Davis,"Hopefully, he got some rest (Sunday) and he'll be ready to go (tonight). Tuesday is definitely a quick turnaround."
Mike Davis,This could be big for barley. I also expect more research to document other potential health benefits.
Mike Davis,"If you're unsure whether you qualify for this program, you should contact either Social Security or the Indiana Senior Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP)."
Mike Davis,"He has no nerves. I mean, he fears nothing."
Mike Davis,"We hope to talk to our group, and see what direction they want to go, ... Then we will let Mr. Marra speak and we know he will have some good information."
Mike Davis,"If Microsoft couldn't keep up with the customers' demand [for the 360], I don't know why they didn't wait to release it. For some people, it doesn't matter whether it [the 360] is out or not, because they still can't get one."
Mike Davis,"He's the leading scorer in the country, so there's really nothing we can do. We hope he misses some shots. We don't have anyone who can really guard him. No one has figured it out."
Mike Davis,"How many interim coaches that had never been a head coach, at this level, following a legend are going to be able to keep his job? Let's be realistic about the whole thing. How many thought I would be here six years? â€¦ It's OK. I was here for the healing process, and now people can move forward."
Mike Davis,"I think every coach, whether or not they're going to be there next year, anytime they have a group of guys they really love and appreciate, I feel more sadness for them than anyone because they fought hard. They really fought hard over the last month. I'm proud of them."
Mike Davis,He's really more of a hyper coach and likes to get into it.
Mike Davis,We went from being a very deep basketball team to only having enough to practice today.
Mike Davis,"(The basketball teams) play on it. I think the men's team is undefeated at home, so I guess we're doing pretty good."
Mike Davis,"They have a good basketball team and they just lost some road games. That's part of being in a good conference. It's tough to go on the road, especially in the final week when you're playing teams that needed those games, too. Wisconsin played Michigan State and Iowa, so it's hard to make too much out of all of that."
Mike Davis,"We played a very good basketball team tonight. They made the game too hard for us. I thought we gave everything we had in the first, but the way they played, the way they shot the basketball I don't think we could have won. They did what they had to do, and they took care of the home game."
Miles Davis,"You can dominate a game if you dominate on the line... We're just going to have to go out there and work hard and blow people off the ball, and let our runners do what they do best."
Miles Davis,Sometimes you have to play a long time to be able to play like yourself.
Miles Davis,I'll play it and tell you what it is later.
Miles Davis,I'm always thinking about creating. My future starts when I wake up every morning... Every day I find something creative to do with my life.
Miles Davis,"The thing to judge in any jazz artist is, does the man project and does he have ideas."
Miles Davis,I'll play it first and tell you what it is later.
Miles Davis,Do not fear mistakes. There are none.
Miles Davis,"If you understood everything I say, you'd be me!"
Miles Davis,"I know what I've done for music, but don't call me a legend. Just call me Miles Davis."
Miles Davis,"It's always been a gift with me, hearing music the way I do. I don't know where it comes from, it's just there and I don't question it."
Miles Davis,A legend is an old man with a cane known for what he used to do. I'm still doing it.
Miles Davis,"Don't play what's there, play what's not there."
Miles Davis,"For me, music and life are all about style."
Phil Davis,They came at key times. We'll work on that.
Phil Davis,"It depends on what they are. We had some guys trying to get off blocks and the (opposing) guy spun and we got called for something. Some holds may get called or they may not. All in all, the penalties jumped up and got us at the worst times. We'll address that."
Phil Davis,Caleb did a good job. He did a good job running the option. He threw it well and defensively he did a good job on Huff.
Phil Davis,"We did what we needed to do. We still made some mistakes, but we were able to overcome them."
Phil Davis,"We just made too many mistakes. We can't do that against good teams. Even when Portsmouth is down, they have good talent."
Phil Davis,We made a ton of mistakes against Portsmouth. Our guys have to step up.
Phil Davis,"We put (Jeffrey) Thornburg on (Josh) Johnson and he did a great job. Our linebackers did a great job. The defense did a super job all night,"
Phil Davis,Last year we had restaurants out of food two days after the event. This year we've even heard of a group that is planning a White Squirrel wedding.
Phil Davis,We'd like to keep their offense off the field. Our execution on offense is a key because they have good skilled players and they can break it at any time.
Phil Davis,College can be in reach for more of our city's students. Power of YOU has the potential to turn dreams of college into reality for hundreds of Minneapolis young people.
Ricky Davis,"We're not running out no more. I think we're running a lot more plays in the second half instead of just playing freely. The first half we're just out there, guys just playing, running up and down the court. I think that's what we need to continue to do."
Ricky Davis,I don't know if it's self pride or whatever. We just need to toughen up a little bit.
Ricky Davis,Hopefully after the break we'll be able to get in a little more practice and everybody can get acclimated.
Ricky Davis,"He was the story of the night. We came in expecting him to hit the boards hard, and he killed us. It's tough anytime somebody is playing like that."
Ricky Davis,"Tough night. We started the game off good, but struggled. They came in and played hard. We tried to match it but couldn't get the victory."
Ricky Davis,"It's almost like we are playing for pride. Some people are going to play every night, some people aren't."
Ricky Davis,"They made every shot. It's kind of tough when a team's shooting really well. And when you try to make your run, and they still make their shots, it's almost impossible."
Ricky Davis,The second quarter hurt us. They jumped out to a 12-14-point lead and we just couldn't get it back.
Ricky Davis,It's real hard to come up with something unique. We've seen just about everything over the last 10 years.
Ricky Davis,"It's not frustrating yet. It's still early in the season. Keep losing games like this, and we'll be frustrated. But we think we are all right. The division's not playing too well, so I think we're still in it."
Ricky Davis,They tried to play Garnett straight up. He's been facing double-teams for the last 20 games. It's tough to get your game on when they play you like that. But tonight he had a great game.
Ricky Davis,That's crazy. I think he should fly out to Hollywood and get a movie set. It's kind of funny.
Ricky Davis,"You're playing against your old team in front of a different crowd, but it was fun."
Ricky Davis,"(Nash) is not the quickest guy, but he knows how to play, knows how to use his body, knows how to find guys."
Ricky Davis,"It's tough, but it's all going out and playing basketball. You get to learn plays and think about the movement later. The terminology is pretty much the same all around the league. You catch on the first couple days. At the end of the day, just come out and play basketball."
Ron Davis,"A Web-based version wasn't available when we selected Concur, but we probably wouldn't have pushed for a Web-based solution because our heavy travelers have to be able to work offline with a laptop."
Ron Davis,We support that group wholeheartedly.
Ron Davis,It's been a long road getting our program back on track. It's progress.
Ron Davis,"The vote they're taking in Middletown has no influence on us whatsoever, other than that we are fellow unions."
Ron Davis,The youth come up with the ideas because they know their peers better than anyone.
Sarah Davis,Public art is out in the open and forces you to be aware it. It's hard to ignore something that is in your face and foreign to your everyday routine.
Sarah Davis,"It's hard to tell, but there seems to be one."
Sarah Davis,There's definitely a potential for this to be a fire season like none of us has ever remembered before.
Shani Davis,I couldn't hold it together mentally. I couldn't finish the race the way I needed to physically.
Shani Davis,"He skated a beautiful race. He was the best today ... I am very proud of him, he's a champion."
Shani Davis,"I'm just just happy about my race. More than anything, the things that I've trained for, I was right about."
Shani Davis,"I can be really fast, but other people are in the race. So you've got to be able to maneuver around those guys, and you have to be a little more versatile out there on the ice. I bring my fitness that I gained from the long track over to here. Hopefully, I'll be able to put it to good use."
Shani Davis,"It started to become a soap opera in there, so I decided to leave."
Shani Davis,I'm one of a kind.
Shani Davis,"Because it's an improvement. As long as I'm improving, I'm pretty happy if it's a world record or a rink record."
Shani Davis,Joey almost gave me a heart attack when I saw how fast he was going.
Shani Davis,"It showed that all the hard work and all the sacrifice paid off. Kids in general, if you put your mind to it and you believe it, you can achieve it."
Shani Davis,"I'll be honest with you. Sure, Chad and I are fighting for the same thing. But it would have been kind of nice after I won the 1,000 if he would have been a good teammate and shook my hand."
Shani Davis,"I'm trying not to get too emotional because I have more events. I'll be emotional in the closing ceremony, but I've got a job to do. I've got to stay focused."
Shani Davis,The Dutch fans are really passionate about speed skating. They bring a lot of energy and atmosphere to our sport.
Shani Davis,"No one loves you more than your mother. It's like on the Discovery Channel where you see a bald eagle do everything it can to protect its young. People can say whatever they want, but it's a sticks-and-stones thing."
Shani Davis,I really don't consider this a defeat because I am skating better and better every race.
Steve Davis,"Honestly, we don't really talk about (playing Ike). We just come out to play as a team and try to limit those easy baskets they like to get."
Steve Davis,"Those guys (the offensive line) have worked in the weight room since February. Because we didn't start school until Thursday, they were able to stay late on Monday and Tuesday and watch tape."
Steve Davis,We've got two of the best wide receivers I've ever coached. I haven't had two wide receivers with their quality since Sterling Hicks.
Steve Davis,"Hopefully, guys take more pride in those units."
Steve Davis,"All those backpacks are still in the school, all throughout the school, and there are briefcases and boxes, ... (Police) are using X-ray machines and everything else they can to X-ray literally thousands of backpacks, boxes, briefcases, anything that could house an explosive device."
Steve Davis,"With the exception of the legendary pink Cadillac Elvis gave his mother, this is as good as it gets."
Steve Davis,"The census is costing us right at $1 million, and all of that money we will recover, I believe, three for one in four years."
Steve Davis,"It is clear that integration to 'back-office' systems such as accounting or service management applications is an important aspect of providing end-to- end mobilization for field service organizations, ... With an easy to implement integration path via SOAP for EService, we are able to provide the considerable benefits of EService while also allowing our customers to use their 'tried and proven' business management applications."
Steve Davis,"It is clear that integration to 'back-office' systems such as accounting or service management applications is an important aspect of providing end-to- end mobilization for field service organizations. With an easy to implement integration path via SOAP for EService, we are able to provide the considerable benefits of EService while also allowing our customers to use their 'tried and proven' business management applications."
Steve Davis,"At first, the six of us thought we could keep our jobs and keep this going part-time,"
Steve Davis,"People are coming here now to have a good time. It's a destination location. It's the cuisine, it's the entertainment, it's the people-watching, it's the sharing of celebrity, and living vicariously through some of those folk."
Steve Davis,"You don't exactly know what she's going to say, but you know it's going to be entertaining."
Steve Davis,"I have very mixed emotions regarding Chris's performance this weekend. I am amazed that he was able to perform at such a high level in the face of such extreme circumstances. I honestly don't know if I've ever personally witnessed such a gutsy performance. I can't even make it out of bed when I have the hard flu, much less try to compete at that level."
Steve Davis,"This year, we came of age. This has evolved into what the vision was, which was to create a true lifestyle event with the auction as the nucleus."
Steve Davis,"They had a 2-1 advantage, and they took her off the ballot, ... What they have done is entered the twilight of election law."
Susan Davis,Our synergy offers the Navy more comprehensive support and training capabilities.
Susan Davis,Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep: An Album of Classical Lullabies
Susan Davis,"They have a lot of fun together, the dogs do."
Terrell Davis,"The one thing that scares me the most is failing. It scares me that one day I won't be at this level. But while I'm here and while I'm having success early, I'm trying to do everything to stay on this level."
Terrell Davis,"You can be the best person in the league but if you don't win championships, something's missing."
Terrell Davis,There is no such thing as sportsmanship.
Thomas Davis,I'm fighting tougher fighters now. But now no one wants to fight me.
Thomas Davis,That's how a real neighbor is. They could just sense what you need.
Thomas Davis,"A people without a language of its own, is only half a nation."
Thomas Davis,"What we'll do is, send out form letters, last week of May. If you're not home, we'll leave you a card, saying 'give us a call.' Also at the end of the job, we'll make one more sweep through the neighborhoods."
Thomas Davis,"The purpose of our Importance of Education Campaign is to convince youth and their parents of the benefits of doing well in school, graduating from high school, enrolling in college and graduating from college."
Thomas Davis,They're trying to make fuel cells a reality. They want to bring the hydrogen economy to the United States.
Tom Davis,We were having trouble getting out on the shooters. They just drilled us.
Tom Davis,"Hopefully we can bring in an IBM, or another big company's western regional conference, or some major trade associations,"
Tom Davis,"You can look at objective measurements such as RPI ratings and schedule strength and stuff like that and see that we're closer. I can look at tape and see where we're improved, and where we're closer. But it's still hard to lose."
Tom Davis,"I think (Stewart) understands that. The question is, can he apply it? Some give it lip service, but they won't get the job done. So it will be a great test for him. If he gets it done, that would be big."
Tom Davis,"I noticed that the (drunk) individuals had moved on, ... He (the AT&T security guard) pointed to a package under a bench in front of the tower and told me that one of them must have left it there."
Tom Davis,"This is progress, but it's not enough,"
Tom Davis,"Maybe we've had more problems with them than other teams have, but that's a reflection more on us. We just haven't been as good as they have been as a team."
Tom Davis,"This will encourage businesses to come in and fix these problems, and right now there's some hesitancy to do that,"
Tom Davis,"What made it hurt is that we told them what the play was going to be. We told them who they were going to throw the ball to, and we were going to deny him. Obviously we didn't execute, which was kind of the story of the game. They just seemed a step ahead of us."
Tom Davis,"It's very hard, because you never know what you're going to get."
Tom Davis,One of our goals was not to let them have a single rebound.
Tom Davis,It's a funny game. You just don't know what the home court is worth.
Tom Davis,You can often find the best information about family needs through their communities of faith. The connections we're making assure engagement of the entire community in the recovery process.
Tom Davis,"There was a profound failure to be proactive, a deep inability to execute,"
Tom Davis,"Our inside guys have really developed nicely, and Jonathan Cox is a good example of that. And our guards do a pretty good job of rebounding. We've had pretty good balance."
Tom Davis,"Nick Grant is a good example. He's getting it figured out about when to drive, and when to pull it out and use his abilities."
Tom Davis,"Great crowd, great environment. It does impact the game. It can be disruptive to visitors."
Tom Davis,"Every time we'd muster a little energy to get back in the game, they were able to hold us off."
Tom Davis,"There's always some national context to state elections here. It probably all does matter, and up here that's probably not a plus."
Tom Davis,"This is a debate the American people need to have, but I think we have more important priorities right now -- getting tax cuts, getting this economy moving, getting an education reform package, patients' bill of rights -- these are, I think, higher priorities for the American people,"
Tom Davis,It's been very easy. You must have a respect for each other and communication is important. Any problems you have at work stay at work because you solve the problem before you get home.
Tom Davis,This is not the movies. There is no Tommy Lee Jones character who comes in and takes charge of everything.
Tom Davis,"I always take a day-to-day approach. With my age, you just don't know. There could be health issues. And some of it is mental. If you don't have fun doing what you're doing, if you lose the part that's enjoyable about it, then you're not going to do a good job anyway."
Tom Davis,"The innovations of the information age - laptop computers, broadband Internet service, blackberries and so forth â€“ continue to make location less relevant in the working world. Telework, by capitalizing on those technological advances, not only offers a broad range of benefits to employers and employees, but also helps reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and fuel consumption. Because of these important benefits, we need to encourage telework wherever possible by removing disincentives, and I applaud the Telework Coalition's help in that effort."
Tom Davis,the type of self-initiated action we were hoping for all along.
Tom Davis,We don't see any other legal action we can take.
Tom Davis,"The first thing I was impressed with was how well the guys honored Drake with their acceptance speeches. I thought it was one of the finest displays of feeling, emotion, appreciation and brevity that I had seen. The other part was how strong their feelings were for Drake. They spoke of their gratitude for the education they got here and how they were treated, things having nothing to do with basketball."
Tom Davis,"We have quickness, we have athletic ability, good hands and good heads. We just don't have good games."
Brian Dawkins,We can't worry about the playoffs. We have to worry about the Giants.
Brian Dawkins,"They came out and everything they did clicked. Everything we did didn't work. We know in no way that's who we are. The bye came at a time where guys can use it. After a loss like that, it's good to get away."
Brian Dawkins,"To risk what he is potentially risking to want to stay out on the field, that's just the toughness that he has. That really speaks to what he thinks of this team and what he is as a player."
Brian Dawkins,That game is over with. We have to get on with the rest of the season.
Brian Dawkins,"It was just good to get back out there to practice your craft, to get that nasty taste out of your mouth. To get going towards another week of positive thinking."
Brian Dawkins,"But I mean, I felt their pain. How close we were, for that many years, to get to that point, and then lose it? We talked our way to where we wanted to be and we played our way to where we wanted to be. From the year before, we knew where we needed to be to get that next level. Then we got there and we couldn't capitalize."
Brian Dawkins,"You saw what happened this year. It can happen. It starts to filter through. Different opinions are given out, and things happen that shouldn't happen."
Brian Dawkins,"But that shouldn't matter to us. If they get the ball on the 30-yard line, our mind-set is we should still hold them to a field goal."
Brian Dawkins,"That's what I love so much about this team. We have some warriors here. We have some guys who go out there and fight. That's the best thing about this team. No matter what happens, we just keep fighting. You have to love that."
Brian Dawkins,"I can only hope that loss drives a lot of guys, ... I can honestly say that in my training sessions, my mind was focused on the fact that those last couple of steps off the field was somebody else celebrating once again in a big game. Personally, I don't want that to happen again, and I am going to do everything in my power not to have that happen again."
Brian Dawkins,"I hate to go because somebody has gone down with an injury, but being the first alternate, that happens. This is something that I work for each and every year and I never take it for granted. It's an honor."
Brian Dawkins,"It still stings a little bit regardless of the circumstances of him not being here. You still would like to have that guy on your side because you can count on him. From all reports, everybody in the organization and on both sides of the situation felt that this was the best thing to do. So they did it and you have to live and keep on playing."
Brian Dawkins,"My age is getting up there, but that doesn't mean my play has to diminish,"
Richard Dawkins,Dawkins Law of the Conservation of Difficulty states that obscurantism in an academic subject expands to fill the vacuum of its intrinsic simplicity
Richard Dawkins,"[But Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary theorist at Oxford, said that even scientists who were believers did not claim evidence for that belief.] The most they will claim is that there is no evidence against, ... which is pathetically weak.

Richard Dawkins,The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry
Richard Dawkins,"[Evolution is] a theory in a special philosophical sense of science, but in terms of ordinary laymen's use of language, it's a fact, ... Evolution is a fact in the same sense that it's a fact that the Earth is round and not flat, [that] the Earth goes round the Sun. Both those are also theories, but they're theories that have never been disproved and never will be disproved."
Richard Dawkins,The theory of evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only theory we know of that is in principle capable of explaining the existence of organized complexity
Richard Dawkins,"God exists, if only in the form of a meme with high survival value, or infective power, in the environment provided by human culture"

Richard Dawkins,"Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish."
Richard Dawkins,"But perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation, the wonder of science, scientific ways of thinking, and the history of scientific ideas, rather than laboratory experience."
Richard Dawkins,"We humans are an extremely important manifestation of the replication bomb, because it is through us - through our brains, our symbolic culture and our technology - that the explosion may proceed to the next stage and reverberate through deep space."

Richard Dawkins,"Complex, statistically improbable things are by their nature more difficult to explain than simple, statistically probable things."
Richard Dawkins,"The fact that life evolved out of nearly nothing, some 10 billion years after the universe evolved out of literally nothing, is a fact so staggering that I would be mad to attempt words to do it justice."

Richard Dawkins,"By all means let's be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out."
Richard Dawkins,What has 'theology' ever said that is of the smallest use to anybody? When has 'theology' ever said anything that is demonstrably true and is not obvious? What makes you think that 'theology' is a subject at all?
Richard Dawkins,"Isn't it sad to go to your grave without ever wondering why you were born? Who, with such a thought, would not spring from bed, eager to resume discovering the world and rejoicing to be part of it?"
Richard Dawkins,"There may be fairies at the bottom of the garden. There is no evidence for it, but you can't prove that there aren't any, so shouldn't we be agnostic with respect to fairies?"
Richard Dawkins,"Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence."
Richard Dawkins,I'm not sure this conversation can go any further.
Richard Dawkins,"After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isnâ€™t it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I am askedâ€”as I am surprisingly oftenâ€”why I bother to get up in the mornings."
Richard Dawkins,"Personally, I rather look forward to a computer program winning the world chess championship. Humanity needs a lesson in humility."
Len Dawson,"We were tied 6-6 in the fourth quarter on our own 20 and needed a spark. I've got to hand it to him, he called the play and made it work."
Len Dawson,"This fight was one that was less painful, and a whole lot more severe. One thing I realized is that you just can't do it by yourself."
Len Dawson,One of the reasons I loved playing quarterback was that I got to call the plays. The cancer put me in a position where I really wasn't in control anymore.
Len Dawson,My PSA was normal but the DRE indicated there may be a problem.
Len Dawson,"If you're unable to catch it in time, the cancer can spread to the lymph nodes and at that point, the cancer is essentially incurable, but that doesn't mean your condition can't be improved."
Len Dawson,I was just fortunate that it was detected in the early stages. Unfortunately my brother Ron wasn't so lucky. He lost his battle with the disease.
Len Dawson,I still can't figure out how Minnesota wasn't in the Super Bowl last year. I've got to say they're the odds-on favorite to win it all this year.
Len Dawson,"I said to myself, 'I've never gotten anything for free that was worth anything. I want a second opinion.' But sure enough, they were right."
Len Dawson,"Granted, prostate exams aren't the most enjoyable things in the world, but they only last about 10 seconds. It's well worth it. Just think of the possible consequences if you don't get it done."
Len Dawson,"'Early stages' is when the cancer is completely contained within the prostate. If it is detected when the cancer is entirely in the gland, the chance for full recovery is at its highest."
Les Dawson,Marriage is an institution and that's where a couple finish up.
Les Dawson,I can always tell when the mother in law's coming to stay; the mice throw themselves on the traps.

Dorothy Day,"As for ourselves, yes, we must be meek, bear injustice, malice, rash judgment. We must turn the other cheek, give up our cloak, go a second mile."
Dorothy Day,"We have all known the long loneliness, and we have found that the answer is community."
Dorothy Day,Don't call me a saint. I don't want to be dismissed so easily.

Dorothy Day,"Love casts out fear, but we have to get over the fear in order to get close enough to love them."

Dorothy Day,"I have long since come to believe that people never mean half of what they say, and that it is best to disregard their talk and judge only their actions."
Dorothy Day,I firmly believe that our salvation depends on the poor.

Green Day,Billie Joe- We were terrible tennants at the time. We ended up chopping up the stairs for firewood
Green Day,Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Green Day,I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
Green Day,Minority is about being an individual. It's like you have to sift through the darkness to find your place and be that individual you want to be your entire life.
Green Day,TrÅ½: I told my dad Yeah Im going to be a drummer and he said well you can if you can rub your stomach at the same time as you pat your head at the same time youre standing on one leg and kicking the other one out in a circle and say the pledge of allegiance. And I did all that just like bam you know?
Green Day,"I don't push my drums down; I go through 'em. I use my body as a battering ram. I had some sports therapists yelling at me for not taking better care of my body. I got a concussion bake in Rhode Island--no,that's where I got thrown around by this bouncer. I got the concussion in New York City. The paramedics wanted to take me to the hospital right there. But I was like, 'No, I'm cool. It's not like I'm going to settle down. I thought it was funny. The thing is, I could never afford to just trash my drums like that before, until I got my deal with Slingerland."
Green Day,"Billie Joe: What do you mean we walked around dressed like girls? They were our own clothes, they just happened to be dresses..."
Green Day,"I'm not gonna say anything inspirational, I'm just gonna f***ing swear a lot."

Daniel Day-Lewis,"You can never fully put your finger on the reason why you're suddenly, inexplicably compelled to explore one life as opposed to another."
Daniel Day-Lewis,"When I've gone back to work, it's always with that sense of inevitability. That may be a complete delusion, but it's the one that I need to get out of bed and go about my business. That sense that I can't avoid this thing. I better just get on with it."
Daniel Day-Lewis,"There's nothing worse than finding yourself in a situation, a very demanding piece of work, and knowing that you're not a true ally to the person who's in charge of all that."

Daniel Day-Lewis,"Making a film, setting it up and getting it cast and getting it together, is not an easy thing."
Daniel Day-Lewis,"It's a complete illusion, this notion. We create for ourselves this strange delusion that we exchange our lives for someone else's."
Daniel Day-Lewis,"If people take an interest in you and they think there's half a chance, they might hang on. It's dreadful."
Daniel Day-Lewis,I'm very often still very much alive for that other being and that other world long after the film is finished.
Daniel Day-Lewis,"I'm not always doing this work, but whatever I'm doing when I'm not doing this work seems to be as much a part of this as anything else."
Daniel Day-Lewis,I was a savage for so many years of my life. There was some seed of determination in me that I was not conscious of. I was mostly consciously getting into trouble and drunk.
Daniel Day-Lewis,I try to honor that bargain that I made with myself that I wouldn't do this work unless I really felt the need to. I just didn't see the point.
Daniel Day-Lewis,I think some actors thrive on working at a much greater pace than I do.
Daniel Day-Lewis,"I see a lot of movies. I love films as a spectator, and that's never obscured by the part of me that does the work myself. I just love going to the movies."

Daniel Day-Lewis,"I suppose I have a highly developed capacity for self-delusion, so it's no problem for me to believe that I'm somebody else."
Troy Dayak,They turned away some of our good opportunities and it was tough to recover from that.
Troy Dayak,"My philosophy is that if we can keep a team at five goals or less, we should win that game."
Troy Dayak,"We had opportunities and we missed them, and the momentum went back the other way and killed us."
Troy Dayak,"We had the momentum, but we weren't putting the balls in the goal. I felt with an extra guy out there we would be able to get the game into overtime."
Taylor Dayne,"When I first came out, like a lot of the artists at that time, I had a very polished, very overproduced sound."
Taylor Dayne,"Well, honey, I had the million dollar houses, I had the car, I had the horse, I had the barn; I had everything. Was I set free? I didn't even know what that meant."
Taylor Dayne,"That's really my goal now. I'm trying to be a positive role model to my kids and to just enjoy this ride, because it's hard. It's hard to enjoy it when you're in it."
Taylor Dayne,So when I'm working out I do things extreme.
Taylor Dayne,"Plus, I am paranoid by nature. I need to be in control."
Taylor Dayne,My tastes and inspirational artists were always rather eclectic and diverse.
Taylor Dayne,My first tour I was on the road for 18 months. You're just out there promoting.
Taylor Dayne,"My current mantra is that sometimes we need teachers in our lives. I never had that in my life, parents and stuff like that; I tried to stay on the outside of them or anybody that had that kind of influence."
Taylor Dayne,Last thing I need is to take LSD or mushrooms.
Taylor Dayne,"If we were truly in the studio making a record, it would have been more time consuming, and certainly I would have been more involved in the writing process."
Taylor Dayne,I'm not looking to go out there and make a rhythmic Timbaland track.
Taylor Dayne,"I touched a lot of people internationally, and Rodney's a very smart business man, he knows you have to go for a broader and bigger audience."

Taylor Dayne,I never even did blow; I had no desire.
Taylor Dayne,"I just try to get out of my own way because if anyone is their own worst enemy, it's usually you."
Taylor Dayne,I have to be very careful about diet and exercise.
Taylor Dayne,I grew up in New York and my friends and I were hanging out on 2nd Avenue and 8th Street. I wore a lot of clothing by Nasty Habits.
Taylor Dayne,I do boot camp now. I go to Barry's. I really enjoy it because it's for one hour and it's just balls out. You're dying by the end of the hour.
Taylor Dayne,"I came out the box and for seven years I had a huge career. And then it's done, it's dumped. But I ain't gone, and I refuse to be gone."
Taylor Dayne,"Did people think I sounded black? Totally, but that was a marketing tool as well, but also this is how I grew up and these are my influences."
Taylor Dayne,"By the second tour I had rice cakes and hummus with me, and I was jumping rope in my room."
Taylor Dayne,"But once you strip that down, you realize it's all about a voice, like a Norah Jones - that's inspiring to me."
Taylor Dayne,And I'm also looking for a comeback record and it has to touch a lot of people.
Taylor Dayne,All you needed back then was a blow dryer and a dream.
Taylor Dayne,I've had enough boyfriends and enough issues. I'd seen enough train wrecks.

Mark Dayton,"Apparently the primary qualification necessary to lead the nation's disaster relief agency was to have been a major supporter of the president's 2000 election campaign,"

Mark Dayton,The fine print in the President's Social Security proposal is that all present and future workers under age 55 will have their promised retirement benefits cut.
Mark Dayton,"I would not at this point advise anyone to not fly Northwest, based entirely upon the assurance that I've been given by the FAA, ...

But again, I've been given that assurance by the highest person responsible for those reviews and decisions, the FAA administrator."

David DeAngelo,Attraction is not a choice.
David DeAngelo,"Little boys tease little girls when theyâ€™re 8, and women still love it when theyâ€™re 28 and 48."
Michael Deaver,He needed to reassure us on the economy and reassure people there is a future they can be positive about.
Michael Deaver,"He needed to reassure us on the economy, and reassure people there is a future they can be positive about. People have been saying no to that question everyone asks ? 'Am I going to be better off a year from now than I am today?' ? and that has been going on for the past two or three years."
Michael Deaver,"Maureen's hoping she can go up and see her father, too, ... Good Morning America."
Eugene Debs,"Ten thousand times has the labor movement stumbled and bruised itself. We have been enjoined by the courts, assaulted by thugs, charged by the militia, traduced by the press, frowned upon in public opinion, and deceived by politicians. 'But notwithstanding all this and all these, labor is today the most vital and potential power this planet has ever known, and its historic mission is as certain of ultimate realization as is the setting of the sun."
Eugene Debs,"The people can have anything they want, the only problem is they do not want anything."
Eugene Debs,"When great changes occur in history, when great principles are involved, as a rule the majority are wrong."
Eugene Debs,Intelligent discontent is the mainspring of civilization. Progress is born of agitation. It is agitation or stagnation.

Brian Deegan,"I just find it obnoxious, repulsive. I always thought life was more valuable than that but it appears that it's not."

Brian Deegan,"There are other dads out there and mums that are going to join the queue, and I just find this revolting,"
Brian Deegan,"This event gave me more confidence. This was for me, no one else."
Frank Deford,"Everybody loves sports. It's awfully hard to be critical of these athletes -- they're young, they're strong, they're beautiful. You want to celebrate these guys."
Frank Deford,"... proud though I may be of my profession, it never occurred to me that it was meant to be a working majority, ... That more than half of young men in TV would want to cover sports has the same ring to it as if we learned more than half the males in medical school wanted to concentrate on cosmetic surgery."
Frank Deford,"[One] brought himself up by his bootstraps ... the other was born to comfort, a college man at a time when nobody went to college. Each saw in the other the thing he wanted to be."
Frank Deford,"I do wish we wouldn't pander to the same audience over and over again,"
Frank Deford,It was a great tragedy ... an athlete dying young always sets us back. We see them as so strong and handsome. We don't think they'll crumble.
Frank Deford,"She glances at the photo, and the pilot light of memory flickers in her eyes."
Ellen DeGeneres,"The only thing that scares me more than space aliens is the idea that there aren't any space aliens. We can't be the best that creation has to offer. I pray we're not all there is. If so, we're in big trouble."

Ellen DeGeneres,"Go to bed in your fireplace, you'll sleep like a log."
Ellen DeGeneres,"I think I let go of the need for approval, ... It certainly feels good when you get it, but I used to be more desperate for it. Once I felt better inside about myself ... I could do everything based on how I want to do things."
Ellen DeGeneres,"I think I let go of the need for approval,"
Ellen DeGeneres,"Nothing says holidays, like a cheese log."
Ellen DeGeneres,I was coming home from kindergarten - well they told me it was kindergarten. I found out later I had been working in a factory for ten years. It's good for a kid to know how to make gloves.
Ellen DeGeneres,Sometimes you can't see yourself clearly until you see yourself through the eyes of others.
Ellen DeGeneres,Just go up to somebody on the street and say You're it! and just run away.
Ellen DeGeneres,"In the beginning there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light. There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better."
Ellen DeGeneres,"I'm on the patch right now. Where it releases small dosages of approval until I no longer crave it, and then I'm gonna rip it off."
Ellen DeGeneres,Just go up to somebody on the street and say You're it! and then run away.
Ellen DeGeneres,"But seriously, I think overall in the scheme of things winning an Emmy is not important. Let's get our priorities straight. I think we all know what's really important in life - winning an Oscar."
Ellen DeGeneres,"Yeah I'm thirty-six, but on the show I'm thirty-two. Nobody wants to watch a thirty-six year old woman, so they decided to make me thirty-two. Much more appealing somehow."
Ellen DeGeneres,"I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her."

Dick DeGuerin,"Before the first indictment you tried to coerce a guilty plea from Tom DeLay for a misdemeanor, stating the alternative was indictment for a felony which would require his stepping down as Majority Leader of the House of Representatives."
Dick DeGuerin,"If you read the indictment, you can't tell what Tom DeLay is charged with doing."
Dick DeGuerin,We are ready now. We don't want to delay the disposition of this case.
Dick DeGuerin,It's payback against Tom DeLay.
Dick DeGuerin,"I thought that this would be resolved quickly, and Congressman DeLay can get back to Washington and resume his post. But obviously, the game here is to keep Congressman DeLay out of his leadership post in the Congress."
Dick DeGuerin,I think that the judicial system should not be open to the kind of criticism that would naturally happen if Judge Perkins remains on the case.
Dick DeGuerin,We're discussing it. Everything is on the table -- except compromise.
Dick DeGuerin,"Without those disclosures or your authority to make inquiry of grand jury members, we cannot go forward on that matter."
Dick DeGuerin,This was about the appearance of impropriety.
Dick DeGuerin,"Frankly, a judge should avoid even the appearance of impropriety."
Jim Delany,We have healthier programs in the middle than we've ever had. Part of that is based on more television opportunities for more people and more bowl opportunities for more people.
Jim Delany,"We choose to play at that time so whatever the consequences are, we bear them."
Jim Delany,"If you disagree with it, that's your right. It's your choice. It's OK, ... But we have a lot of people coming to our games. We've got a lot of people watching our games (on TV). ... Why would we change what we're doing?"

Jake Delhomme,"He hasn't lost his vision. That's one thing. He's good. The guy is smooth and knows how to set up blocks. He's a veteran, too. It's fun to watch him run. Hopefully everything works out all right physically, but certainly he looks good so far."
Jake Delhomme,"In practice, you can only simulate so much stuff. When you're live, things are different. You can't always drop back, set your feet, and throw the ball. You've got to be able to move around back there and make people miss and find your guys. I think Stefan does that extremely well."
Jake Delhomme,"He has so much power, he keeps on moving and grinding those legs. It was beautiful to watch. He just kept on going."
Jake Delhomme,"Oh, yeah, we heard him. I've got horses back in Louisiana and I wish I would have had one of those horse muzzles to put on him."
Jake Delhomme,"Tonight and tomorrow are going to be tough, but we've got to move on. We've got 15 more games and they come quick, real quick. We can't sit here and sulk because we've got a good football team coming in here next week."
Jake Delhomme,"When I talked to you guys after the game on Sunday, it was just one of those things where, if you've ever played a team sport, you're down, ... Certainly, I was extremely down. But things get put into perspective. When I get home, I have a little girl and get to spend time with her. It doesn't take away the pain, especially when you watch it on film. But that's the NFL. I don't mean to make light of it but I'll probably throw another one before my career is up. That's just part of it. It's going to happen. I've slept well the last couple of nights. You have to move on. I try to put things behind me. I'm not saying it's not a scar or anything, but you have to learn and move on."
Jake Delhomme,"We expected to move at a fast pace, and that's how coach Fox likes to practice. That's what's fun. ... You will have some mess-ups along the line, but you can move at a faster pace, and dive deeper into the offense quicker. And that's what makes it fun as a player."
Jake Delhomme,"Their front four really create pressure. When you have to throw the football and the defensive line can just pin their ears back and go, it is not a fun day sometimes."
Jake Delhomme,"If what we're doing can make them happy, we better do all we can. We're playing a game. They're fighting for their lives."
Jake Delhomme,This team has been here before. Guys want to make plays. Guys don't have big eyes in the huddle.
Jake Delhomme,"Just talking to some of those guys, you could almost kind of see hurt in their eyes because it's been a long, long year for them. We have no idea what they've had to go through."
Jake Delhomme,"I was encouraged, very encouraged -- we'll leave it at that."
Jake Delhomme,We still want to control the clock. Hopefully we're a smarter team now.
Jake Delhomme,"I asked him if it was his college number and he said that was No. 17. I told him he should have asked me. I would have given it to him,"

Michael Dell,"There are still opportunities to grow in desktop and mobile computing, ... To say we are going straight into the television market is a bit of an exaggeration. Computing is the core of our business."
Michael Dell,"Don't be afraid or run away from technology,"
Michael Dell,It also means their job is constantly changing because technology is changing and this is a customer-driven industry. So our employees need to be flexible and driven. They are going to always be in training.

Michael Dell,"The interesting thing is when we design and architect a server, we don't design it for Windows or Linux, we design it for both. We don't really care, as long as we're selling the one the customer wants."
Michael Dell,There are a lot of things that go into creating success. I don't like to do just the things I like to do. I like to do things that cause the company to succeed. I don't spend a lot of time doing my favorite activities.
Michael Dell,Twenty years and $40 billion. They seem like good round numbers.
Michael Dell,"Our business is about technology, yes. But it's also about operations and customer relationships."
Iris Dement,"Writing, overall, has never been what I'd call fun. It's fulfilling. It doesn't come real easy for me."
Iris Dement,Turn off the TV and start digging around for information that's not from a corporation trying to make money.
Iris Dement,"This is how it has been since time began: If you want to make something really worthwhile and true, then you have to suffer for it."
Iris Dement,"My guitar is really tempermental. I don't give up on it though, I'm close to my guitar!"
Iris Dement,Most of the music you hear on the radio today is developed for making money. It doesn't feel true or honest. You can feel it in the music.

Iris Dement,"I've always been aware of having feelings that were pretty intense at times. I imagine most people have had that, or they wouldn't be human."

Iris Dement,"I don't know what other people are like, I haven't been able to crawl inside anybody else."

Andrew Demetriou,"This year the umpires have been instructed to actively police tagging, blocking and any contact in marking contests not directly aimed at winning the ball."

Andrew Demetriou,"Football showed again that it is much more than a game, it is an unbreakable thread that weaves its way through our whole social fabric."
Andrew Demetriou,"I don't know why he ran from the car, I know we can all speculate . . . but he was a fool, he's quit the captaincy, he's paid a price . . . . He's a fool because it's not a good image for a captain of a football club. But he's been dealt with by the club under the code of conduct."
Andrew Demetriou,"I have no doubt the coverage will be enhanced on a national basis, particularly in NSW and Queensland, which will be great for our supporters."
Andrew Demetriou,The new broadcasting rights agreement will deliver the best financial and national programming package in the history of the game and provide an important contribution to the ongoing growth of our game.

Nelson DeMille,"If everyone howled at every injustice, every act of barbarism, every act of unkindness, then we would be taking the first step towards a real humanity."
Barbara Deming,I think the only choice that will enable us to hold to our vision. . . is one that abandons the concept of naming enemies and adopts a concept familiar to the nonviolent tradition: naming behavior that is oppressive . . .
Barbara Deming,"We learn best to listen to our own voices if we are listening at the same time to other women - whose stories, for all our differences, turn out, if we listen well, to be our stories also."
Barbara Deming,"We believe, in fact, that the one act of respect has little force unless matched by the other - in balance with it... The acting out of that dual respect I would name as precisely the source of our power."
Barbara Deming,"To resort to power one need not be violent, and to speak to conscience one need not be meek. The most effective action both resorts to power and engages conscience."

Barbara Deming,"The free man must be born before freedom can be won, and the brotherly man must be born before full brotherhood can be won. It will come into being only if we build it out of our very muscle and bone - by trying to act it out."
Barbara Deming,"Punishment cannot heal spirits, can only break them."
Barbara Deming,People who attack others need rationalizations for doing so. We undermine those rationalizations.
Barbara Deming,"Our task, of course, is to transmute the anger that is affliction into the anger that is determination to bring about change. I think, in fact, that one could give that as a definition of revolution."
Barbara Deming,"Of course it can be said of jails, too, that they try - by punishing the troublesome - to deter others. No doubt, in certain instances this deterrence actually works. But generally speaking it fails conspicuously."
Barbara Deming,Nonviolent tactics can move into action on our behalf men not naturally inclined to act for us.
Barbara Deming,Nonviolent action does not have to get others to be nice. It can in effect force them to consult their consciences.
Barbara Deming,I think the only choice that will enable us to hold to our vision... is one that abandons the concept of naming enemies and adopts a concept familiar to the nonviolent tradition: naming behavior that is oppressive.
Barbara Deming,"But if institutions of restraint might still be necessary, they should no longer be institutions of punishment at the same time."
Barbara Deming,All prisons that have existed in our society to date put people away as no human being should ever be put away.
Barbara Deming,"After the revolution, when one person injures another, society would concern itself most immediately to give help to the person who has been injured."
Barbara Deming,"After the revolution, surely the only good reason for institutions that could still be called prisons - because they take people and place them under restraint - is this reason: wanting to keep people from harming others."
Barbara Deming,"After the revolution, let us hope, prisons simply would not exist - if by prisons we mean places that could be experienced by the men and women in them at all as every place that goes by that name now is bound to be experienced."
Barbara Deming,"After the revolution, it might very well remain necessary to place people where they could not do harm to others. But the one under restraint should be cut off from the rest of society as little as possible."
Barbara Deming,Vengeance is not the point; change is. But the trouble is that in most people's minds the thought of victory and the thought of punishing the enemy coincide.
Barbara Deming,The point is to change one's life. The point is not to give some vent to the emotions that have been destroying one; the point is so to act that one can master them now.

Democritus,"By desiring little, a poor man makes himself rich."
Democritus,Men should strive to think much and know little.
Democritus,The wrongdoer is more unfortunate than the man wronged.
Democritus,It is greed to do all the talking but not to want to listen at all
Mickie DeMoss,I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it's our youth or the added pressure of playing there.
Mickie DeMoss,"Those losses drive her because she's still trying to perfect the game. You never do perfect it, but that's the carrot that's always dangling. It's the losses that keep driving her."
Mickie DeMoss,That was a really huge statement. It's a mirror image of what the men have on their side. The administration moved out and the coaches moved in. It's not the office - it's the message that sent.
Mickie DeMoss,It really is madness. This is the standard everyone measures their opening practice by.
Mickie DeMoss,"This is a really, really big win. I'm proud of how our kids kept their composure on the road."
Mickie DeMoss,"It's an honor to be recognized by your peers for your hard work and accomplishments, but it all boils down to the players buying into what you want them to do. You can know all the basketball in the world, but if your team can't commit to play hard and play together, then all that basketball doesn't mean much."
Mickie DeMoss,They don't lose too often. They'll probably come in here fighting mad.
Mickie DeMoss,They were able to execute a little bit better down the stretch. We made just a couple of execution mistakes that possibly could have given ourselves some better looks. Our timing was off a little and I don't know if that's youth or just lack of experience being in the NCAA tournament.
Mickie DeMoss,"They have the longest winning streak in the country, men or women. They haven't lost since November, so they would have to be coming in here feeling pretty good about themselves and feeling confident. They are a very strong 12th seed."
Mickie DeMoss,They proved why they're the No. 3 team in the country. They looked like the No. 1 team in the country.
Mickie DeMoss,"They have the longest winning streak in the country. I'd have to think his kids have a lot of confidence right now, and when you get in the tournament, you're certainly going to do anything to try to get your kids motivated."
Patrick Dempsey,"We need to spend more time here, ... If the show is about personal relationships, we need to expand that and show what their relationship is to the city.

Judi Dench,"I've figured out what to do so far, but it's always the next thing you come to where the man with the bucket of ice cold water is waiting - whoosh! in your face. That's why you work with directors who know what to tell you to do."
Judi Dench,"I would like to work with Jack Nicholson, before it's too late."
Judi Dench,"I work out the other bits, too, but I need to know what I look like, very early on. And then it's like a template; I'll fill that person out. If I get that out of the way, then I'm all right."

Judi Dench,It's incredibly moving to hear some of our greatest actors performing Shakespeare.
Judi Dench,"The more I do, the more frightened I get. But that is essential. Otherwise why would I go on doing it?"
Judi Dench,"Some things you know about, you know what the ingredients are - maybe not all of them. But it's up to you to put in the amount. It's up to the director to nag you until you get it right."
Judi Dench,Since Michael died I think I've worked constantly. Friends and colleagues are very sustaining. They're the people who get you through it... It's no good to be on your own.
Judi Dench,"Seriously, though, I think I never ceased to be grateful of the fact that I am able to do a job that I really love - I never got over that."
Judi Dench,People think you know beforehand when you win an Oscar - I can assure you you don't.
Judi Dench,"Michael died five years ago this January, and the first thing that really struck me about the script was the part about her peeling off from the funeral and just getting into a rowboat and having a real kind of cry where nobody was."
Judi Dench,"It was good to learn so early. They're not going to be kind to you. You have to do it and get on, and then gulp down and get better."

Catherine Deneuve,"I get irritated, nervous, very tense or stressed, but never bored."
Catherine Deneuve,I don't live that much with the character. I find it hard enough having to spend so many hours with the character during the day.
Catherine Deneuve,"I didn't devote my life to acting. I give a lot to my work, but my life has always been more important."
Catherine Deneuve,I can be very critical on myself and on other people; I can be very demanding.
Catherine Deneuve,"I have no physical courage, I've asked for a double."
Catherine Deneuve,I have been involved in some films other actresses would not have done.
Catherine Deneuve,"I have a strong sense of responsibility. I like to be directed, it's true. If I didn't like that, I'd do something else."
Catherine Deneuve,Opportunities are often things you haven't noticed the first time around.
Catherine Deneuve,I don't see any reason for marriage when there is divorce.
Catherine Deneuve,Paris is just special. I don't say that there are no other cities in America or Italy. But everybody wants to show in Paris.
Catherine Deneuve,"A woman has to be intelligent, have charm, a sense of humor, and be kind. It's the same qualities I require from a man."
Jan Denise,"It's amazing how my words, Ã´I am not determined to do good, but to be good,Ã¶ from The Person I Don't Have Time To Be have struck me on a deeper level. When I am good, I don't have to try to do good. When I am love, I don't have to worry about coming from love. I simply need to be who I am."
Jan Denise,"When I am me, I can see me in my space. My desk faces the window and an ocean. The flower on my desk gives off a wonderful aroma. The refrigerator has something in it I feel good about eating. When I am me, I can see me in my day. I am writing. I am talking from a heart of love. I am reviewing my notes, or editing, or walking, or something outside. I am connecting with nature and people."
Jan Denise,"Love really does make everything beautiful, from the inside out."
Jan Denise,"Living in the moment, yesterday is farther away than it used to be. And, so is tomorrow. They both matter less."
Jan Denise,"In my ideal life, I am ... If there's something on the list that I am not, I must ask myself if it's really me. And if it is, I must ask myself why I'm not manifesting it. When I see what's standing in my way, I can move beyond it."
Jan Denise,Life's not about staying on your feet. It's about getting up when you fall. Thank God!
Jan Denise,"Anytime I am looking to somebody else as my source, I'm coming from scarcity. I am no longer trusting God, or the Universe, for my harvest. It's reasonable for me to have expectations based on what somebody I trust has committed to. And it's natural for me to feel disappointed when that somebody doesn't come through. But when I feel more than disappointment, when I also feel anger, it's because I deviated from my truth. It's because I compromised my truth to get what somebody else promised. Because when I'm really following my truth, I will be at peace with the consequences Ã¹ whatever they are. I can accept somebody else's truth, but I must live my own truth. And sometimes that means walking away from a relationship."
Jan Denise,"Today, I will know the unadulterated joy of giving with no strings. I acknowledge that sometimes I hope for praise or reciprocation when I give ... and that that detracts from the joy of giving. Today, the giving will be my joy. I know that I will sow what I reap, but I will not sow for the purpose of reaping. I will sow for the joy of sowing."
Jan Denise,"As I was snuggling back into my bed after getting up to use the bathroom, I breathed a little, This must be like heaven. I love my bed. I love the ahh that comes with getting warm and smelling fresh sheets. I also love how it feels to get clean when I'm dirty and eat when I'm hungry. So, I'm thinking that maybe we still get cold, and dirty, and hungry in heaven. And, that's going to help me enjoy getting cold, and dirty, and hungry in earth (or in this body) just a little bit more."
Jan Denise,"I've been getting rid of some clutter anything that doesn't serve a positive purpose in my life and making room for things that feel happy to me. Because I get to make my life whatever I want it to be. I get to make the room feel however I want it to feel. I get to make the closet as full or as spacious as I want it. And, if I have more clutter to get rid of after Christmas, I'm not going to wait a year, or two or three to do it."

Jan Denise,The best advice we can give ourselves is the loving advice we'd give somebody else. I can get some great clarity during my own workshops.
Ron Dennis,"The drivers who just don't get out of the way influence the outcome of world championships. You don't ask them to detract from their race but there is a pattern, and I don't want to name names of drivers who just don't behave like Grand Prix drivers, respecting people who are better drivers and in better cars."
Ron Dennis,"We anticipate long term relationships with both Kimi and Juan Pablo and consequently, the team is not in negotiations with any other driver, including Michael Schumacher."
Ron Dennis,"We anticipate long-term relationships with both Kimi, who is currently competing in his fourth season with us, and Juan Pablo (Montoya)."
Ron Dennis,"We anticipate long-term relationships with both Kimi, who is in his fourth season with us, and Juan Pablo Montoya,"
Ron Dennis,We are very comfortable with the outcome of today's qualifying session and we look forward to our race strategy unfolding.
Ron Dennis,"Our computer simulation said a second and third was possible, based on our Friday dry running. The race win was never at any stage predicted by our system."
Ron Dennis,"But from our perspective, and we are not hiding from our inadequacies, it is statistically not borne out that we have huge reliability problems because if that was the case we would not have won 10 races."
Ron Dennis,Both drivers put in a faultless performance today which should have given the team maximum points. Kimi claimed his win in a disciplined and controlled manner in very difficult conditions. Juan Pablo was the innocent victim of other people's mistakes but this should not distract from his race which was executed with true team spirit. We of course take some satisfaction from winning eight of the last 11 Grands Prix. As you can imagine we are looking forward to Brazil in a positive frame of mind.
Ron Dennis,"It was an absolutely blameless situation for Juan Pablo, he was really the blameless victim of other people's mistakes,"
Ron Dennis,"We had a great strategy and Kimi drove an excellent race. The mathematics clearly demonstrate we are still capable of winning both world titles, but of course it is going to be somewhat challenging."
Ron Dennis,"The mathematics clearly demonstrate that we are still capable of winning both world championships, but of course it's going to be somewhat challenging."
Ron Dennis,"It's extremely positive for Formula One, ... intention was to turn their share certificates into money. This new shareholder has an interest in developing Formula One."
Ron Dennis,His commitment at the moment is exceptional. He's doing a lot of things by choice to try and put himself in a position where he hits the ground running.
Ron Dennis,Alonso got a points advantage which has allowed him to cruise a little bit but we still feel we did everything we thought was right in the early races.
John Denver,"Whatever meaning 'Annie's Song' had for me on a personal level, there was also a larger context. It could just as easily have been about love for a brother. Or a father. Or a friend. It could just as easily have been a prayer."
John Denver,"There's one piece of advice my dad gave me when he dropped me off at college. He said, You've got the talent. You can sing and play guitar. That doesn't make you any better than anyone else."
John Denver,"I am the eagle, I live in high country, in rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky;I am the hawk and there's blood on my feathers, but time is still turning they soon will be dry;All those who see me, and all who believe in me, share in the freedom I feel when I fly."
John Denver,"Perhaps love is like a resting place, A shelter from the storm, It exists to give you comfort, It is there to keep you warm, And in those times of trouble, When you are most alone, The memory of love will bring you home"
John Denver,"We must begin to make what I call conscious choices, and to really recognize that we are the same. It's from that place in my heart that I write my songs."
John Denver,Peace is a conscious choice.
John Denver,"We must begin to make what I call conscious choices, and to really recognize that we are the same. It's from that place in my heart that I write my songs."
John Denver,I would so much like young people to have a sense of the gift that they are. Not many of them feel like that.
John Denver,"I think the biggest problem in the world is that we have a generation of young people, and maybe two, who don't think it's going to get any better."
John Denver,"I believe that we are here for each other, not against each other. Everything comes from an understanding that you are a gift in my life - whoever you are, whatever our differences."
John Denver,"We don't teach kids how to feel, we don't give them the words to go by."
John Denver,"I get an awful lot of fan mail, and I read all that I can."

Gerard Depardieu,"My eye will roam with equal pleasure over the face of a beautiful woman as it will over the cuts of meat displayed in a butcher's shop window,"
Gerard Depardieu,I have learnt a lot about my body since my heart attack. I don't drink as much now as before.
Gerard Depardieu,"At twenty you have many desires which hide the truth, but beyond forty there are only real and fragile truths --your abilities and your failings."
Chauncey Depew,A pessimist is a man who thinks all women are bad. An optimist is one who hopes they are.

Chauncey Depew,"It is a pity that instead of the Pilgrim Fathers landing on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock had not landed on the Pilgrim Fathers."
Paul DePodesta,I hope so. I think we all hope so.
Paul DePodesta,"He's had nights like tonight, and early in the year he hit a handful of home runs in April and May. So there's no doubt the potential is there, because we've seen it. As with all young players, it's going to be about the consistency of his offense. But it was his effort level, and the above-average defense really solidified his spot on the club throughout the year. He's got elements of his game that you can't teach, like speed and outfield range, so that's certainly going to make him a valuable guy for us going forward."
Paul DePodesta,"In terms of what we've stood for as an organization, ... we take this history seriously."
Paul DePodesta,"Dr. Jobe has recommended surgery to repair the tendon. Needless to say, he's out for the foreseeable future."
Paul DePodesta,"Dodger owner Frank McCourt and I have made it crystal clear that character is an essential attribute for everyone within the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. As we have already stated, Milton Bradley has health issues that we expect he will address. We are disappointed that he is facing challenges away from the ballpark, but we are confident he will confront these issues as well. As these are personal matters for Milton Bradley, the team is not distracted and remains fully focused on winning the National League West Division."

As these are personal matters for Milton Bradley, the team is not distracted and remains fully focused on winning the National League West Division."
Paul DePodesta,"As a baseball operation, we are seeking to carry on the Dodgers' long tradition of developing top-notch players. This honor directly reflects on the job that amateur scouting director Logan White and player development director Terry Collins and their entire staffs have done in finding and cultivating the talent of these young players."
Paul DePodesta,"We're all in this together. It's not unlike a player move. Frank's given me the autonomy to make the baseball decisions, but he is the owner and we need to be on the same page. To this point, [his involvement] has never been an issue."
Johnny Depp,"Villiany wears many masks, non so dangerous as the mask of virtue."
Johnny Depp,"I know, ... To tell you the truth, I've been worshiping it from afar."
Johnny Depp,Am I a romantic? I've seen Wuthering Heights ten times. I'm a romantic.
Johnny Depp,"I'm more relaxed since I met Vanessa, I have more distance and therefore I have more perspective,"
Johnny Depp,Welcome to the Caribbean Love!
Johnny Depp,"When kids hit 1 year old, it's like hanging out with a miniature drunk. You have to hold onto them. They bump into things. They laugh and cry. They urinate. They vomit.'"
Johnny Depp,Luckily the kids are pretty well-balanced and well-grounded and not monster-like at all.
Johnny Depp,"When you live in Hollywood all the time you're constantly in that game, and you're susceptible to the pressures of success and the box office. I couldn't stand it because I had no interest in that."
Johnny Depp,"My upbringing made me as I am now. But I can become merry and happy at once. There were many years I was feeling at a loss about my life or how I grew up. I couldn't understand what is right or what is precious. At that time, I was so miserable and self-defeating. I was feeling angry with various things. My anger came up to the surface then. I don't say such tendency has disappeared. Even now there are anger and the dark side in myself. But it's the first time I've been so close to the light."
Johnny Depp,Actually I find myself sneaking a look at women's shoes and stockings. I've developed this subconscious habit. It may be a little dangerous -- I'm a little worried.
Johnny Depp,You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be appalled.
Johnny Depp,The wardrobe guy [of Blow] was a genius. He was so tapped into that period and he brought me the ugliest things I'd ever seen and then they were somehow beautiful.
Johnny Depp,We're in the middle of a divorce! D-I-V-O-R-C-E! DEE-VORCE!!!
Johnny Depp,May the wind always be on your back and the sun upon your face and may the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.
Johnny Depp,"I don't want to be stuck in one spot. My childhood was spent moving around. We were total nomads. Like gypsies, just moving from one place to another all the time. That's kind of ingrained into my psyche, into my being. I couldn't stand being in one spot for too long."
Johnny Depp,"When kids hit one year old, it's like hanging out with a miniature drunk. You have to hold onto them. They bump into things. They laugh and cry. They urinate. They vomit."
Johnny Depp,Trips to the dentist - I like to postpone that kind of thing.
Johnny Depp,"It's good to experience Hollywood in short bursts, I guess. Little snippets. I don't think I can handle being here all the time, it's pretty nutty."
Johnny Depp,"If there's any message to my work, it is ultimately that it's OK to be different, that it's good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color."
Johnny Depp,I think the thing to do is enjoy the ride while you're on it.
Johnny Depp,"I remember in that red leisure suit I sort of felt like a Pizza Hut employee, and the white one was the ultimate, with the white turtleneck collar, that was the ultimate in bad taste."
Johnny Depp,I guess I'm attracted to these off beat roles because my life has been a bit abnormal. The only thing I have a problem with is being labeled.
Johnny Depp,I am doing things that are true to me. The only thing I have a problem with is being labeled.
Johnny Depp,"I'm an old-fashioned guy... I want to be an old man with a beer belly sitting on a porch, looking at a lake or something."
Johnny Depp,There are necessary evils. Money is an important thing in terms of representing freedom in our world. And now I have a daughter to think about. It's really the first time I've thought about the future and what it could be.
Johnny Depp,I don't pretend to be captain weird. I just do what I do.
Johnny Depp,I think the thing to do is to enjoy the ride while you're on it.
Johnny Depp,I may have a feather duster down my pants.
Johnny Depp,You use your money to buy privacy because during most of your life you aren't allowed to be normal.

Johnny Depp,"I'm shy, paranoid, whatever word you want to use. I hate fame. I've done everything I can to avoid it."
Johnny Depp,The only creatures that are evolved enough to convey pure love are dogs and infants.
Johnny Depp,"With any part you play, there is a certain amount of yourself in it. There has to be, otherwise it's just not acting. It's lying."
Johnny Depp,"Tomorrow it'll all be over, then I'll have to go back to selling pens again."
Johnny Depp,I was ecstatic they re-named 'French Fries' as 'Freedom Fries'. Grown men and women in positions of power in the U.S. government showing themselves as idiots.
Johnny Depp,It's all kinds of these profound things crashing on you when your child arrives into the world. It's like you've met your reason to live.
Johnny Depp,There's a drive in me that won't allow me to do certain things that are easy.
Johnny Depp,The quality of life is so different in France. There is the possibility of living a simple life. I would never contemplate raising my daughter in LA. I would never raise any child there.
Johnny Depp,I think everybody's nuts.
Johnny Depp,"France, and the whole of Europe have a great culture and an amazing history. Most important thing though is that people there know how to live! In America they've forgotten all about it. I'm afraid that the American culture is a disaster."
Johnny Depp,"The only gossip I'm interested in is things from the Weekly World News - 'Woman's bra bursts, 11 injured'. That kind of thing."
Johnny Depp,I'm not sure I'm adult yet.
Johnny Depp,I pretty much try to stay in a constant state of confusion just because of the expression it leaves on my face.
Johnny Depp,"There are four questions of value in life... What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same. Only love."
Johnny Depp,"My body is a journal in a way. It's like what sailors used to do, where every tattoo meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist."
Johnny Depp,"My body is my journal,and my tattoos are my story"
Johnny Depp,"The beauty, the poetry of the fear in their eyes. I didn't mind going to jail for, what, five, six hours? It was absolutely worth it."
Johnny Depp,"America is dumb, it's like a dumb puppy that has big teeth that can bite and hurt you, aggressive. My daughter is four, my boy is one. I'd like them to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out."
Johnny Depp,"I hope some day to make you all a cup of coffee. Alright, peace."
Johnny Depp,As a teenager I was so insecure. I was the type of guy that never fitted in because he never dared to choose. I was convinced I had absolutely no talent at all. For nothing. And that thought took away all my ambition too.
Jacques Derrida,"Everything is arranged so that it be this way, this is what is called culture."
Jacques Derrida,Why is it the philosopher who is expected to be easier and not some scientist who is even more inaccessible?
Jacques Derrida,Who ever said that one was born just once?
Jacques Derrida,"Whatever precautions you take so the photograph will look like this or that, there comes a moment when the photograph surprises you. It is the other's gaze that wins out and decides."
Jacques Derrida,"We are all mediators, translators."
Jacques Derrida,These years of the Ecole Normale were an ordeal. Nothing was handed to me on the first try.
Jacques Derrida,"These critics organize and practice in my case a sort of obsessive personality cult which philosophers should know how to question and above all, to moderate."
Jacques Derrida,"The circle of the return to birth can only remain open, but this is a chance, a sign of life, and a wound."
Jacques Derrida,"The boarding-school experience in Paris was very hard, I didn't put up with it very well. I was sick all the time, or in any case frail, on the edge of a nervous breakdown."
Jacques Derrida,"Still today, I cannot cross the threshold of a teaching institution without physical symptoms, in my chest and my stomach, of discomfort or anxiety. And yet I have never left school."
Jacques Derrida,"No one gets angry at a mathematician or a physicist whom he or she doesn't understand, or at someone who speaks a foreign language, but rather at someone who tampers with your own language."
Jacques Derrida,"My most resolute opponents believe that I am too visible, that I am a little too alive, that my name echoes too much in the texts which they nevertheless claim to be inaccessible."
Jacques Derrida,"In philosophy, you have to reckon with the implicit level of an accumulated reserve, and thus with a very great number of relays, with the shared responsibility of these relays."
Jacques Derrida,"In certain situations, there is a classical function and responsibility there that must not be avoided, even if it is just to appeal to good sense."
Jacques Derrida,"In Algeria, I had begun to get into literature and philosophy. I dreamed of writing-and already models were instructing the dream, a certain language governed it."
Jacques Derrida,"If this work seems so threatening, this is because it isn't simply eccentric or strange, but competent, rigorously argued, and carrying conviction."
Jacques Derrida,"I wrote some bad poetry that I published in North African journals, but even as I withdrew into this reading, I also led the life of a kind of young hooligan."
Jacques Derrida,I never give in to the temptation to be difficult just for the sake of being difficult. That would be too ridiculous.
Jacques Derrida,"I have always had school sickness, as others have seasickness. I cried when it was time to go back to school long after I was old enough to be ashamed of such behavior."
Jacques Derrida,"I do not believe in pure idioms. I think there is naturally a desire, for whoever speaks or writes, to sign in an idiomatic, irreplaceable manner."
Jacques Derrida,I do everything I think possible or acceptable to escape from this trap.
Jacques Derrida,"I believe it is always a writer who is accused of being someone who is engaged in an explanation with language, the economy of language."
Jacques Derrida,I became the stage for the great argument between Nietzsche and Rousseau. I was the extra ready to take on all the roles.
Jacques Derrida,"Every discourse, even a poetic or oracular sentence, carries with it a system of rules for producing analogous things and thus an outline of methodology."

Jacques Derrida,"To pretend, I actually do the thing: I have therefore only pretended to pretend."
Jacques Derrida,"Within the university... you can study without waiting for any efficient or immediate result. You may search, just for the sake of searching, and try for the sake of trying.

Alan Dershowitz,We wouldn't even know where to look to find the law because there is no law.
Alan Dershowitz,All sides in a trial want to hide at least some of the truth.
Alan Dershowitz,"Judges are the weakest link in our system of justice, and they are also the most protected."

Kobita Desai,"Affordable services, increased penetration, and a willing Indian government would ensure and drive this kind of growth."
Kobita Desai,"Normally when such (foreign investment) agreements are spelt out, there are some fundamental control factors or check mechanisms that are implemented.

Rene Descartes,"Whenever anyone has offended me, I try to raise my soul so high that the offense cannot reach it"
Rene Descartes,"Good sense is of all things in the world the most equally distributed, for everybody thinks he is so well supplied with it, that even those most difficult to please in all other matters never desire more of it than they already possess."

Rene Descartes,The first precept was never to accept a thing as true until I knew it as such without a single doubt.

Rene Descartes,"Each problem that I solved became a rule, which served afterwards to solve other problems."
Rene Descartes,I am accustomed to sleep and in my dreams to imagine the same things that lunatics imagine when awake.
David Deutsch,"The theory of computation has traditionally been studied almost entirely in the abstract, as a topic in pure mathematics. This is to miss the point of it. Computers are physical objects, and computations are physical processes. What computers can or cannot compute is determined by the laws of physics alone, and not by pure mathematics."
David Deutsch,"Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make more sense than common sense."
David Deutsch,"The truly privileged theories are not the ones referring to any particular scale of size or complexity, nor the ones situated at any particular level of the predictive hierarchy, but the ones that contain the deepest explanations."
David Deutsch,"Time travel may be achieved one day, or it may not. But if it is, it should not require any fundamental change in world-view, at least for those who broadly share the world view I am presenting in this book."
David Deutsch,"Surely it is more interesting to argue about what the truth is, than about what some particular thinker, however great, did or did not think."
David Deutsch,"The overwhelming majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests."
David Deutsch,"Every potential angle is being looked at the same way as the previous crimes, ... We do have investigative leads."
David Deutsch,"Necessary truth is merely the subject-matter of mathematics, not the reward we get for doing mathematics. The object of mathematics is not, and cannot be, mathematical certainty. It is not even mathematical truth, certain or otherwise. It is, and must be, mathematical explanation."
David Deutsch,Is the human race a universal constructor?
David Deutsch,It is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every possible environment.
David Deutsch,Quantum computation is... a distinctively new way of harnessing nature... It will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes.
David Deutsch,Every problem that is interesting is also soluble.
David Deutsch,I myself believe that there will one day be time travel because when we find that something isn't forbidden by the over-arching laws of physics we usually eventually find a technological way of doing it.
Savitri Devi,"Respect the man of noble races other than your own, who carries out, in a different place, a combat parallel to yours -- to ours. He is your ally. He is our ally, be he at the other end of the world. Love all living things whose humble task is not opposed in any way to yours, to ours: men with simple hearts, honest, without vanity and malice, and all the animals, because they are beautiful, without exception and without exception indifferent to whatever idea there may be. Love them, and you will see the eternal in the glance of their eyes of jet, amber, or emerald. Love also the trees, the plants, the water that runs though the meadow and on to the sea without knowing where it goes; love the mountain, the desert, the forest, the immense sky, full of light or full of clouds; because all these exceed man and reveal the eternal to you."
Savitri Devi,"The unfortunate â€” the fools â€” are those men who, for some reason best known to themselves, â€” probably on account of their exaggerated estimation of what is to be lost in the process â€” would like to stop it. The privileged ones â€” the wise â€” are those few who, being fully aware of the increasing worthlessness of present-day mankind and of its much-applauded â€œprogress,â€ know how little there is to be lost in the coming crash and look forward to it with joyous expectation as to the necessary condition of a new beginning â€” a new â€œGolden Age,â€ sunlit crest of the next long drawn downward wave upon the surface of the endless Ocean of Life."
Savitri Devi,Europe is merely powerful; India is beautiful.
Savitri Devi,"I worship impersonal Nature, which is neither good or bad, and who knows neither love nor hatred."
Savitri Devi,"I believe in the Law of everlasting struggle, which is the law of life, and in the duty of the best specimens of our race - the natural 'lite of mankind - to rule the earth, and evolve out of themselves a caste of supermen, a people 'like unto the Gods'."
Savitri Devi,"A 'civilization' that makes such a ridiculous fuss about alleged 'war crimes' - acts of violence against the actual or potential enemies of one's cause - and tolerates slaughterhouses and vivisection laboratories, and circuses and the fur industry (infliction of pain upon creatures that can never be for or against any cause), does not deserve to live."
Savitri Devi,"Sincere thought, real free thought, ready, in the name of superhuman authority or of humble common sense, to question the basis of what is officially taught and generally accepted, is less and less likely to thrive. It is, we repeat, by far easier to enslave a literate people than an illiterate one, strange as this may seem at first sight. And the enslavement is more likely to be lasting."
Dan Devine,I'm going to be the next head coach at Notre Dame.
Dan Devine,I could have coached better.
Dan Devine,A team is a team is a team. Shakespeare said that many times.
Dan Devine,No one comes into our house and pushes us around.
Dick DeVos,"I think the gasoline tax, the sales tax on gasoline, should be suspended immediately."
Dick DeVos,The first thing that we need in Michigan is jobs. That's why I'm running is to create jobs in this state. Create an environment where we can get more people back to work.
Dick DeVos,"There are too many people who aren't able to find work. For the governor of this state, that's Job One."
Dick DeVos,"As a state, we have to engage the global marketplace. There is no alternative, no choice but to go out and win. The antagonists to this position see it as either/or -- either you invest in China or invest in Michigan. Most businesses do both. If your sales increase in any part of the world, the folks back home benefit."
Richard DeVos,"If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one!''"
Richard DeVos,"The riches of life, the love and joy and exhilaration of life can be found only with an upward look. This is an exciting world. It's cram-packed with opportunity. Great moments wait around every corner."
Richard DeVos,Few things in the world are more powerful than a positive push. A smile. A word of optimism and hope. And you can do it when things are tough.
Richard DeVos,"Life... It tends to respond to our outlook, to shape itself to meet our expectations."
Richard DeVos,"If you have a dream, give it a chance to happen."
Richard DeVos,"It is impossible to win the race unless you venture to run, impossible to win the victory unless you dare to battle."
Richard DeVos,The easiest thing to find on God's green earth is someone to tell you all the things you cannot do.
Lisa Dey,"We got out of two big jams against Southern Boone with running in scoring position, and that's big."
Lisa Dey,"We've adjusted really well to the pitching these last two games. If the top of our lineup is struggling, then the bottom half is strong, and that's a good thing to have."
Lisa Dey,"In the first two games of the season, we've scored quite a few runs, and I'm not complaining if the offense keeps rolling."
Lisa Dey,"It could very well be that kids who last year were in a comfort spot of, 'This is my spot, this is where I'm going to hit,' and then you mix it up a little bit. It was nice to see we'll be gradually getting Courtney back. She should be back before you know it -- she's healed and that will take us up another notch."
The Dhammapada,For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love - this is an old rule.
The Dhammapada,"Those who have high thoughts are ever striving; they are not happy to remain in the same place. Like swans that leave their lake and rise into the air, they leave their home and fly for a higher home."
The Dhammapada,"The traveler has reached the end of the journey! In the freedom of the infinite he is free from all sorrows, the fetters that bound him are thrown away, and the burning fever of life is no more."
The Dhammapada,"In the light of his vision he has found his freedom: his thoughts are peace, his words are peace and his work is peace."
The Dhammapada,For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love - this is an old rule
The Dhammapada,"When a man dwells on the objects of sense, he creates an attraction for them; attraction develops into desire, and desire breeds anger."
The Dhammapada,"He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a real driver; other people are but holding the reins"
The Dhammapada,"As in this body, there are for the embodied one childhood, youth, old age, even so is there the taking on of another body."
Purnama Dharmaji,Traditionally latex is coagulated with sulfate acid. It smells very bad. The liquid smoke technology helps reduce the bad odor. But the liquid smoke factory was officially opened only in 2004 with a capacity of seven tons of liquid smoke a day.
Purnama Dharmaji,Liquid smoke is easy to produce. The technology is very simple.
Purnama Dharmaji,"It can be turned into a powder that can be sprinkled on top of food, just like table salt."
Purnama Dharmaji,"In terms of food, so far we have only used liquid smoke as a preservative for fish and tofu. But I'm sure it can also be applied to other foods including noodles."
Peter Diamandis,"The New Mexico proposal was stronger, specifically on the strength of their financial bid. Governor Richardson is personally very excited about the whole space business and about building New Mexico into a central hub for public spaceflight."
Peter Diamandis,"The New Mexico proposal was stronger, specifically on the strength of their financial bid, ... Governor Richardson is personally very excited about the whole space business and about building New Mexico into a central hub for public spaceflight."
Peter Diamandis,"Space for far too long has been something we just see on TV or read about, and not something that we can personally participate in. And that's what our goal is here, to make it something you can personally get involved in."
Peter Diamandis,"Lindbergh made the flight to win a prize, not as a personal objective. I really saw the power of that prize written out for me in hard numbers: Nine teams spent [a combined] $400,000 to win that $25,000. It occurred to me that what space really needed was a prize to compel folks to build the ships that would take the rest of us there."
Peter Diamandis,"All of a sudden, something that was dangerous was attractive to potential sponsors who saw it as a highly visible thing, like race cars. Or it was attractive to wealthy individuals who were looking to do something fun."
Peter Diamandis,"The Rocket Racing League will inspire people of all ages to once again look up into the sky to find inspiration and excitement,"
Peter Diamandis,"This past fall, Zero-G was used in the premiere of season two of the TV show 'The Biggest Loser.' For this airing the producers created a competition where teams needed to gather colored plastic balls that were released and floated free. It was a very successful competition with great visuals."
Peter Diamandis,"This is where innovation begins. It's all part of the samemission, which is to make space personally accessible to the public."
Peter Diamandis,"From my standpoint, I think watching World Wrestling Entertainment where the competitors are wresting both during the zero-G and 1.8-G portions [of flight] could be a lot of fun."
Peter Diamandis,"New aerospace technologies coupled with the spirit of competition will not only extend the boundaries of entertainment, but continue the public's appetite for space ignited a year ago when the Ansari X-Prize was awarded."
Peter Diamandis,"We need to be willing to take risks we were willing to at the beginning of space exploration and every other frontier, ... We're not going to have these breakthroughs until we have a profitable industry."
Peter Diamandis,"Adventure travel is the fastest growing segment of the leisure travel business. And these X-Prize vehicles are basically the first step for future space-seeking adventure travelers,"
Jared Diamond,"Science is often misrepresented as the body of knowledge acquired by performing replicated controlled experiments in the laboratory. Actually, science is something broader: the acquisition of reliable knowledge about the world."
Jared Diamond,"If one of those friendly societies itself runs into environmental problems and collapses for environmental reasons, that collapse may then drag down their trade partners."
Jared Diamond,"Tasmania lies 130 miles southeast of Australia. When it was first visited by Europeans in 1642, Tasmania was occupied by 4,000 hunter-gatherers related to mainland Australians, but with the simplest technology of any recent people on Earth. Unlike mainland Aboriginal Australians, Tasmanians couldn't start a fire."
Jared Diamond,African cavalry mounted on rhinos or hippos would have made mincemeat of European cavalry mounted on horses. But it couldn't happen.
Jared Diamond,"why, for instance, only 2 per cent of Europeans contract the disease as opposed to 13 per cent of African Americans, 17 per cent of U.S. Latinos and up to 50 per cent of Native Americans"
Jared Diamond,"Science is often misrepresented as Ã¶the body of knowledge acquired by performing replicated controlled experiments in the laboratory.Ã¶ Actually, science is something broader: the acquisition of reliable knowledge about the world."
Jared Diamond,"Why were there far more species of domesticated animals in Eurasia than in the Americas? The Americas harbor over a thousand native wild mammal species, so you might initially suppose that the Americas offered plenty of starting material for domestication."
Jared Diamond,"Although native Africans domesticated some plants in the Sahel and in Ethiopia and in tropical West Africa, they acquired valuable domestic animals only later, from the north."
Jared Diamond,"The United States has long thought of itself as the land of infinite plenty, and historically we did have abundant resources. But now we are gradually exhausting our fisheries, our topsoil, our water. On top of that, we're coming to the end of world resources."
Jared Diamond,"Domesticated plants and animals yield far more calories per acre than do wild habitats, in which most species are inedible to humans."
Jared Diamond,"The broadest pattern of history - namely, the differences between human societies on different continents - seems to me to be attributable to differences among continental environments, and not to biological differences among peoples themselves."
Jared Diamond,"Twenty years ago, you might have been pessimistic and said there's no hope. But these days, some of our very biggest companies are acting remarkably cleanly. And in some cases, although not all cases, the CEOs are the driving forces behind that."
Jared Diamond,"Introspection and preserved writings give us far more insight into the ways of past humans than we have into the ways of past dinosaurs. For that reason, I'm optimistic that we can eventually arrive at convincing explanations for these broadest patterns of human history."
Jared Diamond,"I've always been interested in a lot of things, and a lot of things at the same time, and I always tried to explain them to myself. I ask a lot of questions."
Jared Diamond,"No government is here forever. And there are other forces - the most potent force in our society, in fact, big business - doing good for the environment."
Jared Diamond,Human societies vary in lots of independent factors affecting their openness to innovation.
Jared Diamond,"We're uncomfortable about considering history as a science. It's classified as a social science, which is considered not quite scientific."
Jared Diamond,Eurasia ended up with the most domesticated animal species in part because it's the world's largest land mass and offered the most wild species to begin with.
Jared Diamond,"Australia is the smallest continent, and most of it can support only small human populations because of low rainfall and productivity."
Jared Diamond,"We can't manipulate some stars while maintaining other stars as controls; we can't start and stop ice ages, and we can't experiment with designing and evolving dinosaurs."
Jared Diamond,All human societies go through fads in which they temporarily either adopt practices of little use or else abandon practices of considerable use.
Jared Diamond,"Infectious diseases introduced with Europeans, like smallpox and measles, spread from one Indian tribe to another, far in advance of Europeans themselves, and killed an estimated 95% of the New World's Indian population."
Jared Diamond,"It's striking that Native Americans evolved no devastating epidemic diseases to give to Europeans, in return for the many devastating epidemic diseases that Indians received from the Old World."
Jared Diamond,Native Americans had only stone and wooden weapons and no animals that could be ridden. Those military advantages repeatedly enabled troops of a few dozen mounted Spaniards to defeat Indian armies numbering in the thousands.
Jared Diamond,"The southward advance of native African farmers with Central African crops halted in Natal, beyond which Central African crops couldn't grow - with enormous consequences for the recent history of South Africa."
Jared Diamond,I'd rather spend my leisure time doing what some people call my work and I call my fun.
Jared Diamond,"AIDS and malaria and TB are national security issues. A worldwide program to get a start on dealing with these issues would cost about $25 billion... It's, what, a few months in Iraq."
Jared Diamond,"Measles and TB evolved from diseases of our cattle, influenza from a disease of pigs, and smallpox possibly from a disease of camels. The Americas had very few native domesticated animal species from which humans could acquire such diseases."
Jared Diamond,I personally am not conscious of my accent.
Jared Diamond,"Why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents for the last 13,000 years?"
Jared Diamond,"Technology causes problems as well as solves problems. Nobody has figured out a way to ensure that, as of tomorrow, technology won't create problems. Technology simply means increased power, which is why we have the global problems we face today."
Jared Diamond,Australia is the most isolated continent.
Jared Diamond,"Thousands of years ago, humans domesticated every possible large wild mammal species fulfilling all those criteria and worth domesticating, with the result that there have been no valuable additions of domestic animals in recent times, despite the efforts of modern science."
Jared Diamond,"Starbucks goes to a great effort, and pays twice as much for its coffee as its competitors do, and is very careful to help coffee producers in developing countries grow coffee without pesticides and in ways that preserve forest structure."
Jared Diamond,"If you gave me 10 million dollars, I wouldn't live any differently. Although nowadays I guess you'd have to raise that to 20 million to mean anything."
Jared Diamond,"Take air quality in the United States today: It's about 30 percent better than it was 25 years ago, even though there are now more people driving more cars."
Jared Diamond,"Tasmanian history is a study of human isolation unprecedented except in science fiction - namely, complete isolation from other humans for 10,000 years."
Jared Diamond,"We study the injustices of history for the same reason that we study genocide, and for the same reason that psychologists study the minds of murderers and rapists... to understand how those evil things came about."
Jared Diamond,Federal elections happen every two years in this country. Presidential elections every four years. And four years just isn't long enough to dismantle all the environmental laws we've got in this country.
Jared Diamond,"The rate of human invention is faster, and the rate of cultural loss is slower, in areas occupied by many competing societies with many individuals and in contact with societies elsewhere."
Jared Diamond,I decided that now is the time to start doing the things that really interest me and I find important. It was in the 10 years of the MacArthur grant that I began working on my first book... and I began putting more work into environmental history.
Jared Diamond,"Lest those islands still seem to you too remote in space and time to be relevant to our modern societies, just think about the risks... of our increasing globalization and increasing worldwide economic interdependence."
Jared Diamond,"Some people have much more pull than other people. But when I say that the public has ultimate responsibility, I'm not saying it in a moral sense. I'm just saying it in the sense of what is it that's really going to bring change."
Jared Diamond,Biology is the science. Evolution is the concept that makes biology unique.
Jared Diamond,"Until the end of the last Ice Age around 11,000 B.C., all humans on all continents were still living as Stone Age hunter/gatherers."
Jared Diamond,Technology has to be invented or adopted.
Neil Diamond,"I'm lucky.  Hard work is the key, but luck plays a part."
Neil Diamond,"I made a U-turn and went back 40 years to try to recapture those feelings, ... The major difference between this album and my first or second album is I think the lyrics now go to places I could never go to then."
Neil Diamond,"When you're on a merry-go-round, you miss a lot of the scenery."
Neil Diamond,"There's a mystery to writing, and you don't really know where most of it comes from."
Neil Diamond,"The main objective in any song, the songs that I write, has always been that it reflect the way I feel, that it touch me when I'm finished with it, that it moves me, that it can take me along with it and involve me in what its saying."
Neil Diamond,Songwritng is what I do.
Neil Diamond,"Songwriting is different from music, although I don't deny now that it would be nice to have a little more background in music theory."
Neil Diamond,Songs are life in 80 words or less.
Neil Diamond,"Song Sung Blue took a lot of compressing and refining, and it has one of my favorite lyrics."
Neil Diamond,"Performing is the easiest part of what I do, and songwriting is the hardest."
Neil Diamond,"No, I majored in biology, in a pre-med program."
Neil Diamond,"If it can affect me, if it has meaning to me, if I feel I can do it well, I will do it and record it and thats why I recorded these songs."
Neil Diamond,"I've looked at photographs of myself during concerts and it sometimes looks as if I'm in a fencing move, with a guitar in my hands instead of a sword."
Neil Diamond,"I've always thought of music as something which gives the words their flight and their wings and the music often comes first, although sometimes I'll have a concept, a title idea, a lyric idea that I want to write and the lyric will come first."
Neil Diamond,"I'm lucky. Hard work is the key, but luck plays a part."
Neil Diamond,I think probably Australians have just a little more taste than most people.
Neil Diamond,I still need practice in enjoying the fruits of success.
Neil Diamond,I don't like all of the music to be serious and deadly.
Neil Diamond,Chelsea Morning is a great Joni Mitchell song and I guess I'm partial to her lyrics because they show me a slightly different perspective on life.
Neil Diamond,"Brooklyn is not the easiest place to grow up in, although I wouldn't change that experience for anything."
Neil Diamond,"Because my musical training has been limited, I've never been restricted by what technical musicians might call a song."
Neil Diamond,"I came back to performing with a different attitude about performing and myself. I wasn't expecting perfection any more, just hoping for an occasional inspiration."
Neil Diamond,It's very difficult for me to say 'I love you' but to sing 'I love you' for me is easier.
Russ Diamond,All these have been through our support period. Others are going through the process.
Russ Diamond,We're in the middle of vetting potential candidates.
Russ Diamond,"Instead of just giving us a tax break and putting the money back into the General Fund, we've got to go knock on their door, tell them what our cause is. And the truth is, we don't send them to Harrisburg to be sugar daddies."
Russ Diamond,It takes courage to overthrow your government.
Russ Diamond,"I'm going to retake ownership of my constitution. The constitution was written to limit the power of those we elect to office. This fight is a very important one. There are 12.5 million Pennsylvanians and 253 people in office in Harrisburg, drunk on the power. They don't get it. Out here, it's us versus them."
Russ Diamond,"When there?s competition, the cream rises to the top. Pennsylvania is tired of the same old sour milk."
Russ Diamond,Part of the beauty of freedom is that freedom is chaotic.
Lou DiBella,"To tell you the truth, that fight should have been stopped 30 seconds before it was."
Lou DiBella,I squeezed his hand in the ambulance and he opened his eyes and said he had a terrible headache and then he passed out again.
Lou DiBella,"On June 17, everybody is going to see clearly who's the real champion."
Lou DiBella,That's a disincentive to being the undisputed champion.
Lou DiBella,This diminishes nothing. He is still the undisputed champion.
Lou DiBella,"He had a good 24 hours, ... Doctors said the swelling in his brain did go down.                                                                                                                         They wouldn't go so far as to say he is out of danger, but they are now more optimistic."
Lou DiBella,"It has an extremely strong, hard-core audience, ... It has been marginalized as a sport of cable TV. It's never been an advertiser-friendly sport because you don't know how long a bout will go, and some advertisers are hesitant due to its perception of something of a blood sport. But I don't think anyone is going to lose money on this bout."

Leonardo DiCaprio,My mother is a walking miracle...
Leonardo DiCaprio,There's some of Romeo's romance in me... I romanticise a lot of things in my mind...
Leonardo DiCaprio,The last thing I want to turn into is a fat Hollywood jerk. I was brought up without much money and I was happy. I don't think that I will strive for money or success and end up greedy or big-headed. That only leads to unhappiness. I can still be dow
Leonardo DiCaprio,"My God, no! I hate this whole hunk thing! I feel when I see myself in that, and these other cute faces, that I'm just part of this meat factory, like, Wow! Here's the hunk of the month! This month we're shoving Leonardo DiCaprio down your throat! Isn"

Leonardo DiCaprio,"People want you to be a crazy, out-of-control teen brat. They want you miserable, just like them. They don't want heroes; what they want is to see you fall."
Leonardo DiCaprio,"When I grew up, I lived in the ghettos of Hollywood; it was the most disgusting place to be. I was known as the crazy little kid. I did impressions. Then I realized that's not what I want to do. I don't want to be a comedian to please other people."
Leonardo DiCaprio,Anyone I'm with has to give me freedom. I like to be with someone who has character and style and someone who is very understanding.
Leonardo DiCaprio,What I really wanted was to travel and see all the different animals that were on the verge of extinction.
Leonardo DiCaprio,"I want to be a jerk like the rest of my friends, and have fun, and not care about the consequences, but I just can't now."

Leonardo DiCaprio,"To believe in love, to be ready to give up anything for it, to be willing to risk your life for it, is the ultimate tragedy."
Leonardo DiCaprio,"With Romeo and Juliet, you're talking about two people who meet one night, and get married the same night. I believe in love at first sight-but it hasn't happened to me yet."

Leonardo DiCaprio,"I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn't mean we are dating."
Leonardo DiCaprio,I've never been Romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately. It's been a much slower process for me each time I've gone into a relationship.
Tony DiCecco,"Tara King is really on her game right now. We still need to get a couple more perimeter players to knock down shots for us, but Tara did a great job of hitting some big ones."
Tony DiCecco,"This was a very, very, very physical game, and it's hard to officiate when it gets like that."
Tony DiCecco,It was a very disappointing loss. We didn't do what we needed to do down the stretch for us to win the basketball game. Creighton did.

Charles Dickens,The mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of King Charles's head into my head.
Charles Dickens,". . . I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it."

Charles Dickens,"To be shelterless and alone in the open country, hearing the wind moan and watching for day through the whole long weary night; to listen to the falling rain, and crouch for warmth beneath the lee of some old barn or rick, or in the hollow of a tree; are dismal things -- but not so dismal as the wandering up and down where shelter is, and beds and sleepers are by thousands; a houseless rejected creature."

Charles Dickens,Philosophers are only men in armor after all.
Charles Dickens,"When you're a married man, Samivel, you'll understand a good many things as you don't understand now; but whether it's worth while, going through so much, to learn so little, as the charity-boy said when he got to the end of the alphabet, is a matter o taste."

Charles Dickens,"A moment, and its glory was no more. The sun went down beneath the long dark lines of hill and cloud which piled up in the west an airy city, wall heaped on wall, and battlement on battlement; the light was all withdrawn; the shining church turned cold and dark; the stream forgot to smile; the birds were silent; and the gloom of winter dwelt on everything."

William Diehl,"With today's introduction of the GatewayÂ® E-1500 and E-2600, professional IT managers don't have to compromise when it comes to outfitting employees with powerful new PCs. The combination of Intel processors with ATI's chipset enables us to offer systems with feature sets unheard of at these price points, while still meeting professional customers' demands for manageability and stability."
William Diehl,"Securing the data on notebook PCs is one of the toughest challenges for I.T. professionals, and with the proliferation of mobile computing across all business segments, the threat of data loss and network breaches through theft of notebooks has never been greater."

Richard Dieter,You want to put on a case that enables the jury to see the humanity of this person.
Richard Dieter,"This stage of the penalty phase was probably harder for the government, but that was before he took the stand and connected all the dots for the jury."
Richard Dieter,"It would be counterproductive to force the issue, then have a 5-4 vote that juveniles can be executed, ... The issue then may not be revisited for a long time. It may be a better thing for the issue to percolate, for states to ban executing minors on their own, instead of being forced to by the courts."
Richard Dieter,New Jersey has stopped all executions. Four stays of execution have been granted on this issue in various states. The US supreme court has taken a case related to this issue.
Richard Dieter,"Someone, either a judge or a jury, must determine beyond a reasonable doubt that government has proven an aggravating factor beyond guilt."
Richard Dieter,There's now considerable public skepticism about whether all those being executed are really guilty and that has cast doubt on the whole system.
Richard Dieter,This is a proper action for the governor to take. It's not right to shy away from a difficult question or even shy away from reopening cases when there is a chance that something new might be learned.

Marlene Dietrich,I'm worth more dead than alive. Don't cry for me after I'm gone; cry for me now.
Marlene Dietrich,"Once a woman has forgiven a man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast"
Marlene Dietrich,"To be completely woman you need a master, and in him a compass for your life. You need a man you can look up to and respect. If you dethrone him it's no wonder that you are discontented, and discontented women are not loved for long."
Marlene Dietrich,"[The lover says:] How beautiful you are, now that you love me"
Marlene Dietrich,Courage and grace are a formidable mixture. The only place to see it is in the bullring.

Trent Dilfer,It was just one mistake of many. We all took our turn making mistakes.
Trent Dilfer,Those guys (on the offensive line) have done a great job. You can't say enough good things about them.  They've been the main reason we've been able to move the ball effectively the first two games.
Trent Dilfer,"I put the burden on me. I don't care how low it is, it's my job to get it. I saw the ball. I tried to go down and get it. It hit off my foot. I tried to grab it and Ray took it from me."
Trent Dilfer,"I love him, ... He's a great player. He immediately makes you a better football team. There's not many players, outside of quarterbacks, who when they walk into the locker room, you're a better team. It's simple. When he's there, you're better. And when he leaves, you're worse off."
Trent Dilfer,"I held out for 12 days. It was a wonderful decision financially and a horrible decision football-wise. Being completely honest with that, if I had to go back to do it all over again, I'd have sacrificed the $2 million I made to be a better football player my first couple years."

Trent Dilfer,"Thats how it should be, ... Ive always been a believer that nobody should be safe, that you should have to earn your position week in and week out and perform. I expect that."
Trent Dilfer,"We're not afraid to say what we think we're going to do. I'm not a big believer in talking before the game, but this team has the ability to back up pretty much anything it says."
Trent Dilfer,"Thatâ€™s how it should be, ... Iâ€™ve always been a believer that nobody should be safe, that you should have to earn your position week in and week out and perform. I expect that."
Trent Dilfer,"His greatest impact would be just his presence, ... I believe now that Ricky Watters is gone, I'm the only guy on this roster who's won a Super Bowl. But Shannon would change that. He's won three. He knows what it takes and his daily regimen shows the commitment level that's necessary. Guys would come to view him as the most credible player to show us all how to do this thing."
Trent Dilfer,the finest athlete I have ever seen.
Trent Dilfer,"Went to 16 and hit a really bad 3 wood for my second shot and got stuck in the bunker about 70 yards from the pin. Poor execution, chunked it, hit a good chip up to about eight feet, missed it."
Trent Dilfer,"There's nothing wrong with failing if you learn from it, and I've failed out here plenty."
Trent Dilfer,"There are some guys out here that can really play golf, but it has not been their focus for that long."
Trent Dilfer,The guy next to me is going to be best player out here when he starts doing it full time. A lot of us have been playing other sports.
Trent Dilfer,So I went way too in depth? I thought they wanted the hole by hole.
Trent Dilfer,"I'm excited to see how I'll hold up under pressure. I'm swinging as well as I've ever swung the golf club, so we'll see if that holds up."

Trent Dilfer,"Hit the ball pretty solid. Haven't played a lot of golf this year, so was really unsure of what it would be like. I've been playing pretty well lately, especially hitting the ball solid."
Annie Dillard,I think the dying pray at the last not please but thank you as a guest thanks his host at the door
Annie Dillard,"It could be that our faithlessness is a cowering cowardice born of our very smallness, a massive failure of imagination. If we were to judge nature by common sense or likelihood, we wouldn't believe the world existed."
Annie Dillard,"The writer studies literature, not the world. He is careful of what he reads, for that is what he will write."

Annie Dillard,"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives."

Annie Dillard,"I woke in bits, like all children, piecemeal over the years. I discovered myself and the world, and forgot them, and discovered them again."
Annie Dillard,There is a muscular energy in sunlight corresponding to the spiritual energy of wind.

John Dillon,"We've got the best bid, we're excited about Champion, it's a company that fits very well with International Paper ( IP : Research , Estimates ). They're headquartered very close to our headquarters. Their businesses fit very well with ours - big printing papers business, an important wood and timber business - and they've got a nice, nice position in Brazil, as well as a position in Canada. We see $425 million in merger benefits from putting two U.S. organizations together."
John Dillon,"Now that the merger is completed and we have had a closer look into Champion's businesses, we are even more optimistic about the opportunities this acquisition will provide,"
Paul Dillon,In one sense there has been a lot of progress but there is a heck of a lot more to be done.

Joe DiMaggio,"I'm a ballplayer, not an actor."

Joe DiMaggio,"The phrase 'off with the crack of the bat', while romantic, is really meaningless, since the outfielder should be in motion long before he hears the sound of the ball meeting the bat."
Joe DiMaggio,"There is always some kid who may be seeing me for the first or last time, I owe him my best."
Joe DiMaggio,"I'm just a ballplayer with one ambition, and that is to give all I've got to help my ball club win. I've never played any other way."

James Dimon,"Yes, we are disappointed in the volatility. The management team understands that one of our goals is to reduce that."

Jim Dine,"I've never had an easy relationship with critics. I hold a lot of homicide in my heart. If this was another time, I'd be packing a piece."
Jim Dine,"I have come to terms with a lot of things, because, when all's said and done, there's really very little one can do about a lot of things. You just accept them. The point is you just have to keep on working and you just have to keep on living."

Isak Dinesen,"I do not know if you remember the tale of the girl who saves the ship under mutiny by sitting on the powder barrel with her lighted torch and all the time knowing that it is empty? This has seemed to me a charming image of the women of my time. There they were, keeping the world in order by sitting on the mystery of life, and knowing themselves that there was no mystery."
Isak Dinesen,"When you have a great and difficult task, something perhaps almost impossible, if you only work a little at a time, every day a little, suddenly the work will finish itself."
Isak Dinesen,Who tells a finer tale than any of us. Silence does.

Mike Ditka,"You see people who have been very heavy in their life who have taken that body, trimmed it down, firmed it up through discipline, exercise and being able to say no. Eating properly, that all comes into it."
Mike Ditka,Some people are willing to pay the price and it's the same with staying healthy or eating healthy. There's some discipline involved. There's some sacrifices.
Mike Ditka,"So, when it comes to eating healthy, it's just doing the right thing. And it's not something you have to do 365 days a year, but I think it's something you have to do 25 days a month. Let's put it that way."

Jamie Dixon,"He's better in every area. Carl's comfortable in his position and understanding of our system. That's a big step. It's one thing to know it, but it's another thing to pass it on to others."
Jamie Dixon,"It wasn't our prettiest game. It was tough, and we battled through. We had guys in foul trouble. Aaron and Carl played the whole game with their hands in their pockets. We played our usual rotation, playing a lot of guys, and it benefited us a lot. We'll continue to do that. It's the best thing for this group. So many guys made big plays."
Jamie Dixon,A strength of this team is our depth. We've said from the start of the season that it's a good rotation we have.
Jamie Dixon,"He's grown an inch, and he's gradually put on weight. Strength is a big thing."
Jamie Dixon,What he's doing best this year is keeping the ball up around the basket. He's running better. He's jumping better. He's chasing down shots a lot better than he ever had. But it's not like all of a sudden this summer he decided to work on these things. He's been constantly improving.
Jamie Dixon,"He was somewhat light-headed and dizzy, but he battled through it. He wasn't running the floor like he usually is able to, but he still managed to grab 20 rebounds. That says a lot about him as a player."
Jamie Dixon,"We're not near where we need to be defensively. We need to make significant progress there, but we have the ability to do it."
Jamie Dixon,"He flew in today, but he didn't practice with us."
Jamie Dixon,Not often do you lose a game when you shot over 70 percent in a half. It is tough to lose a game when you shoot that. I thought our offense was good and we made good decisions and (had) good looks. Its amazing how one little thing can change the outcome of the game.
Jamie Dixon,Our family thanks everyone for their support and prayers and asks for their continued respect and privacy.
Jamie Dixon,We had good execution throughout the game. We recognized some things of how they played and executed our plan.
Jamie Dixon,It was perfect execution by two freshmen and a sophomore. Five guys did exactly what we wanted to do.
Jamie Dixon,We've been able to celebrate Big East championships and NCAA Tournament appearances while playing in the sold out Petersen Events Center. That success on the court has been mirrored by tremendous academic achievement. Pitt basketball has a very bright future and we are working to build on our recent success.
Jamie Dixon,"It's my desire to have assistants who aspire to be head coaches. I know that's been the goal for Barry and Joe, and that's why I'm so excited about their opportunities. Both have made invaluable contributions to our program. The University of Pittsburgh is very indebted to them."
Jamie Dixon,"It's probably tougher for my dad and my mom, who want to figure out a way to go to both games."
Jamie Dixon,"We're 16-1. I wouldn't want to be complaining about that. No one would listen. We're getting better and improving every game. Even (against St. John's), we got much better in the second half."
Jamie Dixon,I want guys who want to be head coaches. To be a good head coach you have to be a good assistant first. I want our guys looking at head coaching jobs and preparing to be head coaches because that makes them good assistant coaches.
Jamie Dixon,"Maggie touched so many people beyond basketball. Our family has received an outpouring of sympathy from across the country and we are deeply appreciative. As her older brother I know she looked up to me. But I always looked up to her, too, and it's obvious that a lot of other people did as well."
Jamie Dixon,"We stressed getting off to a good start and being ready to go, but my advice didn't go very far."
Jamie Dixon,We had a size advantage. We have to win the battle of the boards. That's what we base what we do on.
Jamie Dixon,What we were able to do more in the second half was contain their quickness and ability to get penetration. We just had to stay with our game plan.
Juan Dixon,"It's easy looks. When you have a guy who's going to demand a double team, someone's going to get easy looks."
Juan Dixon,"Our defense was great. Can't say enough about our defense. It's tough, because it easily could've been a five-game winning streak if we just executed better down the stretch."
Juan Dixon,"I really don't even know what to say. I've lost before, but never like this. We're just a confidence-booster for other teams."
Milovan Djilas,"[Tyranny is] to compel men not to think as they do, to compel men to express thoughts that are not their own."
Milovan Djilas,The strongest are those who renounce their own times and become a living part of those yet to come. The strongest and the rarest.
Milovan Djilas,Normal life cannot sustain revolutionary attitudes for long.
Milovan Djilas,"Ideology in the Soviet Union is both dead, and very much alive! Dead at the level of faith; alive as an indispensable rationale of policy"
Shane Doan,"He has so much on his plate, we don't worry about his schedule."
Shane Doan,"When we play as a team with five men, we're solid. It's when we get trying to do individual stuff that we really struggle."
Shane Doan,"We had some big goals to keep tying it up, but we needed to find a way to get that lift and to get the one to get the lead. We never managed to get the lead."
Shane Doan,"It was huge, obviously. There's a lot of emotion in a home opener, and you want to come out controlled, work hard and stay disciplined enough, and we stayed with it."
Shane Doan,"It's encouraging that we're going in the right direction, but the goal is to make the playoffs. We're getting close."
Shane Doan,Everyone's disappointed that they just don't get to be around him every day. His credentials and his character are very unique. He was fun to be around.
Shane Doan,"In America, nobody has any idea what Wayne is. If you took Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Derek Jeter, Brett Favre and kind of put them all into one, that type of following would almost be the same as what Wayne has in Canada."

James Dobson,"There are very few certainties that touch us all in this mortal experience, but one of the absolutes is that we will experience hardship and stress at some point."
James Dobson,Don't throw away your friendship with your teenager over behavior that has no great moral significance. There will be plenty of real issues that require you to stand like a rock. Save your big guns for those crucial confrontations.
James Dobson,My observation is that women are merely waiting for their husbands to assume leadership.
James Dobson,God has called us to be His representatives in our nation and in our world. Select candidates who represent your views and work for their election.
James Dobson,"I'm certain that most couples expect to find intimacy in marriage, but it somehow eludes them."
James Dobson,Children are not casual guests in our home. They have been loaned to us temporarily for the purpose of loving them and instilling a foundation of values on which their future lives will be built.
James Dobson,"Sometimes we're so concerned about giving our children what we never had growing up, we neglect to give them what we did have growing up."
James Dobson,Don't marry the person you think you can live with; marry only the individual you think you can't live without.
Christopher Dodd,"Some of the lowest-paid workers in this nation are people that we ask to watch the next generation of Americans. We do a better job insisting that your pets are cared for in this country than your children are, and there ought to be a sense of outrage about that."
Christopher Dodd,"We've got a very busy agenda at the U.N., it's going to be very difficult to get the job done. Let's get behind him, let him do his work  I certainly want to see him succeed but I'm going to watch him carefully."

Christopher Dodd,The Senate's tradition is ruled to protect debate and guarantee that we can't be trampled upon.
Christopher Dodd,"Direct mail service is not likely to happen without cooperation from the Cuban government, nor the scholarship programs for Cuban students. Humanitarian assistance by non-governmental organizations is already ongoing."

Christopher Dodd,"Rumsfeld is violating the law, ... It's been sitting on the books for over a year. They were opposed to it. It was insulting to them. I'm sorry that's how they felt."
Christopher Dodd,"This measure [class action reform bill] is a common-sense measure. It will ensure that people have a right to sue when harmed, and at the same time the bill will put an end to suits that leave consumers with pennies and small businesses with needless legal bills."
Christopher Dodd,"He is a person of outstanding ability and strong character who possesses in my view a deep commitment to the law and the principle of equal justice for all,"
Christopher Dodd,It's easy for Americans to forget that the food they eat doesn't magically appear on a supermarket shelf.
Christopher Dodd,We learned that economic growth and environmental protection can and should go hand in hand.
Betty Dodson,"When I do documentaries, my best information ends up on the cutting-room floor. People have trouble dealing with sexual honesty."
Betty Dodson,The person whose face is between your legs is gonna get lockjaw.
Betty Dodson,The media only wants to get the view of the flaming radicals because they make better copy than those of us who are more sensible. I'm a feminist and I think I've done a lot of good.

Betty Dodson,"Masturbation is our first and natural form of sexual activity and if that's inhibited or damaged, then we suffer for the rest of our lives."
Betty Dodson,"It was so astonishing for women to sit there looking at images of female genitals. When we took those photographs, I got body rushes."

Betty Dodson,"If we could grow up knowing that the genitals are beautiful parts of our bodies, we'd be proud, we wouldn't have shame, we wouldn't have sexual guilt."
Betty Dodson,"I've spent the past six years with a young man, which was a nice break, dipping back into heterosexuality again from all my time with women."
Betty Dodson,"I consider the 70s to be the youth of old age. So all you women out there who are afraid of getting older, just keep your orgasms in place, eat a lot of vegetables, take exercise, and you'll be fine."
Betty Dodson,"We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it's a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend."
John Doerr,We're thrilled Roger is coming back home to the Valley.
John Doerr,"Well, there are more writers of blogs right now than there are readers, so that's clearly a vanity phenomenon."
John Doerr,We all know about blogs and how big they are.
John Doerr,"They've found a way to privately, or within a small family group, share expressions, or other images, drawings, and then gain access to some of the world's great expressions and images and make them real, make them tangible."
John Doerr,"There's this large trend - I think the next trend in the Web, sort of Web 2.0 - which is to have users really express, offer, and market their own content, their own persona, their identity."
John Doerr,"The remarkable thing to me is they've established quite an unimaginable collection of great brands. Not just images, but brands."
John Doerr,The next wave of the Web is going to be user-generated content.
John Doerr,"It's actually not unlike Google at that stage of development. They had an up-and-running site. It wasn't losing very much money, it wasn't making very much money, but it was growing."
John Doerr,"Cafe Press doesn't offer custom postage, just for starters. There are just not many people approved by the U.S. Postal Service to make custom postage."
John Doerr,"But it shows some of the hunger there is for user expression and interest in the most popular of the blogs, in sharing and reading."
John Doerr,Green-tech could be the largest economic opportunity of the 21st Century.
John Doerr,"It is quite clear that compelling content, which is made available on economic terms that respect the intellectual rights of owners, can be a tremendous spur to the growth of broadband networks."
John Doerr,People are looking to have more meaning in their lives. It is a sign the technology community is coming of age.

Ken Doherty,It was a workmanlike performance but I'm very pleased.
Ken Doherty,Those were two cracking shots but I should've won the frame earlier. I'm really disappointed. That was an opportunity lost.
Ken Doherty,I'm really looking forward to playing John again. Let's hope its another classic.
Ken Doherty,That threw me a lifeline and gave me a lot of hope. I kept fighting and hanging in there.
Matt Doherty,Rodney is a tough kid. He really has a good work ethic and is one of the hardest working players I've been around.
Matt Doherty,"We had our (big) men helping bring the ball up. So, if we were able to break the press, we had good scorers who were able to stop and shoot on the other end. This team is getting smarter, and we know who should take (the shots)."
Matt Doherty,"We are excited to have David join our program, ... He is a fine young man who represents al that we look for in a student athlete at FAU. As a player, he gives us another ball handler who can run the team while putting terrific pressure on opposing guards. We were fortunate to find him at such a late date."
Matt Doherty,"We are excited to have David join our program. He is a fine young man who represents all that we look for in a student-athlete at FAU. He's a good person and a good student from a good family. As a player, he gives us another ball handler who can run the team while putting terrific pressure on opposing guards. We were fortunate to find him at such a late date."
Matt Doherty,In a way it's kind of nice. I can go to the mall with my wife and not be recognized.
Matt Doherty,We needed to build momentum heading into the tournament. We couldn't just wake up March 2 and hope that switch is turned on.
Matt Doherty,"I hate to be evasive, but I am just not going to comment."
Matt Doherty,"They don't know what a great experience they can have in Johnson City. It can be the best three days of their life. They have to be mature enough to digest that and then hopefully understand it, visualize it and want it as much as we do."
Matt Doherty,"The thing about New Orleans is that you step out of your hotel and you feel the energy and see the fans decked out in school colors, ... And then of course, after the game you knew you had a place to celebrate."
Matt Doherty,"I hope we build on this. If we play with that kind of energy and lose, I can live with that. But we haven't been playing with that kind of energy."
Matt Doherty,"It's like any divorce. If you see your ex-wife at the grocery store, either she's going to throw a bunch of eggs at you, or you're going to have a genuinely enjoyable conversation. To be able to see those guys and laugh with them and reminisce a little bit was good for my soul."
Matt Doherty,"He has gotten better at defense, and his shooting has improved. If any one player won the game for us, it was him."
Matt Doherty,He really pushes the basketball and gets into gaps. No one person can guard him. It has to be a team effort.
Matt Doherty,"Carlos gave us a big lift when the NCAA finally cleared him to play. His rebounding, scoring and ability to pass elevated our team's play considerably."
Peter Doherty,"You have to be willing to get up when you're knocked down. ... We scientists are rather accustomed to falling flat on our faces! If you don't fail, you aren't trying anything new."

Peter Doherty,Influenza viruses spread very rapidly ... this is a disaster waiting to happen.
Elizabeth Dole,"Women share with men the need for personal success, even the taste of power, and no longer are we willing to satisfy those needs through the achievements of surrogates -- whether husbands, children or merely role models."
Elizabeth Dole,"That's hands-on management, executive management, whether it's a department of 100,000 at the Department of Transportation or whether it's a huge Corporation like the American Red Cross that I ran for eight years,"
Elizabeth Dole,"My objective as Secretary of Labor is to look through the 'glass ceiling' to see who is on the other side, and to serve as a catalyst for change . . . ."
Elizabeth Dole,"I'm not distracted by that. He's raising a lot of money. But I think clearly your vision, your ideas, what you want to do for America, your views on the issues are key. And we'll have the money to be a viable, credible candidate,"
Elizabeth Dole,restoring our public schools to greatness.
Elizabeth Dole,The very idea of freedom incites fear in the hearts of terrorists across the world.
Elizabeth Dole,"There is no doubt that now, more than ever, we must work to end our dependence on foreign oil sources. But we cannot do so by ignoring the wishes of the coastal communities that oppose drilling."
Elizabeth Dole,"In liberating Iraq, we have rid the nation and the rest of the world from the danger of Saddam Hussein."
Elizabeth Dole,"National Airport had been considered to be Congress' baby, ... Maybe ... because it was only a few minutes from a committee hearing to the boarding ramp."
Elizabeth Dole,"after everything he has gone through, I feel the least the Army could do is perform surgery on his foot so that he can at least lead some type of normal life. He will never be able to snowboard, skydive or do the rock climbing again which are the things he loves to do."
Elizabeth Dole,"Inadequate funding limits the number of staff at headquarters and in key states. It restricts your ability to communicate with voters. It places a ceiling on travel and travel staff. Over time, it becomes nearly impossible to sustain an effective campaign."
Bob Doll,"We're known right along that the administration was not happy with the fast vehicle ferries. I think that's a mistake. I think if we look at it from a passenger transportation point of view, that the idea of service has been put on the back burner."
Bob Doll,"Once we move beyond that period of slower growth, we expect to enter an environment of low inflation and renewed economic expansion, which would be good news for financial assets."
Bob Doll,We believe the Fed will only stop when economic growth cools enough to dull inflationary pressures.
Bob Doll,"Consumers will have to curb their spending eventually, which would help to cool economic growth."
Alice Domar,"Women who came into the program were very depressed and very anxious, and very angry and their marriages were in trouble - and all sorts of turmoil. Within 10 weeks, they were feeling better, a lot better."
Alice Domar,Wouldn't it be great if you could meditate a tumor away? ... But there's no data to support this.
Alice Domar,There's also no evidence that simply worrying about a disease can make it worse.
Raymond Domenech,The fact he has announced his retirement now will allow him to prepare well for the World Cup and be able to play in peace. I know that he really wants to succeed in Germany and I'm convinced that he still has the most beautiful page of his sporting history to write: winning a second World Cup with the Blues.
Raymond Domenech,It's not a duel one against the other. I look at the quality and what they can do on the field. Then it's who is in form at the right moment. We have two great goalkeepers and eventually you have to choose.
Raymond Domenech,I'm satisfied and very happy that we qualified. We won the matches that we had to ... against Ireland and here tonight. Now we must prepare properly for the World Cup.
Raymond Domenech,"Two months ago we were hardly good enough for the trash can. And today everyone considers there is no doubt about our [2006] qualification. As far as I know, we haven't taken any extra points in our campaign. My duty is to make sure that no one gets carried away. We must be careful to avoid a dangerous and worthless euphoria."
Raymond Domenech,I sensed it was a team that had taken its destiny in its hands.
Raymond Domenech,"We lacked efficiency, that's a shame. But we showed a lot more creativity than before. Overall I'm happy with the players. They showed a real drive. Something happened tonight that will help us move forward."
Raymond Domenech,If they think it's going to be a case of passing the ball to feet and playing space-age soccer then they'll have missed the point. There will be a physical battle.
Phil Donahue,"I see all those Solomons out there, I can't wait to hear your wisdom."

Phil Donahue,A large psychic void is left by a loss of faith. So many Catholics have tried so many things to replace it.
Phil Donahue,Presenting statues of honor to reporters for covering an earthquake is like presenting a first prize to a doctor for performing surgery.
Phil Donahue,Some people are uncomfortable with the idea that humans belong to the same class of animals as cats and cows and raccoons. They're like the people who become successful and then don't want to be reminded of the old neighborhood.

Jeffrey Donaldson,"I have not heard a viable alternative to what I have put forward, and the reality is that the (power sharing) strategy that we adopted in May has failed,"
Jeffrey Donaldson,"In the past, decommissioning as a process has been shrouded in secrecy and if we are to increase public confidence in the process then we want it to be more transparent,"
Jeffrey Donaldson,"Clearly what we need to know from the IRA is whether this is the beginning of a process which will lead to the decommissioning of their weapons or whether this is as good as it gets,"
Jeffrey Donaldson,Clearly what we need to know from the IRA is whether this is the beginning of a process which will lead to the decommissioning of their weapons or whether this is as good as it gets.
Joe Donnelly,Our ports are a vital link in national security and it is extremely dangerous to be considering their sale to the United Arab Emirates government.
Joe Donnelly,"Their concerts are the most fun thing to do in South Bend. The real Guns N' Roses haven't sounded this good since 1989. I think that if Slash heard some of their guitar solos on Friday, he would immediately run back to his rehearsal studio to practice."
Joe Donnelly,An additional concern of leadership is the caution that some members of the nation's stem-cell research community have raised about state investments in this new area of scientific research.
Billy Donovan,That's what we're trying to build here at Florida. That's what we're trying to create. It has to start somewhere.
Billy Donovan,"It has to start somewhere. That's what we are trying to build at Florida. It's never been done, never been sustained."
Billy Donovan,We are trying to build tradition. Kentucky's the one that has the tradition and we are trying to get there.
Billy Donovan,I was concerned about trying to double him. I wanted him to score and to take those other guys out of the game the best we could. It worked out for us.
Billy Donovan,I was a little concerned with our foul trouble and our turnovers late. In the second half we did a much better job of taking care of the basketball.
Billy Donovan,They made it very difficult for us to get prepared. Just trying to space the floor. And you have to extra pass against them.
Billy Donovan,"I don't sleep, period. I really wish I would sleep. I haven't slept in months."
Billy Donovan,Self-inflicted wounds. I knew it was going to be this kind of a game. I told our team we're going to have to grind it out and win ugly.
Billy Donovan,"Self-inflicted wounds, you know. It was all just self-inflicted."
Billy Donovan,"My biggest thing with the crowd coming on the court was just in terms of the players' safety. It looks good on TV, but you're always concerned or worried that there is going to be some type of altercation."
Billy Donovan,"Those guys, being seniors, they know how to rest during a game. We had to make them guard to make them uncomfortable on the offensive end."
Billy Donovan,"Because he made shots, it energized the rest of his game. He was getting away from that. He was getting ahead of himself."
Billy Donovan,"He's probably never going to get to a point where he feels great the rest of the season. But I think his confidence level is high. It's good to see him take the amount of shots he took. He put up 11 3s on the road. It was great to see him confidently shoot the basketball and it was great to see him move to the next shot, even when he missed a couple in a row."
Billy Donovan,"Lee is one of those guys who understands scouting reports, schemes and how we are guarding. You can be rest assured that he is going to follow everything to the minute detail of what he has to do. So, forget about the shooting part of it, we have just lost maybe our best overall defender."
Billy Donovan,"In our league with the quality of teams and playing four consecutive nights, I think for any team it's a disadvantage. But you go into the tournament with the hand you're dealt."
Billy Donovan,"After practice, he'll thank me three or four times before we leave the gym."
Billy Donovan,Corey just didn't have it today. And it's hard to expect him to have it when you don't practice for two days.
Billy Donovan,The surgery went well. He wasn't at practice because he was dealing with so many things medically. . . . I'll probably have a better understanding maybe (today).
Billy Donovan,He's never had a bad practice since he's been here.
Billy Donovan,"Certainly, I'd like to make a deep run in the tournament. But I'm at peace with this team."
Billy Donovan,"Flat out, the past several years -- to be totally honest -- we weren't good enough to advance. They didn't advance far enough in the tournament because maybe some of the past teams weren't built to make a deep run in the tournament."
Billy Donovan,"I think the tournament is wide open. Is it any more wide open than in years past? It's hard to say, but I just think on a neutral site with the way this league is anything can happen on any given night."
Billy Donovan,"When we lost to Manhattan, we were banged up. That's not making excuses. I just didn't like the passion we played with in that tournament."
Billy Donovan,"This is not about me. If we are fortunate enough to win tomorrow night, it's over. Tuesday morning, it's gone, on to the next thing."
Billy Donovan,"It's an area he's invested a lot of time in. It would have been very difficult for us (Wednesday night) had he gone 12-for-22 from the line, or 10-for-22 from the line."
Billy Donovan,"You look at Al Wednesday night and today, it's two different players. He accepted the responsibility. I respect him so much for that."
Billy Donovan,This was a night when Corey Brewer really stepped up for us. He made some big shots and some plays. He was hitting on his 3s and also had the critical rebound in the final minute. I'm happy for him. He really found his game and his rhythm.
Billy Donovan,"Sometimes, in the NCAA Tournament, the best team doesn't always win. Sometimes it's the hottest team or the luck of the bounce or a shot going in or something happens. Why not give every kid an opportunity to create some type of magic for themselves?"
Billy Donovan,I'm mesmerized. I love watching them play.
Billy Donovan,"He has a great, great vigor for life."
Billy Donovan,"He was almost in tears because, for the first time in his life, he wasn't getting an opportunity to play. I told him, this is going to come to an end this season. And when it does, your time is here."
Billy Donovan,"He has a great passion and vigor for life. He has great respect for people - where they come from, what their heritage is and what their beliefs are."
Billy Donovan,"I still feel it's a learning and growing process for our guys. I'm shocked, unbelievably surprised, that we're 23-6. We've obviously lost a lot of close games, but if you would have told me that Brewer would be out for a stretch and Lee Humphrey would have a separated shoulder, I would have told you we would have had some problems."
Billy Donovan,"I am very, very proud of these kids. It has been such a remarkable run up to this point, just with so much uncertainty surrounding this season with people leaving early and these guys having to step up."
Billy Donovan,"Part of it is youthfulness, but the one thing about the kids is that they're in every game."
Billy Donovan,"It's great to be able to move on and advance. I feel bad for these kids that the past [woes] had to be brought back up to them [all the time]. Some of them weren't even here, some of they weren't even playing."
Billy Donovan,"Our kids just kept battling and playing hard. I mean, to win a championship game and not even get to 50 points is truly remarkable."
Billy Donovan,I'm happy for the kids. All season they have given me everything they had.
Billy Donovan,"This team is just different. Different kids, different time, different everything."
Billy Donovan,"I'm just a big believer that when guys are injured or hurt, if they elect to play, there's a certain expectation they have to uphold. And if they can't uphold that expectation, I'm totally fine if they sit out."
Billy Donovan,"They outplayed us, outperformed us and hurt us in the backcourt. You have to give them credit. They are a quick, explosive team. They rebound well. We are going to have to play a whole lot better than we did in Columbia to have a chance to win."
Billy Donovan,"They outplayed us, outperformed us and hurt us in the backcourt. You have to give them credit. They are a quick, athletic, explosive team. They rebound well. We are going to have to play a whole lot better than we did in Columbia to have a chance to win."
Billy Donovan,"If it were something where he was riding a motorcycle and he was popping some wheelies and he got hurt, than maybe I would be a bit more concerned. It was just a freak accident."
Billy Donovan,"You guys get more interested in all the details. All I know is that the guy's got a hurt shoulder. How it happened doesn't really make a difference. Maybe it was defective spokes or maybe he needs training wheels, I don't know. I just know he slipped off his bike."
Billy Donovan,I can't live their lives for them. They could just as easily get hurt doing something on the court.
Billy Donovan,"I don't care how old you are, there's a level of humility that comes with that."
Billy Donovan,I hope it doesn't flare back up with him.
Billy Donovan,"It's teams like George Mason that give so many people hope in their lives, just seeing what great things can be accomplished."
Billy Donovan,"I really thought that maybe they were not as fresh coming down the stretch. That was kind of our hope in the second half, that maybe we could try to wear them down because they were really sticking with their seven guys."
Billy Donovan,It's one of those things I can hope will get better and he can get back to playing because it's very obvious watching him play that he's not as reckless and daring and playing like he's capable of. I don't know if there's a level of uncertainty if he plants or runs or jumps or if the pain is so severe he just can't do what he's supposed to do.
Billy Donovan,"Tennessee has been hardened by all those losses in the past, and now Bruce has brought in hope."
Billy Donovan,"Ever since the Alabama game, for [Humphrey] and maybe the tirade I had on him in a timeout, I hope it's carried over. He just needs to let it go, it's really that simple for our team."
Billy Donovan,"I'm not even concerned about that right now. I'm more worried about playing LSU (Saturday at home). Even before this game, Tennessee was in control of its own destiny."
Billy Donovan,"There might be some truth to (more pressure playing close to home). Kids say, 'There's so many people there I want to do so well,' so that can happen. If you're out in San Diego you're just kind of playing. (But) I don't think these guys will feel that way -- I hope they don't."
Billy Donovan,"There's been a lot of hard work and sweat that's gone into it. It's a huge milestone. It's a huge thing for our state, for our fans."
Billy Donovan,They started to understand that playing hard isn't enough. I think that stretch helped them understand that there was another piece to winning.
Billy Donovan,"I don't know if we've played against teams as talented as teams we're playing against now. Playing hard, playing unselfish, doing all the right things, team-wise, is great. ... But it's not good enough to beat good teams."
Billy Donovan,I was shocked and happy that we were tied.
Billy Donovan,"John has done a great job over the course of the season with him, when you look at his growth and development as a player. He's a problem, because he can rebound, and he's a very good, [an] underrated passer. He can score. He does a lot of different things for his team."
Billy Donovan,"The biggest thing for David is to make good decisions and play very hard. There are some games, athletically, where what David can do is stretch the defense and really shoot it. So, we have to make sure in this game (Ole Miss) that we have him in the right match-up situation because they have so much quickness."
Billy Donovan,"Based on what do we deserve to win those games? Based on what? Three, four sophomores and a freshman? That doesn't give us a right."
Billy Donovan,"We still have to play the games. At this point in the year, you talk about those things. I don't know what real advantage it gives you except you've got to win three games instead of four."
Billy Donovan,"I told them before the game, this game was going to come down to everything we talk about being. Team work, unselfishness, sharing the ball, and being able to defend and rebound."
Billy Donovan,"He needed to have a game like this. I was happy for him. The last week or so, I think he's been doing some soul searching, just trying to find a way to come up with some answers to help our team. He helped out big-time tonight."
Billy Donovan,"To start this tournament over again, I may not be sitting up here. It is a one-shot game, one-shot deal. Sometimes the best teams don't always advance on in the NCAA Tournament. This team, starting the season, I felt had all the team makeup (to go far). They were unselfish and they wanted to win."
Billy Donovan,This could have been a game where he could have gone 8 for 11. He just didn't have one of those nights.
Billy Donovan,"The last 32 minutes of the game, we were totally outplayed, outperformed, out-everything. I don't think the score is indicative of how they outplayed us in this game."
Billy Donovan,"I felt like this year's team would be great to coach, a fun team to coach. They would be a team that would play unselfishly, play together. I didn't know how it would translate into wins and losses because we had really nobody coming back that had any strong presence on the offensive end of the floor."
Billy Donovan,I didn't know if we had enough experience.
Billy Donovan,We want to create a level of expectation that [future teams] want to uphold. It has to start somewhere.
Billy Donovan,"On TV, it looks great ... but it's really a scary environment on the floor. The other thing it does is it takes away from what a great win Florida State had. They shouldn't (have to) be addressing their lack of security or whatever. ... They should be talking about how great their kids played and what a great win it was for their program."
Billy Donovan,"That's generally a recipe for disaster, but because we defended the 3-point line that gave us an opportunity."
Billy Donovan,"Tonight, we won because of our defense and they didn't shoot the ball particularly well. I would say it was a combination, that we did at times challenge their shots, and there were maybe also some shots they just didn't knock down."
Billy Donovan,"I still don't necessarily believe we (are) the best team in the country. When you're playing in an event that's a one-and-done deal, anything can happen. I've been on the side of it where it ends in a heart-breaking manner. And now I've been on the side where it's obviously just an incredible feeling."
Billy Donovan,"I respect and appreciate him for coming across the country and playing at Florida. I think Ryan being away from his family and not playing as much was tough on him, and he saw that (since graduated guard) Anthony Roberson was coming back."
Billy Donovan,"Our bench has done good. I really believe if I could have control of when they shoot the ball, our bench making shots and giving our bench production, we would do it. But I'm not concerned about that. I'm more concerned about the type of shots we're getting."
Billy Donovan,"We have been right there. There have been some things that have been out of our control a little. I think our guys have put themselves in positions to win, and you are not going to have them all go your way. . . . What our team has done to this point in time and the way they have battled, I think it's pretty impressive."
Billy Donovan,I don't think our guys are upset or bothered by it. That's something that's beyond their control. People can talk about the George Mason story and rightfully so. It's a great story that I think will inspire many people outside of college basketball.
Billy Donovan,Sometimes there's things that are out of your control in these games.
Billy Donovan,"I have confidence putting Walter and David in the game. I'm not going to not play those guys. They deserve an opportunity to play. They may not always play well, but they're going to play hard."
Billy Donovan,"Our bench coming in has to have a little more confidence when they're out there, that there's not going to be a drop off."
Billy Donovan,"When he's letting it go and shooting with confidence like that, it makes us a different team. Some days, it might not be his night, but we need for him to continue to be aggressive."
Billy Donovan,"For a while there, everybody talked about if you really want to win at the college level, you have to have two or three pros on your team. I'm not so sure that's the case any more."
Billy Donovan,"I'm fortunate to coach an unbelievable group of guys who have been totally selfless. They've been all about the team, and all about winning. ... I'm happy that I can be a part of the first-ever national championship."
Billy Donovan,"This has probably been the greatest collection of guys I have had in one class in terms of understanding what unselfishness, what team is all about. They get that piece of it."
Billy Donovan,"He's really made a poor choice, hasn't he?"
Billy Donovan,"He really made a poor choice, didn't he?"
Billy Donovan,"That takes a kid with unbelievable character. It takes a kid who cares about the team, a kid who wants to win."
Billy Donovan,"Someone told me his comments after the game was he put blame on himself. That's wrong. If anything I hold myself more accountable than I would hold him. The only thing I told him in that situation is not get ahead of himself and say, I probably should have called time out. That's probably what we needed to do. But hopefully next time he'll be able to learn."
Billy Donovan,"That's a really, really interesting question because I've always been a big, big believer that things that have happened in the past, negatively or positively, don't affect your future. I believe I have to work harder now as a head coach, and what I mean by that is we've got to try to continue to recruit good, quality kids."
Billy Donovan,I haven't gone to bed yet.
Billy Donovan,"For our basketball team, it was a tale of two halves. In the first half, our guys were very, very impatient on offense. We didn't have the ball movement and the player movement we needed to have. We had good ball movement and player movement and we shot 57 percent in the second half. If we would have played similar to that and rebounded like we did in the first half, it would have been a different game. We couldn't put it all together."
Billy Donovan,As a basketball team you have to go through it. They need it. The game came down to our inexperience on the basketball court to their experience.
Billy Donovan,I would say that our basketball team is totally different. Every guy on our team is playing a completely different role than they did a year ago.
Billy Donovan,They play college basketball way they should play it. We're looking at this game as playing one of the best teams in the United States of America because that is what they are.
Billy Donovan,"Whether it said across their jersey Cinderella, George Mason or another team, for us our basketball team, it's just a matter of going out there playing. Our kids were feeling the same thing that George Mason kids were feeling. The feeling was not any different between teams."
Billy Donovan,The complexion of college basketball has changed so much.
Billy Donovan,"I've often said the greatest equalizer in college basketball is the 3-point line. They outscored us by 12 from the 3-point line. Our inability to limit them to one shot and inability to guard the 3-point line cost us. Anytime a team can come into your building and shoot 53 percent from the field and 47 percent from the 3-point line, you have to have a very, very good night on offense."
Billy Donovan,Those are great for our basketball team. You hate to lose them. But our team has to go through this before they can reach their potential.
Billy Donovan,The greatest equalizer in college basketball -- it doesn't make a difference about talent or who's better than who -- is the three-point line.
Billy Donovan,"I don't think basketball has ever been an afterthought, at least since I've been here. In the Southeast, in terms of enthusiasm and excitement, it's for football. In Kentucky and Indiana, it's for basketball. I understand that and Billy Donovan isn't changing that culture. ... But I think our program has gotten respect."
Billy Donovan,"That's the one thing that's been great about our basketball teams over the years -- they've earned their way in. Now, we've got to make something happen."
Billy Donovan,"I'm happy for Jordan. He's gotten a lot better as a basketball player, as I knew he would. He's a hard-working kid."
Billy Donovan,What they've been able to do this year is great for basketball.
Billy Donovan,"I know a lot of people are so excited for George Mason. It's great for college basketball. Believe me, I'm mesmerized."
Billy Donovan,Corey had a very good game shooting the basketball.
Billy Donovan,"I think our inexperience [caused that]. I'm not using it as an excuse. I think that when you win basketball games like we've won; we've won on heart, passion and toughness."
Billy Donovan,"It was a back-and-forth basketball game. Both teams had a chance to win, but give Arkansas credit. They were able to find a way to come out with a victory."
Billy Donovan,"We allowed him to do what he does well, and that's shoot the basketball. [If] we force him to make all twos, we probably win the game."
Billy Donovan,"It was a great, great college basketball game. Both teams had a chance to win. I think Arkansas is as talented as any team in the league. They have more experience, much more size and physicality than we do."
Billy Donovan,The second half was a back-and-forth basketball game. Give Arkansas credit. They made some plays and their kids played hard and I thought it was a great college basketball game that both teams had a chance to win at times.
Billy Donovan,"I think what George Mason has done this NCAA tournament has been a milestone and a breakthrough in college basketball. There's been so many programs that have been close. ... I just think in my opinion right now, when you talk about the word 'mid-major' or you talk about the word 'major,' there's no more of that to me. I think those days are over with."
Billy Donovan,"I look at who we're playing as a basketball team and don?t get wrapped up in what the perception is about their team. They're a very, very good basketball team that has beaten Connecticut, Michigan State, North Carolina."
Billy Donovan,The 3-point line is a great equalizer in college basketball.
Billy Donovan,"What they've been able to do this year is great for basketball. Most teams don't get a chance to experience what they've been able to experience. In this tournament, they were able to inspire a lot of people. There was no resentment on our team for feeling like they got all the attention or we got slighted."
Billy Donovan,We're just a basketball team that doesn't have a lot of depth right now. That's our biggest challenge.
Billy Donovan,I would say that our basketball team is totally different.
Billy Donovan,It is great for our basketball team to go through this. They need this. I really think it was our inexperience as a basketball team in relation to [Tennessee's] experience.
Billy Donovan,It was a courageous win for our basketball team.
Billy Donovan,Glen Davis is to college basketball and to this league what Shaquille O'Neal is to the NBA. There's nobody quite like him.
Billy Donovan,"It was a good win for us. Vanderbilt is a very good basketball team. Vanderbilt is a very difficult team to play against. The biggest thing is that our basketball team is still learning. Vanderbilt did some things to us at first where we had to settle in and we picked it up, certainly in the second half, but the first 10 minutes were tough."
Billy Donovan,"It was great to see him shoot the basketball and let it go with the confidence he did. The biggest thing I look at with Lee is the confidence level he's shooting the ball with. Tonight, he was just letting it go and shooting it with a great deal of confidence."
Billy Donovan,You just don't see a lot of players like Glen Davis in college basketball.
Billy Donovan,"He runs, he catches and he alters shots. You just don't see a lot of players in college basketball like him."
Billy Donovan,"These are the situations our guys need to be in for us to reach our full potential as a basketball team. I think a lot of people will focus on the last play, but you know what, with the way these guys battled, it's a shame to lose that way."
Billy Donovan,"We have entered a stage right now in college basketball where 15 years ago, it would have been maybe totally no way George Mason could go to the Final Four. It just goes to show how many good coaches there are out there, how many good players there are out there. On any given night, anybody can beat anybody."
Billy Donovan,"I've never gotten into any of that stuff. If we win basketball games, our seed will continue to improve. If we don't win basketball games, our seed will not improve."
Billy Donovan,"I was getting frustrated watching balls go up from the three-point line, when those guys are standing 1-on-1 in the post with a guy 6-6 guarding them. It's hard sometimes. I'm constantly preaching to (Green and guard Lee Humphrey), 'When you're open, let it go.' Sometimes you have to change your thought processes."
Billy Donovan,"I think it's a great comparison. Bobby Jones was a great runner in transition, he was a great athlete on the floor. I believe as David continues to grow, his shooting will get better. He's a very versatile guy."
Billy Donovan,"They can play with anybody in the United States of America, and they've proven that."
Billy Donovan,"With the age limit, I think you're going to continually make college basketball very young. Some kids handle it better than others. ... It makes it very challenging, very, very, very difficult."
Billy Donovan,I think our guys are a little further along mentally than a lot of guys their age.
Billy Donovan,"Our team battled through the adversity of the game. They battled through not shooting the ball, and we found a way, defensively, to win the game."
Billy Donovan,Everybody was worried about the adversity he was going to face if he didn't make shots. We didn't know the adversity was riding a bike.
Billy Donovan,Their ability not to embrace success.
Billy Donovan,"There's no question Corey has the ability to make game-changing plays with his length, his quickness, and speed. But more than anything else he gives us an experienced player who gives us a little depth and maybe some size across our frontline to help us rebound a little better."
Billy Donovan,"I don't think that we have played against anyone with his size and athletic ability. He is very impressive because he is so skilled. He is a good passer which is impressive for a guy who is 7-foot-2. He runs, he catches and he alters shots. You just don't see a lot of players in college basketball like him. This will be a unique game for us to play against a guy like him."
Billy Donovan,"He has the ability to take difficult shots one, to get them off and two, to be able to make them at a high percentage. He has a special gift and there is nothing you can do about it."
Billy Donovan,"There's no question Corey has the ability to make game-changing plays with his length, his quickness, and speed. But more than anything else, he gives us an experienced player who gives us a little depth and maybe some size across our frontline to help us rebound a little better."
Billy Donovan,"This game was all about the 3-point line and our ability to guard it. They made very, very timely 3-point shots. ... The great equalizer in college basketball is the 3-point line. It's the No. 1 stat I look at."
Billy Donovan,I don't know if I would necessarily say we're just tougher. But we have the ability to play more physical and tougher than maybe we did a year ago.
Landon Donovan,"Crucial, ... You don't want to worry about other results, you don't want to worry about getting a result in the sixth game. If you can finish it ... you finish it."
Landon Donovan,"Having Claudio and John makes it easy on me because they do all the work. I don't have to worry about getting the ball and moving it from side to side or finding people. They do that. I just get in front of the goal and try to score, so it's going to be fun for me."
Landon Donovan,"Talent-wise, looking at our roster, we are deeper. But the thing we don't have that we did in 2002, is there are not as many clear leaders."
Landon Donovan,"Talent-wise, we are much deeper. We are deeper, one through 23, and that's a better thing. The thing we don't have that we had four years ago is as many clear leaders. This time, we have only four or five leaders. That's one issue that will sort itself out."
Landon Donovan,"I don't know about the rest of the world, but I know in our region everyone is gunning to beat us. We have a new challenge."
Landon Donovan,You'd be hard-pressed to find another team in our region that could do that.
Landon Donovan,"We had a good team game plan. I wanted to put on a show, though, and I did."
Landon Donovan,"It's not just another game for me,"
Landon Donovan,"Relaxing, going on vacation, sleeping, having fun when I want, golfing when I want, do whatever I want - I am going to enjoy it,"
Landon Donovan,"All of us who play here for less money than we could make and less fame than other players get around the world, we have the same goal in mind, ... We want soccer to develop and become a major sport in this country."
Landon Donovan,"We've had excuses for part of the year, but we don't have excuses now. This is a game we need to win, period."
Mark Donovan,It's clear that music is a key thing.
Mark Donovan,"Among the U.S. carriers, Sprint has been the most aggressive in trying to become a media and entertainment player, and they're leading the pack."
Mark Donovan,"AOL owes its strong position in the mobile domain to its ability to provide seamless access to AIM buddy lists on handsets through an elegantly designed service and its strong relationships with mobile carriers. Its challenge is to demonstrate that it can use AIM as the foundation to engage users with a broader base of services, much as it is seeking to do on the desktop by opening access to its portal and e-mail services and linking these with AIM."
Shaun Donovan,What's really different here is that we are changing the rules. We're saying the developer who wins is the one with the most affordability.
Shaun Donovan,The city will not tolerate residents living in inhuman conditions.
Shaun Donovan,"By creating ownership, you are giving moderate income residents a financial stake in their neighborhoods, so they benefit from the improvement rather than be hurt by it."
Vince Dooley,I like the opportunity to get together with these coaches I've known over the years and exchange ideas. I think the process lends itself to sound judgments and a thorough evaluation of the teams. I think that we do have some credibility.
Vince Dooley,"I see a coach who worked at it, studied other coaches, who was driven to be a good coach overall, ... We all need a little humility, and he's probably an even better coach than he was from that [Redskins] experience."
Vince Dooley,"Stanfill put him on his tail four or five times, ... Steve was a great athlete, confident and cocky, but we put tremendous pressure on him. That was the best way I knew to stop the quarterback."
Vince Dooley,"Steve had a great ability to stick it to somebody, and he took a special delight in doing it to Ray. And their personalities are different, which might be a part of it."
James Doran,"We have to keep remembering that it is a first year, ... is not a small amount of money."
James Doran,There's a future for it and I believe the town needs an attraction of this nature and size to bring people in.
James Doran,We serve as a research center. But our most important role is education. We teach the history of the fire service - and we teach fire safety. That's the most important component.
James Doran,The museum has probably the finest collection of its kind in the country.
Byron Dorgan,"If the allegations brought forward by the whistle-blowers are correct, they represent both a security threat and a waste of taxpayer dollars."
Byron Dorgan,"If the allegations brought forward by the whistleblowers are correct, they represent both a security threat and a waste of taxpayer dollars."
Byron Dorgan,"If the allegations brought forward by the whistleblowers are correct, they represent both a security threat and a waste of taxpayer dollars. It would be ironic, to say the least, if DHS were unable to secure its own headquarters."
Byron Dorgan,"If the allegations brought forward by the whistle-blowers are correct, they represent both a security threat and a waste of taxpayer dollars. It would be ironic, to say the least, if DHS were unable to secure its own headquarters."
Byron Dorgan,"We have a constitutional responsibility to use our heads, our hearts and our minds to make good decisions about the future of this country."
Byron Dorgan,We are telling a guy who fought for freedom that he doesn't have the freedom to see a sick child.
Byron Dorgan,"Most likely Congress will do little or nothing but talk a great deal and hold hearings,"
Byron Dorgan,"It's very important for Congress to be able to do its work, to fully investigate what has happened here, for us to have information about all of these partnerships,"
Byron Dorgan,Retaliation against employees for providing information to Congress is illegal and entirely unacceptable.
Byron Dorgan,Congress is going to slap on the penalties unless you and commissioner Selig do it first.
Byron Dorgan,"Complaints that the selection process was inadequate are significant and come from people in a position to know the facts, ... I think such an investigation is not only appropriate but very much needed."
Byron Dorgan,"These are the kinds of companies that want all the benefits of American citizenship and all the benefits from doing business with the federal government, but they don't want to bare the burden of the responsibilities of paying taxes to our government,"
Byron Dorgan,"Budgets are all about choices,"
Byron Dorgan,"I think this is a seed bed for substantial growth and opportunities in our region,"
Byron Dorgan,"You can delegate authority, but you cannot delegate responsibility."
Jerry Dorsey,He was in between jobs.
Jerry Dorsey,"He's very enthusiastic, and he has fresh ideas. I think he's going to take the hospital to a new level. I'm sure he will be a good fit to our hospital and community."
Jerry Dorsey,"We feel extremely fortunate to have recruited a CEO of Rick's caliber. His work at other health care organizations proves him to be a visionary with experience in clinical service-line growth, an effective leader and mentor and a person who works to build strong relationships with physicians, administrators and staff."
Jerry Dorsey,I think (Hudson) is going to be more oriented in listening to doctors and be more open-minded about ideas doctors have. I think he'll be a good fit with physicians here.
Ken Dorsey,"[The trade] definitely took me by surprise, but it kind of motivates you to go out and work even that much harder because now the coaches have put their trust in you to do a job, ... Because now I'm that much closer to having to be in the game. They entrusted me in a job, and I intend to do that job to the best of my ability."
Ken Dorsey,"I think that it's important that if you don't do something well in practice, you go out and do it (again) so you feel confident in anything you do."
Ken Dorsey,"When you're the third guy, you don't get many reps in practice. You've kind of got to just rely on your past experiences, and go from there. There's no replica for game experience out there. Having [last season's]experience under my belt helps me."
Ken Dorsey,Coach Olson will be a great fit. His offensive philosophy will allow him to do a lot of things with the speed and athleticism that UM has.
Ken Dorsey,"It's an opportunity for me to go out and play and do some good things. You just never know what kind of opportunity is going to arise. I didn't have any idea two weeks ago, being the third-string quarterback, that I'd be starting today."
Ken Dorsey,"I'm excited about the position I'm in, ... It provides an opportunity for me to be the second-string guy now on a team that I love to play for. That's an exciting opportunity for me. I'm excited for Tim and the new opportunity that he has, and we're just going to move on here from where we're at."
Ken Dorsey,"It looks like I've got a little golf ball in there, ... If I can get through a practice, I'll play in the game. I'll go out Wednesday and test it. I'll do anything to be on the field."
Ken Dorsey,It's easily one of the most exciting games I've ever played in.
Ken Dorsey,"It's easy to say to protect the football and be smart with it, but you've got to go out and do it. I think that's going to be an important part of the game for us because it's a fast defense that thrives off getting turnovers."
Ken Dorsey,There is no replication for game experience out there. The more reps the better off you're going to be. I've got to take advantage of every rep I get now. I like to think I've prepared as best as I could in terms of paying attention and working hard. I prepared as best I can for this moment.
Ken Dorsey,"Hopefully we can get back to having some fun and scoring some points. It's not a competition. As a group, we all have a lot of respect for each other. We all like each other. We prepare together and go into every game together."
Alan Doss,"Liberia has been the epicenter of progressive waves of instability that have swept through this region over the past 25 years,"
Alan Doss,"We are doing and will continue to do cordon and search operations based on intelligence tip-offs where we go and raid premises to recover any hidden caches,"
Alan Doss,"The observer mission has termed the elections free and fair. Party representatives were present in, I believe, just about every polling station and they signed off on the records."
Alan Doss,"We have to give the new government, initially, the benefit of the doubt. Help them get moving quickly so people see a difference. If a few years from now they sense that nothing has changed . . . there could be trouble again."
Alan Doss,"Considerable assistance from donors, including debt relief, will be needed in the early years. That is inevitable because there are things that government needs to do: infrastructure has to be built, and so on."
Alan Doss,We hope that the current calm and stability will gradually install itself throughout the country.
Alan Doss,The greatest danger now is that expectations are too high. The euphoria of the end of the conflict will soon be forgotten.
Alan Doss,offered the people of Liberia an opportunity to leave behind the conflict that has devastated this country for so long and turned the page on a very dark chapter in their history.
Alan Doss,"The Liberian people have made their choice through the ballot today, and we are all obliged to respect the choice made by the men and women of this nation,"
Alan Doss,"The United States has made a start here, training the army, but this goes beyond one partner and I hope others will come in,"

Fyodor Dostoevsky,"Happiness does not lie in happiness, but in the achievement of it."
Lance Dottin,"He's worked hard. He had to do off-season work and in-season work. Where he's come from, he's come a long, long way."
Lance Dottin,The guys whose names are on that banner have been a big part of Cambridge history. He'll forever be remembered with that banner hanging there.
Lance Dottin,"They're having fun now. The tough part is behind them. The tough part is learning how to play Cambridge basketball. They have a better understanding now. I'm not saying we're anywhere near the level of some of the teams in the past, but they have a better understanding."
James Dougherty,"It's a perfectly natural deal for these two companies. WPP wants to be the biggest marketing and advertising agency in the world, so from their perspective, it's a natural deal by a lot."
James Dougherty,This deal is an indication that Mr. Sorrell has a drive to be the absolute top advertising and marketing agency in the world. It's a perfectly natural deal for these two companies.

Bobby Douglas,They're a very good team; the best Missouri team I've seen. We've got a big job ahead of us. It's a bigger job than Penn State.

Bobby Douglas,"We wrestled pretty well the first round. We had some moments of despair, but overall we had a pretty good round."

Frederick Douglass,No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck.
Frederick Douglass,Power concedes nothing without demand. It never has and never will. Show me the exact amount of wrong and injustices that are visited upon a person and I will show you the exact amount of words endured by these people.
Frederick Douglass,"I could, as a free man, look across the bay toward the Eastern Shore where I was born a slave."

Frederick Douglass,Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of the injustice and wrong which will be imposed on them.
Frederick Douglass,"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."
Frederick Douglass,"Without a struggle, there can be no progress."
Frederick Douglass,One and God make a majority.
Frederick Douglass,"If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and deprecate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightning."
Frederick Douglass,To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.
Frederick Douglass,"In thinking of America, I sometimes find myself admiring her bright blue sky-her grand old woods-her fertile fields-her beautiful rivers-her mighty lakes and star-crowned mountains. But my rapture is soon checked when I remember that all is cursed with the infernal spirit of slave-holding and wrong; When I remember that with the waters of her noblest rivers, the tears of my brethren are borne to the ocean, disregarded and forgotten; That her most fertile fields drink daily of the warm blood of my outraged sisters, I am filled with unutterable loathing."
Frederick Douglass,Man's greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his powers to things needed to be done.

Alexander Downer,"We have said many times before that ... at the very least, Indonesia is responsible for the security situation in East Timor,"
Alexander Downer,"In addition, I will express Australian support for international efforts to meet the pressing humanitarian problems facing North Korea."
Alexander Downer,"The onus of that task falls on the armed forces and the police force in East Timor and they haven't done a good job in recent times. It's important that they perform more effectively and do everything they can to stop the violence and move to disarm the two sides -- the paramilitaries and the pro-independence side,"
Alexander Downer,It is deeply regrettable that the Pakistani government has shown absolute disregard for the many direct appeals to exercise restraint and has willfully turned its back on the sincere efforts of the international community to encourage reason to prevail.

Alexander Downer,"Their sort of ugly, sneering, amused attitude at the slaughter of innocent people is just horrific,"
Gregg Downer,"Sometimes you have to go toe-to-toe with them, they force you to play fast. It was just kind of like a heavyweight fight and we couldn't really slow them down, whoever gets that 15th-round punch is going to win."
Gregg Downer,"Sometimes you have to go to-to-toe with them, they force you to play fast. I would have liked one more defensive stop in the second half. I felt like one more stop might have changed the course of the game. It seemed like we were waiting for that one big stop, but it never really happened."
Gregg Downer,"I put my lucky dancing shoes on. We're a superstitious team, full of karma."
Brian Doyle,There is more than enough evidence that we have good security â€¦ these issues were addressed quickly and efficiently.

Brian Doyle,"We're making strides. Recently, we've played some games into the fourth quarter we felt we could win."
Brian Doyle,We're trying to get consistency. We've had trouble getting a consistent scorer.
Brian Doyle,He is the type of scientist that bridges the gap between the science community and the commercial fishing community. He?s equally comfortable working in both arenas.
Brian Doyle,We're figuring out how best to use them as a business.
Brian Doyle,You cannot inspect every container - you would stop business in its tracks. The programs put in place for port security have been pretty massive.
Chris Doyle,I feel really proud that in the wake of such a disaster that people are donating. They are going to have such an impact on a lot of people.
Chris Doyle,"As we've seen the rise of cultural, environmental and educational tourism in adventure travel, we've also seen the rise of female participation. Part of that is due to changes in women's attitudes about their own abilities. As more women participate in such things as fly-fishing, whitewater kayaking and bicycling, we're also seeing concurrent growth in those areas in adventure travel."
Chris Doyle,"Women are one of the most important segments of the adventure travel industry. Women make the vast majority of travel decisions in families - not only the destinations, but the activities. They are the predominant adventure travel planners."
Stephen Doyle,"From our end, I don't know the name of the other primary person, but we turned over to the police today documents that show signatures or credit cards or whatever was associated with closing this deal,"
Stephen Doyle,"There was lap dancing with a fair amount of cash floating around the floor with the dancers, leading quickly into sexual acts in a nature so explicit imagination wasn't necessary."
Stephen Doyle,"The scope of it, the nature of it and the location of it add up to pretty bizarre behavior,"
Stephen Doyle,Al and Alma's is really a pretty class operation. And it doesn't matter who it would be. Blatant sexual behavior on those cruises on the lake is simply unacceptable.
Lamont Dozier,"She put it up on the school bulletin board, and that gave me such a jump-start toward writing more things,"
Lamont Dozier,Young writers should definitely research the current sounds and styles.
Lamont Dozier,"We wanted to guide the musicians, so we could create our own sound. We would never let the band just go in and play the chord sheets. We were very focused on what we had in mind for these productions."
Rahul Dravid,He has proved his worth over the years and is always an asset to the side.
Rahul Dravid,It was an unfortunate way to lose the match. But rules are rules and they are part of the game. The match was heading towards an exciting finish when it had to be called off.
Rahul Dravid,We might not risk him if the problem doesn't settle.
Rahul Dravid,I think the way Asif bowled with the new ball in both innings was quality stuff. He put the ball in the right areas and used the seam beautifully.
Rahul Dravid,"Against a good quality seam attack not only us, anyone could have faced a problem. Asif hit the seam on the deck regularly at the right line and I have no doubt his bowling in both innings made the difference."
Rahul Dravid,"If you are quick, accurate and can swing the ball around, you always pose problems."
Rahul Dravid,We are planning to developing a strategy which will give us 20 wickets in a match as in the last four encounters we were unable to do so for a victory.
Rahul Dravid,It was a great professional performance from our team. We had four run outs in Pakistan innings that was fantastic. The boys were confident after our bowlers did well and restricted Pakistan to 265 on a good batting wicket.
Rahul Dravid,Last couple of months have been really good. There have been good performance from all the players.
Rahul Dravid,We have a young and inexperienced bowling attack. So we have to come up with new ideas. We have to be a little better that what we have done so far.
Rahul Dravid,"If we play good cricket, we should win,"
Rahul Dravid,"Seeing the video, cricket seems like fun, I didn't know that. We only know about fast bowlers, dressing room and hotels. Now I know what to do after I finish with cricket. You meet so many people and have such fun. It is quite interesting and exciting."
Rahul Dravid,We're playing some good cricket and everyone in the team is contributing. We ran away with this one.
Rahul Dravid,We know we have to play well. We have to play one day of good cricket out of the remaining two to win the series. We are confident of doing it. We have shown in the last two games we can play well in all departments.
Rahul Dravid,"We had great cricket in two last two series because of the quality of pitches. Unfortunately, the wickets in the first two Tests here have not lived up to the expectations of an India-Pakistan contest."
Rahul Dravid,Hopefully we have a good wicket in Karachi so that both teams can play some entertaining cricket.
Rahul Dravid,"It will tough for both the teams, it will be an interesting day's cricket."
Rahul Dravid,"While it is always special to play your 100th game, the focus really is on playing good cricket and trying to win."
Rahul Dravid,It was not that a single performance lifted us. It was a hard fight and we played good cricket. But we can't slip up as there is still a lot left in the series.
Rahul Dravid,"Irrespective of what happened in the past (the just-concluded Test series), we will play positive and good cricket."
Rahul Dravid,The cricket talent in India is still very much untapped. The hope is that the new money can help find our future stars.
Rahul Dravid,"It's a great sign for him and for Indian cricket. Hopefully, he will go from strength to strength from here."
Rahul Dravid,It is natural that if you play too much against one country people tend to lost interest.
Rahul Dravid,It is a different competition with different rules. Pakistan is a good one-day side especially at home. We have a young side who has done well recently. We are looking forward to it.
Rahul Dravid,There are choices to make and someone will be unlucky. That is how life is.
Rahul Dravid,We had let ourselves down with some poor shots early on. The young boys showed us how to play.
Rahul Dravid,The boys responded well to challenges and the various roles they were asked to perform in the team. They also adjusted to the changes in the batting order.
Rahul Dravid,It has been a good two weeks. The boys responded very well.
Rahul Dravid,"We went through a difficult 10 days, but all the boys showed lot of spirit and determination to comeback strongly in the one-day series."
Rahul Dravid,I thought it was a very professional performance from our boys. The key was the bowling. They bowled really well on a good batting track.
Rahul Dravid,"We have the option of taking up the issue with the relevant authorities, but keeping the relevance and importance of the series we have decided to let the issue pass and put it to rest."
Rahul Dravid,It?s the normal pressure or anxiety to perform well which is good. We know Pakistan?s recent performance against us has been good. But statistics don?t count much as in one-day cricket the team that performs well on that day will win.
Rahul Dravid,"Everyone has ready advice. The question is, whom do you accept it from? For insurance advice, I trust Max New York Life."
Rahul Dravid,"The rule as it is now, gives a huge advantage to the captain inning the toss. So, I think, they (ICC) should continue with it and allow the team to pick their super sub after the toss."
Dr. Dre,"You got to realise that when I was 20 years old, I had a house, a Mercedes, a Corvette and a million dollars in the bank before I could buy alcohol legally."
Dr. Dre,"Mission accomplished, we didn't have any problems as far as violence goes."
Dr. Dre,I'm gonna try and change the course of hip hop again.
Bill Dreikosen,We got a little trigger-happy there.
Bill Dreikosen,"It was a scrappy game. I was really pleased with the last five minutes. I thought our execution was a little bit better, we got some key rebounds and we stepped up and hit our free throws when we needed them."
Bill Dreikosen,We talked (before the game) about playing with some energy and enthusiasm. I really thought our kids did. You could feel some vibes of having fun out there.
Fran Drescher,"I'm very committed to changing legislation to broaden the scope of women's health care but, at the same time, I want to live my life to the fullest."
Fran Drescher,"Ray was not even cool back in those days. He wasn't popular, he wasn't cool. It's so funny, and now he's like so popular and everything"
Fran Drescher,"And remember, it's also very funny, because side by side with grief lies joy."
Fran Drescher,"Once you wake up and smell the coffee, it's hard to go back to sleep."
Fran Drescher,"I definitely do support The American Cancer Foundation, as well as a myriad of other cancer groups and hospitals."
Fran Drescher,I had my moments when I got very frightened that I would not recover.
Fran Drescher,"I have been dairy free for several years, and I started because I felt it was going to reduce my allergies, which it did, and help me lose weight, which it did."
Marie Dressler,"There is a vast difference between success at twenty-five and success at sixty.  At sixty, nobody envies you.  Instead, everybody rejoices generously, sincerely, in your good fortune."
Marie Dressler,"In order to represent life on the stage, we must rub elbows with life, live ourselves."
Marie Dressler,Fate cast me to play the role of an ugly duckling with no promise of swanning. I have played my life as a comedy rather than the tragedy many would have made of it.
Marie Dressler,"What a wretched lot of old shrivelled creatures we shall be by-and-by. Never mind- the uglier we get in the eyes of others, the lovelier we shall be to each other; that has always been my firm faith about friendship."
Marie Dressler,Any fact is better established by two or three good testimonies than by a thousand arguments.
Marie Dressler,No vice is so bad as advice
Marie Dressler,Only a few things are really important.
Scott Drew,"It was great to see the little things work tonight. Your first close game like this is always tough, and to do it with such young players is great."
Scott Drew,He just lightens up a room with that smile.
Scott Drew,"We're very excited with the progress we've made in a short period of time. Our goal is to be a competitive program as soon as we can, rather than waiting."
Scott Drew,"There's only so much you can accomplish in practice. We accomplished all that. And we made it through as a team, and still like each other."
Scott Drew,"Aaron had a very busy summer, and that's something a lot of coaches fear. I don't know if that has something to do with it. Sometimes international experience can wear on you."
Scott Drew,"Curtis came in with a Big 12 body. It's tough for people to overpower him. He's very good offensively, but we're really proud of the way he's progressed defensively."
Scott Drew,They have the talent and the athletic ability and the depth. They are right there.
Patrick Driessen,"Leaders are readers, so lead oneself to read!"
Patrick Driessen,"Do all things with love, passion and dedication!"

Patrick Driessen,Sometimes it is best to take time to be quiet!
Patrick Driessen,True leaders are a threat to average leaders and managers because they rattle their cages!
Patrick Driessen,The best investment anyone can ever make is an investment in oneself!
Patrick Driessen,"Most of the things people worry about never happens! If you unworry more often, you will succeed more often!"
Donald Driver,It's great. They have really high-quality things. Things you don't see anywhere else.
Donald Driver,"We normally play on 'Monday Night Football' pretty good and have a show. But, instead, the Baltimore Ravens had a show, and we were just there."
Donald Driver,The season was over Christmas Day. This is a new year and we started off a new season today.
Didier Drogba,"Didier, it's done!' he shouted. That made me smile and since then Michael has seemed happy with everything like a kid. He is great to have around the place, he's thirsty for knowledge and he's a great player as well."
Didier Drogba,We promised you that our victory would bring back peace to our country.
Didier Drogba,"If such events should occur (again), I would no longer take the risk to come and play for the national team."
Didier Drogba,"This is the reward of all my hard work, but also a sign of encouragement that I can still get better. I know that I am capable."
Didier Drogba,Unfortunately in the emotion of winning the game my comments have come across partly in the wrong way. I want to make clear that I don't dive.
Peter Drucker,Everything must degenerate into work if anything is to happen.
Peter Drucker,"The honest work of yesterday has lost its social status, its social esteem."
Peter Drucker,"Until we can manage TIME, we can manage nothing else."
Peter Drucker,"Everything requires time. It is the only truly universal condition. All work takes place in time and uses up time. Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable, and necessary resource. Nothing else, perhaps, distinguishes effective executives as much as their tender loving care of time."
Peter Drucker,"One cannot buy, rent or hire more time. The supply of time is totally inelastic. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it. Time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday's time is gone forever, and will never come back. Time is always in short supply. There is no substitute for time. Everything requires time. All work takes place in, and uses up time. Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable and necessary resource."
Peter Drucker,My greatest strength as a consultant is to be ignorant and ask a few questions
Peter Drucker,"Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier puts in. It is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for. A product is not quality because it is hard to make and costs a lot of money, as manufacturers typically believe. This is incompetence. Customers pay only for what is of use to them and gives them value. Nothing else constitutes quality."
Peter Drucker,We know nothing about motivation. All we can do is write books about it.
Peter Drucker,The better a man is the more mistakes he will make for the more things he will try.
Peter Drucker,There are no creeds in mathematics.
Peter Drucker,There is an enormous number of managers who have retired on the job.
Peter Drucker,"Management means, in the last analysis, the substitution of thought for brawn and muscle, of knowledge for folklore and superstition, and of cooperation for force. . ."
Peter Drucker,"The leaders who work most effectively, it seems to me, never say I. And that's not because they have trained themselves not to say I. They don't think I. They think we; they think team. They understand their job to be to make the team function. They accept responsibility and don't sidestep it, but we gets the credit. This is what creates trust, what enables you to get the task done."
Peter Drucker,"INNOVATION is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an opportunity for a different business or a different service. It is capable of being presented as a discipline, capable of being learned, capable of being practiced. Entrepreneurs need to search purposefully for the sources of innovation, the changes and their symptoms that indicate opportunities for successful innovation. And they need to know and to apply the principles of successful innovation."
Peter Drucker,How can we overcome the resistance to innovation that plagues most organizations?
Peter Drucker,Objectives are not fate; they are direction. They are not commands; they are commitments. They do not determine the future; they are means to mobilize the resources and energies of the business for the making of the future.
Peter Drucker,Capital formation is shifting from the entrepreneur who invests in the future to the pension trustee who invests in the past
Peter Drucker,Education can no longer be the sole property of the state.
Peter Drucker,"The growth for education and training will be in continuing adult education. Online delivery is the trigger for this growth, but the demand for lifetime education stems from profound changes in society. We live in an economy where knowledge, not buildings and machinery, is the chief resource and where knowledge-workers make up the biggest part of the work force."
Peter Drucker,Decision making is the specific executive task.
Peter Drucker,Concentration is the key to economic results. No other principles of effectiveness is violated as constantly today as the basic principle of concentration.
Peter Drucker,"Leaders shouldn't attach moral significance to their ideas: Do that, and you can't compromise."
Peter Drucker,The really important things are said over cocktails and are never done.
Peter Drucker,The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said.
Peter Drucker,A business exists to create a customer
Peter Drucker,"Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision"
Peter Drucker,"There is only one ethics, one set of rules of morality, one code: That of  individual behavior in which the same rules apply to everyone alike."
Peter Drucker,The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer.
Peter Drucker,Most discussions of decision making assume that only senior executives make decisions or that only senior executives' decisions matter. This is a dangerous mistake.
Peter Drucker,"Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of competence and performance. In teaching we rely on the naturals, the ones who somehow know how to teach."
Peter Drucker,Rank does not confer privilege or give power. It imposes responsibility.
Peter Drucker,Executives owe it to the organization and to their fellow workers not to tolerate nonperforming individuals in important jobs.
Peter Drucker,Today knowledge has power. It controls access to opportunity and advancement.
Peter Drucker,"Company cultures are like country cultures. Never try to change one. Try, instead, to work with what you've got."
Peter Drucker,Accept the fact that we have to treat almost anybody as a volunteer.
Peter Drucker,The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said.
Peter Drucker,"Few companies that installed computers to reduce the employment of clerks have realized their expectations... They now need more, and more expensive clerks even though they call them 'operators' or 'programmers.'"
Peter Drucker,"Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes... but no plans."
Peter Drucker,The purpose of a business is to create a customer.
Peter Drucker,My greatest strength as a consultant is to be ignorant and ask a few questions.
Peter Drucker,A manager is responsible for the application and performance of knowledge.
Peter Drucker,So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work.
Peter Drucker,"Suppliers and especially manufacturers have market power because they have information about a product or a service that the customer does not and cannot have, and does not need if he can trust the brand. This explains the profitability of brands."
Peter Drucker,The productivity of work is not the responsibility of the worker but of the manager.
Peter Drucker,"Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes."
Peter Drucker,The most efficient way to produce anything is to bring together under one management as many as possible of the activities needed to turn out the product.
Peter Drucker,The only thing we know about the future is that it will be different.
Peter Drucker,The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Peter Drucker,The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself.
Peter Drucker,No institution can possibly survive if it needs geniuses or supermen to manage it. It must be organized in such a way as to be able to get along under a leadership composed of average human beings.
Peter Drucker,Management by objective works - if you know the objectives. Ninety percent of the time you don't.
Peter Drucker,We now accept the fact that learning is a lifelong process of keeping abreast of change. And the most pressing task is to teach people how to learn.
Peter Drucker,Effective leadership is not about making speeches or being liked; leadership is defined by results not attributes.
Peter Drucker,"The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity."
Peter Drucker,Efficiency is doing better what is already being done.
Peter Drucker,Trying to predict the future is like trying to drive down a country road at night with no lights while looking out the back window.
Peter Drucker,"Checking the results of a decision against its expectations shows executives what their strengths are, where they need to improve, and where they lack knowledge or information."
Peter Drucker,We can say with certainty - or 90% probability - that the new industries that are about to be born will have nothing to do with information.
Peter Drucker,There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.
Peter Drucker,Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.
Peter Drucker,Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.
Peter Drucker,Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship. The act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.
Peter Drucker,Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.
Peter Drucker,Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work.
Peter Drucker,People who don't take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year. People who do take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year.
Peter Drucker,Time is the scarcest resource and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed.
Peter Drucker,Making good decisions is a crucial skill at every level.
Peter Drucker,Never mind your happiness; do your duty.
Peter Drucker,When a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course.
Peter Drucker,The new information technology... Internet and e-mail... have practically eliminated the physical costs of communications.
Peter Drucker,The computer is a moron.
Peter Drucker,Most of what we call management consists of making it difficult for people to get their work done.
Peter Drucker,"Business, that's easily defined - it's other people's money."
Don Drummond,"You will see further back-up in yields. The economy is robust, which will add fuel to expectations the Bank of Canada will keep raising interest rates."
Don Drummond,Canada has recorded a remarkably bad productivity performance. Productivity has been tepid in terms of absolute growth rates and relative to the growth and levels recorded in other major economies. If this continues it will threaten the standard of living of Canadians.
Don Drummond,There's no doubt we have a mild case of Dutch disease running in Canada.
Don Drummond,"If the economy continues running at a rapid pace, the Bank of Canada has to raise interest rates further. Yields will go up as people expect the Bank of Canada may go more than just one more time."
Don Drummond,"What Canada needs is a shift in focus away from consumption and towards savings and investment,"
Gordon Drummond,"It's definitely our biggest game of the season and we should be at full strength, with the same XI who beat SMRH,"
Gordon Drummond,"[Drummond stressed last Saturday's victory over SMRH was] a good team performance with James Henderson, James Janion, Mick Butler, James Easton, David McLean and Mike Leggat all making worthwhile contributions. ... Gordon was the best bowler in the division."
Gordon Drummond,"James has been a tremendous influence at the club, not only with his performances on the field, but also with his coaching,"
Gordon Drummond,We moved our original fashion show to coincide with the fashion week dates for next month. That will go ahead in any case. We still support the idea of a fashion week and will be working positively with the organisers.
Lori Drumtra,"That felt good, to show that we could actually shoot the ball and make some baskets."
Lori Drumtra,"I knew [Arnold] was good, but not that good. She played very well and showed some intelligence for the game."
Lori Drumtra,"I'm not complaining about the calls, but boy, it sure did seem like it was rough on our end (of the court)."
Ken Dryden,"It represents a huge new opportunity here,"
Ken Dryden,"The money is to be spent on the well-being of families,"
Ken Dryden,"For 18 months, we had worked on something that mattered: a national system of early learning and child care. Then it was gone."
Ken Dryden,"[A goalie's] job is to stop pucks, ... Well, yeah, that's part of it. But you know what else it is? ... You're trying to deliver a message to your team that things are OK back here. This end of the ice is pretty well cared for. You take it now and go. Go! Feel the freedom you need in order to be that dynamic, creative, offensive player and go out and score. ... That was my job. And it was to try to deliver a feeling."
Ken Dryden,"For example, what it represents is for a territory like Nunavut, they would get about eight times as much in those transfers as the highest province would, P.E.I.,"
Ken Dryden,"As kids we knew whatever Canada was then it would be far greater tomorrow. That is the Canada I see today. That was the Canada born into me. Long before I ever wore the jersey, I wore the jersey."
Don Drysdale,"If they knocked two of your guys down, I'd get four. You have to protect your hitters."
Don Drysdale,I hate all hitters. I start a game mad and I stay that way until it's over.
Don Drysdale,"When I throw a curve that hangs and it goes for a hit, I want to chew up my glove."
Don Drysdale,"A torn rotator cuff is a cancer for a pitcher and if a pitcher gets a badly torn one, he has to face the facts, it's all over baby."
Don Drysdale,"My own little rule was two for one. If one of my teammates got knocked down, then I knocked down two on the other team."
Don Drysdale,"The pitcher has to find out if the hitter is timid, and if he is timid, he has to remind the hitter he's timid."
Don Drysdale,"It's a bottom line business where a lot of gray suits are brought in and then, within two years, these guys suddenly know everything about baseball."
Don Drysdale,"Some of these guys wear beards to make them look intimidating, but they don't look so tough when they have to deliver the ball. Their abilities and their attitudes don't back up their beards."
Donna Dubinsky,"We recognize that uncertainty regarding Palm's future pricing creates uncertainly for Handspring's near-term sales and margin outlook, and to the extent that we need to respond, we will."
Donna Dubinsky,"At Handspring, we believe that the future of the handheld industry lies in wireless communication, and we are investing our resources accordingly."
Donna Dubinsky,"We are pleased with the results of the quarter, particularly our ability to achieve revenue growth in what is usually a sequentially down quarter in our industry."
Mike DuBose,"It's more about the love of the game, and I don't mean to put that part of it down. There's nothing wrong with wanting to go to the National Football League. ... (But) there's something appealing to me to see guys working, sacrificing of themselves because they love the game."
Mike DuBose,I can promise you that I'm not picking up the phone and calling to find other jobs. This is what I want to do. I can finish my coaching career right here and be just as happy.
Mike DuBose,"There's some things I've done wrong that I've asked forgiveness for, and there's some things other people have done that I've forgiven them for. I have absolutely no ill feelings, no anger, no resentment for anybody that's had anything to do with the past."
Mike DuBose,The same things win. It doesn't matter where you coach them. The game's the same.
Jean Dubuffet,"Unless one says goodbye to what one loves, and unless one travels to completely new territories, one can expect merely a long wearing away of oneself and an eventual extinction."
Jean Dubuffet,"The State has but one face for me: that of the police. To my eyes, all of the State's ministries have this single face, and I cannot imagine the ministry of culture other than as the police of culture, with its prefect and commissioners."
Jean Dubuffet,"What culture lacks is the taste for anonymous, innumerable germination. Culture is smitten with counting and measuring; it feels out of place and uncomfortable with the innumerable; its efforts tend, on the contrary, to limit the numbers in all domains; it tries to count on its fingers."
Jean Dubuffet,"For me, insanity is super sanity. The normal is psychotic. Normal means lack of imagination, lack of creativity."
Andre Dubus,"What creates dispair is the imagination, which insists on predicting millions of moments, thousands of days, and so drains you that you cannot live the moment at hand."
Andre Dubus,"Berg writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, loneliness, love, and hope. And the transcendence that redeems."
Andre Dubus,"Shyness has a strange element of narcissism, a belief that how we look, how we perform, is truly important to other people."
Gilles Duceppe,This is a transition budget that was not worth triggering an election over.
Gilles Duceppe,"We will be responsible. When something that is proposed that is good for Quebec, we will support that."
Gilles Duceppe,"This is the worst thing that can happen in a democracy, and I'm saying that against the Liberal Party,"
Gilles Duceppe,"In Quebec, there is no place for corruption. You cannot trust the Liberals, but you can trust the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois."
Gilles Duceppe,"In Quebec, there is no place for corruption, ... You cannot trust the Liberals, but you can trust the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois."
Gilles Duceppe,Why is this government so insensitive to the concerns of the middle-class people?
Gilles Duceppe,"When they don't have the moral authority to govern, we have to express what Quebeckers think, and I think Quebeckers don't want the Liberals any more. So we're expressing the voices of all those that elected us."
Gilles Duceppe,"When they don't have the moral authority to govern, we have to express what Quebeckers think, and I think Quebeckers don't want the Liberals any more, ... So we're expressing the voices of all those that elected us."
Gilles Duceppe,Paul Martin's government has lost the moral authority to govern.
Gilles Duceppe,"They no longer have the moral authority to govern,"
Gilles Duceppe,"Today is the moment of truth for the Liberals, who do not have moral authority to govern. Will the prime minister respect the will of the elected representatives of the people and recognize he no longer has their trust?"
Gilles Duceppe,Why would it be ridiculous that Quebec has an army?
Gilles Duceppe,"If you develop a foreign policy the way we see it, then we'll have an army that will intervene mainly to secure democracy in some countries, participating in international forces, going when there's a natural catastrophe, either inside Quebec or outside Quebec,"
Gilles Duceppe,"There'll be an army, of course,"
Marcel Duchamp,"I am interested in ideas, not merely in visual products"
Marcel Duchamp,"The individual, man as a man, man as a brain, if you like, interests me more than what he makes, because I've noticed that most artists only repeat themselves."
Marcel Duchamp,"All in all, the creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act. This becomes even more obvious when posterity gives its final verdict and sometimes rehabilitates forgotten artists."
Jared Dudley,"Their team is very quick, very athletic and they try to use that strength to their advantage. We're going to use our strengths, too."
Jared Dudley,"We always talk about that killer instinct. You don't want to trade baskets at this time of the year, and I thought for the first time all year we really put the hammer down."
Jared Dudley,"You've got to have killer instinct. For the first time all year, we did that. You can't trade baskets, especially at this time because that's when you get beat."
Jared Dudley,"He's a rare player to come in the way he has and shoot the three ball without fear, and no one has to tell him to shoot the ball. He definitely has the confidence to shoot."
Robert Dudley,All sorts of scenarios are floated. That does not mean that any of these ideas will see the light of day.
Robert Dudley,It's no longer the case that energy security is only about supply disruptions.
Robert Dudley,"The oil and gas industry is one of very long lead times. All of the companies in the country need to start investing now, but to do that we need to have a clear investment framework."
Robert Dudley,Today's articles are premature and a bit risky. The stories have a destabilizing effect on the community we work in.
William Dudley,"The Fed is on hold at least through the election but I think we'll get a little more tightening at the start of next year. I think, for the time being, we have a soft landing. But I think the reality is the stock market rally will probably add a little fuel to the economy and the tightening will return next year."
William Dudley,"There seems very little doubt that the Fed will go a quarter-point. There is no evidence of inflation pressures yet, so the Fed can afford to be patient if they want to, but I don't think they want to wait around for problems."
William Dudley,This disaster is unleashing the type of energy-supply shock that we had viewed as the economy's greatest vulnerability.
William Dudley,It's not that growth is bad. It's that the consequences of that growth can be negative.
William Dudley,"Given the Fed's apparent comfort with market expectations and press reports to the contrary, we reluctantly have to conclude that a rate hike is now the most likely outcome next week."
Brian Duffy,"The International Space Station will give us a place where we  can learn more about living in space, ... looking forward to using the space station, to do all the things  that zero gravity can do."
Brian Duffy,"The International Space Station will give us a place where we can learn more about living in space, ... looking forward to using the space station, to do all the things that zero gravity can do."
Brian Duffy,I think they're really going to be happy to get here.
Brian Duffy,"We always get a lot of guys on the football team, so this definitely hurt us in the spring, ... We had to struggle to get three [new members] but now we have had 30 rushes and 21 of them are sophomore football guys. I don't think it has really deferred anyone who was going to rush last year, they just waited a semester."
Brian Duffy,Together we're providing people with the information they need to make informed choices during this year's open enrollment season.
Brian Duffy,"These were valued colleagues and we hate to see them go, ... But the nature of the business is changing in a way that we just needed to restructure."
James Duffy,a waste of the taxpayers' money.
James Duffy,"This is becoming the pre-eminent issue of labor negotiations. Sikorsky is certainly making good money, and if they want good workers they will have to pay good benefits."
James Duffy,An off-duty officer should be able to carry weapons anywhere. We're an asset to public safety.
Wim Duisenberg,"Consequently, the strength in the upturn in economic activity has become more uncertain inside and outside the euro area."
Wim Duisenberg,far too early to judge what the events... will have for an impact on medium-term developments.
Wim Duisenberg,"At this juncture, there is less risk that excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressure given the environment of subdued demand,"
Wim Duisenberg,The trend in the growth of loans to the private sector also seems to point in this direction.
Wim Duisenberg,"I'm rather inclined to say this deplorable action by the United States' authorities to protect its steel industry may have something to do with the exchange rate of the dollar, as it is being experienced by the American steel industry."
Stephane Dujarric,"While maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the state, security considerations should not be the basis for denying citizens their right to peaceful protest _ a right for which virtually all avenues seem to be closing."
Stephane Dujarric,It is likely that the report will go to the Security Council as early as Friday.
Stephane Dujarric,As far as we're concerned the planning is going ahead. We're talking to the AU.
Stephane Dujarric,The secretary general condemns these attacks which represent an unacceptable assault upon the peace process and urges all concerned parties to work together in a spirit of national unity and reconciliation.
Stephane Dujarric,Sri Lanka has lost a deeply respected statesman dedicated to peace and national unity. The secretary-general hopes that this tragedy will not weaken the commitment of the people of Sri Lanka to achieve a durable peace in the country.
Stephane Dujarric,"There is an audit being done of peacekeeping department management. As a result of that audit, which also took a look at the procurement department ... we have put eight staff members on special leave with pay."
Stephane Dujarric,"He already accepted responsibility for management failures in the Secretariat. He also notes that the latest report confirms the committee's earlier finding that the respective roles and responsibilities of the Secretariat, the Security Council and the 661 Committee -- which approved all of the contracts, including the prices -- were never clearly enough defined. Most importantly, the secretary-general believes that thorough reform of the management structures and practices of the United Nations, especially those that relate to oversight, transparency and accountability, is vital."

Most importantly, the secretary-general believes that thorough reform of the management structures and practices of the United Nations, especially those that relate to oversight, transparency and accountability, is vital."
Stephane Dujarric,The Secretary-General encourages the Ivorian leaders to continue this constructive dialogue. He assures the Ivorian parties of the United Nations' support for the implementation of the recommendations of the Yamoussoukro meeting.
Stephane Dujarric,He hopes ... to meet with a number of leaders from Europe and from the Islamic world and to discuss with them ways of calming the situation and allowing a constructive dialogue between people of different faiths and traditions based on mutual understanding and respect.
Stephane Dujarric,"If there is to be peace in the Middle East, it will require leadership, vision and the willingness of leaders on both sides to make sacrifices for the greater good. In this context, the secretary-general commends the courageous decision of Prime Minister Sharon to carry through with the painful process of disengagement from the Gaza Strip and part of the northern West Bank."
Stephane Dujarric,"However we very much hope that the US will continue to be an active player, to defend universal human rights and support the work of the Human Rights Council."
Stephane Dujarric,Turkish health authorities have informed WHO that a total of nine additional patients have been hospitalized in the eastern part of the country.
Stephane Dujarric,We will then go back to those countries that have the capacity and the resources to help put that force together.
Stephane Dujarric,"We've relayed our concerns to them and as I said, it's our duty to speak up to them when we think that the framework they're talking about doesn't meet electoral standards. When there is a contradiction on two different interpretations within one text that would become an issue."
Stephane Dujarric,"That being said, it is our duty in our role in Iraq to point out when the process does not meet international standards."
Stephane Dujarric,The secretary-general urges the parties to seize the unique opportunity and extend the necessary cooperation to the commission so that the expeditious demarcation of the common border can take place.
Stephane Dujarric,"As far as the U.N. is concerned, the constitution itself will have to be judged by the Iraqis on the 15th of October during the referendum. It should come as no surprise that within the U.N. staff who deal with Iraq there would be papers analyzing latest developments in that country, but it's an internal analysis."
Stephane Dujarric,The Secretary General emphasizes that compromise and mutual understanding are critical if the parties are to quickly resolve the remaining issues under consideration.
Stephane Dujarric,"He urges that this commitment be honored, thus ending the violence which has caused so much suffering over so many years."
Stephane Dujarric,"The U.N. reiterates that it will strictly enforce a zero tolerance policy concerning unethical, unprofessional or fraudulent behavior for U.N. contractors."
Stephane Dujarric,"The U.N. reiterates that it will strictly enforce a zero tolerance policy concerning unethical, unprofessional or fraudulent behavior for U.N. contractors,"
Stephane Dujarric,He also calls on the Government of Lebanon to extend its authority over all of its territory in accordance with Security Council resolutions.
Stephane Dujarric,"The secretary-general believes that it is of utmost importance to find ways to implement the cease-fire agreement, start rebuilding trust and lay the foundations for a lasting peace."
David Duke,I don't call myself a white supremacist. I'm a civil rights activist concerned about European-American rights.
David Duke,Absolutely committed to spending the rest of my life as a spokesman for the rights of European Americans.
David Duke,"European-Americans now have the National Organization for European American Rights, to actively defend their rights and heritage in the United States."
David Duke,Our clear goal must be the advancement of the white race and separation of the white and black races. This goal must include freeing of the American media and government from subservient Jewish interests.
David Duke,"Russia's biggest problem is organized crime and its leaders are influenced by the Russian mafia. But it's not right to call it a Russian mafia, it's a Jewish mafia."
David Duke,The truth is there are two hundred white women raped in America by a black man for every one black woman raped by whites.
David Duke,"The civil rights of European Americans are being violated by affirmative action, forced integration and anti-European immigration policies... . We face cultural discrimination in the media and education... . An example is the media hate crime hysteria that highlights and publicizes any white crime against minorities."
Mike Duke,"We have to reflect on our shortcomings. We have to be self-critical and think about how do we raise the bar,"
Mike Duke,"Seiyu's performance in the third quarter has been disappointing, but we remain confident in the company's long-term future,"
Mike Duke,"Seiyu's performance in the third quarter has been disappointing, but we remain confident in the company's long-term future."
Mike Duke,India is becoming a consumer economy.
Joe Dumars,"I think he's special because he has a gift to understand the game and the talent to back it up. He sees the floor, he gets everybody else involved and he plays to win."
Joe Dumars,"It's always cool to be a part of anything that hasn't happened before. This is a great sports town, and the fans around here are about to really have some fun following both teams."
Joe Dumars,I think the (brawl) made the league and the players more conscious of our responsibility to the public.
Joe Dumars,We wish him the best and good health going forward.
Joe Dumars,"I never even thought about the Hall of Fame as a player. Really, all I thought about was trying to play to a bar that players before me had set."
Joe Dumars,"The one thing that I really want, ... is for our second group to be an energy unit. That's what we had in our championship run, and that's what I think you are starting to see with this group."
Joe Dumars,That's the guy. He brings great energy.
Joe Dumars,Maurice is the kind of player we think is going to fit in with our team and our culture. Maurice brings a really strong competitive streak with him and can play two positions for us.
Joe Dumars,"I told him I'm gonna call him out so bad. On the phone conversation I had with him, when I saw him, he's extremely happy. I'm blowing his cover and letting you know, he's extremely happy to be on the team."
Joe Dumars,To have your body of work honored in this manner is the ultimate in any profession. I was blessed to play with some great players and for a tremendous organization.
Joe Dumars,These guys aren't five stiffs from off the street. They're excellent players. But the key was their willingness and ability to mesh with each other and the ability of our coaches [Larry Brown and now Flip Saunders] to help that process along.
John Dunbar,"[The researchers actually reanalyzed old data, using more sophisticated mathematics that took into account that there might be a lot of some species and very little of others.] In previous analyses, researchers did not account for differences in species abundance, ... As a result, they dramatically undercounted."
John Dunbar,"With improved analytical methods, we show that the abundance distribution and total diversity of soil-borne bacteria can be deciphered,"
John Dunbar,"With improved analytical methods, we show that the abundance distribution and total diversity of soil-borne bacteria can be deciphered."
Alan Duncan,"[Tory MPs breezed into the meeting as if it was their birthday party.] We love it! ... rah, rah, rah from the back row!"
Alan Duncan,"the Government may have won in court, but the questions in Parliament are only just beginning. Having escaped the judgement today, Parliament will now have the opportunity to judge them."
Alan Duncan,"The government may have won in court, but the questions in Parliament are only just beginning. The proceedings in court have flushed out a catalogue of contemptible conduct which displays corruption and deceit at the heart of this government."
John Duncan,The U.S. television show
John Duncan,I am prepared to broker a meeting between the federal justice minister and the provincial attorney general. I want them to meet to determine how far they are prepared to go to implement criminal liability in the workplace and then to say so publicly.
John Duncan,"It would definitely hurt our state, if we lose the equivalent of 11 percent of our House delegation,"
John Duncan,"Canadians are being hit hard in the wallet as gas prices continue to rise and yet the Liberal government doesn't seem to care,"
John Duncan,The Liberal government doesn't seem to care.
John Duncan,"All he has served to do by doing this in a backwards fashion is harden the U.S. administration's position,"
John Duncan,Marathons aren't a hobby; they're a disease.
John Duncan,"We've had a lot of rain, but really no adverse winds. It's really winds out of the wrong direction or high winds that give us trouble."
Tim Duncan,"They did a great job double-teaming me. I got in foul trouble, my shots weren't going down, and things just weren't working my way. I tried to be as aggressive as I could, but they were defending me very well. I finally got some shots to go down late in the game when it seemed like it didn't matter anymore."
Tim Duncan,We did a good job to fight back into it. We got the stops and jus made too many mistakes down the stretch.
Tim Duncan,"They were solid all along. That's what killed us. Defensively, we tried to make them make some mistakes and get some turnovers, but they moved the ball well. Elton Brand was incredible. It seemed like he didn't miss a shot out there."
Tim Duncan,"We know what we have left, and we just have to kind of get it done. We still have a chance to end up with one of our best seasons yet, so we just have to turn that corner and get back on a roll before the playoffs come around."
Tim Duncan,It has been a long journey. We felt like we would prevail because we felt like the idea was such a good idea.
Tim Duncan,"They have a solid team. Elton is having a heck of a year. He hurt us last time, so we decided to come after him. We made it difficult for him tonight."
Tim Duncan,It was a huge key. He really hurt us last time. We decided to come after him and make them change their game a little bit.
Tim Duncan,We were turning the ball over and we were giving up offensive boards. We needed to stop giving the ball up and blocking out better.
Tim Duncan,"I thought we really kept our composure, kept fighting. We just kind of found a way to get it done."
Tim Duncan,There's no excuses to be made. We lost the game.
Tim Duncan,I think he has a shot at winning three events at the state meet.
Tim Duncan,We have to keep our composure and understand that they're going to have a lot of emotions [in Game 4]. There are good things to learn from this game. We just lost on a crazy shot.
Tim Duncan,That's way above where we need to be. We need to get back down to our comfort zone.
Tim Duncan,"I've got no choice but to (watch the standings). Every time I walk into the practice facility it's right there, so I know what's going on."
Tim Duncan,The time when there is no one there to feel sorry for you or to cheer for you is when a player is made.
Tim Duncan,The problem they have is convincing advertisers it's a viable medium. I think that's a big hurdle.
Tim Duncan,"Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best."
Tony Dungy,"We're happy for Mike. I don't know what the league's rationale is on it, but I'm sure they looked at all the facts."
Tony Dungy,"We're obviously happy for Mike. I don't know what the league's rationale is on it, but I'm sure they looked at all the facts and that's what they decided to. It's really out of our hands and we've just decided to be thankful for whatever happens."
Tony Dungy,"Like '94 with Warren Moon and Joe Montana, you'll see two future Hall-of-Famers in Saturday's game."
Tony Dungy,"With my son's situation and our family, it puts it all into perspective."
Tony Dungy,Hopefully we can defend that a little bit better. But they play well and they play with a lot of emotion when they play against us. We've got to be able to beat them.
Tony Dungy,We have to learn to channel our emotion and energy. We didn't play with a lot of composure.
Tony Dungy,"We'll know a little bit more [today]. We're going to meet with the doctors. The preliminary news is pretty good. We're going to keep him in a walking boot this week. But it really looks like he'll be ready to go next week. That's what we know preliminarily right now,"
Tony Dungy,Those guys deserve everything they get. You couldn't coach two players that you would want this to happen for more.
Tony Dungy,"We drove the ball and just didn't finish some drives. If people want to make us go down the field at a slow pace, we can do that when we don't have all the penalties, dropped balls and missed assignments."
Tony Dungy,"It's just that guys were very focused. We knew where a lot of the balls would go, and once we got into a situation where Martin had to throw and try to make some plays ... that's when you generally get the interceptions."
Tony Dungy,"He's a physical guy, who is a good special teams player. He's a good guy and a good athlete and we'll get a chance to see what he can do, for a few days at least."
Katherine Dunham,"You know, this isn't theatre like it used to be."
Katherine Dunham,I used to want the words She tried on my tombstone. Now I want She did it.
Katherine Dunham,Without my husband's costumes I wouldn't have known how to accomplish what I saw in my own mind's eyes for choreography. And then seeing our choreography and knowing the background of it I am sure helped my husband a great deal with what he designed for us.
Katherine Dunham,"We have a group of friends of the museum who try to raise, if they can, periodically something to help us. Of course, the main thing about a building like this is its upkeep. It needs central heating and it needs central air conditioning."
Katherine Dunham,"We don't intend to always keep this necessarily African oriented. Originally I had hoped to have African American Indian of this area, and the Appalachian of this area, but at the same time, just as we have the Haitian room, we will always have room for another exhibit."
Katherine Dunham,The older I grow the more I see the influence of my family on my life. I didn't always see it. It was up to our parents to see that we had our education in a town that hadn't yet realized what racial prejudice was but actually knew and practiced it on occasion.
Katherine Dunham,"Sometimes I have given my husband a manuscript to read that has turned out to have fantastic rave reviews and he'll tell me it is no good. Well, if I didn't know him as well as I know him I would be terribly depressed."
Katherine Dunham,"My work has been much more Caribbean and eclectic. I am interested in people, and where they come from happens to have fallen within an area of Africa."
Katherine Dunham,I'd say that anyone who is going to start a minority program to try to think in terms of a big library and some small kind of museum.
Katherine Dunham,I really think that aside from admiring my talent you really admire me as a person and as a woman.
Katherine Dunham,I had certain physical limitations that made me change the choreography for myself or made me more interested in choreography only rather than dancing. I have never been a person who wanted to just dance. I have always been interested in developing for other people.
Katherine Dunham,I don't think Ed Sullivan had anything to do with Carib Song.
Katherine Dunham,I could never live a nonproductive life and I feel that I have lived a productive life as far as I want to in terms of this company that I have for so many years.
Katherine Dunham,"I certainly feel my career was a great career because it inspired so many many people, literally hundreds of people to follow a new kind of life and to realize that they could make out and advance their own professional and private and social lives."
Katherine Dunham,I am happy to know that my husband regards me as a woman and a person.
Katherine Dunham,"Haiti itself was also photographed, some of the streets, some of the mountains, rivers, streams, etc. were photographed before talking with me about how I felt about Haiti. Then the camera went to our voodoo temple and saw a serious ceremony, a real ceremony."
Katherine Dunham,Frequently producers have partners that they never let the public know about.
Katherine Dunham,"For the kind of thing that we were showing, the budget was sufficient. As we were speaking of in Haiti, we had not done that before in exactly this form and we had to have costumes for it."
Katherine Dunham,"Don't think you are going to go on forever because you are not and begin to plan something that will compensate as you reduce your capacities to leap or turn on this or that or the other, begin thinking of something else."
Katherine Dunham,Black people should have recognition for themselves and their backgrounds and their relationships with other people in the world and thus lose some of their alienation. This museum has certainly stood for that in this town.
Katherine Dunham,"A creative person has to create. It doesn't really matter what you create. If such a dancer wanted to go out and build the cactus gardens where he could, in Mexico, let him do that, but something that is creative has to go on."
Katherine Dunham,I was in love with the West Indies and I liked the authenticity with which Trinidad was presented but the critics could have cared less.
Katherine Dunham,"We had maybe the greatest success of any company that I know of in Paris, and after two or three years I wanted to do this same number that we did for PBS, so we did it and Paris had always considered us their darlings."
Katherine Dunham,"So many dancers paint. I used to paint. I started again recently. While I was dancing, I was very busy with my career. Start something else that makes use of your creative ability because if you don't you will die inside as a person."
Katherine Dunham,I used to want the words She tried on my tombstone. Now I want She did it.
Katherine Dunham,"Aside from a few master teachers that we have had over the years, this has been a completely local talent development. But people have started to come now from Chicago, we have a number of students from Chicago and different places of the country and even in the world."
Katherine Dunham,I have actually five honorary degrees.
John Dunlap,He had just had dinner with his family. And he came to the place that he loved. He sure did love basketball. I really think it was a great blessing. He was having fun.
John Dunlap,It keeps me working for the patient. I don't have to answer to the insurance company first.
John Dunlap,The main thing that any good showing comes down to is just taking advantage of par 5's.
Adam Dunn,"I like this park. I don't like that it has a first-base dugout, though, cause I have to run further [to left field]. We even have that at home. Can we change that?"
Adam Dunn,"I've been seeing lefthanders good all year. I know my numbers stink. I think I've been overly aggressive, trying to pull everything. I'm not doing anything different -- just hitting it more."
Adam Dunn,"He was back to his old self,"
Adam Dunn,"I can't wait to sit down and talk to them. They seem like people I can talk to. You know how it is with people in that position, but these guys seem as normal as can be."
Adam Dunn,"The game is changing, man. It's developing. You've got to find new stuff."
Adam Dunn,It's what I do for a living.
Adam Dunn,"People assume I can't hit for average. I've hit for average all my life, until I got up here. It's not because I can't. It's because people have tried to get me to hit more homers. I'll hit even more home runs when I'm hitting the way I can."
Adam Dunn,"I hope so. I didn't think it was going to be like that for a while. But with new ownership coming in and it seems like they're committed to not just competing, but winning, I'm on board for that."
Adam Dunn,"That kind of stuff happens. I'm not going to go home and cry over it. Hopefully, I'll give them a lot more to cheer about than to boo about."
Adam Dunn,"[When Rob Butcher, director of media relations, told Dunn,] Only 25 players in the history of the game have 1,000 extra-base hits, ... Thanks, Rob, that's all I wanted to know."

Adam Dunn,"[Adam Dunn got a little sticker shock after renting a big-screen TV to play video games in his Pittsburgh hotel room. The four-day tab came to $884.] To rent a TV! ... When I saw that bill, I asked for my room key back so I could go to the room and carry out that TV I just bought."

Brian Dunn,Every case must be evaluated on its merits but the phenomenon of unjustifiable police homicides is something that is recurring at an alarming level.

Douglas Dunn,On the whole I think Nationalism has been a very positive force in Scotland over the last two or three decades.
Douglas Dunn,"The negative aspects of Scottish Nationalism are a kind of aggressive complacency, that sort of boasting; but that's an expression of insecurity, I think, of a lack of confidence."

Trevor Dunn,I have no inflated ideas about success anyway.
Trevor Dunn,"I guess the two Manifesto, Communicating Vessels, Mad Love, and some of his poetry made a significant mark on me but as far as bringing a literary element into the music I see it as a much broader assimilation."
Trevor Dunn,"I feel akin to the Platypus. An orphan in a family. A swimmer, a recluse. Part bird, part fish, part lizard."
Trevor Dunn,I don't really know why I chose bass except that it was different than guitar.

Warrick Dunn,"The uncle, the one that nobody one knew where he was at, is in Baton Rouge, ... We're still looking for some cousins. My grandfather _ he came up. It's just a blessing, but I have so many family members that have just lost everything. Their homes and everything. I have a bunch of friends that are just traumatized. There's still a lot of people they haven't heard from. Their family members, parents, kids separated from their moms."

Warrick Dunn,"Lorenzo and I had a great conversation. I told him that I didn't think that he got an opportunity to show the coaches and the world the type of running back and football player that I think he has a chance to develop into. I saw it a lot this season, and after the season I told him I thought he should stay in school."
Warrick Dunn,"At first, I thought about $10,000 because right now people need money, ... Everybody's going to try to send clothes, food, but people need money so they can start getting back on their feet. People don't have jobs, clothes on their back. People have lost everything, but I think guys can afford to donate $5,000. There's a lot of guys that make a lot of money."
Robin Dunne,"I nearly killed myself, but I did finish the race."
Robin Dunne,"That town, when you're hot, people love you."
Robin Dunne,"It was quite a heady time. Living in a guesthouse in the hills and just having a crazy life. And I think that getting there and then getting divorced, all those things that are part of life, they keep these questions coming up: what are you doing with your life and why?"

Fran Dunphy,"It's weighing on a lot of peoples' minds up at Cornell. I know coach Donahue is struggling with it, but I think he's doing a good job of trying to go on."
Fran Dunphy,"We had one stretch of very inconsistent offense, and making poor choices. You can't give that team a 21-point lead. We didn't shoot well, obviously, but it would be wrong if you didn't credit Villanova's defense for a lot of it."
Fran Dunphy,"I thought Friedrich?s three-point play in the first half was huge. We were a struggling basketball team at that time. It really settled us. And from that point on, I thought we ran a little bit of a better offense."
Stephen Dupont,"If they applied for, and obtained another job with our Waterloo facility, their service would be adjusted for the time that they have already been with us and their time away. If one of these former employees did want to move to Troy, I'm sure the general manager of that facility would consider the employee for an available position, however, we're not planning to offer relocation at this time."

Will Durant,Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.
Marguerite Duras,"Before they're plumbers or writers or taxi drivers or unemployed or journalists, before everything else, men are men. Whether heterosexual or homosexual. The only difference is that some of them remind you of it as soon as you meet them, and others wait for a little while."
Marguerite Duras,"The woman is the home. That's where she used to be, and that's where she still is. You might ask me, What if a man tries to be part of the home -- will the woman let him? I answer yes. Because then he becomes one of the children."
Marguerite Duras,"The thing that's between us is fascination, and the fascination resides in our being alike. Whether you're a man or a woman, the fascination resides in finding out that we're alike."
Marguerite Duras,"The woman is the home. That's where she used to be, and that's where she still is. You might ask me, What if a man tries to be part of the home - will the woman let him? I answer yes. Because then he becomes one of the children."
Marguerite Duras,It's afterwards you realize that the feeling of happiness you had with a man didn't necessarily prove that you loved him.
Marguerite Duras,In love there are no vacations. No such thing. Love has to be lived fully with its boredom and all that.
Marguerite Duras,The best way to fill time is to waste it.
Marguerite Duras,Heterosexuality is dangerous. It tempts you to aim at a perfect duality of desire.
Marguerite Duras,"I believe that always, or almost always, in all childhoods and in all the lives that follow them, the mother represents madness. Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we've ever met."
Marguerite Duras,"It's only women who are not really quite women at all, frivolous women who have no idea, who neglect repairs."

Marguerite Duras,"You have to be very fond of men. Very, very fond. You have to be very fond of them to love them. Otherwise they're simply unbearable."
Marguerite Duras,"I see journalists as the manual workers, the laborers of the word. Journalism can only be literature when it is passionate."
Marguerite Duras,"For that's what a woman, a mother wants -- to teach her children to take an interest in life. She knows it's safer for them to be interested in other people's happiness than to believe in their own."
Marguerite Duras,"Frigidity is desire imagined by a woman who doesn't desire the man offering himself to her. It's the desire of a woman for a man who hasn't yet come to her, whom she doesn't yet know. She's faithful to this stranger even before she belongs to him. Frigidity is the non-desire for whatever is not him."
Marguerite Duras,"To love one child and to love all children, whether living or dead --somewhere these two loves come together. To love a no-good but humble punk and to love an honest man who believes himself to be an honest man --somewhere these, too, come together."
Marguerite Duras,Men like women who write. Even though they don't say so. A writer is a foreign country.
Marguerite Duras,"For that's what a woman, a mother wants - to teach her children to take an interest in life. She knows it's safer for them to be interested in other people's happiness than to believe in their own."
Marguerite Duras,"A house means a family house, a place specially meant for putting children and men in so as to restrict their waywardness and distract them from the longing for adventure and escape they've had since time began."
Marguerite Duras,"I believe that always, or almost always, in all childhood and in all the lives that follow them, the mother represents madness. Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we've ever met."
Marguerite Duras,"Paradoxically, the freedom of Paris is associated with a persistent belief that nothing ever changes. Paris, they say, is the city that changes least. After an absence of twenty or thirty years, one still recognizes it."
Marguerite Duras,The house a woman creates is a Utopia. She can't help it - can't help trying to interest her nearest and dearest not in happiness itself but in the search for it.

Richard Durbin,This is the heart of the debate. This is what the patients' bill of rights is all about.
Richard Durbin,we cannot put off the debate over the best course for the future. . . . We do not honor our fallen soldiers simply by adding to their numbers.
Richard Durbin,That's a critical part of this conversation. We understand that this is the first of two vacancies on a court that's so evenly divided that one bad choice ... could have an impact for a long time.

Richard Durbin,"The White House wants to expand that power in so many areas. Clearly, Congress is holding back."
Richard Durbin,"I think clearly there's been movement that we wanted [at the U.N.]. Now the president sends to Congress this challenge, which basically says, ignore the United Nations, the United States is going to do this alone. I think it's the wrong way to go."
Richard Durbin,We will initiate at the beginning of next year one of the most serious debates about civil rights and individual liberties in our history.

Richard Durbin,"[The Ku Klux Klan branded Johnson the most hated man in America; wooden crosses were burned on his lawn.] Judge Frank Johnson, ... was denounced as a judicial activist and threatened with impeachment.

Richard Durbin,"We hope before the end of the week the Senate Intelligence Committee will reach an agreement to move forward in this important phase of the intelligence investigation,"
Adam Duritz,"In LA, and also on tour, I've been isolated for too long. On stage you're the man, but other than that, there's nothing I like about being on tour. Thousands of people that worship you are nothing, compared to one evening with your friends. But it's my job: I'm a grown-up man, and I go to work."
Adam Duritz,"I can write good songs. I can sing 'em, and I mean it, I mean it deeply, and I pour everything into that. Other than that, I suck."
Adam Duritz,"For me, songwriting is something like breathing: I just do it. But that doesn't mean you're fantastic."
Adam Duritz,"But what you realise after you've been in the business for a while is that people develop opinions about you that don't have anything to do with your music, they like or dislike you for a million reasons, they like or dislike you for your last record."
Adam Duritz,All my songs are where I am.
Adam Duritz,Sometimes the world seems like a big hole. You spend all your life shouting down it and all you hear are echoes of some idiot yelling nonsense down a hole.
Adam Duritz,"Truth is, you make albums, and some of those songs are hits, and some of the greatest hits albums have songs that weren't hits. You have a career, the reason why we're still around 10 years is that we do have successful songs."
Adam Duritz,My life isn't necessarily more important than anyone else's: I'm just better in talking about it.
Adam Duritz,"If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts."
Adam Duritz,There just is exponentially more money in the movie business than in the music business. As a result there are more people involved in the creative process.
Emile Durkheim,"Man's characteristic privilege is that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social. He is governed not by a material environment brutally imposed on him, but by a conscience superior to his own, the superiority of which he feels. Because the greater, better part of his existence transcends the body, he escapes the body's yoke, but is subject to that of society."
Emile Durkheim,Too cheerful a morality is a loose morality; it is appropriate only to decadent peoples and is found only among them.
Emile Durkheim,"From top to bottom of the ladder, greed is aroused without knowing where to find ultimate foothold. Nothing can calm it, since its goal is far beyond all it can attain. Reality seems valueless by comparison with the dreams of fevered imaginations; reality is therefore abandoned."
Emile Durkheim,"There is no society known where a more or less developed criminality is not found under different forms. No people exists whose morality is not daily infringed upon. We must therefore call crime necessary and declare that it cannot be non-existent, that the fundamental conditions of social organization, as they are understood, logically imply it."
Emile Durkheim,It is too great comfort which turns a man against himself. Life is most readily renounced at the time and among the classes where it is least harsh.
Leo Durocher,"If I were playing third base and my mother were rounding third with the run that was going to beat us, I'd trip her. Oh, I'd pick her up and brush her off and say, Sorry, Mom, but nobody beats me."
Leo Durocher,"He?s on the team, boys. He?s on the team because he?s going to put money in all our pockets. And remember this, boys. He?s only the first. There?s more coming, and they?re hungry."

Leo Durocher,Nice guys finish last.

Leo Durocher,You can't get any pictures from way back there.
Leo Durocher,Win any way you can as long as you can get away with it.
Leo Durocher,"In the olden days, the umpire didn't have to take any courses in mind reading. The pitcher told you he was going to throw at you."
Leo Durocher,Baseball is like church. Many attend few understand.
Leo Durocher,God watches over drunks and third baseman.
Leo Durocher,Win any way as long as you can get away with it. Nice guys finish last.
Leo Durocher,"There are only five things you can do in baseball - run, throw, catch, hit and hit with power."
Leo Durocher,Winning is a habit.
Leo Durocher,"I believe in rules. Sure I do. If there weren't any rules, how could you break them?"
Leo Durocher,"If you don't win, you're going to be fired. If you do win, you've only put off the day you're going to be fired."
Leo Durocher,I made a game effort to argue but two things were against me: the umpires and the rules.
Leo Durocher,"I never did say that you can't be a nice guy and win. I said that if I was playing third base and my mother rounded third with the winning run, I'd trip her up."
Leo Durocher,You argue with the umpire because there is nothing else you can do about it.
Leo Durocher,I come to win.
Leo Durocher,"How you play the game is for college ball. When you're playing for money, winning is the only thing that matters."
Leo Durocher,You don't save a pitcher for tomorrow. Tomorrow it may rain.
Leo Durocher,"I never questioned the integrity of an umpire. Their eyesight, yes."

Brian Duscha,"People only need to walk up to 12 miles per week or for about 125 to 200 minutes per week to improve their heart health. Our data suggest that if you walk briskly for 12 miles per week you will significantly increase your cardiovascular fitness levels compared to baseline. If you increase either your mileage or intensity, by going up an incline or jogging, you will achieve even greater gains."
Brian Duscha,"People need to know: even without losing weight, you are getting significant benefits by exercising -- you're improving your fitness level, decreasing fat and increasing muscle and improving your lipid panel -- so don't stop exercising."
Brian Duscha,"Although our results did point toward amount being more important, it is very likely fitness levels can be improved by increasing either amount or intensity."
Brian Duscha,Exercise amount appears to be more important than exercise intensity for eliciting gains in cardiovascular fitness.
Brian Duscha,The classic exercise regimen has a component of intensity up to 80 percent of someone's maximum for health benefits.
Brian Duscha,"The participants in our study received the fitness benefits without losing any weight. Many people exercise to lose weight, and when that doesn't occur, they stop exercising. However, the truth is that you can improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce the risk of heart disease by exercising without losing weight."
Brian Duscha,People find exercise 'hard' and few people want to exercise at an intensity higher than they have to. Walking briskly for 12 miles a week per week is realistic and does not require anyone to incorporate a hardcore training regimen. Increasing your mileage or intensity will give you even greater health benefits.
Brian Duscha,"The other thing to realize is that people gain 3 to 4 pounds a year, so exercise is really important for weight maintenance."
Brian Duscha,"A second very important message is that subjects enjoyed fitness benefits in the absence of weight loss. Many people exercise with the purpose of losing weight. When they do not lose weight, they do not think the exercise is benefiting them and they stop exercising."

Robert Duvall,Too many people think that economics is this subject that should wait until the university level. But it can't wait that long.
Steve Duwel,She trailed the whole race until the final 10 meters and then reeled everyone in. It's a great tribute to Bethany as one of our senior team leaders.
Steve Duwel,She showed some great endurance and leadership to win two difficult events back to back.
Steve Duwel,"This is the first time the boys have won a meet by more than 100 points. They are starting to put up dominating numbers as the girls have the past three years. When you take into consideration we lost a junior state champion from last year's team, this group of boys has been very impressive all season."
Steve Duwel,The boys competition I think is a lot more of a level playing field. And I think the fact that we won last year was just a tribute to the boys stepping up and racing. I don't think anybody thought we were going to win that.
Steve Duwel,The boys seem to be peaking at the right time. They are coming on very strong as we wind down the season.
Howard Dvorkin,"There's no pain involved when you pay with plastic. But there is some pain when you go out and you have to part with cash. You worked hard for that green stuff, and you aren't as apt to spend it."
Howard Dvorkin,You're looking at an economy driven by consumers and consumers are getting killed. The price of everything is rising. The consumer is getting caught in the crossfire.
Howard Dvorkin,"The average debt per household is $9,000. The rate now is $180. It will be $360."
Howard Dvorkin,"You'll see creditors get more aggressive at collecting debt, the reason being that they can."
Howard Dvorkin,"In a person's budget, there's about 15% fat that they can get rid of without really feeling it."
Howard Dvorkin,Everybody has 15% to 20% of fat in their budget.
Howard Dvorkin,"It's going to be huge. You'll see a massive amount of advertising from bankruptcy mills. Beat the deadline, etc.."
Andrea Dworkin,"The will to domination is a ravenous beast. There are never enough warm bodies to satiate its monstrous hunger. Once alive, this beast grows and grows, feeding on all the life around it, scouring the earth to find new sources of nourishment. This beast lives in each man who battens on female servitude."
Andrea Dworkin,Men who want to support women in our struggle for freedom and justice should understand that it is not terrifically important to us that they learn to cry; it is important to us that they stop the crimes of violence against us
Andrea Dworkin,"Romantic love, in pornography as in life, is the mythic celebration of female negation. For a woman, love is defined as her willingness to submit to her own annihilation. The proof of love is that she is willing to be destroyed by the one whom she loves, for his sake. For the woman, love is always self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of identity, will, and bodily integrity, in order to fulfill and redeem the masculinity of her lover."
Andrea Dworkin,"By the time we are women, fear is as familiar to us as air. It is our element. We live in it, we inhale it, we exhale it, and most of the time we do not even notice it. Instead of I am afraid, we say, I don't want to, or I don't know how, or I can't."
Andrea Dworkin,"Wild intelligence abhors any narrow world; and the world of women must stay narrow, or the woman is an outlaw. No woman could be Nietzsche or Rimbaud without ending up in a whorehouse or lobotomized."
Andrea Dworkin,Women's fashion is a euphemism for fashion created by men for women.
Andrea Dworkin,Men are distinguished from women by their commitment to do violence rather than to be victimized by it.
Andrea Dworkin,Men who want to support women in our struggle for freedom and justice should understand that it is not terrifically important to us that they learn to cry; it is important to us that they stop the crimes of violence against us.
Andrea Dworkin,"No phallic hero, no matter what he does to himself or to another to prove his courage, ever matches the solitary, existential courage of the woman who gives birth."
Andrea Dworkin,"Undernourished, intelligence becomes like the bloated belly of a starving child: swollen, filled with nothing the body can use."
Andrea Dworkin,"Money speaks, but it speaks with a male voice."
Andrea Dworkin,"Male supremacy is fused into the language, so that every sentence both heralds and affirms it."
Andrea Dworkin,Childbearing is glorified in part because women die from it.
Andrea Dworkin,No woman needs intercourse; few women escape it.
Andrea Dworkin,"All personal, psychological, social, and institutionalized domination on this earth can be traced back to its source: the phallic identities of men."
Andrea Dworkin,"Men have defined the parameters of every subject. All feminist arguments, however radical in intent or consequence, are with or against assertions or premises implicit in the male system, which is made credible or authentic by the power of men to name."
Andrea Dworkin,"Erotica is simply high-class pornography; better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer."
Andrea Dworkin,Only when manhood is dead - and it will perish when ravaged femininity no longer sustains it - only then will we know what it is to be free.
Andrea Dworkin,"While gossip among women is universally ridiculed as low and trivial, gossip among men, especially if it is about women, is called theory, or idea, or fact."
Andrea Dworkin,"You think intercourse is a private act; it's not, it's a social act. Men are sexually predatory in life; and women are sexually manipulative. When two individuals come together and leave their gender outside the bedroom door, then they make love."
Andrea Dworkin,"The argument between wives and whores is an old one; each one thinking that whatever she is, at least she is not the other."
Andrea Dworkin,"Women have been taught that, for us, the earth is flat, and that if we venture out, we will fall off the edge. Some of us have ventured out nevertheless, and so far we have not fallen off. It is my faith, my feminist faith, that we will not."
Andrea Dworkin,The common erotic project of destroying women makes it possible for men to unite into a brotherhood; this project is the only firm and trustworthy groundwork for cooperation among males and all male bonding is based on it.
Andrea Dworkin,"In this society, the norm of masculinity is phallic aggression. Male sexuality is, by definition, intensely and rigidly phallic. A man's identity is located in his conception of himself as the possessor of a phallus; a man's worth is located in his pride in phallic identity. The main characteristic of phallic identity is that worth is entirely contingent on the possession of a phallus. Since men have no other criteria for worth, no other notion of identity, those who do not have phalluses are not recognized as fully human."
Andrea Dworkin,"Men are rewarded for learning the practice of violence in virtually any sphere of activity by money, admiration, recognition, respect, and the genuflection of others honoring their sacred and proven masculinity. In male culture, police are heroic and so are outlaws; males who enforce standards are heroic and so are those who violate them."
Kristy Dwyer,We weren't in trouble at all the whole match. We only had one serve-receive error and not many hitting errors. We didn't struggle anywhere.
Kristy Dwyer,"It just says something about the quality of the programs we have here. All these programs have coaches that are really dedicated. I think, overall, with a few exceptions on the bench, we exemplify proper behavior and we want our students to act that way."
Kristy Dwyer,"It was an easy opener. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance. Our serving (57-for-61) was a little off but I can't complain."
Kristy Dwyer,They don't have as many skilled players as in the past. They don't have much of an offense and they don't have as many powerful hitters. Their defense is OK.
Kristy Dwyer,"Argonaut played decent defense. In the third game we got behind a couple times, but we were never down (emotionally) and panicked."
Kristy Dwyer,We had a lot of long rallies. They were digging up a lot of our balls.
Kristy Dwyer,"I was shocked at first when I found out about it, because of my age. I haven't been in the profession as long."
Wayne Dyer,"You'll seldom experience regret for anything that you've done. It is what you haven't done that will torment you. The message, therefore, is clear. Do it! Develop an appreciation for the present moment. Seize every second of your life and savor it. Value your present moments. Using them up in any self-defeating ways means you've lost them forever."
Wayne Dyer,How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours.
Wayne Dyer,"You leave old habits behind by starting out with the thought, 'I release the need for this in my life'."
Wayne Dyer,There is a big difference between thinking: I'm in a relationship and something's wrong. Therefore something must be wrong with the relationship. and thinking I'm in a relationship and we've got problems. This is evidence that you are different than me.
Wayne Dyer,Anything that has been accomplished by any other human being in the physical realm is within the field of possibility.
Wayne Dyer,Self-actualized people are independent of the good opinion of others.
Wayne Dyer,A am realistic -- I expect miracles.
Wayne Dyer,A transcendent being can be any miracle.
Wayne Dyer,"If we are to have magical bodies, we must have magical minds."
Wayne Dyer,"Each person must decide for himself what he wants each day. As a leader, I will expose you to the options and the likely consequences of those options. I'll even share my opinion if asked, but I'll never confuse it with the opinion, which simply doesn't exist."
Wayne Dyer,There's no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love. There isonly a scarcity of resolve to make it happen.
Wayne Dyer,"You can set yourself up to be sick, or you can choose to stay well."
Wayne Dyer,"To sit in judgment of those things which you perceive to be wrong or imperfect is to be one more person who is part of judgment, evil or imperfection."
Wayne Dyer,"Anything inside that immobilizes me, gets in my way, keeps me from my goals, is all mine."
Wayne Dyer,"Life is never boring, but some people choose to be bored."
Wayne Dyer,The concept of boredom entails an inability to use up present moments in a personally fulfilling way.
Wayne Dyer,"All blame is a waste of time. No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much you blame him, it will not change you. The only thing blame does is to keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration. You may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming him, but you won't succeed in changing whatever it is about you that is making you unhappy."
Wayne Dyer,"You are always a valuable, worthwhile human being -- not because anybody says so, not because you're successful, not because you make a lot of money -- but because you decide to believe it and for no other reason."
Wayne Dyer,"When you squeeze an orange, orange juice comes out - because that's what's inside. When you are squeezed, what comes out is what is inside."
Wayne Dyer,Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life.
Wayne Dyer,You can never get enough of what you don't want.
Wayne Dyer,You cannot always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside.
Wayne Dyer,You are doomed to make choices. This is life's greatest paradox.
Wayne Dyer,You can't choose up sides on a round world.
Wayne Dyer,I think and that is all that I am.
Wayne Dyer,You'll see it when you believe it.
Wayne Dyer,Your children will see what you're all about by what you live rather than what you say.
Wayne Dyer,We are Divine enough to ask and we are important enough to receive.
Wayne Dyer,"Everything in the universe has a purpose. Indeed, the invisible intelligence that flows through everything in a purposeful fashion is also flowing through you."
Wayne Dyer,There is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love; there's only scarcity of resolve to make it happen.
Wayne Dyer,I cannot always control what goes on outside. But I can always control what goes on inside.
Wayne Dyer,"When I chased after money, I never had enough. When I got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life, then I was prosperous."
Wayne Dyer,Stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.
Wayne Dyer,Transformation literally means going beyond your form.
Wayne Dyer,"Successful people make money. It's not that people who make money become successful, but that successful people attract money. They bring success to what they do."
Wayne Dyer,Everything you are against weakens you. Everything you are for empowers you.
Wayne Dyer,"What we think determines what happens to us, so if we want to change our lives, we need to stretch our minds."
Wayne Dyer,Miracles come in moments. Be ready and willing.
Wayne Dyer,Loving people live in a loving world. Hostile people live in a hostile world. Same world.
Wayne Dyer,Deficiency motivation doesn't work. It will lead to a life-long pursuit of try to fix me. Learn to appreciate what you have and where and who you are.
Wayne Dyer,"Simply put, you believer that things or people make you unhappy, but this is not accurate. You make yourself unhappy."
Wayne Dyer,Self-worth comes from one thing - thinking that you are worthy.
Wayne Dyer,Everything is perfect in the universe - even your desire to improve it.
Wayne Dyer,Only the insecure strive for security.
Wayne Dyer,You are important enough to ask and you are blessed enough to receive back.
Wayne Dyer,Begin to see yourself as a soul with a body rather than a body with a soul.
Wayne Dyer,Relationships based on obligation lack dignity.
Wayne Dyer,"Anything you really want, you can attain, if you really go after it."
Wayne Dyer,Judgements prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.
Wayne Dyer,"It makes no sense to worry about things you have no control over because there's nothing you can do about them, and why worry about things you do control? The activity of worrying keeps you immobilized."
Wayne Dyer,Our intention creates our reality.
Wayne Dyer,"When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor. It's to enjoy each step along the way."
Wayne Dyer,"If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."
Wayne Dyer,"The last suit that you wear, you don't need any pockets."
Wayne Dyer,It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the poser to choose either.
Wayne Dyer,"A mind at peace, a mind centered and not focused on harming others, is stronger than any physical force in the universe."
Wayne Dyer,Maxim for life: You get treated in life the way you teach people to treat you.
Wayne Dyer,Conflict cannot survive without your participation.
Wayne Dyer,"There is no way to prosperity, prosperity is the way."

Wayne Dyer,People who want the most approval get the least and people who need approval the least get the most.
Wayne Dyer,Love is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves without any insistence that they satisfy you.

Wayne Dyer,If you are living out of a sense of obligation you are slave.
Wayne Dyer,"When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself."
Wayne Dyer,Live one day at a time emphasizing ethics rather than rules.
Wayne Dyer,What comes out of you when you are squeezed is what is inside of you.
Wayne Dyer,Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.
Wayne Dyer,Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made.
Wayne Dyer,The highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about.
Wayne Dyer,It's never crowded along the extra mile.
Wayne Dyer,"The components of anxiety, stress, fear, and anger do not exist independently of you in the world. They simply do not exist in the physical world, even though we talk about them as if they do."
Wayne Dyer,If I could define enlightenment briefly I would say it is ''the quiet acceptance of what is.''
Wayne Dyer,Abundance is not something we acquire. It is something we tune into.
Wayne Dyer,"Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice."
Wayne Dyer,Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others.
Wayne Dyer,It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the power to choose either.
Wayne Dyer,The state of your life is nothing more than a reflection of your state of mind.
Greg Dyke,"Now, if that's how she reacted to the arrival of a new television set and having to learn how to use a new remote control, how is she possibly going to cope with digital switchover? Who is going to convince her and thousands of old people like her that, in the interests of greater viewing choice (choice that she has made very clear to me she doesn't want), her viewing life will be totally disrupted?"
Greg Dyke,"Probably not 'War and Peace,' but probably a lot of sports clips,"
Greg Dyke,"I expected her to be pleased and excited. Sadly, she was no such thing. When it arrived my mother burst into tears because she didn't want that much change in her life,"
Henry Dyke,It is with rivers as it is with people: the greatest are not always the most agreeable nor the best to live with
Henry Dyke,"I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength. I stand and watch her until at length she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come to mingle with each other. Then, someone at my side says; There, she is gone! Gone where? Gone from my sight. That is all. She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and she is just as able to bear her load of living freight to her destined port. Her diminished size is in me, not in her. And just at the moment when someone at my side says, There, she is gone! There are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout; Here she comes! And that is dying."
Henry Dyke,"Who can explain the secret pathos of Nature's loveliness? It is a touch of melancholy inherited from our mother Eve. It is an unconscious memory of the lost Paradise. It is the sense that even if we should find another Eden, we would not be fit to enjoy it perfectly nor stay in it forever."
Henry Dyke,"Happiness is inward, and not outward; and so, it does not depend on what we have, but on what we are"
Henry Dyke,Culture is the habit of being pleased with the best and knowing why
Henry Dyke,"As long as habit and routine dictate the pattern of living, new dimensions of the soul will not emerge."
Henry Dyke,"Gratitude is a twofold love / love coming to visit us, and love running out to greet a welcome guest."
Henry Dyke,Gratitude is the inward feeling of kindness received. Thankfulness is the natural impulse to express that feeling. Thanksgiving is the following of that impulse.

Henry Dyke,Look around for a place to sow a few seeds.
Henry Dyke,A friend is what the heart needs all the time.
Henry Dyke,"Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity."
Henry Dyke,"To desire and strive to be of some service to the world, to aim at doing something which shall really increase the happiness and welfare and virtue of mankind - this is a choice which is possible for all of us; and surely it is a good haven to sail for."
Henry Dyke,"Half of the secular unrest and dismal, profane sadness of modern society comes from the vain ideas that every man is bound to be a critic for life."
Henry Dyke,There is no personal charm so great as the charm of a cheerful temperament.
Henry Van Dyke,"He that planteth a tree is a servant of God, he provideth a kindness for many generations, and faces that he haith not seen shall bless him."
Henry Van Dyke,"Gratitude is a twofold love -- love coming to visit us, and love running out to greet a welcome guest."
Henry Van Dyke,"There are two good rules which ought to be written on every heart; never to believe anything bad about anybody unless you positively know it to be true; and never to tell that unless you feel that it is absolutely necessary, and that God is listening while you tell it."
Henry Van Dyke,"Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love, to work, to play, and to look up at the stars."
Henry Van Dyke,"Time is Too slow for those who wait, Too swift for those who fear, Too long for those who grieve, Too short for those who rejoice. But for those who love, time is not."
Henry Van Dyke,Culture is the habit of being pleased with the best and knowing why.
Henry Van Dyke,"Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity."
Henry Van Dyke,Some people are so afraid do die that they never begin to live.
John Dykstra,"You had to make a camera look like it's traveling at 300 mph, but you couldn't make it actually travel at 300 mph so you had to slow everything down and build devices to do that. So you were constantly engineering."
John Dykstra,We still get to blow some stuff up. One of the most enjoyable things about doing special effects was going out and blowing up miniatures.
John Dykstra,"We stayed there 24 hours a day. We lived and ate and slept that movie. We were enthusiastic, not just because of the movie, but because we had such a great collaborative team. We had a really good time. It was very much a family."
John Dykstra,"Once the image was in the digital environment, one of the problems was, we had no means to reproduce the color spectrum, grey scale, and contrast that film produces, without converting the digital file to film, evaluating it, then going back and changing the digital image."
John Dykstra,"It's very much like filmmaking always is-you're always asked to do something that you're not sure you know how to do. So you make an educated guess as to what you think will work and you hope between that and plan B, that you can end up with a product that's really good."
John Dykstra,"It's an embarrassment of riches because you have directors who don't better. You end up with so much stuff going on the screen that you don't know where to look, and that's what I consider self-indulgent."
John Dykstra,"In the first Spider-Man, at the end of the movie, Peter Parker had to deny himself a relationship with a girl that he's in love with. The very next thing that happens is that he's swinging through the city."
John Dykstra,"If you can imagine it, we can make it."
John Dykstra,"I was involved in the color correction and the digital color correction. In an odd way, you end up making a film many times-the DVD, the archival record of a high-definition master, and so on."
John Dykstra,"I like engineering, but I love the creative input."
John Dykstra,George Lucas wanted this moving camera for all of the photography in Star Wars. He was willing to take a risk with the concepts that I advanced with regard to ways for doing that.
John Dykstra,"Film, as far as I'm concerned, is my area of artistic endeavor, so I never think of a movie that gets released as being all done-it's just when they took it away from you."
John Dykstra,Digital imaging has untied our hands with regards to technical limitations. We no longer have to be arbiters of technology; we get to participate in the interpretation of technology into creative content.
John Dykstra,"Because I come from that old-school optics environment, I know stuff about depth of field and camera movement and things that are not necessarily a part of the curriculum for people who started on a box and have never done anything that wasn't on a box."
John Dykstra,"As with sound, images are subjective. You and I may not see the same color red as red, but we will probably agree that the image on the screen is a digital image or film image, based on contrast, bit depth, and refresh rate."
Bob Dylan,"No one is free, even the birds are chained to the sky."
Bob Dylan,"It was relatively simple. Bob put himself in my hands. He just turned up - just his words on paper - no instruments, no musicians, no preconceptions. He just turned up on the doorstep and I built the studio. It's what I call a kitchen studio, so we played in the kitchen. I knew it would suit Bob because I knew Bob didn't have a lot of time for the studio. He didn't want people standing around scratching their heads, banging pianos or whatever. I sat down next to him, put a guitar in his hand and off we went."
Bob Dylan,"May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true. May you always know the truth and see the lights surrounding you. May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong. May you stay forever young."
Bob Dylan,"Sailing round the world in a dirty gondola oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!"
Bob Dylan,[It just goes to show that technology investors aren't sure which way to turn. Or to quote] All Along the Watchtower ... There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
Bob Dylan,I beat Bob Dylan in a talent contest.

Bob Dylan,"Well, I don't know, but I've been told the streets in heaven are lined with gold. I ask you how things could get much worse if the Russians happen to get up there first; Wowee! pretty scary!"
Bob Dylan,"Despite everybody who has been born and has died, the world has just gone on. I mean, look at Napoleon --but we went right on. Look at Harpo Marx --the world went around, it didn't stop for a second. It's sad but true. John Kennedy, right?"
Bob Dylan,I don't think the human mind can comprehend the past and the future. They are both just illusions that can manipulate you into thinking there's some kind of change.
Bob Dylan,I think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility thatcomes with his freedom.
Bob Dylan,The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face.
Bob Dylan,"Come mothers and fathers  Throughout the land, And don't criticize  What you can't understand"
Bob Dylan,I accept chaos. I am not sure whether it accepts me. I know some people are terrified of the bomb. But then some people are terrified to be seen carrying a modern screen magazine. Experience teaches us that silence terrifies people the most.

Bob Dylan,I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours.
Bob Dylan,"Don't matter how much money you got, there's only two kinds of people: there's saved people and there's lost people."

Bob Dylan,"To live outside the law, you must be honest."
Bob Dylan,"Money doesn't talk, it swears."
Bob Dylan,All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie.
Bob Dylan,"People seldom do what they believe in. They do what is convenient, then repent."
Bob Dylan,At times in my life the only place I have been happy is when I am on stage.

Bob Dylan,I'm speaking for all of us. I'm the spokesman for a generation.

Bob Dylan,What good are fans? You can't eat applause for breakfast. You can't sleep with it.
Bob Dylan,"A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do."
Bob Dylan,"Democracy don't rule the world, You'd better get that in your head; This world is ruled by violence, But I guess that's better left unsaid."
Bob Dylan,"Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past."
Bob Dylan,"All I can do is be me, whoever that is."
Bob Dylan,I consider myself a poet first and a musician second. I live like a poet and I'll die like a poet.
Bob Dylan,There is nothing so stable as change.
Bob Dylan,Just because you like my stuff doesn't mean I owe you anything.
Bob Dylan,"Yesterday's just a memory, tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be."
Bob Dylan,"In ceremonies of the horsemen, even the pawn must hold a grudge."
Bob Dylan,Basically you have to suppress your own ambitions in order to be who you need to be.

James Dyson,"After the idea, there is plenty of time to learn the technology."
James Dyson,One of the most fun inventions of my lifetime is the Mini.
James Dyson,Enjoy failure and learn from it. You can never learn from success.
