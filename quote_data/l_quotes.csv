Louis L'Amour,"Some say opportunity knocks only once, That is not true. Opportunity knocks all the time, but you have to be ready for it. If the chance comes, you must have the equipment to take advantage of it."
Louis L'Amour,A good beginning makes a good end.
Louis L'Amour,"Neither drink (coffee or tea) was known in Frankish lands, but seated in the coffeehouses, I drank of each at various times, twirling my mustache and listening with attention to that headier draught, the wine of the intellect, that sweet and bitter j"
Louis L'Amour,"Knowledge is awareness, and to it are many paths, not all of them paved with logic. But sometimes one is guided through the maze by intuition. One is led by something felt on the wind, something seen in the stars, something that calls from the wastelands to the spirit."
Louis L'Amour,"Knowledge is like money: to be of value it must circulate, and in circulating it can increase in quantity and, hopefully, in value."
Louis L'Amour,"Too often I would hear men boast of the miles covered that day, rarely of what they had seen."
Louis L'Amour,Nobody got anywhere in the world by simply being content.
Louis L'Amour,"No memory is ever alone; it's at the end of a trail of memories, a dozen trails that each have their own associations."
Louis L'Amour,"No one can get an education, for of necessity education is a continuing process."
Louis L'Amour,"For one who reads, there is no limit to the number of lives that may be lived, for fiction, biography, and history offer an inexhaustible number of lives in many parts of the world, in all periods of time."
Louis L'Amour,To disbelieve is easy; to scoff is simple; to have faith is harder.
Louis L'Amour,"Victory is won not in miles but in inches. Win a little now, hold your ground, and later, win a little more."
Louis L'Amour,"All loose things seem to drift down to the sea, and so did I."
Louis L'Amour,"He might never really do what he said, but at least he had it in mind. He had somewhere to go."
Louis L'Amour,"A wise man fights to win, but he is twice a fool who has no plan for possible defeat."
Louis L'Amour,There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. Yet that will be the beginning.
Mauli'a LaBarre,I'm just so happy to be part of this team. It's a great way to end the season. I've seen guys come in and out of the program. To have it be my senior night ... it's kind of surreal.
Mauli'a LaBarre,He had the international experience playing for the Junior (national) team.
Mauli'a LaBarre,The thing in men's volleyball is the competition is so tight. You only have so many programs. You don't have one or two good players on every team. You've got six or seven good players on every team. You've got to be focused or you'll be in trouble. That's a lesson we learned in (Friday's) match.
Patti LaBelle,There was nobody hating on nobody.
Patti LaBelle,"So if diva means giving your best, then yes, I guess I am a diva."
Patti LaBelle,"A diva is someone who is a perfectionist, who does her best in her craft."
Shia LaBeouf,"A lot of people like to think that golf is a lazy man's sport, ... Or it's a rich man's sport, or it's a sport that they can't be involved in. But they don't know Francis' story, which is why the movie was made in the first place: To bring back this amazing tale so that people could be educated about how interesting it was. When golf used to be a rich man's sport, if you were poor you could not step foot on a course. Francis was a caddy. He grew up across the street from the course, looked up to Harry Vardon (played by Stephen Dillane in the film), this five-time British Open champion â€” but he was never allowed to play."
Shia LaBeouf,I understand why marriages break up over golf. I can't even talk about my own handicap because it's too upsetting.
Shia LaBeouf,"I turned down a scholarship to Yale, ... The problem with college is that there's a tendency to mistake preparation for productivity. You can prepare all you want, but if you never roll the dice you'll never be successful."
Shia LaBeouf,If I have enough money to eat I'm good.
Neil LaBute,"You start as an audience member and create a world you're interested in, and then you move into the telling of those stories, bringing what has interested you as an audience member."
Neil LaBute,"Without In The Company of Men, I could still be teaching, so who knows if this would've existed."
Neil LaBute,"With In the Company of Men, the misogynist label stuck early and firmly. In the end, it probably did hurt the film a bit, because getting women into the theaters was difficult."
Neil LaBute,We live in a disposable society. It's easier to throw things out than to fix them. We even give it a name - we call it recycling.
Neil LaBute,We humans are a fairly barbarous bunch.
Neil LaBute,Unrequited love is always a great thing.
Neil LaBute,People think my work is therapeutic. I don't see it that way. It's not like I'm saving money from a weekly therapy visit by writing down my life.
Neil LaBute,People have perhaps gotten to the point where for the most part movies are a just bit of escape.
Neil LaBute,"My business is can I create a world that's possible and could happen? I think that's the only thing that I have to do, and I think that I have done that each time."
Neil LaBute,My best male friend is my best friend until he crosses me. We're all protective of the self.
Neil LaBute,"Just in the past few years - since I've been making movies, which isn't a very long time - you now have a culture that is fascinated and informed about the box office in a way that sometimes filmmakers weren't even."
Neil LaBute,"It's just often more interesting to write about one or more people who are being awful to other people because it makes for exciting, dramatic fare."
Neil LaBute,"If we put the camera on ourselves, our friends and neighbors, we'll come up with some scary stuff."
Neil LaBute,"I'm more than open to hope, but I think men and women have a difficult time dealing with each other and often take the low road."
Neil LaBute,I would be more frightened as a writer if people thought my movies were like science fiction.
Neil LaBute,"I will say that the idea of a woman being deceptive came from that original discussion with critics and reporters about if woman could do that kind of thing. Evelyn, herself, grew out of the discussions about how capable women are of deceit and lying and manipulation."
Neil LaBute,"I was very careful to cast guys who were very good-looking and very fit and who had a certain sense of privilege about them, because with that sense of privilege comes contempt."
Neil LaBute,I was always looking for the most dramatic emphasis.
Neil LaBute,I wanted to tell a story that interested me as much in the telling as in the watching.
Neil LaBute,"I wanted to make these people real, not like they were in a painting. Like these are people who don't know they're in a period movie. Those concerns are incredibly immediate."
Neil LaBute,"I think the more the actor lets you know what he thinks of the character, the less the audience cares - like a comedian who laughs at his own jokes."
Neil LaBute,"I think people are capable of everything I've written. Would they ever do it? I don't know and really don't care, because that's not my business."
Neil LaBute,"I think Christine and Chad are on the opposite extremes of the spectrum. Christine is a model victim, and Chad is a model perpetrator, and Howard is closer to the middle."
Neil LaBute,I still am somewhat guarded with my feelings. A lot of writers find it much easier to express themselves on paper. That hasn't changed.
Neil LaBute,I see bits and pieces of me in all the characters in my films.
Neil LaBute,I have a healthy view of what one can do with art.
Neil LaBute,"I don't see my career as this steady building to a point, it's just a path that wanders for me to do whatever I'm interested in doing."
Neil LaBute,"I didn't choose BYU, I like to think it chose me."
Neil LaBute,"First I would probably place men at the bottom of the food chain. On a grander scale, I would say they're reacting to change. Feminism has got to be part of that."
Neil LaBute,Everyone has a story.
Neil LaBute,Everyone has a little bit of Howard and Chad in them. I think there's Christine in all men as well.
Neil LaBute,"Everybody has the ability to be manipulative, to be hateful and deceitful."
Neil LaBute,"But for me, it feels like a natural extension of what I've been doing: exploring relationships. Here you have two relationships and we can explore how difficult it is for people to be together."
Neil LaBute,"But even with a character like Cary who is relatively outlandish, at the end of the movie he's in a place where I wouldn't have expected him to be - taking on the responsibility of a woman who is pregnant and who used to be his best friend's wife."
Neil LaBute,"And with Aaron, I'd have to find a reason not to work with him."
Neil LaBute,And I've got some screenplays and plays ready to dip into when I need to.
Neil LaBute,I make movies I want to see.
Neil LaBute,Relationships in general make people a bit nervous. It's about trust. Do I trust you enough to go there?
Neil LaBute,In a relationship you have to open yourself up.
Andrew Lack,"He agreed there will be no ground rules and that Tom and Katie may ask him questions on anything they wish,"
Andrew Lack,has got two revenue streams: one from our music and one from the sale of his iPods.
Andrew Lack,"As most of you know, Sony Music Entertainment is implementing a series of strategic, structural changes that are necessary to position the company for future growth,"
John Lackey,I'm happy here. It's tough to beat Southern California.
John Lackey,It's another quality arm that we're getting in here. You never can have too much pitching.
John Lackey,I just have to make better decisions.
Mercedes Lackey,"Time doesn't. All that Time does is make it more distant, put more space between you and what happened. It doesn't heal anything. I don't know how or what does the healing, but it isn't Time."
Mercedes Lackey,"There's always going to be fighting. People of honor have to be a part of that, because if they aren't, the only ones fighting will be the ones who don't care, who have no honor, and no concern for how many others die if all the fighting is done by people with no conscience, there won't be any safety anywhere for the people who only want peace."
Mercedes Lackey,"Magic, like technology, is a tool."
Mercedes Lackey,"I try to use all of my senses when describing a setting, and try to think of everything that would impact a character in any given scene."
Mercedes Lackey,"I always work from an outline, so I know all the of the broad events and some of the finer details before I begin writing the book."
Mercedes Lackey,"It makes sense for people who are good at fighting to go out and do it-because if they're good at it, that means the fewest number of other people die."
Christian Lacroix,There's always some kind of hidden logic.
Christian Lacroix,The notion of time bothers me. You look at thirty-year-old photographs and realize how the time has passed.
Christian Lacroix,"My first time in England, in the '60s, the interiors were somehow familiar to me, probably because of the books I'd read and the images I'd seen."
Christian Lacroix,Italy is a divided country without a center.
Christian Lacroix,"In Italy, the Milanese are well organized but follow bourgeois taste. They adhere to certain codes of elegance, but not to individualism."
Christian Lacroix,"I'd experienced the '40s and '50s by looking at my grandparents' old clothes, books, and magazines."
Christian Lacroix,I translated Beatles songs for my English class.
Christian Lacroix,"Going out in Paris was like going out in the '30s dressed like the Andrews Sisters. It was everything I'd seen in books at my grandparents' house, only it was our generation."
Christian Lacroix,"French design hardly exists, except as artificial modernism."
Christian Lacroix,"For fifteen years I've had Swiss clients who tell me that it's a mystery how the French react to their own artists, especially the painters."
Christian Lacroix,"But the Milanese have made bad choices, bad fashion, and bad jewelry."
Christian Lacroix,"But it seemed like the more we advanced, the more the future looked impossible, making us return to the more radical times in the past."
Christian Lacroix,We all look for lost time.
Christian Lacroix,They say that the best furniture and clothing design from the '50s and '60s is Scandinavian or Milanese.
Christian Lacroix,There are days when I'm completely depressed and able to do only one drawing.
Christian Lacroix,The Paris store Colette is successful because it's a filter for things that are made elsewhere. It's the kind of store France needs.
Christian Lacroix,The idea of seeing everybody clad the same is not really my cup of tea.
Christian Lacroix,That was the idea behind glam clubs like Seven and The New Eve. You could eat and dance to live music. To enter you had to descend a grand staircase.
Christian Lacroix,"Much later, designers like Dior and Saint Laurent recreated styles form the '30s and '40s."
Jeff Lacy,"To tell you the truth, I don't know nothing about him. I've never seen him fight, but I know I want his title and I'm ready to shut his mouth as soon as he's ready to be reasonable with his demands."
Jeff Lacy,"I think my performance I put on tonight spoke for itself [on what he would like to say to Joe Calzaghe]. The shirt Gary gave him [Reid], 'all he did was come to America and get knocked out by Jeff Lacy,'...we do what we say. We do what we say."
Jeff Lacy,"It is an honor for me to fight in the (Tampa) bay area, ... It's something I always dreamed of doing -- defending a world title in the bay area. Now it has come true and now it is time for me to go to work."
Jeff Lacy,"The ring can be a real lonely place. I've been fighting 20 years, ever since my dad took me into the gym at the age of eight because I'd been fighting kids at elementary school. The first guy I fought in the gym gave me a real whipping. So I decided there and then to become a proper fighter."
A.G. Lafley,Our retention rate is above the goal. We want to keep as many of the people there as we can. We'd like to meet our cost-synergy targets in some other way.
A.G. Lafley,"We develop and grow leaders. P&G people are given the opportunity - the assignments, experiences, and coaching - to become the strongest leaders they can be."
A.G. Lafley,It's energizing and inspirational just to spend an hour or two with you here.
A.G. Lafley,I believed it in January and after eight months ... my enthusiasm and confidence are even greater.
A.G. Lafley,"This quarter's results, a robust innovation pipeline, and good progress on the Gillette integration, give us the confidence to raise the earnings outlook for the fiscal year."
A.G. Lafley,"We have made a commitment that every Gillette employee will know his or her circumstances within 6 months or less of the closing. And in a lot of cases, it's going to be less."
A.G. Lafley,"I'm a baseball fan, and a longtime Cincinnati Reds fan."
Pat LaFontaine,"Opening this Lion's Den is truly my dream come true for the patients here at Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo, many of whom I've had the pleasure to meet and become friends with over the years."
Pat LaFontaine,Not in my wildest dreams I'd think a night like this would happen. To be back in this fashion is really special. This gesture is over the top and overwhelming.
Pat LaFontaine,"Being with these kids -- knowing their smiles, their pain and their courage -- changed my life."
Emeril Lagasse,"Spice is life. It depends upon what you like... have fun with it. Yes, food is serious, but you should have fun with it."
Emeril Lagasse,"I moved to Louisiana to become the executive Chef at Commander's Place. And I must say I had some encouragement from friends such as Ella Brennan, the queen of the New Orleans's culinary set, and others. This was very flattering to a young man with a dream. I was only 26 years old."
Emeril Lagasse,"Because of my restaurant schedule and other commitments I have, I shoot up to 12 shows in a week. It's taped live."
Emeril Lagasse,"My best friend became the manager and maitre d', and he and I-with 33 people-opened this white tablecloth restaurant in the Warehouse District in 1990. By the end of '90, it blew the charts: we were getting every award, we got the highest review ever done."
Emeril Lagasse,"If somebody has a chance to put my food in their mouth, that tells the story."
Emeril Lagasse,I don't limit myself.
Emeril Lagasse,"We began building this incredible new foundation in this restaurant, and that's what began giving me the left-hand side of tradition and the right-hand side, my new palate."
Emeril Lagasse,Life just doesn't hand you things. You have to get out there and make things happen. that's the exciting part.
Emeril Lagasse,"Music is one of those things that is constantly going in my head all the time. It's sort of like the evolution and creation of doing food, or my philosophy about wine. It's always beating in my head, so it keeps the spirit moving."
Emeril Lagasse,"I have always been involved with both music and food. Music was first, and I kind of had to set that on the back burner when food took over."
Emeril Lagasse,"You know, for 300 years it's been kind of the same. There are restaurants in New Orleans that the menu hasn't changed in 125 years, so how is one going to change or evolve the food?"
Emeril Lagasse,"If you don't follow your dream, who will?"
Emeril Lagasse,"I started cooking when I was about 10. I have memories like when I was 6 or 7 with my mom, and when I was 12 I started getting real serious about cooking."
Emeril Lagasse,I came here because the city has a tradition and is a very respected food city.
Emeril Lagasse,My family... always had the value of the family table and these cultural influences of growing up.
Emeril Lagasse,I spent a lot of time on farms when I was young. My uncle and my dad owned a big farm.
Emeril Lagasse,I ended up turning down a full scholarship of music at the conservatory to pay to go to cooking school.
Emeril Lagasse,"Growing up in New England, being schooled and classically trained, it needed to shake, it needed to evolve."
Emeril Lagasse,"I had these recipes that say do this, do that. Who MAKES these rules?"
Emeril Lagasse,In the restaurant it's much more serious.
Emeril Lagasse,"I've always done food that can work in a set time frame. The message I'm trying to get across is, it doesn't have to take three days to do this. With planning, you can do a lot and really have quality food every day."
Emeril Lagasse,"Mom ran the house, so we grew up Portuguese."
Emeril Lagasse,I'm not a TV guy. I'm a restaurant chef and a businessman.
Emeril Lagasse,"Those other 10 o'clock shows that come on, all you get from them is headaches and nightmares when you go to bed! At least we give you food, know what I mean?"
Emeril Lagasse,We're a new show. We can't afford instant replay.
Emeril Lagasse,"I guess I feel that I was following my instincts, and at the same time being guided by the best. I became totally intrigued with Louisiana - the people, the food. It is a part of my life. Everything that has happened for me since moving here has just been icing on the cake."
Emeril Lagasse,We try to take care of guests in any way we can. Like vegetarian tastings. Which reminds me of our truffles... we are known for our truffles.
Emeril Lagasse,"I'm working harder than ever now, and I'm putting on my pants the same as I always have. I just get up every day and try to do a little better than the day before, and that is to run a great restaurant with great food, great wine, and great service. That's my philosophy."
Emeril Lagasse,"When it ceases to be fun, I'll stop and just stay in my restaurants."
Emeril Lagasse,"I grew up in Fall River, Massachusetts. My background was modest, and I worked at a Portuguese bakery in town."
Emeril Lagasse,"Home base is the support system where we have a culinary team, my own writers because of the shows and the books and stuff, we have a culinary team of about six people. Marketing, public relations, accounting and all that sort of stuff."
Emeril Lagasse,I respected it. I submerged myself into it. So on a lot of days off I would go and fish with the fishermen and the families that ran the boats. I would go work the fields with farmers. I would go and talk with farmers about growing particular products for me.
Emeril Lagasse,"The world has changed, and it's almost been 11 years. I have 975 employees. I have six restaurants. We haven't opened any new ones in almost three years."
Emeril Lagasse,"My philosophy from day one is that I can sleep better at night if I can improve an individual's knowledge about food and wine, and do it on a daily basis."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"You know, since the reviews have come out and people have reacted to it, I've realized that is in a sense what has happened. But as I was writing them, I didn't feel a part of any tradition. I think that would have been too overwhelming, in a sense."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"Winning the Pulitzer is wonderful and it's an honor and I feel so humbled and so grateful, but I think that I'll think of it very much as the final sort of final moment for this book and put it behind me along with the rest of the book, as I write more books."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"When I sit down to write, I don't think about writing about an idea or a given message. I just try to write a story which is hard enough."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"This story is based on a gentleman who indeed did... used to come to my parents' house in 1971 from Bangladesh. He was at the University of Rhode Island. And I was four, four years old, at the time, and so I actually don't have any memories of this gentleman."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"There's obviously a message, or a moral, or something. I think that's good - but it's not something I actively think about, to be honest with you."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"The reactions haven't differed; the concerns have been different. When I read for a predominantly Indian audience, there are more questions that are based on issues of identity and representation."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"The narrator is not anybody in particular. It's a group of women, so there's no particular identity to the narrative voice. A Faulkner story, 'A Rose For Emily.' I admired used that voice and I wanted to try it out.. It was an experiment for myself."
Jhumpa Lahiri,Relationships do not preclude issues of morality.
Jhumpa Lahiri,"On the screen I saw tanks rolling through dusty streets, and fallen buildings, and forests of unfamiliar trees into which East Pakistani refugees had fled, seeking safety over the Indian border."
Jhumpa Lahiri,It's hard for me to talk about anything I'm doing at the moment. It's only after I finish something that I can actually describe it in words.
Jhumpa Lahiri,"It's easy to set a story anywhere if you get a good guidebook and get some basic street names, and some descriptions, but, for me, yes, I am indebted to my travels to India for several of the stories."
Jhumpa Lahiri,Interpreter of Maladies is the title of one of the stories in the book. And the phrase itself was something I thought of before I even wrote that story.
Jhumpa Lahiri,"I've seen novels that have grown out of one story in a collection. But it hasn't occurred to me to take any of those stories and build on them. They seem very finished for me, so I don't feel like going back and dredging them up."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"I've never had Internet access. Actually, I have looked at things on other people's computers as a bystander. A few times in my life I've opened email accounts, twice actually, but it's something I don't want in my life right now."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"I've inherited a sense of that loss from my parents because it was so palpable all the time while I was growing up, the sense of what my parents had sacrificed in moving to the United States, and yet at the same time, building a life here and all that that entailed."
Jhumpa Lahiri,I would not send a first story anywhere. I would give myself time to write a number of stories.
Jhumpa Lahiri,"He told me he was working as an interpreter in a doctor's office in Brookline, Massachusetts, where I was living at the time, and he was translating for a doctor who had a number of Russian patients. On my way home, after running into him, I just heard this phrase in my head."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"For years, I sort of would try to write a story that somehow fit the title. And I don't think it happened for maybe another four years that I actually thought of a story, the plot of a story that corresponded to that phrase."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"For that story, I took as my subject a young woman whom I got to know over the course of a couple of visits. I never saw her having any health problems - but I knew she wanted to be married."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"At 6:30, which was when the national news began, my father raised the volume and adjusted the antennas. Usually I occupied myself with a book, but that night my father insisted that I pay attention."
Jhumpa Lahiri,"As he watched, he had an immovable expression on his face, composed but alert, as if someone were giving him directions to an unknown destination."
Jhumpa Lahiri,Some Indians will come up and say that a story reminded them of something very specific to their experience. Which may or may not be the case for non-Indians.
Jhumpa Lahiri,I can't tell you exactly how I found it. It was just a process of writing a lot of stories and reading a lot of stories that I admired and just working and working until the sentences sounded right and I was satisfied with them.
Ray LaHood,"There's an awful lot of work that will have to go on before there's any vote on Social Security,"
Ray LaHood,"We've got lots of time, lots of good ideas."
Ray LaHood,"They are a long way away from getting the votes, ... Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, whatever -- for every person, there's an issue."
Ray LaHood,"We're not just going to pile it on the debt, we're going to pay for it,"
Ray LaHood,my 40-minute conversation with him.
Ray LaHood,"We're going to have to put a real sharp pencil to the budget, sharper than we have ever had to do before,"
Ray LaHood,"I find it hard to believe that the same gas which cost about $2.50 per gallon at 7 a.m. on Monday was priced at over $2.75 by noon that very same day,"
John Lahr,Wilson's output and quality have been extraordinary.
John Lahr,"It has the look of the avant-garde, but the heart of a Hollywood production. It's the ultimate expression of business art. ... You leave the theater and they guide you right into the store."
John Lahr,"His life was one long extravaganza, like living inside a Faberge egg."
John Lahr,Society drives people crazy with lust and calls it advertising.
Ashraf Laidi,This was a key auction for the dollar as it relieves worries of successful financing of the swelling trade gap.
Ashraf Laidi,"Given the aforementioned dynamics, it is more probable for the U.S. trade deficit to continue soaring to record highs than it is probable for foreign capital flows to keep up with swelling imbalance."
Ashraf Laidi,"Markets could see higher risk of slowing activity from a recurring increase in oil prices. In that case, the Fed will safely close the first chapter of the tightening cycle and move to 'wait' mode. Such a plausible scenario would be a negative for the dollar."
Ashraf Laidi,Past history indicates a relationship between the background of the U.S. treasury secretary and the direction of the U.S. dollar.
Ashraf Laidi,"The riots are definitely doing something, ... It's the usual story of growing unemployment in the euro zone, social unrest that is at first attributed to ethnicity but is really about unemployment and the lack of jobs."
Ashraf Laidi,"The metals and gold prices are already telling you that there's an inflation risk. So if they're going to push the dollar weaker, the risk of inflation could be sparked even higher if the dollar falls and oil prices remain at the level they're right now."
Ashraf Laidi,"This last comment is crucial, especially when the U.S. Congress last night rejected restrictions on tax cuts and spending, and raised the federal debt limit by $800 billion, to $8.18 trillion."
Ashraf Laidi,"The budget deficit is on the radar again due to the emergency spending packages and the lack of any freeze or phasing out of tax cuts,"
Bill Laimbeer,"What I've talked about the entire series and throughout this playoffs is about intensity and effort, desire and will of our players."
Bill Laimbeer,We joke around a lot with our ballclub.
Bill Laimbeer,We came in today with a chip on our shoulder to prove who we are.
Bill Laimbeer,They scored 26 points in three quarters. That's solid defense.
Bill Laimbeer,The players have to come and play. Today we did.
Bill Laimbeer,The Finals are about a test of wills.
Bill Laimbeer,"It's not tough at all as long as the fans are yelling, screaming and hollering."
Bill Laimbeer,"I thought we were aggressive across the board defensively, and you could just see it grow. As the game went along, you could see the confidence grow. It showed in the fourth quarter."
Bill Laimbeer,"I played in Joe Louis in a playoff game. I played there when the roof caved in for half a season. The facility is great for basketball because it goes straight up, so you feel like the fans are on top of you."
R. Laing,"The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds."
R. Laing,"Rule A: Don't. Rule A1: Rule A doesn't exist. Rule A2: Do not discuss the existence or non-existence of Rules A, A1 or A2."
R. Laing,Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair.
R. Laing,Whether life is worth living depends on whether there is love in life.
Johannes Laitenberger,We are not yet there and it is possible to come to a deal but more work is needed.
Johannes Laitenberger,"This being said, the language being employed is certainly neither helpful nor proportionate."
Johannes Laitenberger,We should be able to supply our citizens with energy resources.
Johannes Laitenberger,The commission calls on Israelis and Palestinians to show restraint to avoid measures which would weaken confidence at this critical time.
Ricki Lake,"Tell me, what kind of a woman goes for an arrogant, unattractive, dandruff-laden billionaire?"
Ricki Lake,"I've surpassed any goal I set for myself as far as my body, my career, and getting married."
Ricki Lake,On the birth of her 2nd son Owen. 'I wanted to give birth as opposed to being delivered!
Ricki Lake,What's the difference between tough love and acting like a jerk?
Alan Lakein,"Review our priorities, ask the question; What's the best use of our time right now?"
Alan Lakein,You cannot do a goal. Long-term planning and goal-setting must therefore be complemented by short-term planning. This kind of planning requires specifying activities. You can do an activity. Activities are steps along the way to a goal. Let's say you desire security. Putting $10.00 in the bank or talking to your stockbroker about your investment plans are activities that will move you toward your goal.
Alan Lakein,Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now
Alan Lakein,Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.
Alan Lakein,In all planing you make a list and you set priorities.
Alan Lakein,Failing to plan is planning to fail.
Alan Lakein,"Time = Life, Therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life."
Jack LaLanne,I just want to see how long I can keep this thing going. The easiest thing is dying. Living is a a pain in the butt.
Jack LaLanne,"You can't get rid of it with exercise alone. You can do the most vigorous exercise and only burn up 300 calories in an hour. If you've got fat on your body, the exercise firms and tones the muscles. But when you use that tape measure, what makes it bigger? It's the fat!"
Jack LaLanne,"What you need to do is get that tape measure out, and start measuring that gut. Then you start working out and you start eating properly till that gut gets down close to it was when you were in your 20's. Then you'll find out what your weight should be."
Jack LaLanne,"We don't know all the answers. If we knew all the answers we'd be bored, wouldn't we? We keep looking, searching, trying to get more knowledge."
Jack LaLanne,They thought that athletes that worked out with my system wouldn't be able to throw a ball because they'd be too muscle bound. Those are the misconceptions I had to go through for about 40 years.
Jack LaLanne,"So many older people, they just sit around all day long and they don't get any exercise. Their muscles atrophy, and they lose their strength, their energy and vitality by inactivity."
Jack LaLanne,Remember this: your body is your slave; it works for you.
Jack LaLanne,"Probably millions of Americans got up this morning with a cup of coffee, a cigarette and a donut. No wonder they are sick and fouled up."
Jack LaLanne,I'd rather see you drink a glass of wine than a glass of milk. So many people drink Coca-Cola and all these soft drinks with sugar. Some of these drinks have 8 or 9 teaspoons of sugar in them What's the good of living if you can't have the things that give a little enjoyment?
Jack LaLanne,"I only eat fish - no chicken, no turkey, just fish. I get all my protein from fish and egg whites."
Jack LaLanne,"I have spoken to a whole group of millionaires, head executives at Microsoft. Boy did I chew those guys out."
Jack LaLanne,"Focus on your problem zones, your strength, your energy, your flexibility and all the rest. Maybe your chest is flabby or your hips or waist need toning. Also, you should change your program every thirty days. That's the key."
Jack LaLanne,"By exercise. I'll tell you one thing, you don't always have to be on the go. I sit around a lot, I read a lot, and I do watch television. But I also work out for two hours every day of my life, even when I'm on the road."
Jack LaLanne,"Look at the average American diet: ice cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, all this fat. People don't realize how much of this stuff you get by the end of the day. High blood pressure is from all this high-fat eating."
Jack LaLanne,I do it as a therapy. I do it as something to keep me alive. We all need a little discipline. Exercise is my discipline.
Jack LaLanne,The only way you get that fat off is to eat less and exercise more.
Jack LaLanne,"If you've got a big gut and you start doing sit-ups, you are going to get bigger because you build up the muscle. You've got to get rid of that fat! How do you get rid of fat? By changing your diet."
Jack LaLanne,Do you know how many calories are in butter and cheese and ice cream? Would you get your dog up in the morning for a cup of coffee and a donut?
Alexi Lalas,"Red Bull is committed to providing not only quality domestic soccer, but also quality international soccer. You can't get much better than Barcelona. Our entire organization is excited about the opportunity to play one of the premier teams in the world."
Alexi Lalas,This is a seminal moment in the history of this team and this league. What Red Bull brings to the table is something the likes of which this league has never seen.
Alexi Lalas,"We're bringing Edson back home and make no mistake about it, we're bringing him back here to score goals. That was the message I relayed to him and he understands that."
Alexi Lalas,"We're going to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope there is a very, very good reason. We expect to have him obviously not here today, but hopefully he arrives tomorrow. I haven't heard one way or the other. It's not excused until a legitimate excuse is given."
Alexi Lalas,The latest indication we have is that Amado is experiencing some delay in getting his visa. We understand that and we can accept that as a plausible reason for him not to be here.
Alexi Lalas,I'm not going to name names. I also wouldn't rule out our current coach.
Alexi Lalas,"He is a quality coach and a class individual. It's unfortunate that, at times, this team failed to live up to the loyalty and faith that he has consistently shown them."
Alexi Lalas,I can see the argument that some clubs could make about some teams having an advantage in terms of the talent available to them in their area. That would be my argument if I were in Kansas City.

Dalai Lama,"I feel they should be discussed informally, truthfully, honestly, and in some cases, I think, without forgetting ... long-term vision. They should be practical."

Dalai Lama,The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality
Dalai Lama,"We cannot learn real patience and tolerance from a guru or a friend. They can be practiced only when we come in contact with someone who creates unpleasant experiences. According to Shantideva, enemies are really good for us as we can learn a lot from them and build our inner strength."
Dalai Lama,"Human beings are of such nature that they should have not only material facilities but spiritual sustenance as well. Without spiritual sustenance,  it is difficult to get and maintain peace of mind."
Dalai Lama,"Every noble work is bound to face problems and obstacles. It is important to check your goal and motivation thoroughly. One should be very truthful, honest, and reasonable. One's actions should be good for others, and for oneself as well. Once a positive goal is chosen, you should decide to pursue it all the way to the end. Even if it is not realized, at least there will be no regret."
Dalai Lama,"There are some among us who say our neighbor only understands the language of violence, ... It is easy to say 'jihad,' but actual implementation is very complicated, very hard, and too risky."
Dalai Lama,Human happiness and human satisfaction must ultimately come from within oneself. It is wrong to expect some final satisfaction to come from money or from a computer.

Dalai Lama,Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.

Dalai Lama,"I believe deeply that we must find, all of us together, a new spirituality."
Dalai Lama,"The deep root of failure in our lives is to think, 'Oh how useless and powerless I am.' It is essential to think strongly and forcefully, 'I can do it,' without boasting or fretting."
Dalai Lama,"I am open to the guidance of synchronicity, and do not let expectations hinder my path."
Dalai Lama,"I find that because of modern technological evolution and our global economy, and as a result of the great increase in population, our world has greatly changed: it has become much smaller. However, our perceptions have not evolved at the same pace; we continue to cling to old national demarcations and the old feelings of 'us' and 'them'."
Dalai Lama,"The prize reaffirms our conviction that with truth, courage and determination as our weapons, Tibet will be liberated. Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred."
Dalai Lama,"If one's life is simple, contentment has to come. Simplicity is extremely important for happiness. Having few desires, feeling satisfied with what you have, is very vital: satisfaction with just enough food, clothing, and shelter to protect yourself from the elements. And finally, there is an intense delight in abandoning faulty states of mind and in cultivating helpful ones in meditation."
Dalai Lama,"Consciousness will always be present, though a particular consciousness may cease. For example, the particular tactile consciousness that is present within this human body will cease when the body comes to an end. Likewise, consciousnesses that are influenced by ignorance, by anger or by attachment, these too will cease. But the basic, ultimate, innermost subtle consciousness will always remain. It has no beginning, and it will have not end."
Dalai Lama,"It is human beings that we conflict with, so special emphasis should be placed on developing compassion for them."
Dalai Lama,Compassion in Exile: The Story of the 14th Dalai Lama.
Dalai Lama,"Your friend, your enemy, your neutral all are equal. Genuine compassion is unbiased."
Dalai Lama,The real test of compassion is not what we say in abstract discussions but how we conduct ourselves in daily life.
Dalai Lama,"I would like to explain the meaning of compassion, which is often misunderstood. Genuine compassion is based not on our own projections and expectations, but rather on the rights of the other: irrespective of whether another person is a close friend"
Dalai Lama,"Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive."
Dalai Lama,"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."
Dalai Lama,"The foundation of the Buddha's teachings lies in compassion, and the reason for practicing the teachings is to wipe out the persistence of ego, the number-one enemy of compassion."
Dalai Lama,"I believe all suffering is caused by ignorance. People inflict pain on others in the selfish pursuit of their happiness or satisfaction. Yet true happiness comes from a sense of peace and contentment, which in turn must be achieved through the cultiv"
Dalai Lama,"My basic belief and effort, firstly to try and promote some of the useful emotions such as compassion or forgiveness and through the that way the spirit of reconciliation?s and the spirit of dialogue. These will increase."
Dalai Lama,"Although it is difficult to pinpoint the physical base or location of awareness, it is perhaps the most precious thing concealed within our brains. And it is something that the individual alone can feel and experience. Each of us cherishes it highly, yet it is private"
Dalai Lama,"It is very important to generate a good attitude, a good heart, as much as possible. From this, happiness in both the short term and the long term for both yourself and others will come."
Dalai Lama,"This we can all bear witness to, living as we do plagued by unremitting anxiety . It becomes more and more imperative that the life of the spirit be avowed as the only firm basis upon which to establish happiness and peace."
Dalai Lama,"Anger and hatred cannot bring harmony. The noble task of arms control and disarmament cannot be accomplished by confrontation and condemnation. Hostile attitudes only serve to heat up the situation, whereas a true sense of respect gradually cools down what otherwise could become explosive. We must recognize the frequent contradictions between short-term benefit and long-term harm."
Dalai Lama,"Your sadness, your anger will not solve the problem. More sadness, more frustration only brings more suffering for yourself, ... No matter how tragic the situation, we should not lose hope."
Dalai Lama,"When we are young and again when we are old, we depend heavily on the affection of others. Between these stages we usually feel that we can do everything without help from others and that other people's affection is simply not important. But at this stage I think it is very important to keep deep human affection."
Dalai Lama,"Not only is this the greatest achievement of Taiwan's democracy, it is also the pride of Taiwan,"
Dalai Lama,"With realization of one's own potential and self-confidence in one's ability, one can build a better world."
Dalai Lama,Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Dalai Lama,"The time has come to think, to try to find a solution through dialogue based on mutual respect."

Paul Lambert,"When you work in training all week and throw everything in the box, it is cleared. But then, in a game, if you are not there then there is no point. I don't mind if people are scoring world class goals against us - but not from three yards out."
Paul Lambert,I hope this is the kick-start.
Paul Lambert,We are absolutely delighted to have Wes here. There's no doubting his ability and we are looking forward to getting him playing.

Richard Lamm,"He devoted his whole life to education. He kept on giving, even after he retired."
Richard Lamm,Christmas is the time when kids tell Santa what they want and adults pay for it. Deficits are when adults tell government what they want and their kids pay for it.
Lou Lamoriello,I never get discouraged. 'Discouraged' and 'disappointed' are two different words. I'm disappointed in the results... I'm not discouraged at all. I see a lot of very positive things.
Lou Lamoriello,"There's no question he's an outstanding talent and he's going to do very well. Whether it was just not getting the opportunity or it just didn't work out, we gave up a top prospect."
Lou Lamoriello,"Kris at 6-5, 240 pounds, is a physical forward who brings additional size and strength to our roster."
Lou Lamoriello,"I don't think we were really competing against the rules. But early in the year, we had some experiments. We took a step back, trying some things based on the team we had built. We realized it shouldn't be that different, with a couple of minor adjustments."
Lou Lamoriello,The teams took advantage of power plays both ways. We're getting chances and taking advantage of them on the power play. Nashville also has an excellent power play. This was just a case of who was going to take advantage of a break.

Lou Lamoriello,He's done a lot of good things here. He brings a lot of enthusiasm. He knows his role and he knows what's at stake.
Lou Lamoriello,"I think a couple of those calls were from players being aggressive, real emotion. I don't think we lost our discipline."
Lou Lamoriello,"You have to make some transition decisions to go forward, no different than you have to do with an NHL team. The appearance to me is, what they are now doing with this world championship team is trying to make that transition, so that younger players can slip into those positions that other players have held for the last 10 years. They need to gain experience."
Lou Lamoriello,"I haven't even thought of it that way. Common sense would say that it helps us, but in saying that, it's not something we were hoping would happen. We wanted them to have as much success as they could."
Lou Lamoriello,We came out from the beginning and sustained a consistency the whole game.
Lou Lamoriello,"The opportunities we gave them early in the game, they took advantage of."
Lou Lamoriello,Any individual accomplishment that's achieved is a compliment to the team and the player. But that's something that happens. It's not something that's in a thought process.
Lou Lamoriello,"The most important thing is you have to believe that you have the ability to get it done. Once you believe that, then you have to find a way to get it done."

Anne Lamott,You can safely assume that you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.

Frank Lampard,"His aggression is one of his big strengths,"
Frank Lampard,To be involved with such illustrious names is a sign of our achievements.
Jim Lampley,"Do I fear for Roy's safety? Absolutely. How could you watch him lie still on the canvas for such a long time after getting knocked out by Glen Johnson, watch his feet quiver like that, and not be concerned? He couldn't be any worse than he was against Glen Johnson. I don't rule out that he could beat Antonio Tarver. I just don't think it's worth taking the risk. I would prefer not to see him get hit in the head again."

Jim Lampley,We're both accustomed to being the center of attention. We're both accustomed to being spoiled by the people around us. And we don't expect to have to compete with somebody for all of that.

Jim Lampley,"I met Roy's father once... And I think that Roy's relationship with his father is still at the heart of what Roy does. But at the end of the day, he's trying to prove himself to a father he'll never really please."
Jim Lampley,"I mean, you know, I get a tremendous positive charge every day just from knowing these kids and who they are. I mean, Larry, my 12-year-old son is my hero in life. Could there be a greater privilege than that? I mean, I can't imagine anything that would be more exciting."
Jim Lampley,"I mean, I spent 30 years in the world of physical perfection, right? I've known most of the world's most perfect physical specimens over the course of the last 30 years."
Jim Lampley,I've never seen a truly great fighter get knocked onto the ropes unconscious... knocked out cold before... and I saw Roy Jones get knocked out twice in a row.
Jim Lampley,"And to a certain degree, I'm the odd man out in the family, aren't I? I mean, I'm the only one who actually has conventional fingers and toes."
Jim Lampley,"I think there was a sense that the impact was being lost because the audience was so familiar with the form. You combine that with people's attention spans, which are clearly conditioned to be shorter now, and there's a need to vary the paradigm."
Pascal Lamy,"The April 30 deadline will be a moment of truth. It's approaching fast, so we don't have any minute to waste."
Pascal Lamy,"The April deadline is the moment of truth, it's approaching fast and we do not have any minute to waste. Things are moving, the problem is they're not moving at the right pace. The pace remains too slow."
Pascal Lamy,This shouldn't be done to the detriment of the symbolic importance of multilateral trade for South Africa.
Pascal Lamy,It's been a long time that this hasn't happened. This is what allows the rest of the negotiations to be unblocked.
Pascal Lamy,"I think that ... this has become urgent, ... It is necessary that they advance on some issues to allow the rest (of the world trade negotiations) to be advanced."
Pascal Lamy,We also need solid progress in the other key areas of the negotiations.
Pascal Lamy,They both need to make progress in some areas to allow the rest to get moving.
Pascal Lamy,"It is going to be three months of continuing work in progress, ... There is no way that Hong Kong can result in a sort of lowest common denominator deal."
Pascal Lamy,"It's also clear therefore if the negotiations are to progress, the United States will have to move on domestic support."
Pascal Lamy,"To the question of whether a WTO member can put up obstacles to trade as a consequence of a threat to public health, the answer is yes."
Pascal Lamy,"The director-general has no magic wand ... things do not work this way in the WTO. We can catalyse, we can broker, we sometimes can lead, but at the end of the day ... member states have the decision-making power."
Pascal Lamy,"The problems are numerous and time is fading, ... There are a mountain of subjects to address and I hope that it can be climbed."
Pascal Lamy,"Hard work, hard work, ... It's too early at this stage to give any sort of prognostic."
Pascal Lamy,(It) is in my view a recipe for failure.
Pascal Lamy,The success or failure of the round (of negotiations) will be decided in the 40 days before the end of April.
Pascal Lamy,We have to exercise our right to protect our industry and our jobs.
Pascal Lamy,"Today we can be sure we are heading into the right direction. We managed to put the round back on track, after a long hibernation. But we are not there yet."
Pascal Lamy,"It is not so much the United States that is trying to push the European Union in one direction or another, it is developing nations as a whole that are pushing the United States and Europe to open their markets a little more."
Pascal Lamy,"It's obviously my priority number one, two and three. I'll be fully hands-on and fostering negotiation and cooperation,"
Pascal Lamy,"This request is designed to protect our rights in the WTO, fully in line with the procedural agreement reached with the U.S. in September, ... Whilst wishing to de-escalate this dispute, our aim is to see the WTO-incompatible FSC export subsidies removed."
Pascal Lamy,"This agreement, coming just before the Hong Kong ministerial conference, is good news, ... Members have shown that they are ready to ensure that the world's poorest countries have the flexibility that they need in order to meet their WTO obligations in a way that serves their development needs."
Pascal Lamy,"Not that what is on the table is nothing, but it is insufficient to reach an agreement."
Pascal Lamy,"It's a bit like a business negotiation. We have reached agreement on the crucial elements,"
Robert Lande,"If you don't trust the other person, you don't negotiate well with them. Microsoft has had two years to figure out a behavioral remedy that has lots of loopholes and escape clauses in it."
Robert Lande,"This law has only been used two times - both times in the AT&T antitrust case - so it's rarely, rarely used. The longer it sits at the Court of Appeals, the less likely the Supreme Court is to take it on an expedited basis. To the extent that the Court of Appeals really starts to get their teeth into this, they could jump on this right away."
Robert Lande,"If all she was going to do was rubber-stamp the settlement between the Department of Justice and Microsoft and say that the states get nothing, she could have done that in two or three months. I think it means the states are going to get something."
Robert Lande,"One word for Microsoft: delay. Stretch the remedy out, stretch the appeal out, stretch the Supreme Court proceeding out. If you delay as long as possible then anything could happen."
Ann Landers,The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.

Ann Landers,"If I were asked to give what I consider the single most useful bit of advice for all humanity it would be this: Expect trouble as an inevitable part of life and when it comes, hold you head high, look it squarely in the eye and say, ''I will be bigger than you. You cannot defeat me.''"
Ann Landers,Class is an aura of confidence that is being sure without being cocky. Class has nothing to do with money. Class never runs scared. It is self-discipline and self-knowledge. It's the sure footedness that comes with having proved you can meet life.
Ann Landers,One of the secrets of a long and fruitful life is to forgive everybody everything before you go to bed
Ann Landers,Maturity: Be able to stick with a job until it is finished. Be able to bear an injustice without having to get even. Be able to carry money without spending it. Do your duty without being supervised.

Ann Landers,I advise keeping four feet on the floor and all hands on deck.
Ann Landers,Know yourself. Don't accept your dog's admiration as conclusive evidence that you are wonderful.
Ann Landers,"Maturity is the ability to do a job whether or not you are supervised, to carry money without spending it and to bear an injustice without wanting to get even."

Rocco Landesman,one of the most important American playwrights ever. I think his work is going to speak to generation after generation of theatergoers.
Rocco Landesman,"but that doesn't mean I want to see plays about it. A Broadway audience comes for entertainment, not to be lectured."
Rocco Landesman,"Jed Bernstein leaves a completely different League than he found when he took this job 10 years ago, ... The transformation he has engineered is truly remarkable. What we now know as the Broadway Brand, with its numerous new programs, sponsorships, and greatly expanded public profile, is largely Jed's creation. We will miss him."

Letitia Landon,Ah tell me not that memory / Sheds gladness o'er the past; / What is recalled by faded flowers / Save that they did not last?
Letitia Landon,"Enthusiasm is the divine particle in our composition: with it we are great, generous, and true; without it, we are little, false, and mean."
Letitia Landon,"Ah, tell me not that memory sheds gladness o'er the past, what is recalled by faded flowers, save that they did not last?"

Mary Landrieu,"Kathleen Blanco was the most experienced and the most qualified, ... The first woman governor to represent our state."
Mary Landrieu,The truth will speak for itself.
Mary Landrieu,The president picked a very inspiring spot to make this speech. The image is worth many words in terms of what Jackson Square and the cathedral mean to New Orleans and what New Orleans means to the nation. ... His three proposals are innovative and bold.

Mary Landrieu.] The people behind Operation Mend a Heart understand that one way we can support our troops is by supporting the people they are fighting for, the children of Iraq, ... Operation Mend a Heart will help provide the humanitarian medical assistance to the underprivileged children of Iraq who would otherwise not have access to the pediatric medical and surgical care they need."
Mary Landrieu,"Small businesses are the engine of our economic growth. This was true before Katrina, and it remains true as our small businesses move our economy forward as we rebuild from the greatest natural disaster in U.S. history, ... Since Hurricane Katrina first hit our shores, 53,900 businesses have asked for Washington's help, but so far only 58 of theses businesses have received any assistance. Washington has promised real help for the people of the Gulf Coast -- it is time to stop making promises and to start fulfilling them."

Mary Landrieu,"The president's statement indicates a failure to appreciate the burdens borne by the people of Louisiana and other coastal oil-and-gas-producing states,"
Mary Landrieu,"Instead of just spending it on a general fund, let's redirect these monies back to environmental funds."
Mary Landrieu,"While investment in education without accountability is a waste of resources, demanding accountability without making investments is a waste of time, ... We believe the president's call for education reform will be an empty promise if we can't also find common ground on education investment."
Mary Landrieu,"This unprecedented national disaster requires an unprecedented national response,"
Mary Landrieu,"It's not a focus but a foundation, ... We've gotten criticism from people who don't understand how critical the situation is in south Louisiana and don't understand how important south Louisiana is to the rest of the nation."

Mary Landrieu,"She would be very high in my book,"
Mary Landrieu,"I'd say that we have a general agreement that the military has a very strong role to play, but so do our governors and our local elected officials.

Tom Landry,"Leadership is getting someone to do what they don't want to do, to achieve what they want to achieve."

Tom Landry,"Football is an incredible game. Sometimes it's so incredible, it's unbelievable."

David Lane,"Nonprofit organizations play an irreplaceable role in our society and democracy. We are proud to support the Nonprofit Congress?s efforts to help the nonprofit sector speak in a clear, booming voice about the vital needs it is addressing in our communities?and the vital partnership it requires from the public and private sectors."
David Lane,"It's obviously nice to win some games with a little adversity, but we need to get better. It's nice to be 13-1, but by no means are we ready for conference play."
David Lane,"The advantage is we're involved. It demonstrates our commitment. We've been in business 20 years, but in the city for 18 months. Things are evolving for us. It's an immediate opportunity to become known in circles we were not known in before."
David Lane,"If they're stopping him from taking his sabbatical, that is an adverse employment action."
Judge M. Lane,"You've got to be big enough to say I was wrong, have your administrative assistant get the lawyers, get the litigants back in, and be big enough to go on the record and correct it."
Judge M. Lane,"Well, judges take offense to that if they're called an activist judge. But the fact of the matter is if the shoe fits, you've got to put it on. There are judges that do that."
Judge M. Lane,"Well, I was a referee. I've since retired from that. I was a fighter and I took up refereeing as a hobby after I retired from being a competitive fighter. And see, I've got no nose."
Judge M. Lane,"Well, I think, unfortunately, the application of the system sometimes is not fair. I think that's something that we have to work out - work at very, very, very hard."
Judge M. Lane,"Well, I think you've get to get people on the bench, and the police and people in law enforcement to recognize that we're all Americans. We're not black Americans, white Americans, red Americans: We're all Americans."
Judge M. Lane,"There are some judges that in my view do cross the line. They try to make up the law as they go along. Those judges, in my view, respectfully, do not honor their oath. Their oath is to construe the law and follow the law the legislature enacts."
Judge M. Lane,"The production is great, the producers do a heck of a job. And, yes, it's fun doing the work. In the course, the economic payback isn't too bad either."
Judge M. Lane,"On the other hand, every now and again somebody deserves a pat on the back and some compliment and some encouragement. I think you've got to do that, too."
Judge M. Lane,"Laws are changed all the time, but the legislature primarily makes the law."
Judge M. Lane,"In the beginning, I don't think any juvenile of kinder years, of young age like that, should be in an adult facility. I think that is in and of itself criminal."
Judge M. Lane,"If you've got a case that's due out or you have a trial starting Monday morning, and you haven't read the file, you haven't done the homework and done the research, you ought to be in there Saturday and if necessary Sunday. That goes with the territory."
Judge M. Lane,"If you run - if you give the gavel to a lawyer, they'll take it."
Judge M. Lane,"If you litigate, you're entitled to litigate and you're entitled to have the issues explored completely."
Judge M. Lane,"I'll never forget where I came from and the folks that helped me, and I feel very, very fortunate."
Judge M. Lane,I worked on weekends. I worked every weekend. We had some judges that worked weekends and some that didn't.
Judge M. Lane,I think some cases should be dismissed as being non meritorious or frivolous.
Judge M. Lane,"I think judges have some benign power, like to say that the lights have to be turned on, the county commission has to pay the bills so you can operate the court."
Judge M. Lane,I think Judge Mathis is a good person. He's a friend of mine. And I assume he's a good judge.
Judge M. Lane,"I don't call it my show, I call it our show. And it's a lot of fun to do."
Judge M. Lane,I believe that sometimes people have got to have their butts chewed and you've got to be rough on them.
Judge M. Lane,"However, when you hear somebody's case, they're entitled to two things: to believe that somebody's listening to the facts, trying to decide what the truth is, and applying the law applicable to that case."
Judge M. Lane,"But the other side of that coin is some things, issues and cases, take consideration. There is no quick fix."
Judge M. Lane,"But judges don't - should not go willy-nilly changing the rules of the game if they happen to like to do. If you do that, in my view, you have anarchy, you have no real sound principles that we all operate under."
Judge M. Lane,"But if you're saying, can judges do a better job? The answer is, you bet."
Judge M. Lane,"But if somebody goes to a juvenile facility in lockup and then thereafter they become an adult, maybe they can then be transferred to an adult facility."
Judge M. Lane,"But I always say this: I don't care where you get, if you don't remember a lot of folks helped you get there, you're nothing but a damned ingrate."
Judge M. Lane,"As a matter of fact, on the TV court you actually probably have more time to present your case than you would in a regular small claims court."
Judge M. Lane,"And I think, one, a lot of judges don't work hard enough, don't spend enough time, don't rule quickly enough and delay too much."
Judge M. Lane,"And I think we've got to be treated with dignity as Americans, and that has to do with the educational process of people on the bench, lawyers, people in law enforcement and people that have to do with the system."
D. Lang,"If you knew how meat was made, you'd probably lose your lunch."
D. Lang,"You have to respect your audience. Without them, you're essentially standing alone, singing to yourself."
D. Lang,"Look. Art knows no prejudice, art knows no boundaries, art doesn't really have judgement in it's purest form. So just go, just go."
Jack Lang,It's time to bring down the curtain on this ridiculous farce. This conflict revealed a profound regime crisis.
Jack Lang,The aim of the project is to make children better understand their history and heritage.
Jack Lang,The presidential race is not a beauty contest.
Robert Lang,It does get you going for the rest of the season.
Robert Lang,He was just given a little rest.
Robert Lang,"These things have always happened organically. What we don't have experience with is a contrivance of this, where it's engineered."
Robert Lang,"The decade began with the economy off track, but the population boom kept rolling along and is on track to nearly match the record 1990s. The country found places to keep booming, shying away from the high-cost coasts and seeking the South and the mountain West."
Robert Lang,The dispersion shows this is one well-networked country with big social networks.
Scott Lang,"With Southern magnolias, you're talking leaves the size of snowshoes and that's a big pain."
Scott Lang,"Having him around is like having a library of knowledge. He's been coaching 25 years and in that time there probably isn't a defense or offense he hasn't seen or gone against. You just don't find guys like him, with that much knowledge, sitting around."
Scott Lang,"We are delighted to welcome this sales team to Silver Spring Networks. Their vast industry knowledge, extensive leadership abilities and proven track record will be instrumental to our success as we continue our growth. Lendon understands the complex and global nature of the utility industry and, combined with Vance, Peggy and Carlos, this team is uniquely positioned to build upon our strong momentum and to make an immediate and lasting impact."
Scott Lang,outrageous accusations based on erroneous information.
Scott Lang,one more example of this mayor being out of touch with the neighborhoods.

Jessica Lange,"I hate Bush, I despise him and his entire administration."
Jessica Lange,"Yes, and you should question your government."
Jessica Lange,Military action on Iraq makes me feel ashamed to come from the United States. It is humiliating.
Jessica Lange,"I am tortured when I am away from my family, from my children. I am horribly guilt-ridden."
Jessica Lange,"For me, nothing has ever taken precedence over being a mother and having a family and a home."
Justin Langer,"The issue has come up throughout the series. I don't want to delve too deep but cricket has a great tradition of 12th men being bowlers or whatever, but generally the English are much smarter than Australians, and in the day of professionalism I suppose it is just getting the best out of the resources available within the rules. ... I would be surprised if there was not a twist left in this game. We are hanging on by the skin of our teeth."
Justin Langer,"It hasn't been at the cutthroat edge we're used to playing at. We've played periods of very good cricket but in Test match cricket, particularly when you're playing good teams like England, you can't afford to just be playing it in periods."
Justin Langer,"Personally, I'm very disappointed because I went there to play cricket. I don't think you can ever say they're cheapened runs in Test cricket."
Justin Langer,"I've always found him a handful in first-class cricket, as I do in the nets."
Larry Langford,"I'm told they may have had some original sheet music, but they're still trying to get in to see what may or may not have been damaged. Everything else in that building appears to be burned ... just destroyed. If you look at it from the air, all you see is the walls."
Larry Langford,It's a big step in fire communications ? the biggest upgrade that's been undertaken in at least 25 years.
Larry Langford,The roof was being worked on and the fire began on the roof. That's what we know.
Larry Langford,"We had a pregnant woman complaining of shortness of breath, and another woman who was asthmatic, who were also transported to Little Company of Mary. And there were several other people who were treated on the scene but not transported, about a half dozen people."
Mark Lanier,"He and the clinic are working together to see how Eric can best save lives and best do his work as a doctor and a scientist. Those conversations are ongoing--and their conversations because Eric loves the Cleveland Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic loves Eric. He's not looking to get out of there even, he's trying to analyze his different options on what he wants to do in life."
Mark Lanier,"I don't mince words. I speak bluntly, and I'll continue to do that."
Mark Lanier,The jury saw the truth in black and white.
Mark Lanier,"From Merck's victories, I've leaned that you must tie their lawyers to the truth. They specialize in mudslinging."
Mark Lanier,Merck should come to the table and accept responsibility.
Mark Lanier,This case is about folks trying to make money off of people in a desperate situation. That's not right. You come to people's rescue when they are in a desperate situation. You don't target them as something you can make money off of.
Mark Lanier,"Seeger needs to give the closing of his life. I would have tried it differently. I would have made marketing the center issue of the case, and Chris chose to make causation the center issue. By closing arguments, our case was over. This case can go either way."
Mark Lanier,"[The jury awarded plaintiff Carol Ernst $243 million, though Texas law prevents her from collecting damages that high.] When the dust settles there will be $26.3 million at 10 percent interest annually, ... I'm not sure Ms. Ernst will see any of that for the next five years."
Mark Lanier,This jury has sent a message out from the backyard of pharmaceutical land that they take their policing powers seriously.
Mark Lanier,"This is right. Justice is done, amen."
Mark Lanier,Their motion is a diversion. I also think it's the pinnacle of hypocrisy.
Mark Lanier,"I cannot entrust my clients to them, ... So I hope the MDL works well. I want to run alongside it and not frustrate it. But I also want to work my clients' cases. I can do that in state court."
Mark Lanier,"Traffic to our site has increased tremendously with the rapid growth of our firm and the opening of our New York office. We wanted to make sure that our site was offering visitors the most up-to-date information in the most user-friendly, state-of-the-art format. We hope that the new site will be a good resource for clients, potential clients, colleagues, and the news media."
Mark Lanier,We've seen a decade of deception by Merck.
Mark Lanier,"On a life-or-death drug, the marketing should be as transparent as glass. But it was as murky as seawater."
Mark Lanier,"I don't mince words. I speak bluntly, and I'll continue to do that. Remember, this is coming from a company that, in the last (New Jersey) trial, engaged in a shouting match with the judge. I promise I won't do any of that. We just need to be nice and polite - to the court, to the jury, to each other."
Mark Lanier,You've got to punish them. You've got a chance to say this is how business is going to be done from now on out.
Mark Lanier,They say they heard you. Don't believe it.
Mark Lanier,Chris has been involved in this litigation from the very beginning. He knows it extremely well.
Robin Lanier,All of the back channel information I'm getting is that they're actually making some progress.
Robin Lanier,"The fashion apparel will shift to air because their selling season is only six weeks, and then it goes to markdown. They can't afford to miss one day. But the price for the plane is going up, and space will evaporate very quickly as the Limited and Gap fill them up."

Lao-Tzu,Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them -- that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.
Lao-Tzu,"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power."
Lao-Tzu,To see things in the seed is genius.
Lao-Tzu,"People in their handlings of affairs often fail when they are about to succeed. If one remains as careful at the end as he was at the beginning, there will be no failure."

Lao-Tzu,The sage wears clothes of coarse cloth but carries jewels in his bosom; He knows himself but does not display himself; He loves himself but does not hold himself in high esteem.
Richard Lapchick,"It's not good that they don't have any minorities in the final pool because our research shows there are a lot of qualified minorities out there and available for these types of jobs, but it's slightly less bothersome because New Mexico has had such a good record when it comes to minority administrators."
Richard Lapchick,"I would make the analogy that if my son or daughter had legal problems, I would try to get the best representation possible, and that's the way universities view these firms."
Richard Lapchick,The most encouraging thing is finally [the racial performance gap is] narrowing.
Richard Lapchick,"First of all, the policy is not racist. The intention is to make the league image more corporate rather than hip-hop, which has been the going trend for years, ... It's a natural outcome of what happened last year with the brawl. As for the NBA, it's probably the most progressive league with regard to its diversity practices. There may be some resistance to this policy, but (the NBA) needs to just stick to its guns."
Richard Lapchick,There's been a general improvement in the leagues over a period of time. I think the glaring gaps are at the college level at what are considered to be the top positions.
Richard Lapchick,There's been a general improvement in the leagues over a period of time.
Richard Lapchick,"They're giving the impression that minorities are not capable of doing these jobs, and that's obviously not true."
Richard Lapchick,"Women come from a culture where society has told them all these years that at whatever level you have to be better, you have to work harder, you have to outperform everyone else in order to break through all the gender barriers. In a basketball male culture, it's almost not cool to study. I think it's taken a lot of programs the NCAA has implemented to let those players and their coaches know, 'We've got to perform or we're going to lose scholarship."
Lewis Lapham,"Unlike any other business in the United States, sports must preserve an illusion of perfect innocence. The mounting of this illusion defines the purpose and accounts for the immense wealth of American sports. It is the ceremony of innocence that the fans pay to see -- not the game or the match or the bout, but the ritual portrayal of a world in which time stops and all hope remains plausible, in which everybody present can recover the blameless expectations of a child, where the forces of light always triumph over the powers of darkness."
Lewis Lapham,"A certain kind of rich man afflicted with the symptoms of moral dandyism sooner or later comes to the conclusion that it isn't enough merely to make money. He feels obliged to hold views, to espouse causes and elect Presidents, to explain to a trembling world how and why the world went wrong. The spectacle is nearly always comic."
Lewis Lapham,"Except in a few well-publicized instances (enough to lend credence to the iconography painted on the walls of the media), the rigorous practice of rugged individualism usually leads to poverty, ostracism and disgrace. The rugged individualist is too often mistaken for the misfit, the maverick, the spoilsport, the sore thumb."
Lewis Lapham,"Most of the ladies and gentlemen who mourn the passing of the nation's leaders wouldn't know a leader if they saw one. If they had the bad luck to come across a leader, they would find out that he might demand something from them, and this impertinence would put an abrupt and indignant end to their wish for his return."
Lewis Lapham,"The figure of the enthusiast who has just discovered jogging or a new way to fix tofu can be said to stand or, more accurately, to tremble on the threshold of conversion, as the representative American."
Lewis Lapham,"Among all the emotions, the rich have the least talent for love. It is possible to love one's dog, dress or duck-shooting hat, but a human being presents a more difficult problem. The rich might wish to experience feelings of affection, but it is almost impossible to chip away the enamel of their narcissism. They take up all the space in all the mirrors in the house. Their children, who represent the most present and therefore the most annoying claim on their attention, usually receive the brunt of their irritation."
Lewis Lapham,"We might make a public moan in the newspapers about the decay of conscience, but in private conversation, no matter what crimes a man may have committed or how cynically he may have debased his talent or his friends, variations on the answer ''Yes, but I did it for the money',' satisfy all but the most tiresome objections."
Lewis Lapham,"Leadership consists not in degrees of technique but in traits of character; it requires moral rather than athletic or intellectual effort, and it imposes on both leader and follower alike the burdens of self-restraint."
Lewis Lapham,"A society that presumes a norm of violence and celebrates aggression, whether in the subway, on the football field, or in the conduct of its business, cannot help making celebrities of the people who would destroy it."
Wayne LaPierre,"I believe Clinton needs a certain level of violence in this country,"
Wayne LaPierre,"That's just not what good people do, ... It's been proven that good people can use rational decisions about what's necessary to save their life."
Wayne LaPierre,Cities do not have the authority under the state law to ban the possession of handguns.
Wayne LaPierre,"Let's use this week to put firearm safety education in every elementary classroom in America so young kids know if they see a gun what to do: stop, don't touch it, leave the area, call an adult,"
Wayne LaPierre,Americans saw a complete collapse of the government's ability to protect them.
Joan Laporta,We have to work to try and win the league as soon as possible and concentrate on the Champions League. We want to reach the final in Paris and win it.
Joan Laporta,The referee has evaluated the risk to the players and has acted correctly.
Joan Laporta,It'll be a great final between the two teams that have played the best football over the season in Europe. I'm especially pleased with the happiness that is being felt by all Barca fans.
Joan Laporta,"We are very satisfied with the agreement,"
Brian Lara,"The mental strength is important and that is really where I feel I come in as an experienced player, someone who has played in a winning team and now plays in a team that's not doing too well."
Brian Lara,I am ready to sacrifice anything to see that West Indies becomes the best team in the world. To beat teams like Australia and England in the world cup would be great.
Brian Lara,"You can't play a patience game with them. They take command and like to take command and if you let them, they will."
Brian Lara,"We have to put the past behind us. We have to view the situation as if we are about to start a two-test series against South Africa, and we want to come out of that one on top."
Brian Lara,"It's good to see the young guys coming in and being very positive -- they seem to have the passion for the game. That's been missing for quite some time,"
Brian Lara,Thinking about a whitewash or anything like that is not uppermost in my mind.
Brian Lara,This is one of the greatest days of my life.
Brian Lara,"I can remember the last two series vividly - South Africa's home series here and the one in the West Indies,"
Brian Lara,He bowled yesterday and seemed to have lost none of his zest. He is capable now of giving 100 per cent.
Brian Lara,"These are the young guys we're banking on and the more experience they get at this level, the better it will be for us."
Brian Lara,"There was no devil in the pitch and we definitely faltered today,"
Brian Lara,We spoke about his love for cricket and what cricket does to influence the world.
Brian Lara,A resurgence is needed. West Indies cricket needs a resurgence.
Brian Lara,"We have to be hopeful that things can improve. It is pretty embarrassing the state that West Indies cricket is in at the moment. We can't put out our best team. At the end of the day, everybody is losing."
Brian Lara,I was reading about it in the press and I just thought it was a bit disrespectful toward a country that has a greater cricketing history than the present country we're playing.
Brian Lara,"I am short of competitiveness,"
Brian Lara,I think I was selected to lead the team but it was a bit unfortunate that the higher authorities did not see it that way.

Ring Lardner,"A good many young writers make the mistake of enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope, big enough for the manuscript to come back in. This is too much of a temptation to the editor."
Ring Lardner,An optimist is a girl who mistakes a bulge for a curve.
Ring Lardner,The only real happiness a ballplayer has is when he is playing a ball game and accomplishes something he didn't think he could do.
Ring Lardner,The family you come from isn't as important as the family you're going to have.
Steve Largent,"This year's keynote session is a clear reminder that wireless data technology is expanding its reach beyond that of an alternative to wireline telephony. We have gathered an exclusive group of business leaders to share how wireless is being integrated into their company's business strategies and what it means for their bottom lines. The presence of these telecom, media and entertainment giants on our center stage is a great indicator of the impact wireless data has made on countless industries,"
Steve Largent,"Does this look like a mature industry to you, ... Here we are, in our twenty-third year of service, enjoying our best year yet."
Steve Largent,"[Largent also responded to questions that have been raised regarding the continuation of wireless service for affected gulf residents.] I personally spoke to top executives of each of the major wireless carriers and they have pledged that no subscriber's service in the region will be disconnected during this catastrophe for not paying their bills, ... We will continue to work with the FCC and other federal, state and local officials on restoration efforts and look forward to sharing with them the massive effort that we as an industry have undertaken in the gulf region."
Steve Largent,"They have pledged that no subscriber's service in the region will be disconnected during this catastrophe for not paying their bills,"
Steve Largent,"Our industry has been working around-the-clock since before Hurricane Katrina hit land to have the people, assets and materials in place to provide needed telecommunications services to the affected region. The challenges we have met in the form of flooding, power outages and security have been truly unprecedented, but we will continue to devote whatever assets and human resources are needed to bring back telecommunications service as soon as possible. Our valued customers deserve our best effort during this disaster and that is exactly what we are delivering,"
Steve Largent,"Not only will the wireless consumer and the nation's economy benefit from the â€¦ auction, but today we have learned that the American taxpayer has emerged as a big winner as well."
Steve Largent,This is not a victimless crime. This is a cancer eating away at the soul of this country.
Steve Largent,Where is the harm in the wireless industry?
Steve Largent,"When a child grows up without a father, there is an empty place where someone must stand, providing an example of character and confidence."
Steve Largent,"What you see happening right now with some of the consolidation is all about more spectrum and capital formation that give you the scale, scope and resources to invest in that 3G world."
Steve Largent,"We've got vibrant competition, we've been lightly regulated, and we continue to offer more services and more minutes of use for a lower price."
Steve Largent,"We're not necessarily the ski boat, we're the skier. There are countries like Japan and Korea and others who are the ski boat at this point, but we're getting pulled right behind them."
Steve Largent,We're not in the business of shaping consumer demand. We respond to it.
Steve Largent,This is going to become a battle for access to your home and office plus mobility. It's about who can provide the biggest and least expensive and fastest pipe to your home and office and offer you a mobility feature.
Steve Largent,"These companies know that at their current size they're not going to be big enough to have the necessary capital, and they don't have enough spectrum to get to the third generation."
Steve Largent,"There's nothing like playing. You can coach and you can be around the game, but there is nothing like playing. It's just so much fun."
Steve Largent,"There's a lot of consternation about sitting on an airplane for three, four or five hours listening to somebody else's phone conversation."
Steve Largent,Sometimes Congress likes to milk an issue.
Steve Largent,"People are very protective of their cell phones, how it's used, where it's used and how much it costs. It has become a very personal issue for a whole lot of people in this country."
Steve Largent,People are very interested in having access to wireless data while they are on a plane.
Steve Largent,"Life is very good. I'm the president and Chief Executive Officer of the Wireless trade association, the CTIA."
Steve Largent,"Japan and Korea, they have had a government that has been very compliant with allowing them to have access to a lot of spectrum."
Steve Largent,"It's still fun to come to games, and it's still fun to be in the Seattle crowd."
Steve Largent,"It's hard, or you wouldn't like it. A lot of coaches really don't like what they're doing."
Steve Largent,It would have been a lot of fun as a receiver to play.
Steve Largent,"It sure made me feel good to be here today, and have so many people say so many kind things."
Steve Largent,"I was standing up on top of the stadium before the game, to raise the flag. It was an awesome experience, it really made my day."
Steve Largent,"I don't have the fire in the belly right now. It's one of those been there, done that deals."
Steve Largent,A child can escape the shadows.
Steve Largent,"When you start thinking about taking pictures, sending an e-mail, receiving an e-mail, speaking into your phone and have it transcript voice into text and then sent as an e-mail, it's mind-boggling."
Steve Largent,"Considering that 10 years ago, there were only 38 million subscribers in America, this is one amazing feat."
Steve Largent,"While it's hard to believe that only ten years ago there were but 30 million subscribers in America, there is no doubt that more subscriber growth is on the way,"
Steve Largent,"The mobile communications revolution is in full swing, and now nearly 70 percent of America is taking part in it."
Steve Largent,"Well, it's the old head fake -- The play action pass where you pretend you're handing off and you're really not and, you know, I'm not falling for it."

Philip Larkin,"Life has a practice of living you, if you don't live it."
Philip Larkin,I can't understand these chaps who go round American universities explaining how they write poems: It's like going round explaining how you sleep with your wife.
Philip Larkin,"Above all, though, children are linked to adults by the simple fact that they are in process of turning into them. For this they may be forgiven much. Children are bound to be inferior to adults, or there is no incentive to grow up."
Philip Larkin,I wouldn't mind seeing China if I could come back the same day.
Philip Larkin,"Man hands on misery to man. It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can, and don't have any kids yourself."

Bruce Larner,"Paul may not have scored (much), but I wouldn't trade (that). He dominated the inside."
Bruce Larner,"Joe's a good player, but he's only a sophomore. His father used to teach at Okemos, so I had a feeling he'd have a big game for us."
Bruce Larner,We made some really bad choices and mistakes. We started playing fast instead of playing the way we play. We were almost in trouble.
Adam LaRoche,"I'm kind of glad. If we had won, we would have come in here and watched television for two hours to see if the Phillies won. I'm not saying I would have complained. Obviously, that would have been better than this. But it will all work out."
Adam LaRoche,"It takes a lot of nerve to throw it, ... And to practice it enough to be able to be able to throw strikes ... there's not too many pitching coaches that are going to work on it with you."
Adam LaRoche,Unbelievable. I guess I forgot what kind of power he has. He gets some pretty incredible carry when he gets ahold of the ball.
Adam LaRoche,"I'm just trying to get it going for the postseason. I know we're not in there yet, but I'm planning on going there."
Adam LaRoche,We had a lot of obstacles this year. We've been in and out of trouble all year. We just seemed to battle through it with the new guys.
Adam LaRoche,"If you could put us together, I'd love to play with these guys for the next eight years. It'd be a dream. I've thought about that a lot. It'd be cool."
Adam LaRoche,"If we're going to go home after the first round again, I'd rather not make the playoffs, ... It was a miserable feeling [last year]. If it happened two years in a row, it would be even worse than last year. I've got to have my swing figured out before then."
Adam LaRoche,"We should have done better than winning one out of three games here. We didn't get some hits when we needed them, and we gave up some hits when we didn't need to."
Adam LaRoche,"We've played a ton of one-run games. I know we've won some of them, but it just feels like we've lost most of them."
Adam LaRoche,"Hats off to him. I think one of the hardest things to do in the game is to keep a hitting streak. I don't think as long as I'm alive we'll ever see anybody get close to 56, but if anybody is going to do it, Jimmy's a great guy."
Adam LaRoche,"It's good to see him happy. He misses everybody; he'll always miss being a Brave. It's frustrating to see him there, but to see him enjoying it, to see him liking where he's at, and having (Edgar) Renteria being such a good guy makes it easier."
Paul Larrabee,The rest was old-fashioned shoe-leather and investigative technique.
Paul Larrabee,"This is a section of law and jurisdiction that continues to evolve, but because you have really three different services, it is not as clear as it could be."
Paul Larrabee,You can see from a case like this how the Medicaid system can have a substantial impact on county budgets.
Paul Larrabee,"The facts will determine our next course of action. If there is evidence of criminal impropriety [by Nurses on Hand], it will be pursued."
Jim Larranaga,"Having the kind of support we received tonight, and what we've been getting since we started this tournament, we're all just loving it. It helped us get off to a great start."
Jim Larranaga,"We had a police escort back to the Patriot Center, which was really awesome. Then we arrived here. There were over 2,000 students and fans and friends of the program here to greet our guys. It was like a pep rally."
Jim Larranaga,"It's been an absolutely fantastic magic carpet ride. In the movie 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' Butch and Sundance were being chased by these detectives. They keep trying to lose them. They can't. They keep asking themselves, 'Who are those guys?' That basically represents the George Mason basketball team."
Jim Larranaga,"What is the magic number -- 64, 65 or 128? I don't know where you stop."
Jim Larranaga,We're the largest state university in Virginia. We've had two Nobel Prize winners. Our law school is ranked in the top 40 nationally.
Jim Larranaga,"If any of them lived in Northern Virginia, we would have recruited them just as hard. I don't know why, but there are a lot of good players in Maryland who have shown interest in us. There were a lot of very good players in Northern Virginia we wanted, but for some reason they didn't have an interest in us."
Jim Larranaga,"I don't think you want to create the expectation, now that George Mason has done it â€” they've broken the barrier, so to speak â€” now everybody else should be expected to do that. That would be the wrong message."
Jim Larranaga,"Hats off to Florida. They played at a very high level. The greater the expectation, the greater the pressure, the more likely you will fall short. We'll just continue to be who we are and believe in the things we do."
Jim Larranaga,"I think what it might do is eliminate some of the lower-major programs from being in some major events. More quality schools are available now, and promoters of those are always looking for the best teams in this."
Jim Larranaga,"This season has been a lot about our consistency. We didn't have a lot of ups and downs. We learned some lessons in November and since then, we've played some very consistent basketball. That's what has separated this team because we've been able to play consistently well, even in the NCAA tournament against high-quality programs and teams."
Jim Larranaga,"I'm not going to judge based on the circumstances. I'm not going to be influenced by what the cause and effect might be. If I did that, I'd be changing my philosophy every single day. We can't live that way. We have to have a certain amount of core values that we live by."
Jim Larranaga,Circumstances do not dictate whether or not we follow that policy.
Jim Larranaga,David has not won the national champion-ship yet.
Jim Larranaga,"When the argument came as to whether or not we belonged, quite frankly I loved it. I think everybody loves the David and Goliath story. But most of the time, no one cheers for Goliath. No matter who we faced, it was going to be something that we were expected to lose. It was something that it motivated our guys."
Jim Larranaga,"I think they've had an incredibly great year with all the adversity they've had to deal with. You can't say it's the same team if someone gets hurt and they're not playing. That's not fair. You don't lose a guy to an injury or have a guy get shot. How bad a circumstance is something like that? That doesn't just affect one guy. It affects the whole program. Somebody's life is in danger, and you're distracted."
Jim Larranaga,Their ability to contest shots made it difficult to get the kind of 3-pointers we'd been getting.
Lexa Larsen,We just want that chilly ride on the fire truck now.
Lexa Larsen,"She led mostly by example. When we needed a big play, she came up with it. She's capable of scoring 30 points in a night, but she averages about 11 points because she does such a good job of getting all of her teammates involved."
Lexa Larsen,"They brought that determination, and they were going to do it no matter what."
Lexa Larsen,She's the glue that holds us together. She gives everyone confidence . . . She makes the right decisions. She is an extension of myself out on the floor because she knows exactly what I want and how I want things done out there.
Bob Larson,"It shows democracy at work, and hopefully what we just did eliminates any problems in the future with how we count our ballots."
Bob Larson,"The belief is that after Katrina makes landfall, it will move north to the Tennessee Valley and then northeast through the Ohio Valley and onto eastern Canada."
Bob Larson,The public health threats are extremely difficult to find. The diseases that can be passed from animals to humans are primarily of concern for people that work directly with livestock.

Gary Larson,"No one knows what the public school system is going to look like in 10 or 20Â years, but we know it's moving toward being more innovative, more cutting edge or more designed to meeting the needs of individual students."
Gary Larson,"We expect increased net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, when compared to the prior quarter. With our solid execution and the positive trends in our core business, we expect to close fiscal 2006 by reporting a significant increase in annual net sales over fiscal 2005. We also anticipate full-year profitability in 2006, which marks a dramatic improvement in our bottom line compared to the prior year."

Gary Larson,We are going to fight this thing all the way. The district is breaking the law and it's breaking its word to treat students who attend charter schools fairly.
Gary Larson,"Things can be low on the food chain, but that doesn't mean they're lowly,"
Gary Larson,"Charters give public school teachers the flexibility to design programs to the individual student needs. They no longer have to go to a distant bureaucracy to ask for permission. By being allowed to make their own decisions the teachers are able to create strong partnerships with parents,"
Gary Larson,You're seeing a shift within the charter school movement. The first 10 years were about creating choices for parents. The second decade is a focus on identifying successful models and replicating them as quickly as possible.

Christopher Lasch,"Once women begin to question the inevitability of their subordination and to reject the conventions formerly associated with it, they can no longer retreat to the safety of those conventions. The woman who rejects the stereotype of feminine weakness and dependence can no longer find much comfort in the clichT that all men are beasts.

Tommy Lasorda,"Guys ask me, don't I get burned out? How can you get burned out doing something you love? I ask you, have you ever got tired of kissing a pretty girl?"
Tommy Lasorda,About the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure.
Tommy Lasorda,"Pressure is a word that is misused in our vocabulary. When you start thinking of pressure, it's because you've started to think of failure."
Tommy Lasorda,"There are three types of baseball players: those who make it happen, those who watch it happen, and those who wonder what happens."

Ivory Latta,"I think it's great for the game, to be honest. Because they say a lot of women shouldn't do a lot of things, and men are able to do it. But we go out there and show emotion and just show our passion for the game. ... Without emotion in the game, it would be pretty much boring."
Ivory Latta,I don't think we had trouble. There was a lot of calls we didn't get down the stretch.
Ivory Latta,When I went down I was in a lot of pain and I'm still in a lot of pain right now. But I tried not to let it affect me and I think that I let my teammates down.
Ivory Latta,I didn't see any fright in their eyes like I usually see in other team's eyes.
Ivory Latta,We just have to go out there and play Carolina basketball. We also have to rebound and play great defense. I think our defense is capable of stopping anything that they want to do.

Colleen Laukka,Love is pure like the fresh fallen snow unencumbered by yesterday's debris.
Colleen Laukka,"Fear drags me into the slums of the emotions.   But when I move into love, the penthouse of emotions, I choose a completely different neighborhood.  The valley below transforms into a spectacular, unobstructed view reminding me of how far I have come."
Colleen Laukka,Changing Your Life is as easy as E Y T...Examine Your Thinking in order toâ€¦   Elevate Your Thoughts so you canâ€¦      Enjoy Your Today and        Expand Your Tomorrows!
Cyndi Lauper,"People used to complain to me all the time, 'I can't even hear you sing because your clothes are so loud.'"
Cyndi Lauper,"My partner and I, we were talking about Christmas. And it's a holiday of the heart, and you know, like we listened to 'Silent Night' and 'In the Bleak Midwinter,' and that to me was like a lullaby, ... And after all, this holiday's about a baby. So I wanted to put a human face on this, and I said, 'Well, what would you say if you were singing to your baby, telling your baby about Christmas? What would you say?' And so I came up with this song."
Cyndi Lauper,I'm in the business where you get the business all the time.
Cyndi Lauper,Sometimes my mind boggles. It's so deep my mind actually boggles.
Cyndi Lauper,God has more important things to worry about than who I sleep with.
Cyndi Lauper,Somebody did complain to me and tell me that my clothes were so loud they couldn't hear me sing.
Cyndi Lauper,"I get the greatest feeling when I'm singing. It's other-worldly. Your feet are anchored into the Earth and into this energy force that comes up through your feet and goes up the top of your head and maybe you're holding hands with the angels or the stars, I have no idea."
Cyndi Lauper,"When I got hoarse, the manager would say, 'Drink this. Joplin used to drink this,' and I used to say, 'Joplin? Joplin's dead."
Cyndi Lauper,"When I sing I don't feel like it's me. I feel I am fabulous, like I'm 10 feet tall. I am the greatest. I am the strongest. I am Samson. I'm whoever I want to be."
Cyndi Lauper,"I've always wondered what it would be like if somebody from outer space landed with three heads. Then all of a sudden everybody else wouldn't look so bad, huh? Well, OK you're a little different from me but, hey, ya got one head."
Cyndi Lauper,"You know, I do speak the Queens English. It's just the wrong Queens that's all. It's over the 59th Street Bridge. It's not over the Atlantic Ocean."
Cyndi Lauper,"What, do you think that feminism means you hate men?"
Ralph Lauren,I wanted to show the dimension and the international image of my work.
Ralph Lauren,"We're making a major move of the Internet, and runway.polo.com is a natural extension of both polo.com and our collection business."
Ralph Lauren,"I've always been about style for people, not 'You're going to wear this outfit,' ... It was the way you put yourself together and the imagination, not buying this number off the rack, but the way you wear it."
Ralph Lauren,"Knowledge is not a passion from without the mind, but an active exertion of the inward strength, vigor and power of the mind, displaying itself from within."
Ralph Lauren,"It's the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept... It's not about age. It's about taste, and it's about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything."
Ralph Lauren,"I think the accessories look very modern and very exciting. These big earrings, these big hoops. I think the girls are sort of falling in love with... collars, neck collars."
Ralph Lauren,People ask how can a Jewish kid from the Bronx do preppy clothes? Does it have to do with class and money? It has to do with dreams.
Ralph Lauren,"They know they're going to look beautiful, and I don't think women should look like costumes. They shouldn't look like fashion victims."
Ralph Lauren,"It's the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept, ... It's not about age. It's about taste, and it's about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything."
Ralph Lauren,"I don't design clothes, I design dreams."
Dino De Laurentiis,We set ourselves a limit and cut characters which weren't so vital.
Dino De Laurentiis,These scenes deal with what happened before Hannibal Lecter was captured for the first time.
Dino De Laurentiis,"My philosophy is very simple. To feel young, you must work as long as you can."
Dino De Laurentiis,Mr Tony Hopkins says he's willing to do it if he likes the script.
Dino De Laurentiis,"Italian industry was so poor we had no money for studio, to create the set, to go anyplace. We had to shoot everything in the street."
Dino De Laurentiis,"It's a fantastic review. Sixty percent of the American reviews are sensational, 20% are mixed, not so good."
Dino De Laurentiis,"If you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters."

Dino De Laurentiis,"I realized the exciting place was behind the camera with the producer, director and so on."

Dino De Laurentiis,"After The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, the audience would like to know where, when, and who arrests Hannibal Lecter for the first time. This is the story of Red Dragon."
Wilfrid Laurier,"Let them look to the past, but let them also look to the future; let them look to the land of their ancestors, but let them look also to the land of their children,"

Wilfrid Laurier,"Two races share today the soil of Canada  These people had not always been friends. But I hasten to say it  There is no longer any family here but the human family. It matters not the language people speak, or the altars at which they kneel."

Frank Lautenberg,You can't ignore that there's an abundance of talent in this individual.
Frank Lautenberg,"should have acted faster, based on the rules and regulations that they're committed to."
Frank Lautenberg,"Our system of campaign finance has completely collapsed and it needs reform,"
Rod Laver,I wouldn't bet against him. He's got so much talent.
Rod Laver,"He wasn't his usual self, with that desire to win points and how he says to players: 'You have to beat me', ... Maybe he was concerned on getting himself right for the US Open."
Rod Laver,"There's a lot of competition now and a lot of the players have adapted his game to what they do, keeping the ball in play and chasing balls down."
Rod Laver,"When you have the opportunity, you strike."
Rod Laver,"When you've got your man down, rub him out."
Rod Laver,"I think age is not really an issue when you're looking at someone like Roger. He could be 31, 32 and be winning matches if the desire's there."
Avril Lavigne,"Yeah, let's keep the peace going."
Avril Lavigne,"I was eating bad stuff. Lots of sugar and carbs, junk food all the time. It makes you very irritated."
Avril Lavigne,"Life is like a roller coaster, live it, be happy, enjoy life."
Avril Lavigne,I liked being a minor because you can't get into trouble. Now I just have to try and behave myself.
Avril Lavigne,I'm the kind of person who always likes to be doing something.
Avril Lavigne,"To understand me, you have to meet me and be around me. And then only if I'm in a good mood - don't meet me in a bad mood."
Avril Lavigne,"In America, I get a lot of younger kids, but there's teens and adults too, ... In Europe, for some reason, I see a lot more males in the audience. In Japan, I don't even notice any kids, partially because they're a lot more strict about fan behavior over there."
Peter Laviolette,"We're not there yet. There's still a lot of work and this is not going to be an easy task going up to Montreal. To be honest, we're going to have to play better than we did tonight."
Peter Laviolette,"The speed and the skating just weren't the same. We tried to work through it, tried to muster up the energy and guts to get it done. It was just a little bit ugly and not our typical brand of hockey."
Peter Laviolette,"They work very hard and they have nothing to lose, and that makes them dangerous. It seemed to me like we were on our heels a little bit in the first period. We need to be on our toes."
Peter Laviolette,"To be honest, it's really hard to sum up in words how excited and proud I am to be asked to coach this team. We'll have one goal when the Olympics roll around in February and that's to win the gold medal. We have a legitimate chance."
Peter Laviolette,"I think it's just trying to put in the nuts and bolts,"
Peter Laviolette,"He's trying to yell it as loud as he can. He's standing on top of the mountain, screaming. I don't know if anybody will hear, but you've got to love the way he took charge of the game."
Peter Laviolette,We're trying to hold on to that zero as long as we can. We've got to fight for that.
Peter Laviolette,"Trust me, it's not the ultimate goal."
Peter Laviolette,We don't need the guys we picked up at the trade deadline to come in and feel like they have to carry everybody on their shoulders. We had a good offensive team. But where we've been successful is by having depth on our offense all year long.
Peter Laviolette,"I saw what happened...it was not a clean hit. You know what - people who constantly hit people from behind should be made an example of by the league. Somebody is going to get hurt. Hopefully, our guy is not severely hurt, but it is not sounding good."
Peter Laviolette,"Just reading what's being written, or what people are saying about the U.S. team, they've got us harnessed in sixth, seventh place, somewhere in that area."
Peter Laviolette,We have three starting goaltenders. It's an opportunity to see what he can do.
Peter Laviolette,"It's an opportunity to get him in and see what he can do. We have three NHL starting goaltenders. They all start for their teams, and they are pretty capable."
Peter Laviolette,That was big. We couldn't get anything by them. It was a frustrating night.
Peter Laviolette,"It was a frustrating night. Offensively we had a whole bunch of chances and a whole bunch of shots on net and came away with one goal. Defensively we held them to seven shots a period and probably in the range of four or five quality chances a period. It was a frustrating night. I guess the only positive you can take is you have to win four games, not just one."
Peter Laviolette,"He's just the guy, the consummate professional that shows up every night."
Peter Laviolette,"I was checking with him the whole night. He felt good, he looked good. I kept asking him if he was good, and he was good. He's been skating for a while and he's been in practices for a while. If I thought that he was in an awkward position, I would have cut it back."
Peter Laviolette,The one thing that kept coming up about Chris is his competitive nature.
Peter Laviolette,The one thing that kept coming up about Chris is his competitive nature. It kept coming up over and over again: This is a guy than can help win hockey games.
Peter Laviolette,"It's important to keep in mind that it's an exhibition game and the teams don't have their full lineups. But in saying that, exhibitions can set a winning culture or a losing culture. I think it is how you approach the game and the players have approached it in order to be successful. I'm happy with the fact we're being successful."
Peter Laviolette,"I would hope we come out the way we did tonight, with a sense of urgency and put the foot on the gas and be the best team in the league."
Peter Laviolette,"We didn't win enough at home last season, and before this season starts we talked about doing better."
Peter Laviolette,"You hear me say 'Offense, offense, offense,' but we didn't score many goals [in 2003-04] and we've got to fix the problem, ... But we want to be a good defensive team, too. It's important to have a good mix."
Peter Laviolette,"The game wasn't quite [like] the last four games, where we seemed like we were in a huge hole. It was a good back-and-forth game. I thought it had a good pace, and I thought in the third period we started to play a little bit more our style of hockey."
Peter Laviolette,"He's going to have somewhere between six and 10 games to get ready for the playoffs. We've tried to do that by having depth all year long, and when Joe does come back, he doesn't have to carry this team. He just has to come in and be Joe."
Peter Laviolette,"We're not here to lose in overtime, we're here to win hockey games."
Peter Laviolette,"They all seem to be big games now. It doesn't matter who the opponent is. Four points [the possible turnaround against any Eastern Conference opponent] are a bundle, and we've got to seize these points."
Peter Laviolette,"It doesn't revolve around one person. Not everyone can remain hot for all 82 games. It's a combination of having that balanced attack as far as offense goes, along with two goaltenders [Gerber and rookie Cam Ward] we trust and have played well."
Peter Laviolette,There just won't be an easy games from here on out.
Peter Laviolette,There's nothing to say you're going to win a hockey game just because you're better on paper. I think the Swiss proved that.
Peter Laviolette,It's tough when you leave one place and you're in limbo and not sure what the future holds. But I wouldn't paint the rock-bottom picture.
Peter Laviolette,"I think it's tough when you're traded. You come into new surroundings. ? It's a whole new environment, surroundings, and every day provides a comfort level. I think it's really starting to show with Doug."
Peter Laviolette,"He provides a physical presence, hard work, energy. Everything you want your team to exemplify, Nic brings to the table."
Peter Laviolette,"We were in control of the game, and then we made a couple of really bad turnovers, bad decisions with the puck."
Peter Laviolette,We seemed to be in control at 2-0. I honestly don't think they had five solid chances. That goal seemed to give them life and they ran with it.
Peter Laviolette,The year in the American Hockey League really helped his confidence and skating.
Peter Laviolette,We have a lot of confidence in all our goaltenders. There is no question about it.
Peter Laviolette,"We were embarrassed. To win in this building, against this team, is good for confidence."
Peter Laviolette,"The thing about international competition is, no matter who you play, there are no easy games. There won't be one easy game."
Peter Laviolette,"Anyone over here, from my experience with international competition, can win on any given night."
Peter Laviolette,"It's tough when you get traded. It's a whole new environment, surroundings, and every day provides a comfort level. You feel a little better, a little easier about what you're supposed to be doing here. I think it's really starting to show with (Weight)."
Peter Laviolette,Everyone's dealt with the same situation. What concerns me as a coach is one of the few teams that's not held back is the Latvian team. They're ready. They're time-adjusted.
Peter Laviolette,"Under the circumstances, being down 2-0, I think the guys really stepped up and played."
Peter Laviolette,"That was a big effort. Under the circumstances, being down 2-0, I think the guys really responded in the last 40 minutes. For (Stall) to lead the way like that, that was impressive."
Peter Laviolette,"We have no choice in it. It is what it is. It's frustrating because we've had a lot of good players that aren't available to us. I guess it says a lot about our team that we're still in the position we're in. Still, you'd rather have everybody healthy."
Peter Laviolette,I think the character of this team showed through.
Peter Laviolette,We'll have to be much better on Thursday if we expect to beat Canada.
Peter Laviolette,"I see similarities in the fact that I guess nobody really is picking either team, so at the beginning of the year, there was not a lot of talk about Carolina. Just reading what's being written or what people are saying about the U.S. Team, you know, they have got us harnessed somewhere in 6th, 7th place, somewhere in that area. I don't think that that really matters."
Peter Laviolette,"It's an accomplishment and our guys should be proud of that. They've worked hard to get to this point, but trust me. It's not the ultimate goal."

Antoine Lavoisier,"One succeeds in obtaining an equivalent production at a lower price by improving the arts, trades and agriculture and by developing the physical and moral qualities of workers, farmers and craftsmen."
Antoine Lavoisier,"A wealthy landowner cannot cultivate and improve his farm without spreading comfort and well-being around him. Rich and abundant crops, a numerous population and a prosperous countryside are the rewards for his efforts."
Antoine Lavoisier,"It took them only an instant to cut of that head, but it is unlikely that a hundred years will suffice to reproduce a singular one."
Antoine Lavoisier,Vegetation is the basic instrument the creator uses to set all of nature in motion.
Antoine Lavoisier,I consider nature a vast chemical laboratory in which all kinds of composition and decompositions are formed.
Antoine Lavoisier,"Let us hope especially that the enthusiasm and exaggerations, which so easily seize men congregated in large groups - affecting human passions and leading the crowd against its own interest, sweeping up in their whirlwind the sage and philosopher as"
Joe LaVorgna,The issue in my mind is what kind of recovery we get from here.
Joe LaVorgna,The NAPM report is another piece of information that fits the market's mindset that the Fed's tightening is close to being done.
Joe LaVorgna,The economy got off to a good start (early) in the first quarter.
Joe LaVorgna,"We think the economy is in recession, and it looks like October is going to be weaker than September."
Sergei Lavrov,We have either close or identical views or full understanding on all issues.
Sergei Lavrov,"We are going to support the main conclusion contained in the new IAEA report which stresses the need to continue working within the IAEA framework,"
Sergei Lavrov,We support your efforts and will provide comprehensive support for the UN Security Council.
Sergei Lavrov,"The [UN] Security Council will be informed, but will take no steps."
Sergei Lavrov,Sanctions are not the best or the only way to solve international problems.
Sergei Lavrov,"When he said that Russia should wait for new attacks, goes beyond all limits of law and morals and we hope proper measures will be taken in regards to him."
Sergei Lavrov,"Any ideas about a coercive, forceful solution to the issue are highly counter-productive and cannot be supported."
Sergei Lavrov,"We have certain differences over the ways to pursue our goals, but our final aims coincide, in my opinion."
Sergei Lavrov,"There can be wars without weaponry and military hardware, without the use of military force as we know it today, [but] ones based completely on information and online technologies. Such forms of confrontation may be more destructive and effective than conventional armed conflicts."
Sergei Lavrov,"Regardless of the results of the German elections on Sept. 18, relations with Russia will remain no less important than in the past decades,"
Sergei Lavrov,I doubt we would accept (a proposal) taken behind our back and then presented to us as the only outcome possible.
Sergei Lavrov,"The content and direction of our relations to a large extent determine the tendencies of the continent's development. All of Europe benefits from the Russian-German friendship and cooperation,"
Sergei Lavrov,"The contribution of these organizations could be very interesting. NGOs have both the desire and capabilities to develop topics to achieve specific, tangible results for ordinary people."
Sergei Lavrov,"We agreed to continue contact on the issue to promote its solution in cooperation with other countries, in the first place with the European troika,"
Sergei Lavrov,"Besides the traditional bilateral cooperation in the trade and economic spheres, it is high time to think of joint projects on the markets of other countries involving our scientific-technical and financial potentials,"
Sergei Lavrov,"Commodity turnover between our countries is growing, but we also want to develop investment cooperation."
Sergei Lavrov,My colleague gave assurances that cooperation [with the commission] would continue.
Sergei Lavrov,"The result we achieved is a compromise that does not solve all the problems,"
Sergei Lavrov,There is no competition between [Russia and the U.S. in the matter].
Sergei Lavrov,I also think we have to stick to the text of the agreement. ... The most important thing is to see that the agreement is carried out.
Sergey Lavrov,There is no collectively discussed and agreed strategy of what we all will be doing in the Security Council if the issue is there.
Sergey Lavrov,"We do not agree that this matter should be sent to the Security Council,"
Sergey Lavrov,"I fully support the call for the resumption of talks, but in reality it can be done only on condition of continuing the enrichment moratorium, which is mutually acceptable."
Sergey Lavrov,"Sanctions are not the best or the only way to solve international problems. Our common efforts should be aimed at getting answers to all the questions, without exception, which were posed by experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
Sergey Lavrov,we would be relying entirely on diplomatic means to achieve the full cooperation of Iraq on the issue of access.
Sergey Lavrov,There is no compromise new proposal.
Sergey Lavrov,"[The resolution] was a compromise, but to make it possible, all participants made steps to accommodate."
Sergey Lavrov,NATO is going beyond all borders. We are really disturbed over this barbaric action. We are outraged...and we call and demand an immediate investigation.
Sergey Lavrov,"We are outraged over this barbaric action,"
Vance Law,"We are looking forward to playing in a more comfortable environment. Now that we are at home it gives our players more class time, too."
Vance Law,"Dad always says, 'The Yankees got all the records and we got the rings,'"
Vance Law,"From where I was, I didn't see it. But coach Roberts said it was an unbelievable swing."
John Lawhon,"I'm just glad to get the game in without anyone hurt. It was wet and slippery, but I'm happy with how we played."
John Lawhon,We scored and you think that would be enough. Porter kept itself in the game and showed heart by coming back. Scoring (their first goal) gave them momentum. Little things like that in a state tournament game can make the difference.
John Lawhon,It was a game where we could have had a couple more goals in the first half and a couple more in the second half.

D.H. Lawrence,"Be still when you have nothing to say; when genuine passion moves you, say what you've got to say, and say it hot."
D.H. Lawrence,"The true self is not aware that it is a self. A bird, as it sings, sings itself. But not according to a picture. It has no idea of itself."
D.H. Lawrence,"And what's romance? Usually, a nice little tale where you have everything as you like it, where rain never wets your jacket and gnats never bite your nose, and it's always daisy-time."
D.H. Lawrence,"I want relations which are not purely personal, based on purely personal qualities; but relations based upon some unanimous accord in truth or belief, and a harmony of purpose, rather than of personality. I am weary of personality. Let us be easy and impersonal, not forever fingering over our own souls, and the souls of our acquaintances, but trying to create a new life, a new common life, a new complete tree of life from the roots that are within us."
D.H. Lawrence,"Once you abstract from this, once you generalize and postulate Universals, you have departed from the creative reality, and entered the realm of static fixity, mechanism, materialism."

D.H. Lawrence,We have to hate our immediate predecessors to get free of their authority.
D.H. Lawrence,"It is all a question of sensitiveness. Brute force and overbearing may make a terrific effect. But in the end, that which lives by delicate sensitiveness. If it were a question of brute force, not a single human baby would survive for a fortnight. It is the grass of the field, most frail of all things, that supports all life all the time. But for the green grass, no empire would rise, no man would eat bread: for grain is grass; and Hercules or Napoleon or Henry Ford would alike be denied existence."
D.H. Lawrence,"Myth is an attempt to narrate a whole human experience, of which the purpose is too deep, going too deep in the blood and soul, for mental explanation or description."
D.H. Lawrence,"This is the very worst wickedness, that we refuse to acknowledge the passionate evil that is in us. This makes us secret and rotten."

D.H. Lawrence,"You must drop all your democracy. You must not believe in ''the people.'' One class is no better than another. It must be a case of Wisdom, or Truth. Let the working classes be working classes. That is the truth. There must be an aristocracy of people who have wisdom, and there must be a Ruler: a Kaiser: no Presidents and democracies."
D.H. Lawrence,"The more I see of democracy the more I dislike it. It just brings everything down to the mere vulgar level of wages and prices, electric light and water closets, and nothing else."
D.H. Lawrence,"Every civilization when it loses its inner vision and its cleaner energy, falls into a new sort of sordidness, more vast and more stupendous than the old savage sort. An Augean stable of metallic filth."
D.H. Lawrence,"The trains roared by like projectiles level on the darkness, fuming and burning, making the valley clang with their passage. They were gone, and the lights of the towns and villages glittered in silence."
D.H. Lawrence,"The world is wonderful and beautiful and good beyond one's wildest imagination. Never, never, never could one conceive what love is, beforehand, never. Life can be great --quite god-like. It can be so. God be thanked I have proved it."
D.H. Lawrence,"Love is the flower of life, and blossoms unexpectedly and without law, and must be plucked where it is found, and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration."
D.H. Lawrence,In every living thing there is the desire for love.
D.H. Lawrence,Never trust the artist. Trust the tale. The proper function of a critic is to save the tale from the artist who created it.
D.H. Lawrence,"Literary criticism can be no more than a reasoned account of the feeling produced upon the critic by the book he is criticizing. Criticism can never be a science: it is, in the first place, much too personal, and in the second, it is concerned with values that science ignores. The touchstone is emotion, not reason. We judge a work of art by its effect on our sincere and vital emotion, and nothing else. All the critical twiddle-twaddle about style and form, all this pseudoscientific classifying and analyzing of books in an imitation-botanical fashion, is mere impertinence and mostly dull jargon."
D.H. Lawrence,"They were evidently small men, all wind and quibbles, flinging out their chuffy grain to us with far less interest than a farm-wife feels as she scatters corn to her fowls."
D.H. Lawrence,"Every new stroke of civilization has cost the lives of countless brave men, who have fallen defeated by the ''dragon,'' in their efforts to win the apples of the Hesperides, or the fleece of gold. Fallen in their efforts to overcome the old, half sordid savagery of the lower stages of creation, and win the next stage."
D.H. Lawrence,Ethics and equity and the principles of justice do not change with the calendar.
D.H. Lawrence,"It is so much more difficult to live with one's body than with one's soul. One's body is so much more exacting: what it won't have it won't have, and nothing can make bitter into sweet."
D.H. Lawrence,"We and the cosmos are one. The cosmos is a vast body, of which we are still parts. The sun is a great heart whose tremors run through our smallest veins. The moon is a great gleaming nerve-centre from which we quiver forever. Who knows the power that"
D.H. Lawrence,"Be a good animal, true to your animal instincts."
D.H. Lawrence,"The only justice is to follow the sincere intuition of the soul, angry or gentle. Anger is just, and pity is just, but judgment is never just."
D.H. Lawrence,America does to me what I knew it would do: it just bumps me. The people charge at you like trucks coming down on you -- no awareness. But one tries to dodge aside in time. Bump! bump! go the trucks. And that is human contact.
D.H. Lawrence,"America is neither free nor brave, but a land of tight, iron-clanking little wills, everybody trying to put it over everybody else, and a land of men absolutely devoid of the real courage of trust, trust in life's sacred spontaneity. They can't trust life until they can control it."
D.H. Lawrence,"Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically."
D.H. Lawrence,"The great living experience for every man is his adventure into the woman. The man embraces in the woman all that is not himself, and from that one resultant, from that embrace, comes every new action."
D.H. Lawrence,"The horse, the horse!  The symbol of surging potency and power of movement, of action."
D.H. Lawrence,"And what's romance? Usually, a nice little tale where you have everything As You Like It, where rain never wets your jacket and gnats never bite your nose and it's always daisy-time."
Jacob Lawrence,"Our homes were very decorative, full of pattern, like inexpensive throw rugs. It must have had some influence, all this color and everything. Because we were so poor the people used this as a means of brightening their life. I used to do bright patterns after these throw rugs; I got ideas from them, the arabesques, the movement and so on."
Jacob Lawrence,I would describe my work as expressionist. The expressionist point of view is stressing your own feelings about something.
Jacob Lawrence,"When the subject is strong, simplicity is the only way to treat it."
James Lawrence,"[Meanwhile, General Mills, which had been investigating soy protein for cereals, was equally intrigued.] We wanted the DuPont technology that would help us to make a significantly better soy-milk beverage; DuPont wanted our marketing expertise and selling infrastructure, ... Both sides wanted to be in the business; both sides wanted what the other had."
James Lawrence,"We're using every available resource to combat this series of home invasions,"
James Lawrence,It is hindering the provision of primary health care to refugees.
John Lawrence,I'm not trying to hold back anybody's vote. I'm just trying to make sure everyone has a say.
John Lawrence,"While total supplies are expected to increase, per capita domestic consumption may increase only slightly thanks to continued strength in pork exports. Supplies of competing meats are expected to be close to 2005 levels setting up a supply scenario similar to 2005 but with slightly more pork."
John Lawrence,That leaves consumer income and their preferences.
John Lawrence,This is a very tangible example of that. Things are different than they used to be.
John Lawrence,The Salvation Army needs a lot of help right now in terms of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. So we thought this was a good place to donate the money.
John Lawrence,"Ultimately, the consumer is king or queen... Hopefully, they'll look and see that everyone in America eats the product and realize that it's a safe and wholesome product."
Martin Lawrence,No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life.
Martin Lawrence,Def Comedy Jam.
Martin Lawrence,"Nobody's ever challenged me and tapped into what I can do. I ain't played a villain which I believe I can do and do real well. There hasn't been any director who has been able to challenge me to go there. At this point in my life I've done a lot of things from stand-up to my own television show for five years to successful comedy shows, and concert films."
Martin Lawrence,"If you don't believe in yourself, then who will believe in you? The next man's way of getting there might not necessarily work for me, so I have to create my own ways of getting there."
Martin Lawrence,"I don't want to sound facetious, but humour is the key to the soul. You know what I mean?"
Martin Lawrence,"I know you think I'm crazy. I go into a different room and I actually felt like it takes me to a better place, positive instead of negative."
Martin Lawrence,If somebody pisses me off and I understand it ain't personal then I'll go to another place and I'll meditate.
Martin Lawrence,"I'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully I'll learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do."
Mike Lawrence,My purpose in visiting with them (this week) was to alert them to the need.
Mike Lawrence,It's an attempt to make it a fun event even though they're waiting to check in.
Mike Lawrence,"I focused on the negative - I was concerned about him and his family. From my perspective, he had spent eight years working tremendously hard as governor. He's got more time to spend with his family."
Mike Lawrence,He made ethics a major deal and he's going to be held to account for any indications that his administration is not highly ethical and associates of his have made use of the relationship with him and others in the administration.
Mike Lawrence,"Providing clean, dependable and affordable electricity is the single most important commodity we can contribute to improving the quality of life in underdeveloped countries."
T.E. Lawrence,"This, therefore, is a faded dream of the time when I went down into the dust and noise of the Eastern market-place, and with my brain and muscles, with sweat and constant thinking, made others see my visions coming true. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that all was vanity; but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, and make it possible."
T.E. Lawrence,"All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible."
T.E. Lawrence,"Club Secretary: I say, Lawrence. You are a clown! Lawrence: We can't all be lion tamers."
Thomas E. Lawrence,"All men dream, but unequally. Those that dream at night in the dusty recesses of their minds awake the next day to find that their dreams were just vanity. But those who dream during the day with their eyes wide open are dangerous men; they act out their dreams to make them reality."
Thomas E. Lawrence,"To me an unnecessary action, or shot, or casualty, was not only waste but sin."
Thomas E. Lawrence,"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity; but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible."
Tim Lawrence,"When Sherry is out at practice, it's similar to Liz. Sherry is out to get better and work she's a great leader who really recognizes and leads from the back. She's just a quality individual."
Tim Lawrence,"One thing is when she steps out on the field whether it's practice or a game she'll put her best effort out. Sometimes I see girls become seniors and because they've been playing their whole life they get a little burned out. Liz still has that enthusiasm to play, has a good attitude and kept everything in perspective."
Tim Lawrence,"He never had a stable marriage. This was certainly a shock. I've known him since I was a kid. He was very generous, he'd give you the shirt of his back."
John Lawson,The market is fragmented so consolidation makes sense and long-term it may be worth paying a decent price to get that dominant position.
John Lawson,"We did great. For not having any rest, we bettered our times in a lot of places."
John Lawson,"Smart hasn't developed as planned, and it's no secret the two sets of management didn't always see eye to eye"
John Lawson,We had some fun with it. But we've got a big week coming up.
Kenneth Lay,Mr. Ramsey has a colorful way with words.
Kenneth Lay,"Rules are important, but you should not be a slave to rules either."
Kenneth Lay,"We welcome this request, ... We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."
Kenneth Lay,"Do you believe based on the information that you had available, what you were saying at the road show was accurate and fair? I did then, I do today, based on what I knew."
Kenneth Lay,"The third quarter is looking great. We will hit our numbers. We are continuing to have strong growth in our business and, at this time I think we're well positioned for a very strong fourth quarter."
Kenneth Lay,"We have been very pleased with the performance of Portland General, ... However, the rapidly evolving competitive electricity market allows us to deliver commodity services and risk management products to our customers without requiring the ownership of a regulated electric utility."
Kenneth Lay,"This is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in Enron, ... Additionally, we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long-term credit rating."
Kenneth Lay,I don't recall him ever telling me the company was in dire straits.
Kenneth Lay,The company is probably in the strongest and best shape it's ever been in. The company is strong and has tremendous momentum.
Kenneth Lay,The company is doing extremely well.
Kenneth Lay,"I was looking forward, not back. I was looking at the fundamentals of the business."
Kenneth Lay,"In virtually every other situation, if there were concerns that any of these business activities were not being done appropriately, these concerns would be addressed by a regulatory agency, like the SEC, or as a civil matter in the courts. However, in this case, the Enron Task Force is attempting to criminalize these very same business activities."
Kenneth Lay,"My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have,"
Kenneth Lay,"My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."
Kenneth Lay,You'll have lower prices under deregulation than you will through regulation.
Kenneth Lay,You'd rather have a surplus versus a shortage in your position.
Kenneth Lay,"When you have a monopoly franchise player exercising their market power, then usually we're out on the other side of those issues."
Kenneth Lay,When there's uncertainty they always think there's another shoe to fall. There is no other shoe to fall.
Kenneth Lay,"Well, rates would go up whether you deregulate or not, and of course, the rates that are going up right now on the electricity side are still within the regulated framework."
Kenneth Lay,We've tried to get as much supply into California as we can.
Kenneth Lay,We use competitive markets to arrange for delivery of our food supply.
Kenneth Lay,We see ourselves as first helping to open up markets to competition.
Kenneth Lay,We need someone who is a strong representative of our value system.
Kenneth Lay,"The last thing I would have ever expected to happen to me in my life would be that, in fact, I would be accused of doing something wrong and maybe even something criminal."
Kenneth Lay,"Our liquidity is fine. As a matter of fact, it's better than fine. It's strong."
Kenneth Lay,"Jeff knew full well what he was walking away from. Again, he needed to deal with this right away."
Kenneth Lay,Investors don't like uncertainty.
Kenneth Lay,"In the case of Enron, we balance our positions all the time."
Kenneth Lay,"I mean, our primary businesses in wholesale pipelines, utilities, retail, were all doing extremely well."
Kenneth Lay,I have to take responsibility for anything that happened within its businesses.
Kenneth Lay,I have faith in the market when we get the rules right.
Kenneth Lay,"I don't think I'm a criminal, number one."
Kenneth Lay,Every market is in transition.

Kenneth Lay,We don't break the law.
Kenneth Lay,The transmission systems are still regulated.
Kenneth Lay,Trillions of dollars every day are being exchanged around the world in all of the financial markets.
Kenneth Lay,"Today, there are also buyers and sellers of all these energy commodities, just like there are buyers and sellers of food commodities and many other commodities."

Kenneth Lay,"There are no accounting issues, no trading issues, no reserve issues, no previously unknown problem issues."
Kenneth Lay,There are absolutely no problems that had anything to do with Jeff's departure.
Kenneth Lay,The problems in California have been that it's been very difficult to site and build new power plants.
Kenneth Lay,"But we have very, very narrow limits on all of our buying and selling of all of our commodities worldwide; different kinds of terms, etc."
Kenneth Lay,"But the most important thing is, Enron did not cause the California crisis."
Kenneth Lay,But indeed a market like California is not good for Enron.
Kenneth Lay,But I can't take responsibility for criminal conduct of somebody inside the company.
Kenneth Lay,"Any slots at the senior level, including CEO or other slots, will be filled internally."
Kenneth Lay,Am I a fool? I don't think I'm a fool. But I think I sure was fooled.
Kenneth Lay,"I have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthrightly investors' questions and concerns, ... Responding to the SEC offers us an additional opportunity to achieve this same goal for investors, and we will cooperate fully. We will also make every appropriate public disclosure during the course of the SEC's investigation."
Heather Layman,"As we watched the work progress, it became clear that this job was more complicated than this one contractor could accomplish."
Heather Layman,We're building for the future. Our belief is that planning for the future and setting ambitious goals ultimately helps the Iraqis achieve their goals.
Heather Layman,"Both the US Defense Department (Army Corps of Engineers) and the State Department have roles in reconstruction, however, the Iraq Project and Contracting Office (PCO) manages most of the pledged $18 billion."
Heather Layman,"Starting about late 2004, we were finding out that security constrained our ability to build all the things we wanted to."

Irving Layton,"I am a genius who has written poems that will survive with the best of Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Keats."
Jack Layton,"We've heard words, we've heard some sabre-rattling, ... But we haven't seen a real plan."
Jack Layton,"When will the prime minister finally stand up and tell George Bush Canadians have had enough with his trade attacks,"
Jack Layton,"There's an enormous amount of taxpayers' dollars involved here and just no sense of responsibility,"
Jack Layton,The responsibility of a minister is to step aside when there is a criminal investigation of the department. That protects the propriety of Parliament and of responsible government.
Jack Layton,"I suggested a research project would be required and I guess we're in that research project. There are clear and profound differences. But in a community we can find solutions, compromises, to pursue results."
Jack Layton,This Parliament's life is likely limited.
Jack Layton,"When you bring good ideas forward in the context of a Parliament where no one party has been given the absolute authority to proceed, then you roll up your sleeves, you discuss, you negotiate."
Jack Layton,If there is a government in Ottawa that doesn't share their values there is a possibility they could reject the option of keeping their place inside Canada. It would be put into question.
Jack Layton,This is not a solution for the future.
Jack Layton,"Friends, this election is wide open,"
Jack Layton,We will be pursuing the protection of our system with a great deal of energy in the next Parliament. We have taken the view that the Conservatives are wrong on a number of key issues.
Jack Layton,"The report has shown there is a culture of greed in the Liberal Party,"
Jack Layton,"There is a culture in the Liberal party that is unacceptable in a democracy,"
Jack Layton,"It levels things out, ... It means you've got a little bit of certainty about what the price is going to be for the next little while."
Jack Layton,"I think it's shocking a lot of Canadians that after an election that was supposed to be about ethical behavior, the first thing we have is an effort to try and fire somebody who is looking into the ethical behavior of the prime minister."
Jack Layton,"If [Martin is] willing to take action on a few key issues over the next few weeks, then perhaps we can wait until the election in the winter, ... If not, then clearly the parliament serves no positive purpose."
Jack Layton,"If there isn't significant action on some of these key issues that we've outlined ... then Canadians may be having an opportunity (to vote) sooner rather than later,"
Emma Lazarus,"His cup is gall, his meat is tears,/ His passion lasts a thousand years."
Emma Lazarus,The particular article ought in my opinion to be treated with absolute contempt. It is too vile to touch.
Emma Lazarus,"I am perfectly conscious that this contempt and hatred underlies the general tone of the community towards us, and yet when I even remotely hint at the fact that we are not a favorite people I am accused of stirring up strife and setting barriers between the two sects."
Emma Lazarus,I am never going to write for the sake of writing.
Emma Lazarus,"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."
Emma Lazarus,My own curiosity and interest are insatiable.
Edward Lazear,"On the other side of the trade deficit, of course, is the capital surplus. We are buying more goods than we are selling, but, on the other hand, the capital account surplus means that the United States is such an attractive market...that individuals from abroad are investing in the United States...at a record rate."
Edward Lazear,"There's not much we can do about it in the short run, and that's the reality."
Edward Lazear,It is a little surprising given the strength of the economy that there is a perception - at least among some of the public - that the economy is not very good.
Edward Lazear,"Over the longer period of time it would move in exactly the wrong direction because it would encourage us to use more oil, not less."

Edward Lazear,One of the things we worry about when we cut the tax on gasoline is that it basically stimulates additional use.

Rick Lazio,"Nobody from Arkansas or Hollywood or Washington, D.C., is going to tell us who's going to represent us in the U.S. Senate."
Jim Leach,"A number of us have worked on Mississippi River issues for a long time. Support for a lock and dam issue is critical for an area like Burlington, especially to do it in such a way that there is respect for environmental issues, too. We're hopeful this year that we're going to get a major Mississippi River initiative passed."
Jim Leach,"This is the stickiest part in any potential discussions,"
Jim Leach,There's probably a little greater case for pessimism than optimism. But I do not rule out optimism.
Jim Leach,"A resolution has been achieved that appears to represent a good-faith consensus in which the Treasury participated and both parties played a role, ... We believe we're at a credible resolution."
Jim Leach,"We stressed that delay was not in anybody's interest, either procedurally or substantively,"
Jim Leach,"A delay does not serve well the North Korean people,"
Jim Leach,"You chose to make this initiative without, to my knowledge, any serious prior consultation with Congress."
Jim Leach,"This administration's tough policies had certain advantages in dealing with this Congress on the huge changes in law that would be necessary if there were a change of policies for North Korea,"
Jim Leach,"As long as it's laying dormant, there are no disturbed fibers loose in the air, we don't have any authority over it,"

Mike Leach,"He's kind of like Chris Hatcher was at Valdosta, except that he's not a worry-wart like Chris was,"
Mike Leach,"The one thing that I discovered about European sports is that they're really good with their feet. I had my choice of something like six kickers, ... But to make a long story short, they didn't do much with their hands. ... As far as catching and throwing, it's not a big part of their arsenal."
Mike Leach,Vincent made some bad decisions on his part and was also a victim of some bad circumstances created by other people.
Mike Leach,"Their speed impacted our margin of error. Everything coming faster, their ability to react, even when we got them in a bind they were able to react quickly."
Mike Leach,Some of the most interesting things about him are his ability to handle a staff and a team. He had a great presence and a John Wayne-type of quality. There is a lot to be learned from him.
Mike Leach,"He's like B.J. (Symons), where he was calm like him, ... 'Cause B.J., under fire, had the ability to be calm and confident."
David Leadbetter,I'm just going to play as hard as I can (today). Try as hard as I can.
David Leadbetter,She has difficult decisions to make on every tee.
David Leadbetter,Playing PGA Tour events makes her better. I think she gets psyched watching the guys and seeing their ability. It raises her level. It helps her up the ladder of improvement.
John Leahy,It's not a big problem at all in fact. We hope and expect it to be relatively minor.
John Leahy,I'm not worried about their cabin size or their economics. The one thing they have is they can deliver a 787 about three years ahead of me.
John Leahy,"You'll walk in and you'll see an atrium, a two-story atrium, ... You'll have piano bars, coffee bars, lounges."

Louis Leakey,I withdrew my support for the validity of the evidence for early Pleistocene Stone Age tools in Europe on the grounds of not proven.
Louis Leakey,I saw what looked like another fallen tree in front of me and put my foot on it to cross over. At that moment it reared up in front of me-the biggest python I had ever seen!

Louis Leakey,"I held a research fellowship at St. John's College, Cambridge, and had been allowed to retain my rooms there while I was away in Africa."
Louis Leakey,I have examined the stomach contents of seven aardvarks.
Louis Leakey,I felt that in time simple stone tools would be found in early Pleistocene in England.
Louis Leakey,Far too often animals are put to sleep when they could be saved through proper care and nursing.
Louis Leakey,Eloquent testimony to the recovery powers of wild animals frequently becomes apparent from the study of skeletons housed in museums.
Louis Leakey,During our first night in the new camp a number of lions came round to investigate. The lions contented themselves by roaring at us.
Louis Leakey,"Colonial governors and senior civil servants are not easy people to argue with, and I was not popular because of my criticism of the colonial service in Kenya."
Louis Leakey,"At Olduvai, for 20 years, Mary and I had investigated and made a general survey of the overall geology."
Louis Leakey,"Although we followed that hyena for the best part of half an hour, we never caught up with it."
Mary Leakey,I've found him-found our man!
Mary Leakey,The first money I ever earned was for drawing stone tools.
Mary Leakey,"She stops, pauses, turns to the left to glance at some possible threat or irregularity, and then continues to the north. This motion, so intensely human, transcends time."
Mary Leakey,Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.
Mary Leakey,No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely.
Mary Leakey,I'd rather be in a tent than in a house.

Denis Leary,My biggest regret in life is that I didn't hit John Denver in the mouth while I has the chance.
Denis Leary,"Jerry Lewis has been married twenty times. He gets married on a Tuesday, they find his wife dead in a swimming pool on Thursday. Maybe if you married someone who's old enough to swim next time, OK Jerry?"
Denis Leary,"Personally, I think Jim Henson said it best when he said Anybody got an aspiren? I think I've got a cold."
Denis Leary,Why hate someone for the color of their skin when there are much better reasons to hate them.
Denis Leary,"Rescue Me' will explore the lives of firefighters through their relationships with each other, their families and their bookies."
Denis Leary,"Rescue Me' will explore the lives of firefighters through their relationships with each other, their families and their bookies,"
Denis Leary,"Most people think life sucks, and then you die. Not me. I beg to differ. I think life sucks, then you get cancer, then your dog dies, your wife leaves you, the cancer goes into remission, you get a new dog, you get remarried, you owe ten million dollars in medical bills but you work hard for thirty-five years and you pay it back and then -- one day -- you have a massive stroke, your whole right side is paralyzed, you have to limp along the streets and speak out of the left side of your mouth and drool but you go into rehabilitation and regain the power to walk and the power to talk and then -- one day -- you step off a curb at Sixty-seventh Street, and BANG you get hit by a city bus and then you die. Maybe."

Jim Leavitt,"We're stepping up to a whole new level now. We're a team that has some talent, but we're facing a heck of a challenge."
Jim Leavitt,I'm really encouraged. I remember watching the spring game last year. There's some talent on the field. We have a chance for a pretty good team.
Jim Leavitt,"There is an awful lot of athletic talent in the group. Over the next two years, we'll really find out just how good the class is."
Jim Leavitt,I went out and did a press conference. I stood with the police officers and paused for a moment. That's all we get.
Jim Leavitt,"He's such a good leader. He has humility. He goes out and works so hard, and he understands you have to work for everything you get in life. He's got the right mind-set, and that's why I think he'll make it in the NFL."
Jim Leavitt,"We had a gold mine this year. We got almost everybody we wanted. We needed help on the line and big, physical receivers, and we got them."
Jim Leavitt,"At defensive end we thought we just hit the gold mine. On our board at end, we about hit on everybody we really wanted."
Jim Leavitt,People thought [Pat] couldn't do it for us. But nobody was complaining after the UCF and Louisville games.
Michael Leavitt,"So as we sign this memorandum of understanding, I would like all of you to know this is a step toward a friendship that I know will grow,"

Lee,"What a cruel thing is war:  to separate and destroy families and friends, and mar the purest joys and happiness God has granted us in this world; to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors, and to devastate the fair face of this beautiful world.  -  letter to his wife, 1864"
Robert E. Lee,Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or to keep one.
Robert E. Lee,The education of a man is never complete until he dies.
Robert E. Lee,Duty is the sublimest word in the language. You can never do more than your duty. You should never wish to do less.
Robert E. Lee,"I have been up to see the Congress and they do not seem to be able to do anything except to eat peanuts and chew tobacco, while my army is starving."

Robert E. Lee,The devil's name is dullness.
Robert E. Lee,A true man of honor feels humbled himself when he cannot help humbling others.
Robert E. Lee,Duty is the most sublime word in our language. Do your duty in all things. You cannot do more. You should never wish to do less.
Robert E. Lee,"Do your duty in all things. You cannot do more, you should never wish to do less."
Robert E. Lee,"I tremble for my country when I hear of confidence expressed in me. I know too well my weakness, that our only hope is in God."
Robert E. Lee,"We failed, but in the good providence of God apparent failure often proves a blessing."
Robert E. Lee,"Duty, then is the sublimest word in our language. Do your duty in all things. You cannot do more; you should never wish to do less."
Robert E. Lee,"Whiskey - I like it, I always did, and that is the reason I never use it."
Robert E. Lee,"We must expect reverses, even defeats. They are sent to teach us wisdom and prudence, to call forth greater energies, and to prevent our falling into greater disasters."
Robert E. Lee,"I think it better to do right, even if we suffer in so doing, than to incur the reproach of our consciences and posterity."
Robert E. Lee,"The trite saying that honesty is the best policy has met with the just criticism that honesty is not policy. The real honest man is honest from conviction of what is right, not from policy."
Robert E. Lee,I cannot trust a man to control others who cannot control himself.
Robert E. Lee,Duty is the sublimest word in our language.
Robert E. Lee,"Get correct views of life, and learn to see the world in its true light. It will enable you to live pleasantly, to do good, and, when summoned away, to leave without regret."
Robert E. Lee,The education of a man is never completed until he dies.
Robert E. Lee,Obedience to lawful authority is the foundation of manly character.
Stan Lee,"I always felt that if I had super-power, I wouldn't immediately run out to the store and buy a costume."
Stan Lee,Wolverine is one of the best characters ever created in fiction. I blew it by not coming up with the idea first.
Stan Lee,"I have never had a lap dance in Tampa or any other part of Florida. If I ever did have a lap dance, I don't think I would be discussing television ideas with the girl that was giving it to me."
Brian Leetch,We're playing well and just having trouble closing them out. We've just got to get better as a team at learning how to win.
Brian Leetch,"He'd eliminate the man, and my job was to clean up from there. I think I'm able to adapt to different partners, play off their strengths and go from there."
Brian Leetch,Each bad game hurt even more because I didn't want to let him down.
Brian Leetch,"Eighteen years ago, my left knee I hurt. I've never had a knee injury in the pros,"
Brian Leetch,"It was nothing (specific). It wasn't like there was a violent move or anything, just like when I hurt it the first time in practice. It just went again."
Brian Leetch,"We look forward to playing at home, but this is a bad way to go home after a loss like this."
Brian Leetch,"I hope they don't mention I was on the ice for all four goals in the loss. Hopefully they won't remember that, because that was disappointing."
Brian Leetch,I don't expect to be booed. I expect it to be a fun night. Just sitting on the bench between shifts will be the most difficult part as your mind wanders.
Brian Leetch,Your accomplishments on the ice will live in the record books forever. But I just want to thank you personally for a great friendship over the years.
Brian Leetch,It reminded me of sitting in Yankee Stadium at the beginning of the games when the guys in the bleachers are yelling out to all the guys in the field. You are used to going into a building and they are for you or against you. It's never in between like that. It was really a different night.
Manny Legace,"He's irreplaceable. He and Drapes, they work hard, and they never complain. Whatever the coach asks, (Maltby) goes out and does."
Manny Legace,"We've been trying to get into playoff mode and that's what we've been stressing the last few weeks. You can't take nights off this time of year. Especially at home, you have to come out and play well for the fans."
Manny Legace,"Not bad hands, huh? He's young and exciting to watch with these new rules."
Manny Legace,"He's a special player. When I was here for that month, he was lighting me up in practice just like he lit me up tonight."
Manny Legace,"He's a great goalie, I admire him a lot. He has great patience. He just works hard and he's doing a great job."
Manny Legace,That's the way they play. They just sit back and wait and capitalize on your mistakes.
Manny Legace,You don't want me handling the puck back there anyway. But I can see where that would hurt teams like New Jersey. They rely on (Martin) Brodeur to handle the puck in the corners. He's like an extra skater.
Manny Legace,"They've been a good team. I'm not sure why we've had that kind of success, but I hope it keeps up."
Manny Legace,He's been the best player for us the last two weeks. I hope he comes back. This team needs him.
Manny Legace,"I feel like going home and hanging myself, that's what I feel like."
Manny Legace,"It's just hard work by the guys. The guys are so dedicated to it, concentrating so much on it. I can't say enough about how hard they work. I don't see a shot some time. It's amazing."
Manny Legace,They had a lot of scoring opportunities. They come hard to the net and they skate so well and they've got a lot of talent. They're going to be a forced to be reckoned with coming down the stretch.
Manny Legace,Thank goodness. We were lucky to be down by one goal.
Manny Legace,"I really do. I left in two bad goals, late in the second period, and instead of leading, we're down 3-2. Those are two I felt I should have stopped."
Manny Legace,I can play better. I know I can play better. Giving up three goals a game isn't cutting it.
Manny Legace,"The same intensity hasn't been there the last two games, and it's shown on the ice."
Manny Legace,"Every game is about special teams right now. We know that power plays are going to win or lose games the way it is now. Our guys aren't getting held up, so that gives us an advantage. We've got a pretty good power play."
Manny Legace,"They came in here and played well, two good road games. Not too flashy. Solid defensively."
Manny Legace,"Ozzie and I are good friends, and whoever is playing better is going to play. But there's no question, it's a great opportunity for me to have a legitimate shot at being a No. 1 goaltender here for the first time."
Manny Legace,"Ozzie and I are good friends, and whoever is playing better is going to play, ... But there's no question, it's a great opportunity for me to have a legitimate shot at being a No. 1 goaltender here for the first time."
Manny Legace,"The young teams that get down a couple of goals, they try to force things to make things happen. Where maturity knows you're going to get it back in the next two minutes."
Manny Legace,"He's done it to a lot better goalies than me but he was on fire tonight,"
Manny Legace,"Those are good teams, and they're all fighting to make the playoffs. Every game is important for those guys. We're going to have to be ready to play."
Manny Legace,"I was terrible tonight. The guys played great. I was fighting the puck the whole night. It seemed like I was getting blinded by the last second. I just wasn't on my game tonight. You score five goals, we should have won in regulation."
Manny Legace,There's no hard feelings toward him. It's just part of the game.
Manny Legace,"Our guys played great in front of me. That's what we're stressing, solid defense. It's hard to play a team like that because they're so fast and they crash and they bang and they send guys all the time. Their defense is pinching. It's a credit for our guys to stand in there and take the punishment."
Manny Legace,It comes down to a skills competition and their skill is better than mine.
Manny Legace,"I love watching them play. Their leadership is amazing, and they just go about their business. They can be down 20 points and there's no panic. That reminds me so much of us."
Manny Legace,The boys gave me a great gift.
Manny Legace,"It was kind of nice, just standing their watching. The boys were playing unbelievable, going to the net hard, pelting the net."
Manny Legace,"The boys have been playing real well in front of me, ... I think this was our best defensive night. We didn't let any breakaways or 2-on-1s."
Manny Legace,"It's a weird thing, it seems I play every year on my birthday, but I always lose."
Manny Legace,"In baseball, they come back and start over the next day after a rainout, even if it's 4-0. But this is the way the NHL wanted it."
Manny Legace,"That's different, both games being at home, that's kind of like a baseball series. Every time we have that (home ice), that's like an extra man at home, with the fans (cheering). They rile us pretty well."
Manny Legace,It's a great honor to be in the record book. I just wish I was playing baseball. I'd be making millions.
Manny Legace,"Comes back, just making saves like he never missed a step. Just a great athlete."
Manny Legace,"You've got to give them credit, they played hard. They took advantage that we might have been a little tired tonight."
John Legend,"I'm really excited to have Ms. Hill on the track, ... She's truly a genius. The first time I ever appeared on a major album was when I played piano on 'Everything Is Everything' from 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.' I have been wanting to work with her again ever since. It's great to see that wish finally come true."
John Legend,Now that I'm coming out with my own record people can see I'm a solo artist.
John Legend,"My first big break came with Lauryn Hill on a track called Everything is Everything, I played piano on that track way back in 1998."
John Legend,The best training is to play by ear: trial by fire.
John Legend,Experience is a great teacher.

Christopher Lehmann-Haupt,"We breathe, we think, we conceive of our lives as narratives."
Christopher Lehmann-Haupt,"There is no medical proof that television causes brain damage - at least from over five feet away. In fact, TV is probably the least physically harmful of all the narcotics known to man."
Jim Lehrer,"[One person who unexpectedly expressed nervousness about Wednesday's] table talk ... This is the first time a conversation-type format has been used. I have to keep my wits about me, and I don't want you involved. Are we okay with that?"
Jim Lehrer,You want to see an angry person? Let me hear a cell phone go off.

Jim Lehrer,There's always a germ of truth in just about everything.
Jim Lehrer,There are very few really stark black and white stories.

Jim Lehrer,"On a daily basis there are some huge ones that are, sure, from time to time, but it is helping the reader sort through all this sort of gray stuff out there."

Jim Lehrer,"My own view, there is a need for and a demonstrated need for more journalism now than there ever has been."
Jim Lehrer,Most of the stories I have covered in 45 years have been gray stories.
Jim Lehrer,"If we don't have an informed electorate we don't have a democracy. So I don't care how people get the information, as long as they get it. I'm just doing it my particular way and I feel lucky I can do it the way I want to do it."
Jim Lehrer,"If people want bells and whistles and all of that, there are bells and whistles available. If they don't want bells and whistles there are places to go where they are not available."
Jim Lehrer,"If Letterman tells a joke with a piece of information in it that you didn't know before, that's fine with me, that doesn't bother me."
Jim Lehrer,I'm not in the judgment part of journalism.
Jim Lehrer,I'm in the reporting part of journalism.
Jim Lehrer,I'm in the civil discourse business. I think it takes all kinds. And more power to everybody.
Jim Lehrer,I'm an expert on the NewsHour and it isn't how I practice journalism. I am not involved in the story. I serve only as a reporter or someone asking questions. I am not the story.
Jim Lehrer,I'm a journalist and that's what I do.
Jim Lehrer,I started as a print reporter.
Jim Lehrer,I have great faith in the intelligence of the American viewer and reader to put two and two together and come up with four.
Jim Lehrer,Everyone should get their news however they want to and in whatever form they want. I'm not going to sit back in judgment of other people and the way they do it.
Jim Lehrer,Best I can do for them is to give them every piece of information I can find and let them make the judgments. That's just my basic view of my function as a journalist.
Jim Lehrer,"As I say, I'm a discourse advocate. What form it comes is less important to me than the fact that there is discourse."
Tom Lehrer,"In the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you are doing rather than to get the right answer"
Tom Lehrer,An actress must never lose her ego - without it she has no talent.

Tom Lehrer,"On Christmas day you can't get sore, Your fellow man you must adore, There's time to cheat him all the more The other three hundred and sixty-four"
Tom Lehrer,"All books can be indecent books, though recent books are bolder.For filth, I'm glad to say, is in the mind of the beholder. When correctly viewed, everything is lewd. I could tell you things about Peter Pan,And the Wizard of OZ, there's a dirty old man!"
Tom Lehrer,"The Army has carried the American ... ideal to its logical conclusion. Not only do they prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, creed and color, but also on ability."
Tom Lehrer,Bad weather always looks worse through a window.
Tom Lehrer,I feel that if a person has problems communicating the very least he can do is to shut up.
Tom Lehrer,"I know that there are people who do not love their fellow man, and I hate people like that!"
Tom Lehrer,I wish people who have trouble communicating would just shut up.
Tom Lehrer,"Apart from that Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?"
Tom Lehrer,Life is like a sewer... what you get out of it depends on what you put into it.
Tom Lehrer,"If a person feels he can't communicate, the least he can do is shut up about it."
Tom Lehrer,On my income tax 1040 it says Check this box if you are blind. I wanted to put a check mark about three inches away.

Tom Lehrer,"Hark, the Herald Tribune sings, Advertising wondrous things"
Jere Lehtinen,We've got speed and I think we are using it very much to our advantage. But don't underestimate our talent level. We've got a lot of very good players. And we're confident like I have never seen us before.
Jere Lehtinen,"I've been to three Olympics before, and it's been great. It's different, every four years. You see and meet all the different athletes in the various sports biathlon, ski jumping, cross country skiing. And everybody is living in the Olympic village."
Jere Lehtinen,"If you score a lot of goals, after that everybody wants to see you score more. Then you're a goal scorer, even [though] the first 10 years you weren't. Suddenly, one year changes everything. I don't want to think about that too much."
Annie Leibovitz,"In a portrait, you have room to have a point of view. The image may not be literally what's going on, but it's representative."
Annie Leibovitz,You don't have to sort of enhance reality. There is nothing stranger than truth.
Annie Leibovitz,"When you go to take someone's picture, the first thing they say is, what you want me to do? Everyone is very awkward."
Annie Leibovitz,"When you are younger, the camera is like a friend and you can go places and feel like you're with someone, like you have a companion."
Annie Leibovitz,"When you are on assignment, film is the least expensive thing in a very practical sense. Your time, the person's time, turns out to be the most valuable thing."
Annie Leibovitz,When I take a picture I take 10 percent of what I see.
Annie Leibovitz,"When I started working for Rolling Stone, I became very interested in journalism and thought maybe that's what I was doing, but it wasn't."
Annie Leibovitz,"What I learned from Lennon was something that did stay with me my whole career, which is to be very straightforward. I actually love talking about taking pictures, and I think that helps everyone."
Annie Leibovitz,What I end up shooting is the situation. I shoot the composition and my subject is going to help the composition or not.
Annie Leibovitz,What I am interested in now is the landscape. Pictures without people. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually there are no people in my pictures. It is so emotional.
Annie Leibovitz,There must be a reason why photographers are not very good at verbal communication. I think we get lazy.
Annie Leibovitz,There are still so many places on our planet that remain unexplored. I'd love to one day peel back the mystery and understand them.
Annie Leibovitz,"The work which is manipulated looks a little boring to me. I think life is pretty strange anyway. It is wooo, wooo, wooo!"
Annie Leibovitz,"The pictures of my family were designed to be on a family wall, they were supposed to be together. It was supposed to copy my mother's wall in her house."
Annie Leibovitz,"The camera makes you forget you're there. It's not like you are hiding but you forget, you are just looking so much."
Annie Leibovitz,"No one ever thought Clint Eastwood was funny, but he was."
Annie Leibovitz,My lens of choice was always the 35 mm. It was more environmental. You can't come in closer with the 35 mm.
Annie Leibovitz,"My hope is that we continue to nurture the places that we love, but that we also look outside our immediate worlds."
Annie Leibovitz,Lennon was very helpful. What he taught me seems completely obvious: he expected people to treat each other well.
Annie Leibovitz,It's hard to watch something go on and be talking at the same time.
Annie Leibovitz,"If I didn't have my camera to remind me constantly, I am here to do this, I would eventually have slipped away, I think. I would have forgotten my reason to exist."
Annie Leibovitz,"I've created a vocabulary of different styles. I draw from many different ways to take a picture. Sometimes I go back to reportage, to journalism."

Annie Leibovitz,"I wish that all of nature's magnificence, the emotion of the land, the living energy of place could be photographed."
Annie Leibovitz,I was scared to do anything in the studio because it felt so claustrophobic. I wanted to be somewhere where things could happen and the subject wasn't just looking back at you.
Annie Leibovitz,I still need the camera because it is the only reason anyone is talking to me.
Annie Leibovitz,"I shoot a little bit, maybe two rolls, medium format, which is 20 pictures, and if it's not working, I change the position."
Annie Leibovitz,I feel very proud of the work from the '80s because it is very bright and colorful.
Annie Leibovitz,I feel a responsibility to my backyard. I want it to be taken care of and protected.
Annie Leibovitz,I don't think there is anything wrong with white space. I don't think it's a problem to have a blank wall.

Annie Leibovitz,"I am impressed with what happens when someone stays in the same place and you took the same picture over and over and it would be different, every single frame."
Annie Leibovitz,"Everyone keeps asking you for pictures, and after a while you get tired of that. I always say, They are in the archives."
Annie Leibovitz,"Coming tight was boring to me, just the face... it didn't have enough information."

Annie Leibovitz,"If it makes you cry, it goes in the show."
Annie Leibovitz,A thing that you see in my pictures is that I was not afraid to fall in love with these people.
Annie Leibovitz,Sometimes I enjoy just photographing the surface because I think it can be as revealing as going to the heart of the matter.
Annie Leibovitz,"When I say I want to photograph someone, what it really means is that I'd like to know them. Anyone I know I photograph."
Annie Leibovitz,"It's a heavy weight, the camera. Now we have modern and lightweight, small plastic cameras, but in the '70s they were heavy metal."
Annie Leibovitz,Computer photography won't be photography as we know it. I think photography will always be chemical.
Annie Leibovitz,"Nature is so powerful, so strong. Capturing its essence is not easy - your work becomes a dance with light and the weather. It takes you to a place within yourself."
Tom Leighton,"It's very interesting to see what the security cameras can do and how long of a range they have,"
Tom Leighton,"With the additional pedestrian traffic we are projecting downtown and the additional retail stores, we want to guarantee safety,"
Tom Leighton,"That was a very sophisticated attack; the nature of it was novel,"

Tom Leighton,"We're confident we can get a rate that works in the 2006 budget,"
Matt Leinart,"I remember watching Carson [Palmer's Heisman victory in 2002] from my couch, and I was just following in his shoes. I just wanted to play. I could never have imagined this."
Matt Leinart,I don't want to watch television. I don't want to look at mock drafts. I just want it to happen.
Matt Leinart,I know a lot of teams question my arm strength. I've never questioned my arm strength. I think I've proven it in three years of playing with top-notch competition.
Matt Leinart,"I don't regret anything,"
Matt Leinart,"He came in like a little baby, just a 17-year-old kid. He had all the athleticism and potential in the world. He just couldn't quite find it."
Matt Leinart,Absolutely. I feel it's an honor to get drafted wherever I go to whatever city takes me.
Matt Leinart,"Oh my goodness, I've never seen him flip out like that. He was so mad that the guy missed his assignment. He picked the guy up, threw the guy on the ground and started cussing -- and he never cusses. He's like barbaric on the field. He just plays the game so intensely."
Matt Leinart,"Oh my goodness, I've never seen him flip out like that. He was so mad that the guy missed his assignment. He picked the guy up, threw the guy on the ground and started cussing - and he never cusses. He's like barbaric on the field. He just plays the game so intensely."
Matt Leinart,He was in game mode.
Matt Leinart,"I want to be known as a football player, not some Hollywood guy or not some party guy, which I'm completely not. I rarely set foot in Hollywood."
Matt Leinart,"I was not upset when Coach Chow left, but you build up a comfort level with a coach and my first couple years were tough. My last couple years with him were great. We developed a personal relationship. We talked about all sorts of things. Once Coach Chow left, I was like, I'm happy for him. I still keep in contact with him."
Matt Leinart,"I love watching quarterbacks run. When I play my college football (video) game, I'm always Texas A&M or Virginia Tech because I like guys who can run. I'm obviously not one of those guys who do that."
Matt Leinart,One of the great finishes in the history of college football.
Matt Leinart,"That's probably one of the greatest finishes ever, of all time, in college football history."
Matt Leinart,"I enjoyed my talks with all the teams. In New Orleans, I had a good session with coach Payton and (general manager Mickey) Mr. Loomis. I don't know if they're really interested because they just got Drew. But in this situation, you never know what will happen."
Atul Lele,"That can lead to oversupply from six months to 12 months on. But in the next six months, the momentum for aluminum is very strong and prices will rise."
Atul Lele,"Around A$800 million would be a good price to achieve for Myer, given its recent disappointing sales data and the expectation that margins have also been squeezed."
Atul Lele,"The result and dividend exceeded our forecasts. The company is saying it has many opportunities to pursue, highlighting a strong deal pipeline."
Jacques Lemaire,"He feels he could get $3.5 [million], good for him. I won't lose sleep because we lose a player. He wants to go for the money, go for the money. You know, the Earth is still going to turn. Players, they come and go."
Jacques Lemaire,"He hadn't been playing well defensively, so when I put him out there, it was a risk. But we had four minutes to go, so I couldn't go with just four guys, I had to go with six guys."
Jacques Lemaire,"They were not quality shots, and the quality ones went in."
Jacques Lemaire,"We had a couple in the past. But being in this situation, needing the points like we do, it's pretty unique."
Jacques Lemaire,We made some little mistakes that we shouldn't have made.
Jacques Lemaire,"Certain guys can't keep living like this and think that everything's going to be OK. If you can't leave an impression from now until the end, you're going to be looking for a job."
Jacques Lemaire,His game's good. There's improvement that he could get.
Jacques Lemaire,"It's in and out, but it will be good. Maybe it will make us appreciate home."
Jacques Lemaire,We got some goals from a lot of guys. We did not start well; we played better in the second period.
Jacques Lemaire,"He needs two eyes in the back. Besides that, he'll be OK."
Jacques Lemaire,"We know it's going to be twice as hard. These guys will play better, there's no doubt. We will try to elevate our game. If we do not, there's no way we will have a chance to win."
Jacques Lemaire,"It's a tough way to lose, no doubt."
Jacques Lemaire,His confidence is at a great level. He's got a great shot and he knows the goalie on the other side and where to put it. He's a great asset for us.
Jacques Lemaire,"That's the way it is. We have to accept everything that is done without any complaints. That's the way it is, but it is a disgrace."
Jacques Lemaire,"Wes is a warrior. These guys, you think they're done, they always come back until their age tells them that they cannot come back. They're fighters. They get injuries. They fight through it."
Jacques Lemaire,"The 5-on-3, we took advantage of that. We moved the puck well and got good shots on the power play, and that's what we're looking for."
Curtis Lemay,That's the reason some schools of thinking don't rule out a destruction of the Chinese military potential before the situation grows worse than it is today. It's bad enough now.
Curtis Lemay,That was the era when we might have destroyed Russia completely and not even skinned our elbows doing it.
Curtis Lemay,"Sometime in the future - 25, 50, 75 years hence - what will the situation be like then? By that time the Chinese will have the capability of delivery too."
Curtis Lemay,My solution to the problem would be to tell the North Vietnamese Communists frankly that they've got to drawn in their horns and stop their aggression or we're going to bomb them into the stone age.
Curtis Lemay,"I think there are many times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons. However, the public opinion in this country and throughout the world throw up their hands in horror when you mention nuclear weapons, just because of the propaganda that's been fed to them."
Mario Lemieux,"It's never easy to go through the first couple of weeks like this, but we have the talent here that should be able to turn it around,"
Mario Lemieux,"It's a different mix of players, but we've got more talent this year,"
Mario Lemieux,"I think so. Not only (because of) his talent, but the way he thinks about the game. He's dedicated to the game of hockey. A lot of guys have had talent in the past, but to put the mind that he has with his talent is special."
Mario Lemieux,"I thought he skated very well. He showed a lot of strength at times protecting the puck. That's a good start for him, he was one of the best players out there."
Mario Lemieux,We're running around too much.
Mario Lemieux,I think we're really running out of time. We probably ran out of time already. It's been unfortunate that the city and the county haven't been willing to work with us over the last two or three years.
Mario Lemieux,"We have no rules,"
Mario Lemieux,"The rules have really helped him. Three, four years ago, if you had that speed, you always had a stick on you. The game is a lot more exciting now."
Mario Lemieux,Our only goal is to make the playoffs. We don't care about the rest of the hockey world. I think we're going to surprise a lot of people.
Mario Lemieux,"It could always happen, but I don't see any problems moving forward."
Mario Lemieux,"I think we have to show some pride in the jersey that we are wearing, and can't quit."
Mario Lemieux,Winning two Stanley Cups really allows me to leave the game in peace.
Mario Lemieux,I can no longer play at the level I was accustomed to in the past. That has been very frustrating to me throughout this past year. That's a big part of why I'm retiring.
Mario Lemieux,"I've watched him skate a little in the past week, and I know how good he is. But once you step onto the ice and start playing, it can be a little different. But I wasn't surprised with how well he played."
Mario Lemieux,"He's been great for us, ... He has a passion for the game almost like Bob Johnson. He's really our leader. We need to listen to him."
Mario Lemieux,"We feel that, with Sidney, we have a great opportunity over the next few years to put a great team on the ice. We're prepared to lose some money along the way. Eventually we're going to need some help,"
Mario Lemieux,He meant a lot to us. When we traded for him in the early 1990s he gave us the opportunity to win the Cup right away. What a great leader for our team when he came here and a great ambassador for the game and a great two-way player.
Mario Lemieux,He really gave us an opportunity to turn this franchise around overnight.
Mario Lemieux,"He's young and he's going to have many opportunities. I know he was disappointed last night, but there are so many good young players now with a little bit more experience. It's unfortunate, but he'll be there for the next one."
Mario Lemieux,"He (Crosby) is our best player, night-in and night-out, that's incredible. He just keeps getting better."
Mario Lemieux,Every game he gets better. That's amazing that he just turned 18 and he's our best player night in and night out. It's incredible.
Mario Lemieux,"People are all excited, saying we're going to make money now ... but in this building, that's the best we can do, ... Even if we go to the finals, we're not going to make money."
Mario Lemieux,"Even if we go to the (Stanley Cup) finals, we're not going to make money,"
Mario Lemieux,"It was just that type of game where he didn't have that many odd-man rushes. [It's] just the way the game went. We've seen him play a few games so far, and we look forward to a great season from him."
Mario Lemieux,"First of all he speaks the language which is a lot easier. I didn't speak English until I came to Pittsburgh and it took me awhile to start to feel comfortable with the language. That's a big advantage that he has,"
Mario Lemieux,"He's adjusted very well. He plays with the kids a lot and he's very chatty. He talks all the time. The kids love him. We talk a lot, have dinner together every night."
Mario Lemieux,"The kids love him and have a good time with him, so it's been an easy adjustment thus far."
Mario Lemieux,But a year off probably hurt some of these guys who didn't stay in shape. It's always tough to come back after a year off.
Mario Lemieux,I hope all parties continue talking and come to a solution for the betterment of the game.
Mario Lemieux,"One thing I hate is people screaming at me. If you want me to do something, talk to me. When someone screams at me to hurry up, I slow down."
Mario Lemieux,"That's part of being a professional, I guess, to deal with tough situations, ... For myself, thank God I never dwelled too much on these things. That probably helped me get through the tough times."
Mario Lemieux,"The chances are there, it's going to come, ... One of these games, we are going to explode for a few goals and get our confidence back. I think the guys are a little uptight right now."
Mario Lemieux,"It's going to be tough. For us to get in the playoffs, we have to win 10 or 12 games in a row and get back in it. That's the only way we can do it."
Mario Lemieux,"Obviously he was a great player, but also a great person and very intelligent and knowledgeable about the game of hockey and I could see him as a president as a general manager of president somewhere down the road."
Mario Lemieux,"Maybe he just turned 18, but look how he played in our last (preseason) game, ... He was one of the best players on the ice, making plays, with his skating and his strength, handling the puck. Give this kid a couple of years, he's going to do some damage."
Mario Lemieux,"Actually, it's kind of nice. We're promoting our young guys in the NHL and players who are the future of the league, not the guys who are 40 or 42 years old."
Mario Lemieux,"I think we've done pretty much everything we can do, as far as setting up the franchise for the future."
Mario Lemieux,"Everybody understands that he's the future of the franchise. He's done even better this season than we thought he'd do. The way he's played, at that age, is quite amazing."
Mario Lemieux,It's a lot more fun to play the game this year than it has been the last four years.
Mario Lemieux,"They're trying to put the best team together, so experience is going to be a factor over there -- I think that had to do with the way they picked the team."
Mario Lemieux,"Maybe he just turned 18, but look how he played in our last [exhibition] game. He was one of the best players on the ice, making plays, with his skating and his strength, handling the puck. Give this kid a couple of years, he's going to do some damage."
Mario Lemieux,"That's good for his confidence, ... Not only the game, but the shootout."
Mario Lemieux,"It should be a no-brainer for the community and the politicians, ... If an owner is willing to pay for his own arena, what else more would you want than that?"
Mario Lemieux,It's up to the community now to decide if they want to keep this team.
Mario Lemieux,"Since the beginning, I always loved the game. When you grow up in Montreal, one day you want to be a professional hockey player. When I was six or seven, I knew that was what I wanted."
Mario Lemieux,"The new owners will be bound by the same agreement we have with Isle of Capri. Certainly, our preference would be to keep the team in Pittsburgh forever."
Mario Lemieux,Everything that he's doing now is quite amazing at his age.
Mario Lemieux,"He is, ... more mature than I was at his age."
Mario Lemieux,"I think he's a lot more mature than I was at his age. He speaks very well, always says the right things and because of that I think the adjustment is going to be a lot quicker for him."
Bob Lemon,I had bad days on the field. But I didn't take them home with me. I left them in a bar along the way home.
Bob Lemon,"I don't care how long you've been around, you'll never see it all."
Bob Lemon,The two most important things in life are good friends and a strong bullpen.
Abe Lemons,"I told [Johnny] Bench once, 'If you had come with me, you could be the principal of a high school by now'."
Abe Lemons,Finish last in your league and they call you idiot.  Finish last in medical school and they call you doctor.
Abe Lemons,"Coaches are creatures of habit. I knew a coach who got a deal going where his players had to run a mile in six minutes. I asked why. He said, 'gut check'."
Abe Lemons,One day of practice is like one day of clean living. It doesn't do you any good.
Abe Lemons,"I don't jog, if I die I want to be sick."
Abe Lemons,Finish last in your league and they call you idiot. Finish last in medical school and they call you doctor.
Abe Lemons,"I don't have any tricky plays, I'd rather have tricky players."
Abe Lemons,You know what they call the fellow who finishes last in his medical school graduating class? They call him 'Doctor.'
Abe Lemons,"There are really only two plays: Romeo and Juliet, and put the darn ball in the basket."
Abe Lemons,The trouble with retirement is that you never get a day off.
Abe Lemons,It was a hole in one contest and I had a three.
Jack Lengyel,"When I went down there, I thought I was rebuilding a football team. I quickly found out that it was also a community that suffered a great loss."
Jack Lengyel,"Somewhere in there he has recognized that this story is symbolic of faith, commitment and determination. He really went out and wanted to do this particular role. I think we have an individual here that will portray it in the proper manner and be true to the documentary information of the particular movie. And I'm looking forward to that."
Jack Lengyel,You see that. He walks up to the player and he's very firm like a coach. He speaks like a coach.
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,"Worst of all, it is women who usually have to do, usually alone, all the dirty work of the kitchen and household, work that is unimportant, hard, tiresome, and soul-destroying"
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,You cannot make a revolution in white gloves.
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,It is impossible to predict the time and progress of revolution. It is governed by its own more or less mysterious laws.
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,Literature must become party literature. Down with unpartisan litterateurs! Down with the superman of literature! Literature must become a part of the general cause of the proletariat.
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,"Whenever the cause of the people is entrusted to professors, it is lost."
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,"All our lives we fought against exalting the individual, against the elevation of the single person, and long ago we were over and done with the business of a hero, and here it comes up again: the glorification of one personality. This is not good at all. I am just like everybody else."
John Lennon,"Nobody's ever tried the peace thing, ... We are selling it like soap."
John Lennon,"You are all geniuses, and you are all beautiful. You don't need anyone to tell you who you are. You are what you are. Get out there and get peace, think peace, live peace, and breathe peace, and you'll get it as soon as you like."
John Lennon,I resent performing for frisking idiots who don't know anything.
John Lennon,"Song writing is about getting the demon out of me. It's like being possessed. You try to go to sleep, but the song won't let you. So you have to get up and make it into something, and then you're allowed to sleep."

John Lennon,All You Need Is Love

John Lennon,"The youth have hope because it's their future they're hopeful about and if they're depressed about their own future, well, then we are in a bad state. And we keep hope alive by keeping it alive amongst ourselves."
John Lennon,I remember a time when everybody I loved hated me because I hated them. - Letter to Stuart Sutcliffe circa 1960
John Lennon,"It's fear of the unknown. The unknown is what it is. And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams, illusions, wars, peace, love, hate, all that--it's all illusion. Unknown is what it is. Accept that it's unknown and it's plain sailing. Everything is unknown--then you're ahead of the game. That's what it is. Right?"
John Lennon,"Work is life, you know, and without it, there's nothing but fear and insecurity."
John Lennon,Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans
John Lennon,Surrealism had a great effect on me because then I realised that the imagery in my mind wasn't insanity. Surrealism to me is reality.

John Lennon,"We were all on this ship in the sixties, our generation, a ship going to discover the New World. And the Beatles were in the crow's nest of that ship."
John Lennon,"He didn't come out of my belly, but my God, I've made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and how he sleeps, and the fact that he swims like a fish because I took him to the ocean. I'm so proud of all those things. But he is my biggest pride."
John Lennon,The thing the sixties did was to show us the possibilities and the responsibility that we all had. It wasn't the answer. It just gave us a glimpse of the possibility.
John Lennon,The more I see the less I know for sure.
John Lennon,Everybody loves you when you're six foot in the ground.

John Lennon,The postman wants an autograph. The cab driver wants a picture. The waitress wants a handshake. Everyone wants a piece of you.
John Lennon,Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.
John Lennon,"Part of me suspects that I'm a loser, and the other part of me thinks I'm God Almighty."
John Lennon,"As usual, there is a great woman behind every idiot."
John Lennon,"If being an egomaniac means I believe in what I do and in my art or my music, then in that respect you can call me that. I believe in what I do, and I'll say it."
John Lennon,I've got to admit it's getting better. It's a little better all the time.
John Lennon,Rituals are important. Nowadays it's hip not to be married. I'm not interested in being hip.
John Lennon,"You're just left with yourself all the time, whatever you do anyway. You've got to get down to your own God in your own temple. It's all down to you, mate."
John Lennon,A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.
John Lennon,"My role in society, or any artist's or poet's role, is to try and express what we all feel. Not to tell people how to feel. Not as a preacher, not as a leader, but as a reflection of us all."
John Lennon,"When you're drowning, you don't say 'I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me,' you just scream."
John Lennon,You don't need anybody to tell you who you are or what you are. You are what you are!
John Lennon,"I'm not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything. I've always been a freak. So I've been a freak all my life and I have to live with that, you know. I'm one of those people."
John Lennon,Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.
John Lennon,"If someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the Sixties, that's his problem. Love and peace are eternal."
John Lennon,"Will the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands? And the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewelry."

John Lennon,"If you tried to give rock and roll another name, you might call it 'Chuck Berry'."
John Lennon,"The pressures of being a parent are equal to any pressure on earth. To be a conscious parent, and really look to that little being's mental and physical health, is a responsibility which most of us, including me, avoid most of the time because it's too hard."
John Lennon,"the blues is a chair, not a design for a chair or a better chair . . . it is the first chair. It is a chair for sitting on, not for looking at. You sit on that music."

John Lennon,Jersey Boys.
John Lennon,"I've had the boyhood thing of being Elvis. Now I want to be with my best friend, and my best friend's my wife. Who could ask for anything more?"
John Lennon,"I believe in everything until it's disproved. So I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons. It all exists, even if it's in your mind. Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now?"
John Lennon,"The cross of the Legion of Honor has been conferred on me. However, few escape that distinction."
John Lennon,"The thing is, in America, it just seemed ridiculous -- I mean, the idea of having a hit record over there, ... It was just something you could never do."
John Lennon,I get by with a little help from my friends.

David Lereah,"You want to make sure homes are affordable; when they start to increase at lofty rates, you start to worry about affordability, ... But certainly, right now, the fundamentals are so good in housing that if we have a drop-off in price gains, it's still going to be at healthy levels."
David Lereah,"Although we've been expecting sales to ease, it's clear the market has tremendous momentum, ... The improving job market and higher consumer confidence are feeding into a large demographic demand for housing."
David Lereah,"We don't need to break a record every year for the housing market to be good. In fact, cooling sales are necessary for the long-term health of this vital sector."
David Lereah,"[The Realtors' association characterized the sales drop as a healthy cooling of a heated market.] Housing activity has peaked and is coming down a bit, ... and we expect further cooling in the coming months."
David Lereah,"Just when you think sales activity is ready to settle into a more sustainable pace, the housing market continues to surprise, ... We've been expecting sales to remain at historically high levels, but this performance underscores the value of housing as an investment and the importance of homeownership in fulfilling the American dream."
David Lereah,"Although interest rates are rising modestly, an improving job market is creating a favorable backdrop for home sales, but at a somewhat slower pace in the months ahead."
David Lereah,"The ongoing stimulus of lower-than-expected mortgage interest rates was the primary driver of strong home sales in October, ... Of course all of the other market fundamentals remain sound, so we should only see a modest decline from record home sales this year if mortgage interest rates gradually rise."
David Lereah,This is not a scenario for a hard landing.
David Lereah,The reason interest rates are higher is that we are in a growing economy.
David Lereah,Housing will still contribute to the overall economy in a positive way and will help consumer spending.
David Lereah,"Changes in the overall direction of the housing market are akin to a large ship making course corrections â€“ it takes some time for the driving factors to materialize as a change in the sales level. In many recent transactions we're looking at a delayed effect of mortgage interest rates that peaked in November but are now lower than expected. Mortgage applications have trended up in recent weeks, so we shouldn't be surprised to see pending home sales rise in the next couple months."

David Lereah,"Vacation-home buyers are making lifestyle choices and purchasing primarily for their own enjoyment. Investment-home buyers are seeking rental income and portfolio diversification, although vacation-home buyers also mentioned diversification."
David Lereah,"Clearly, mortgage interest rates that are near 30-year lows are bringing many buyers into the market at the beginning of the traditional home-buying season, ... and we're counting on the Federal Reserve to continue its accommodative interest rate policy to keep housing strong."
David Lereah,"[As for California,] appreciation there is still healthy, ... Realtors there say that there is still very little supply of homes for sale."
David Lereah,"I truly believe the housing market will continue to expand. But rather than the double-digit price appreciation we've seen, we might see that drop to a 5 or 6 percent appreciation sometime toward the end of next year."
David Lereah,"Although home sales have eased, the tremendous momentum in price appreciation was sustained in the fourth quarter because tight inventories still favored sellers."
David Lereah,"In 2007, you'll have positive home-sales growth and you'll have positive price appreciation."
David Lereah,We are entering a period of a more normal balance in supply and demand. The modest dip in appreciation is an early sign of a market adjustment.
David Lereah,Looking forward the outlook for housing is mixed. I do expect some slowing of home sales and price appreciation going forward.
Max Lerner,"We all run on two clocks. One is the outside clock, which ticks away our decades and brings us ceaselessly to the dry season. The other is the inside clock, where you are your own timekeeper and determine your own chronology, your own internal weather and your own rate of living. Sometimes the inner clock runs itself out long before the outer one, and you see a dead man going through the motions of living."
Max Lerner,To deaden yourself against any hurt is to deaden yourself also against the hurt of others
Max Lerner,A world technology means either a world government or world suicide
Max Lerner,"Having a thirteen-year-old in the family is like having a general-admission ticket to the movies, radio and TV. You get to understand that the glittering new arts of our civilization are directed to the teen-agers, and by their suffrage they stand or fall."
Max Lerner,"The best thing about lying in bed late is that you learn to distinguish between first things and trivia, for whatever presses on you has to prove its importance before it makes you move"

Max Lerner,In our rich consumers' civilization we spin cocoons around ourselves and get possessed by our possessions.
Max Lerner,"The problem of freedom in America is that of maintaining a competition of ideas, and you do not achieve that by silencing one brand of idea."
Max Lerner,"Despite the success cult, men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of the effort involved in getting there - or failing to get there."
Max Lerner,The so-called lessons of history are for the most part the rationalizations of the victors. History is written by the survivors.
Max Lerner,To reject the word is to reject the human search.
Max Lerner,"We cannot live by power, and a culture that seeks to live by it becomes brutal and sterile. But we can die without it."
Max Lerner,The real sadness of fifty is not that you change so much but that you change so little.
Max Lerner,"When you choose the lesser of two evils, always remember that it is still an evil."
Max Lerner,"Next to the striking of fire and the discovery of the wheel, the greatest triumph of what we call civilization was the domestication of the human male."
Max Lerner,When evil acts in the world it always manages to find instruments who believe that what they do is not evil but honorable.
Max Lerner,A President is best judged by the enemies he makes when he has really hit his stride.
Max Lerner,"The crime of book purging is that it involves a rejection of the word. For the word is never absolute truth, but only man's frail and human effort to approach the truth. To reject the word is to reject the human search."
Max Lerner,"You may call for peace as loudly as you wish, but where there is no brotherhood there can in the end be no peace."
Max Lerner,The tourist who moves about to see and hear and open himself to all the influences of the places which condense centuries of human greatness is only a man in search of excellence.
Max Lerner,The turning point in the process of growing up is when you discover the core of strength within you that survives all hurt.
Max Lerner,Somehow life doesn't always pay off to those who are most insistent.
Max Lerner,"The problem of freedom in America is that of maintaining a competition of ideas, and you do not achieve that by silencing one brand of idea"
Max Lerner,"I am neither an optimist nor pessimist, but a possibilist."

Richard Lerner,John's extraordinary contribution is a reflection of his desire to tackle tough health problems of enormous scope that can benefit millions of people.
Richard Lerner,"Obviously, we are disappointed that there might be any further delay. However, we remain committed to working with the state of Florida and Palm Beach County to make Scripps Florida an even greater success that it already is,"
Ali LeRoi,"We're trying to build stories that come from smaller things. There's one show where Chris gets into trouble because his sister wants to make a cup of hot chocolate, but she almost burns the house down. It's just about hot chocolate. There's another show where he gets upset with the girl next door because he finds out she likes his little brother more than she likes him. It's little, simple things."
Ali LeRoi,"UPN is getting behind it. They're putting in everything they have in terms of support. That's good. You'd rather have that than no support. The downside is, you don't want to believe the hype."
Ali LeRoi,Everybody Hates Chris' is a semi-autobiographical show. We try to get humor out of tough subject matters. It never occurred to me what a 6-year-old would think about the subject of Santa.

Ali LeRoi,He had a really great energy and really expressive face. He just had a lot of natural expression in him.
Ali LeRoi,"Usually, funny people aren't in charge of comedy. Comedy has become commerce. They're just trying to duplicate a thing that they can sell. That's the business. I'm not mad at that. You know, cookie companies do the same thing. But all the cookies aren't good cookies. Mrs. Fields is better than a lot of them."
Ali LeRoi,"We were just trying to cast a great kid that kind of embodied the idea of the character. A young kid who kind of felt put upon, who wasn't too cocky and who was a little unsure of himself."
John Leslie,You really have to keep up your nerve for the sake of the performance and other actors around you. There is a real camaraderie at the theatre which I enjoy as I have always been a team player.
John Leslie,I like to entertain. This role was the opportunity to try something different and see if I was any good at acting. I really believe in trying new things and pushing myself.
John Leslie,I usually end up having to owe a little money so why not pay at the last minute? It is hard to get things done early for me.
John Leslie,I am an innocent man.
John Leslie,"This ordeal has been made all the more difficult because of how much it has upset my family, particularly my mother."
Lisa Leslie,"Those other gold medals are at home. Plus, I have a gold outfit I want to wear. I didn't bring anything silver or bronze."
Lisa Leslie,"We're going to the Olympics as favorite to win the gold, and every other team in the Olympics is going bring their best game. We have treat every team with respect, because you know what happen when you take a team lightly. On any given day, you can lose."
Lisa Leslie,I want to thank God for giving me this opportunity and also my teammates from the West side for giving me the ball.
Lisa Leslie,"As a role model for young girls and women, I just encourage them to continue their education and set their goals. And for me, mine are just really high and I just happen to be a professional basketball player but I really am a stickler for my goals and I wanted to get my Master's."
Lisa Leslie,Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. We're both role models who have made different choices. I don't know why we're even talking about it. It's a private matter. It has nothing to do with basketball.
Lisa Leslie,There's a lot of women in the WNBA. There's a lot of women who could be here. To be voted by the fans says a lot - that people are aware of what's going on. I'm really thankful. I think they just really appreciate my talent so I'm definitely grateful.
Lisa Leslie,"I'm strong, I'm tough, I still wear my eyeliner."
Lisa Leslie,I've grown so much since 1996. I think that was the turning point of when I started to go to church every Sunday and not just because you're supposed to. But because you enjoy going and listening to the Word and being excited about it.
Lisa Leslie,It's really not about the money. It's just about educating yourself.
Lisa Leslie,I don't think I would have been able to stick with it and been proud of who I am and be feminine out on the court. I think I would have folded to the peer pressure if I didn't have my mom to encourage me to be me and be proud of how tall I am.
Lisa Leslie,"Right now I'm 185, which is really good for me yet very hard for me to maintain. My weight seems high for the average woman, but I've got big bones and I'm maintaining muscle."
Lisa Leslie,"For me, being tall was very positive because I thought my mom was the most beautiful person ever."
Lisa Leslie,I'm probably taller than 90% of the men I meet.
Lisa Leslie,"Until now, until I actually got into law class, I just never thought of it as being an interest for me, but it's really funny because now that I'm in law, I'm like 'Wow, I could be a lawyer."
Lisa Leslie,Boys have a tendency to jump around a lot more than girls. Boys have that desire to want to dunk way more than girls do. It just never seemed like something we could truly fathom and do.
Lisa Leslie,"I enjoy being in school. I've learned so much already, with taking economics and law, and I have marketing and statistics coming up next."
Lisa Leslie,"Actually just recently I came up with that idea, watching the movie 'Legally Blonde' and I was like, 'cool, that's something I want to do."
Lisa Leslie,"Most people compliment me on maintaining my femininity while I'm on the court. People like the fact that I model. My fans or little girls always say they want to play sports, but also want to be a model like me and I think that's great."
Lisa Leslie,"Everyone talks about age, but it's not about age. It's about work ethic. Winning never gets old."
Doris Lessing,"There is only one real sin, and that is to persuade oneself that the second-best is anything but the second-best"

Doris Lessing,Laughter is by definition healthy.
Doris Lessing,"In the writing process, the more a story cooks, the better."

Doris Lessing,You can't be a Red if you're married to a civil servant.
Doris Lessing,"This world is run by people who know how to do things. They know how things work. They are equipped. Up there, there's a layer of people who run everything. But we - we're just peasants. We don't understand what's going on, and we can't do anything."
Doris Lessing,In university they don't tell you that the greater part of the law is learning to tolerate fools.
Doris Lessing,There is only one real sin and that is to persuade oneself that the second best is anything but second best.
Doris Lessing,"Man, who is he? Too bad, to be the work of God: Too good for the work of chance!"
Doris Lessing,"We use our parents like recurring dreams, to be entered into when needed."
Doris Lessing,What's terrible is to pretend that second-rate is first-rate. To pretend that you don't need love when you do; or you like your work when you know quite well you're capable of better.
Doris Lessing,"For the last third of life there remains only work. It alone is always stimulating, rejuvenating, exciting and satisfying."
Doris Lessing,Pleasure resorts are like film stars and royalty... embarrassed by the figures they cut in the fantasies of people who have never met them.
Doris Lessing,What is a hero without love for mankind.
Doris Lessing,"What's terrible is to pretend that the second-rate is first-rate, that you don't need love when you do or that you like your work when you know quite well you're capable of better."
Doris Lessing,"Some people obtain fame, others deserve it."
Doris Lessing,"I don't know much about creative writing programs. But they're not telling the truth if they don't teach, one, that writing is hard work, and, two, that you have to give up a great deal of life, your personal life, to be a writer."
Doris Lessing,Any human anywhere will blossom in a hundred unexpected talents and capacities simply by being given the opportunity to do so.
Doris Lessing,Literature is analysis after the event.
Doris Lessing,"If a fish is the movement of water embodied, given shape, then cat is a diagram and pattern of subtle air."
Doris Lessing,Pearls mean tears.
Doris Lessing,A simple grateful thought turned heavenwards is the most perfect prayer.
Doris Lessing,"There are no laws for the novel. There never have been, nor can there ever be."
Doris Lessing,Space or science fiction has become a dialect for our time.
Doris Lessing,Small things amuse small minds.
Doris Lessing,Borrowing is not much better than begging; just as lending with interest is not much better than stealing.
Doris Lessing,"Think wrongly, if you please, but in all cases think for yourself."
Doris Lessing,I have found it to be true that the older I've become the better my life has become.
Doris Lessing,"Trust no friend without faults, and love a woman, but no angel."
Doris Lessing,"The great secret that all old people share is that you really haven't changed in seventy or eighty years. Your body changes, but you don't change at all. And that, of course, causes great confusion."
Margaret Levens,Just to watch the smile on his face when a chopper flew over. He died doing what he wanted. That was his passion and I know he was happy.
Margaret Levens,It's what he always wanted to do as a young child. It was his passion. He would just sit there and beam every time a chopper passed over the house.
Margaret Levens,He was there to serve his country and to keep his family and country safe. It was what he wanted to do. He was there for us ... in fact he had re-enlisted for four (more) years.

Denise Levertov,Images / split the truth / in fractions.
Denise Levertov,"You can live for years next door to a big pine tree, honored to have so venerable a neighbor, even when it sheds needles all over your flowers or wakes you, dropping big cones onto your deck at still of night."
Denise Levertov,"Acknowledgement, and celebration, of mystery probably constitutes the most consistent theme of my poetry."
Primo Levi,"Is he out of his senses?! Does he not see Beppo the Greek next to him? Beppo who`s 20 years old and is going to the gas chamber tomorrow, and knows it, and lies there staring up at the light, without saying anything, without even thinking anymore."
Primo Levi,Anyone who has obeyed nature by transmitting a piece of gossip experiences the explosive relief that accompanies the satisfying of a primary need.
Primo Levi,"Human memory is a marvelous but fallacious instrument. The memories which lie within us are not carved in stone; not only do they tend to become erased as the years go by, but often they change, or even increase by incorporating extraneous features."
Primo Levi,"I live in my house as I live inside my skin: I know more beautiful, more ample, more sturdy and more picturesque skins: but it would seem to me unnatural to exchange them for mine."
Primo Levi,"The future of humanity is uncertain, even in the most prosperous countries, and the quality of life deteriorates; and yet I believe that what is being discovered about the infinitely large and infinitely small is sufficient to absolve this end of the century and millennium. What a very few are acquiring in knowledge of the physical world will perhaps cause this period not to be judged as a pure return of barbarism."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"Enthusiastic partisans of the idea of progress are in danger of failing to recognize... the immense riches accumulated by the human race. By underrating the achievements of the past, they devalue all those which still remain to be accomplished."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"Since music is a language with some meaning at least for the immense majority of mankind, although only a tiny minority of people are capable of formulating a meaning in it, and since it is the only language with the contradictory attributes of being at once intelligible and untranslatable, the musical creator is a being comparable to the gods, and music itself the supreme mystery of the science of man, a mystery that all the various disciplines come up against and which holds the key to their progress."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"The musical emotion springs precisely from the fact that at each moment the composer withholds or adds more or less than the listener anticipates on the basis of a pattern that he thinks he can guess, but that he is incapable of wholly divining. If the composer withholds more than we anticipate, we experience a delicious falling sensation; we feel we have been torn from a stable point on the musical ladder and thrust into the void. When the composer withholds less, the opposite occurs: he forces us to perform gymnastic exercises more skillful than our own."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"The world began without man, and it will end without him."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"The world began without man, and it will complete itself without him."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"Our system is the height of absurdity, since we treat the culprit both as a child, so as to have the right to punish him, and as an adult, in order to deny him consolation."
Claude Levi-Strauss,The scientific mind does not so much provide the right answers as ask the right questions.
Claude Levi-Strauss,"Language is a form of human reason, which has its internal logic of which man knows nothing."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, he is one who asks the right questions."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"Just as the individual is not alone in the group, nor any one in society alone among the others, so man is not alone in the universe."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"The wise man doesn't give the right answers, he poses the right questions."
Claude Levi-Strauss,"I therefore claim to show, not how men think in myths, but how myths operate in men's minds without their being aware of the fact."
Adam Levin,"Now our clients can continue doing what they do best -- writing and producing hit television shows with the knowledge that their speech is protected. The court found that the speech which the plaintiff was challenging was not directed at her and did not concern her. Quite simply, she was complaining about the back-and-forth sexual discussions of male and female writers on an adult situation comedy."
Adam Levin,"The writers needed to, as part of their jobs, take on taboo subject matter."
Adam Levin,The writers needed to have the freedom and breathing room to explore sexual topics. That's what the show dealt with.
Adam Levin,Identity Theft 911 congratulates Rutgers on stepping up on behalf of the university community. We're honored that Rutgers has chosen us to join them in fighting this epidemic.
Adam Levin,You can present yourself as an exotic muse the West wants but that's not going to sell clothes.
Richard Levin,"I think we've had a remarkable improvement in the engagement of the University of the city, ... I think we've made major strides in the development of downtown and substantial impact on the creation of the industrial city."
Richard Levin,"Your movies entertain, engage and enlighten, ... For your artistry and imagination, we honor you with this degree of doctor of humane letters."
Richard Levin,"We have some very substantial gifts, ... They'll be announced in due course."
Richard Levin,"I have many broad responsibilities, ... [Vice President for Finance and Administration John Pepper] is the person with direct responsibility in the area."
Richard Levin,"I think that my job is more to set direction, define objectives and develop strategies for reaching them, ... One takes account of the various constituencies in both shaping that agenda and persuading people about it, but if the primary goal were just balancing off the different interests of people, that would make the job pretty uninteresting."
Richard Levin,"The outstanding performance by the Investments Office in the past year has matched a record of achievement over time that has earned (Chief Investment Officer) David Swensen and his colleagues the highest possible praise and admiration from their peers,"
Arthur Levine,"I think that there is a lot of metaphorical truth in the books, and I think that particularly when she talks about things like the protection of love, ... I think the reading experience is more rich and complex than just a bunch of fun, funky magical effects."
Arthur Levine,"We're quite excited about all of these terrific young people, ... It also positions us very competitively for continued growth and as one of the country's powerhouses in biomedical research."
Arthur Levine,"I think I'll have complex feelings about [the last book], ... It's clearly the series that I will be best known for. But it won't be, it's not the end of my career. It's not the last thing J.K. Rowling will write either, and my relationship with her will continue."
Arthur Levine,"The wonderful thing about Martha's work is that it showed such sweet empathy with her characters. Their joy was her joy, their fears were hers. At least it felt that way, which is all an artist can ask. Her art was pretty without being precious, sweet without being icky. And she was a truly nice person."
Arthur Levine,It's the best thing we have right now. Research shows us that children in national board certified teachers' classrooms actually have higher achievement scores.
Michael Levine,Having children makes one no more a parent than having a piano makes you a pianist.
Michael Levine,Part of that is realizing the wealth of American music available.
Michael Levine,"Like it or not, knowledge of the world is no longer a luxury. Other countries are moving ahead with their educational systems, and it's certainly a competitive advantage for them."
Michael Levine,"Learning Chinese is one step we need to be engaged in a global economy. It is time for the United States to really make international education and language a part of U.S. education reform, if we want to compete and respect our colleagues and allies in other countries."
Paul Levinson,"All the hand-wringing misses the most enduring truth: It is wrong to jail a reporter for protecting sources, including flawed reporters. When the dust clears, journalists and newsrooms will be emboldened and Miller's reputation will be transformed."
Paul Levinson,Oprah has been in such a unique position that it takes more than just her performance (Thursday) to undo the damage that she did with Frey's book.
Paul Levinson,"The last thing you want to do, if you are investing dreams, energy and money into a city edition, is to basically fold up the Web page into something nobody would recognize as being a part of Newsday."
Paul Levinson,"Today's audiences are vastly more savvy than even audiences of 10 years ago, thanks to all the movie info that's available 24/7. Moviegoers are now more attuned to any kinds of delay. If they think it's a turkey, the word could spread."
Paul Levinson,"What he did down in New Orleans was really an extraordinary accomplishment, which goes way beyond what we would expect a news anchor to do, ... He not only reported what was going on, he did not allow other people to minimize or mischaracterize what was happening."
Paul Levinson,"What he did down in New Orleans was really an extraordinary accomplishment, which goes way beyond what we would expect a news anchor to do. He not only reported what was going on, he did not allow other people to minimize or mischaracterize what was happening."
Tobias Levkovich,"We think most investors already seem to expect a Bush victory. Consequently, we infer that a Bush victory would be somewhat anti-climactic."
Tobias Levkovich,Simply chasing the momentum is something that we are particularly uncomfortable doing since it smacks of the same mistakes that were made in 2000 when investors felt that they had to be in dot-com names to participate in the new economy paradigm.
Tobias Levkovich,"Tech captures the imagination, more so than talking about auto build rates."
Tobias Levkovich,Any policies that reduce the benefits of moving to low-cost locations could hurt profits by triggering inflation risk and possibly slowing global growth.
Tobias Levkovich,"Two of the more intriguing opportunities come from the biotech area, which often have events that drive their stock prices."
Tobias Levkovich,"Earnings do look as if they are about to start turning. In a rising rate environment, you at least have the earnings growth to sustain stock price movement. Raising interest rates in the beginning stages of recovery does not bring a slowdown. Raising rates in the latter stages of recovery is a different story."
Tobias Levkovich,"Earnings do look as if they are about to start turning. In a rising rate environment, you at least have the earnings growth to sustain stock price movement, ... Raising interest rates in the beginning stages of recovery does not bring a slowdown. Raising rates in the latter stages of recovery is a different story."
Tobias Levkovich,We had accounting scandals in 2002 and there was a lot of clean-up thereafter. It's a different environment now.
Tobias Levkovich,"In a strange way, the skeptics are keeping us bullish. When they concede defeat, there will no longer be a 'wall of worry' to surmount."
Tobias Levkovich,"I think people still think there's serious problems with the bank sector in terms of debt structures or credit losses, ... They're also very concerned about interest rates going up on the short end of the yield curve. Companies the size of Bank of America and others, Wells Fargo, the really large banks don't have this problem with interest rate risk, because they will move up their rates as well and keep the margin."
Marv Levy,I had bigger things to worry about; I had to figure out a way to stop [former Dolphins quarterback Dan] Marino.
Marv Levy,"Now we're not looking at going in to wheel and deal on the trade market, but we're sure not going to close it off."
Marv Levy,The combine has become more expansive than when I was last coached [1997]. It still serves a great purpose. It's the first chance as coaches and general managers we have to see these players. Our scouting staff has been following them for a couple of years and know every little detail about them. Now you can see the human element. They're not just commodities now.
Marv Levy,Our intention remains to keep Eric as a part of our team.
Marv Levy,I'm an 80-year-old rookie. And looking forward to it with boundless enthusiasm.
Marv Levy,"My enthusiasm is unbounded. It's not just to get back into the mainstream of the football world, but to do it with the Buffalo Bills, for whom I have such a longtime affection."
Marv Levy,"I think all teams are involved, to a degree, in making some painful decisions."
Marv Levy,It takes more that just a great coach or a great quarterback or a great anything. It takes the whole package. They still are a distance away from that.
Marv Levy,"Way back when I was hired in 1986, I was 61 years of age. It sounded too old, so I lied and said I was 58. Finally I cleared that up. Maybe as I matured I realized (age) wasn't a factor. It's what you can do that counts."
Marv Levy,"I was 61 years of age and it sounded too old, so I lied and said I was 58. Maybe as I matured, I realized that your age isn't what's important, but your actions."
Marv Levy,The age factor means nothing to me. I'm old enough to know my limitations and I'm young enough to exceed them.
Marv Levy,Ability without character will lose. The Bills are going to be a team of high character. That stamp I will push very hard. I hope we can convey that to our fans and project something very special to the rest of the nation.
Paul Levy,We have made enormous progress.
Paul Levy,"This is a legal question that has to be answered in the context of the litigation under trademark law, and it's a social policy question, ... In theory a famous trademark can be enforced against anybody who uses it commercially. Should Madonna not be able to have a song that uses 'Like a Virgin' in the title on the theory that Virgin record company is actually the owner of the song?"
Paul Levy,She'll breathe a little bit better. She'll be able to exercise a little bit better and do more things and lead a more normal life and hopefully a longer life.
Paul Levy,What kind of healthcare service union would stand in the way of a cancer center in New England? That strikes me as the kind of union we don't want.
C. S. Lewis,You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
C. S. Lewis,Thirty was so strange for me. I've really had to come to terms with the fact that I am now a walking and talking adult.
C. S. Lewis,"The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of 60 minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is."
C. S. Lewis,Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives.
C. S. Lewis,"Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival."
C. S. Lewis,"It may be hard for an egg to turn into a bird: it would be a jolly sight harder for it to learn to fly while remaining an egg. We are like eggs at present. And you cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We must be hatched or go bad."
C. S. Lewis,How incessant and great are the ills with which a prolonged old age is replete.
C.S. Lewis,The fundamental laws are in the long run merely statements that every event is itself and not some different event.
C.S. Lewis,"Smelling isn't everything said the Elephant. Why, said the Bulldog, if a fellow can't trust his nose, what is he to trust? Well, his brains perhaps, she replied mildly."
C.S. Lewis,"What can you ever really know of other people's souls -  of their temptations, their opportunities, their struggles?  One soul in the whole creation you do know: and it is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands"
C.S. Lewis,"The great thing, if one can, is to stop regarding all the unpleasant things as interruptions of one's 'own,' or 'real' life. The truth is of course that what one calls the interruptions are precisely one's real life -- the life God is sending one day by day."
C.S. Lewis,To what will you look for help if you will not look to that which is stronger than yourself?
C.S. Lewis,"As long as you are proud you cannot know God. A proud man is always looking down on thing and people: and, of course, as long as you are looking down you cannot see something that is above you."
C.S. Lewis,"But that would be putting the clock back, gasped the Governor. Have you no idea of progress, of development? I have seen them both in an egg,  said Caspian. We call it Going Bad in Narnia."
C.S. Lewis,"Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition is gone, pride is gone."
C.S. Lewis,"The value given to the testimony of any feeling must depend on our whole philosophy, not our whole philosophy on a feeling."
C.S. Lewis,"A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means.  This is an obvious lie.  Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is....  A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later.  That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness.  They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in."
C.S. Lewis,"The human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it. Now error and sin both have this property, that the deeper they are the less their victim suspects their existence; they are masked evil. Pain is unmasked, unmistakable evil; every man knows that something is wrong when he is being hurt."
C.S. Lewis,"The real problem is not why some pious, humble, believing people suffer, but why some do not."
C.S. Lewis,We have now for many centuries triumphed over nature to the extent of making certain secondary characteristics of the male (such as the beard) disagreeable to nearly all the females - and there is more in that than you might suppose
C.S. Lewis,Music. A meaningless acceleration in the rhythm of celestial experience.
C.S. Lewis,"Miracles do not, in fact, break the laws of nature."
C.S. Lewis,It is only when you are asked to believe in Reason coming from non-reason that you must cry Halt. Human minds. They do not come from nowhere.
C.S. Lewis,"There is, hidden or flaunted, a sword between the sexes till an entire marriage reconciles them."
C.S. Lewis,"A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you're looking down, you can't see something that's above you."
C.S. Lewis,And she never could remember; and ever since that day what Lucy means by a good story is a story which reminds her of the forgotten story in the Magician's Book.
C.S. Lewis,"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."
C.S. Lewis,"If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning."
C.S. Lewis,"It may be hard for an egg to turn into a bird: it would be a jolly sight harder for a bird to learn to fly while remaining an egg. We are like eggs at present. And you cannot go on indefinitely being just an ordinary, decent egg. We must be hatched or go bad."
C.S. Lewis,You cannot make men good by law: and without good men you cannot have a good society
C.S. Lewis,Knock and it shall be opened.' But does knocking mean hammering and kicking the door like a maniac?
C.S. Lewis,I sometimes wander whether all pleasures are not substitutes for joy.
C.S. Lewis,"Be confident small immortals. You are not the only voice that all things utter, nor is there eternal silence in the places where you cannot come."
C.S. Lewis,Adventures are never fun while you're having them.
C.S. Lewis,"Humans are amphibians -- half spirit and half animal. As spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time."
C.S. Lewis,"When you meet anything that's going to be human and isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or ought to be human and isn't, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet."
C.S. Lewis,We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.
C.S. Lewis,Long before history began we men have got together apart from the women and done things. We had time.
C.S. Lewis,Has this world been so kind to you that you should leave with regret? There are better things ahead than any we leave behind.
C.S. Lewis,"God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing."
C.S. Lewis,"I once read the sentence 'I lay awake all night with a toothache, thinking about the toothache an about lying awake.' That's true to life. Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief."
C.S. Lewis,"Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief."
C.S. Lewis,"Gratitude looks to the Past and love to the Present; fear, avarice, lust, and ambition look ahead."
C.S. Lewis,"Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable."
C.S. Lewis,"God whispers in our pleasures, but shouts in our pain."
C.S. Lewis,I do not believe one can settle how much we ought to give. I am afraid the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare.
C.S. Lewis,"The mark of Friendship is not that help will be given when the pinch comes (of course it will) but that, having been given, it makes no difference at all."
C.S. Lewis,"You have not chosen one another, but I have chosen you for one another."
C.S. Lewis,"We ought to give thanks for all fortune: it is is good, because it is good, if bad, because it works in us patience, humility and the contempt of this world and the hope of our eternal country"
C.S. Lewis,Love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them: but Love cannot cease to will their removal.
C.S. Lewis,"You ask whether I have ever been in love: fool as I am, I am not such a fool as that. But if one is only to talk from first-hand experience, conversation would be a very poor business. But though I have no personal experience of the things they call love, I have what is better -- the experience of Sappho, of Euripides, of Catallus, of Shakespeare, of Spenser, of Austen, of Bronte, of anyone else I have read."
C.S. Lewis,No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.
C.S. Lewis,"Faith... is the art of holding on to things your reason once accepted, despite your changing moods."
C.S. Lewis,Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.
C.S. Lewis,Badness is only spoiled goodness.
C.S. Lewis,The salvation of a single soul is more important than the production or preservation of all the epics and tragedies in the world.
C.S. Lewis,All that is not eternal is eternally out of date.
C.S. Lewis,"There, right in the midst of our lives, is that which satisfies the craving for inequality, and acts as a permanent reminder that medicine is not food. Hence a manâ€™s reaction to monarchy is a kind of test. Monarchy can easily be â€˜debunked;' but watch the faces, mark the accents of the debunkers. These are the men whose tap-root in Eden has been cut: whom no rumour of the polyphony, the dance, can reach - men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch. Yet even if they desire equality, they cannot reach it. Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison."
C.S. Lewis,"The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles, but to irrigate deserts."
C.S. Lewis,"True friends... face in the same direction, toward common projects, interests, goals."
C.S. Lewis,"There are two kinds of people: those who say to God, ''Thy will be done,'' and those to whom God says, ''All right, then, have it your way.''"
C.S. Lewis,"If we really think that home is elsewhere and that this life is a 'wandering to find home,'' why should we not look forward to the arrival?"
C.S. Lewis,Friendship is...the sort of love one can imagine between angels.
C.S. Lewis,"Courage is not simply one of the virtues but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means at the point of highest reality."
C.S. Lewis,"Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point."
C.S. Lewis,We are all fallen creatures and all very hard to live with
C.S. Lewis,"Some have paid me an undeserved compliment by supposing that my Letters were the ripe fruit of many years' study in moral and ascetic theology. They forgot that there is an equally reliable, though less creditable, way of learning how temptation works. 'My heart'-I need no other's-'showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly.'"
C.S. Lewis,"I have learned now that while those who speak about oneâ€™s miseries usually hurt, those who keep silence hurt more."
C.S. Lewis,"Education without values, as useful as it is, seems rather to make man a more clever devil."
C.S. Lewis,"Aim at heaven, and you will get earth thrown in; aim at earth, and you will get neither."
C.S. Lewis,"The next moment is as much beyond our grasp, and as much in God's care, as that a hundred years away. Care for the next minute is as foolish as care for a day in the next thousand years. In neither can we do anything, in both God is doing everything."
C.S. Lewis,"A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word, 'darkness' on the walls of his cell."
C.S. Lewis,Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours.
C.S. Lewis,What you see and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing; it also depends on what kind of a person you are
C.S. Lewis,Why love if losing hurts so much? We love to know that we are not alone.
C.S. Lewis,You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me
C.S. Lewis,Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief.
C.S. Lewis,"Though our feelings come and go, Godâ€™s love for us does not."
C.S. Lewis,"Many things--such as loving, going to sleep, or behaving unaffectedly--are done worst when we try hardest to do them."
C.S. Lewis,When you argue against Him you are arguing against the very power that makes you able to argue at all: it is like cutting off the branch you are sitting on.
C.S. Lewis,"Humans are amphibians - half spirit and half animal. As spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time."
C.S. Lewis,We treat our dogs as if they were 'almost human': that is why they really become 'almost human' in the end.
C.S. Lewis,How incessant and great are the ills with which a prolonged old age is replete.
C.S. Lewis,"But probably every age gets, within certain limits, the science it deserves"
C.S. Lewis,You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
C.S. Lewis,Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again.
C.S. Lewis,Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives.
C.S. Lewis,"Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person's ultimate good as far as it can be obtained"
C.S. Lewis,Don't use words too big for the subject. Don't say infinitely when you mean very; otherwise you'll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite.
C.S. Lewis,"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket- safe, dark, motionless, airless--it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable."
C.S. Lewis,"The long, dull, monotonous years of middle-aged prosperity or middle-aged adversity are excellent campaigning weather for the devil."
C.S. Lewis,Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.
C.S. Lewis,"God, who foresaw your tribulation, has specially armed you to go through it, not without pain but without stain"
Chad Lewis,"It was just two good football teams refusing to lose the game, ... Neither team was going to quit, and both teams knew that."
Chad Lewis,Those guys aren't going to pick a friend to coach with them because they're a friend. They want a smart guy around them.
Chad Lewis,"What Coach Reid does is just try and share his confidence, ... He says, 'Hey, we got it started. Let's keep it going.' That's where our sights are."
Chad Lewis,"Andy's wanted Lance to come and coach with him since he's been in the NFL,"
Chad Lewis,We believe in the Eagles.
Greg Lewis,"We just have more opportunities to go out and make plays. If you worry about pressure you're going to get squashed. As a whole I think we're coming along. Right now we're real young with T.O and Pink going down, but that's no excuse."
Greg Lewis,"We weren't terrible on offense, ... We just made some mistakes we need to look at. I felt we would get in a rhythm and then all of a sudden something would happen. We had favorable matchups and I thought we could exploit them."
Greg Lewis,did a tremendous job on his side.
Greg Lewis,"It's really sad and I hate to hear this, you know, from what I hear of them ... they are good people."
Greg Lewis,"I'm enjoying being part of this. Everyone is getting involved and you can't just key on one person. T.O. is the headliner of the receiving corps, and Reggie and myself try to get in there where we can fit in."
Greg Lewis,"He is a great athlete and he strives to be the best. He comes out and shows it when the lights are shining. I commend him for that. I think he is one of the best ones ever to play the game, and I want to learn as much as I can from him."
Greg Lewis,"It's been awesome to reach that accomplishment. Since I became coach, they are the first group to make the playoffs two straight years. We had our goals set high this year. We wanted to win Division 7-4, and the players did. Their hard work is paying off."
Jason Lewis,"It would be great to win at home. We've been real close a lot of times; we just haven't been able to pull the game out for whatever reason. We're not worried about the past right now, though. All we're concerned about is the future."
Jason Lewis,One thing you're not aloud to do is escalate the level of force being used.
Jason Lewis,"This kid?s a phenomenal athlete who?s just beginning to mature physically and mentally. The hurdles are difficult to learn for anyone, but he picked them up just like that. We haven?t even worked on form yet. He?s doing it on pure athletic ability. As an indicator of what kind of ability Gary has, he?s long-jumped 21-4 and run 10.7 for the 100 in practice."
Jerry Lewis,"If a chick turned me down years ago, I said, `There's another few outside, don't worry about it.' I can't take no when I know children and victims are standing around waiting for someone to help them."
Jerry Lewis,"We intend to support our troops as long as they have to serve in this region and are faced with this challenge, (it) is very, very important and Milosevic is watching the members today."
Jerry Lewis,We want to make sure the security of our ports is in America's hands.
Jerry Lewis,Every mans dream is to be able to sink into the arms of a woman without also falling into her hands.
Jerry Lewis,"The information we have is that the suspect was firing randomly at anybody going by, any student going by,"
Jerry Lewis,"If I've learned anything in the more than 50 years that I've led MDA, it's that the generosity of the American people knows no bounds. I'm sure that with their fellow citizens in such dire need, they'll dig deep and do everything they can to help. I'm hopeful that many people will be willing to make two phone calls and donate to both causes."
Jerry Lewis,"I spent a half-million dollars just traveling, doing, trying [and] bringing doctors to me,"
Jerry Lewis,"It will be the greatest appropriations outlay for a disaster in the history of doing this,"
Jerry Lewis,"While the needs of 'my kids' are with us all year round, Hurricane Katrina is a national disaster on a scale that's difficult to comprehend,"
Jerry Lewis,"A woman doing comedy doesn't offend me, but sets me back a bit, ... I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I think of her as a producing machine that brings babies in the world."
Jerry Lewis,"When I was onstage doing the work, adrenaline killed the pain because I never hurt in front of an audience."
Jerry Lewis,"The danger for children today, honey, is the news. Keep them away from news on television and you're going to have very, very fine, natural children."
Jerry Lewis,I get paid for what most kids get punished for.
Jerry Lewis,Pity? You don't want to be pitied because you're a cripple in a wheelchair? Stay in your house!
Jerry Lewis,"People hate me because I am a multifaceted, talented, wealthy, internationally famous genius."
Jerry Lewis,I've had great success being a total idiot.
Jerry Lewis,We're leaving the House to people who either were born with a silver spoon in their mouth... or couldn't get better jobs in the first place.
Jerry Lewis,"A woman doing comedy doesn't offend me, but sets me back a bit. I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I think of her as a producing machine that brings babies in the world."
Jerry Lewis,I am probably the most selfish man you will ever meet in your life. No one gets the satisfaction or the joy that I get out of seeing kids realize there is hope.
Jerry Lewis,Every man's dream is to be able to sink into the arms of a woman without also falling into her hands.
Joe E. Lewis,"I play in the low 80s. If it's any hotter than that, I won't play."
Joe E. Lewis,"The way taxes are, you might as well marry for love."
Joe E. Lewis,"I distrust camels, and anyone else who can go a week without a drink."
Joe E. Lewis,"I told my doctor I get very tired when I go on a diet, so he gave me pep pills. Know what happened? I ate faster."
John L. Lewis,"Workers have kept faith in American institutions. Most of the conflicts, which have occurred have been when labor's right to live has been challenged and denied."
John L. Lewis,"While the men of the steel industry were going through blood and gas in defense of their rights and their homes and their families, elsewhere on the far-flung C.I.O. front the hosts of labor were advancing and intelligent and permanent progress was being made."
John L. Lewis,"Unionization, as opposed to communism, presupposes the relation of employment; it is based upon the wage system and it recognizes fully and unreservedly the institution of private property and the right to investment profit."
John L. Lewis,The real breeders of discontent and alien doctrines of government and philosophies subversive of good citizenship are such as these who take the law into their own hands.
John L. Lewis,"The organized workers of America, free in their industrial life, conscious partners in production, secure in their homes and enjoying a decent standard of living, will prove the finest bulwark against the intrusion of alien doctrines of government."
John L. Lewis,In the steel industry the corporations generally have accepted collective bargaining and negotiated wage agreements with the Committee for Industrial Organization.
John L. Lewis,If there is to be peace in our industrial life let the employer recognize his obligation to his employees - at least to the degree set forth in existing statutes.
John L. Lewis,"But the Committee for Industrial Organizations is here. It is now henceforth a definite instrumentality, destined greatly to influence the lives of our people and the internal and external course of the republic."
John L. Lewis,"The organization and constant onward sweep of this movement exemplifies the resentment of the many toward the selfishness, greed and the neglect of the few."
John L. Lewis,The men in the steel industry who sacrificed their all were nor merely aiding their fellows at home but were adding strength to the cause of their comrades in all industry.
John L. Lewis,Out of the agony and travail of economic America the Committee for Industrial Organization was born.
John L. Lewis,"Ordinary problems affecting wages, hours, and working conditions, in most instances, will quickly respond to negotiation in the council room."
John L. Lewis,Labor was marching toward the goal of industrial democracy and contributing constructively toward a more rational arrangement of our domestic economy.
John L. Lewis,Five of the corporations in the steel industry elected to resist collective bargaining and undertook to destroy the steel workers' union.
Kevin Lewis,Now we can say we have a safety net extending from Fort Kent to Sanford.
Kevin Lewis,It would give residents in crisis a place to go. And it would take pressure off the crisis unit at the Charlotte County Mental Health Center.
Kevin Lewis,Dan is a proven leader with a commitment to excellence and integrity. His keen understanding of the hotel development process combined with his operations and support experience make his appointment a win-win for Choice and prospective developers.
Kevin Lewis,"Unfortunately, less than five percent of people diagnosed with cancer will be treated through enrollment in a clinical trial. Our organization is very supportive of the Coalition and its efforts to accelerate research. We believe that in recent years patients have received better treatment options in trials, and if we can educate people about clinical trials I am confident that we can increase enrollment in these high-priority colon cancer trials."
Lennox Lewis,you're out of your mind!
Lennox Lewis,I am definitely not scared of Mike Tyson. I am at the top of the food chain and he is looking to knock me off. Mike's an arrogant imbecile. He sounds like a cartoon character.
Lennox Lewis,"Rage takes energy, and I want to keep my energy focused. If a man hits me, I'll think, good for you, that's a good shot."
Lennox Lewis,"It's not rage that drives me, it's competition."
Mark Lewis,"The tickets are a way to get creative, get some extra money in fall and winter."
Mark Lewis,"We believe that a $1,000 tax reduction equals about $10,000 more on the overall value of your home, ... If you were in the buyer's market and you were considering two similar homes on the same block, and one has taxes of $10,000 and the other $9,000, wouldn't you pay $5,000 or even $10,000 more for that home? Most people would, since they usually plan to stay there for at least 10 years."
Mark Lewis,"The drill went very well. It was a simple exercise, and Clean Harbors' response people had no problem getting on post or finding the right building."
Mark Lewis,"It's an unfair system, ... You can go to one particular block in Long Island, for example, where 11 houses got a tax reduction last year because they filed grievances. The remaining 4 homeowners who didn't file a grievance are still overpaying. In most municipalities, if you don't file it means you accept the assessment value of your home."
Mark Lewis,We conducted this drill to make sure that our spill response contractor is familiar with the route to the installation. I also wanted to get the response team familiar with the procedures of getting onto the post.
Mark Lewis,They are not just for one person. They can be used as Christmas presents. Companies can give them away to clients.
Mark Lewis,"Like any business, size is important when dealing with vendors. It gives us more muscle with airlines and tour and cruise lines."
Marvin Lewis,"We didn't play very well on offense, defense and special teams. We didn't tackle, we didn't block, we didn't cover, we didn't punt. The fortunate thing is it doesn't count."
Marvin Lewis,We need to understand that it's about working through the tough times. You work through the critical points in the game and keep your eye on the target. Do your job. This is a lesson that we needed to learn.
Marvin Lewis,"I told the guys that that's a victory to be proud of,"
Marvin Lewis,"For the guarantee, you've got to zoom in close, because I'm about to get myself in trouble,"
Marvin Lewis,"He's got premier talent. We've got to get all our guys clicking, and we're trying to do that. That's the challenge for our football team."
Marvin Lewis,I said sacrifice something you normally do and spend that time on Pittsburgh.
Marvin Lewis,They do come in bunches. The guys were on top of their routes and did a nice job of running the cuts with the receivers. Our guys can cover.
Marvin Lewis,"It's my fault, so I'll take responsibility and we'll coach harder. We'll improve it, and we'll do a better job and we'll play better football, or else we'll keep getting new guys, better guys. We'll find a way."
Marvin Lewis,He's understanding what his role and responsibility is. I think he's confident in those guys wherever the ball goes because they make plays. It's not like we have to go to one guy; I think he's confident in all of the guys.
Marvin Lewis,"It's up to him to tell me he's ready to practice seven days in a row, if that's what (the threshold) is. That's what was disappointing about last year: His stress fracture wouldn't allow him to work every day. And I said that I don't want to put pressure on the coaches. If he's in, he's in. He understands that."
Marvin Lewis,"I sensed a different guy on the practice field last week, a guy playing faster."
Marvin Lewis,Those people aren't good for you. They're not people who are on your side when the times are tough. That's the way it works.
Marvin Lewis,Kevin has done a fine job here and he deserves the opportunity he's going to get to be a starting player in Houston. But we feel it's in the best interest of our team to allocate the funds to another position.
Marvin Lewis,"We do want to get things settled and get an opportunity to get the guy signed. I think it's important for us, for where our program is, our team, our city, that we don't have any problems with that and it's as smooth as we can make it."
Marvin Lewis,"We had an opportunity to make some things happen that we didn't get done early in the game. Some things that you can't do in a football game. Eventually, the game gets away from you."
Marvin Lewis,"He is just so, so fast, and has a great competitive spirit about him when he gets an opportunity to get in the football game."
Marvin Lewis,I'm excited. I'm different than I was against Denver (2003). Last year we played on Sunday night (against Miami). That was something new and neat for our guys.
Marvin Lewis,"He did a fine job last night, probably his best game that I remember where he didn't have eight to 10 catches because he hustled his tail off, he blocked. So as I watched that tape this morning, I was proud of Chad Johnson for how he played."
Marvin Lewis,"Why would I want our game in Pittsburgh to be there on a Thursday night to open the season? (It favors the home team), particularly coming off a world-championship season."
Marvin Lewis,"And that's what it's all about. That's been our mind-set all the way through, to bring players here who can handle that challenge and are up to that challenge."
Marvin Lewis,"That's a part of it. There's no question that goes through [our] mind. But you don't go into this thing to fail. If you do the research, the character, the background all the way through ... you've got to feel like you've done the right thing."
Marvin Lewis,"In my mind, this is what I wanted to do. But I wanted to think about it some more and talk to both of those guys at the end of the year. But I announced it when I did because I wanted everybody to know, and put all the cards on the table."
Marvin Lewis,"He's had a good week. Every time he steps on the field, he practices hard and he's learning what he needs to learn. He's getting closer to doing the things he needs to do."
Marvin Lewis,"So, I am learning about what their strengths and weaknesses are as we go. You want to try and find where they can fit."
Marvin Lewis,"He's one of our guys who we expect to play better. He's one of our leaders and best players. So we're counting on Levi, just like we're counting on (right tackle) Willie (Anderson) on the other side. They're part of the reason why we believe we're a good offensive football team."
Marvin Lewis,We're obviously doing without some of our leaders.
Marvin Lewis,Gee whiz. The guy got hurt. Let it go. There's nothing you can do. You can't get it back. To sit there and baby and cry like their quarterback did - ridiculous.
Marvin Lewis,You can't purposely go out and hurt somebody. I've never seen that happen in the NFL. So I don't think there needs to be any resentment.
Marvin Lewis,He pushed very hard to get this done.
Marvin Lewis,"[It's just the way Palmer goes about life. At a golf tournament, he and Lewis were playing with a corporate chief executive. The man marveled at Palmer's natural abilities.] I see it every day, ... But you would never know he is so good at everything. He just shows up, performs great and sort of slips out the door."
Marvin Lewis,"I'm proud of our guys for how hard they've worked, giving everybody something to smile about. We're ready to keep going."
Marvin Lewis,I think we're doing a lot of giving. I don't know how much taking we're getting to do.
Marvin Lewis,"In a lot of their games this year they've got right down the field early and scored,"
Marvin Lewis,"We have a plan. Some of it can be the game plan, some of it can be the opponent, where other guys are at the position health-wise. Sunday morning we should be pretty close. I want to make sure the guys who should be OK and ready to go are OK and ready to go."
Marvin Lewis,"We're excited to have this deal concluded. We're excited to get started with David, for his and our future."
Marvin Lewis,"This is a key development for our team. It further secures our future with one of our top players, in the prime of his career, and I want to commend Chad for his efforts in making it happen. He is showing his commitment to what we have going here."
Marvin Lewis,"We beat a good football team,"
Marvin Lewis,"We hung in there toe to toe, but we have to make plays to win. We're a good football team. In order to prove that, we have to go beat the other good football teams."
Marvin Lewis,"He finds a way to make football plays,"
Marvin Lewis,The defined role is to get him in the game and get him the football in his hands as much as we can.
Marvin Lewis,"We won't know where things are until we go out and begin playing football when it counts. That's the hard part of it. Even if he had been here every day, no matter who it is, what position, there's always something new that comes up, and how people handle those situations is always tested. That's why it's not an exact science."
Marvin Lewis,"Our team needed to win games, ... As I said a zillion times, we could not afford to lose football games and having somebody to blame. All that would've done is give people an excuse to say, 'They're losing because of the quarterback position.'"
Marvin Lewis,"If you tackle well and you tackle with your arms, and if you keep going after the football aggressively, good things will happen."
Marvin Lewis,"We played another physical football game and we knew it was going to be that type of game. We've got to make corrections, both players and coaches."
Marvin Lewis,It's a pretty typical play whether they show it or not. It's a fundamental football play. Just cover your man. Don't let your eyes go to where they don't belong.
Marvin Lewis,"We're in a situation on our football team where no matter what position the guy plays, he doesn't necessarily have to come in right now and be the bell cow. We don't have to put the pressure on that guy to do that, right or wrong. But when we pick that first pick, we want a guy that we feel can be a fine pro for a long time."
Marvin Lewis,He's got a lot of football ahead of him here.
Marvin Lewis,"We made a lot of mistakes. When you make a lot of mistakes, you can lose the football game. That's the way it is. We've said this before. It's medicine. It doesn't taste good, but it's good for you."
Marvin Lewis,Nah. It's not going to have any effect on who wins or loses the football game -- until somebody hits you in the mouth.
Marvin Lewis,"We have an opportunity to have a home playoff game in Cincinnati. We still have a lot of football to play, but it's time to stop hiding from it. It's time to go sit in the front row."
Marvin Lewis,We don't need to spout off. Let's play football.
Marvin Lewis,"It just tells you that we have a good football team, but we need to play good at all times or that's what's going to happen. We have enough good players and a team that has some resolve."
Marvin Lewis,"It's an exciting week for the city. For our football team, I'll keep them calm and let's just get ready to play the football game. But I think for everybody else it's going to be an exciting week."
Marvin Lewis,We have to win football games. I don't think Carson has to do anything different. The rest of us have to keep playing and coaching better. We just let him do his job. I think it's up to the rest of us.
Marvin Lewis,We are underdogs. We're underdogs every time we step on the field. Don't let anyone fool you. We're underdogs.
Marvin Lewis,I thought our offense did a good job of fighting through some early difficulties. But we have to do a better job of field position. That hurt us on both sides of the ball.
Marvin Lewis,"The 2005 season was a great learning experience for our franchise, our team and for me. We've established an evaluation process of free agents and college prospects. All we're going to do is get better and better at this."
Marvin Lewis,"As a player and a person, Carson has met and gone beyond every expectation I had for him. For myself as the head coach, I'm excited about the commitment the club has made to Carson, and about Carson's commitment to the organization and the city of Cincinnati."
Marvin Lewis,"As a player and a person, Carson has gone beyond every expectation I had for him."
Marvin Lewis,"As a player and a person, Carson has met and gone beyond every expectation I had for him. For myself as the head coach, I'm excited about the commitment the club has made to Carson and about Carson's commitment to the organization and to the city of Cincinnati."
Marvin Lewis,"Your expectation of them is, 'What is their niche?'"
Marvin Lewis,I was pleased with our execution. Guys went out there and carried out their assignments the way they're supposed to.
Marvin Lewis,"There was nothing flat about that, ... When you get punched in the face, that's what happens. That's an excuse: Flat didn't drop balls. Flat didn't miss assignments. Flat didn't commit penalties and miss tackles."
Marvin Lewis,"I have no doubt in my mind that it's time for our team to achieve success. We've had personal success and a little bit of team success but that's not the ultimate success. The only way to get the ultimate success is to become a football team totally. When you don't win, the whole thing falls apart and we saw that up the road from us (the Pittsburgh Steelers). They figured out a way to turn it around and get it righted. We saw a couple of years ago with Baltimore."
Marvin Lewis,"I think what he's been able to do is have a good plan for the team and set a direction -- set it on Wednesday and reinforce it throughout the week. Then, as the game unfolds, things that come up don't put them in a panic. They are able to stay the course."
Marvin Lewis,"You're a combination of all those things, but you learn that you have to set the direction, and I learned a lot of that from Bill. You always have to adjust, but you always have to have a starting point, as far as a direction, a game plan. It all ties together."
Marvin Lewis,To have Willie back now adds a sense of calmness and also determination. I think Willie and Rudi (Johnson) play off each other as far as their approach to the game.
Marvin Lewis,"He's just a phenomenal athlete and has very quick feet, good speed and he has the desire to catch the ball."
Marvin Lewis,"When you recruit in college, you do those things. Those are the things you think about. How you drive a guy around the city? What routes do you take? Where do you take him to show him? Do you involve the wife? Who's important to him? Who's going to help him make the decision? Those are all the things we talked about and were important for us to do, as we brought these guys to town. And I think that's helped us acquire the guys we have."
Marvin Lewis,"He's our guy, we drafted him, we like him. When we get him here, we'll coach him up."
Marvin Lewis,"Obviously you draft a player, (and) you really, really, really like the player. You really, really want to coach him."
Marvin Lewis,"I think it's the role of the offensive coordinator, the special teams coordinator and the defensive coordinator to coach the coaches as hard as he coaches the players. As hard as I push on them, they've got to push everybody else just as hard. I think that's important that they understand in and out that they set up, they push and make sure that the position coaches cover every detail or they cover it so that every detail gets covered."
Marvin Lewis,"For me, I can't believe,"
Marvin Lewis,We dug ourselves a hole with field position in the first half. We didn't play very well at the beginning of the game and we were playing up hill.
Marvin Lewis,We didn't play very well in the beginning of the game and were playing up hill.
Marvin Lewis,Our focus has been geared toward beginning our season better than we did the last two seasons. We get an opportunity here to write that script as we go week in and week out.
Marvin Lewis,They'll keep playing. We didn't play well at the beginning of the game and were playing uphill. But we kept playing and hanging in there together.
Marvin Lewis,It's unfortunate. We're not going to sit here and baby and cry like their quarterback did.
Marvin Lewis,"There was (the) ability for us to take advantage of some NFL cap numbers and rules if we got this completed in time. This is a foundation, and now we're able to move on and know where certain things are spent and allocated."
Marvin Lewis,He brings a lot of ability and character to our football team.
Marvin Lewis,"First of all, you must have the ability to run the football and take care of the ball offensively."
Ramsey Lewis,"They don't encourage quality today. When I was coming along, Columbia Records would sit with you and assume it would take two or three albums to get the act where it needed to be. Then the company would structure its promotion based on one, two or three years. They encouraged quality and innovation - that's why groups like the Beatles would use sitars, string orchestras and so forth."
Ramsey Lewis,"Our intention is to not only attract the hardcore jazz fan, but we're doing it in such a way that it will also be easy to take for those who are not necessarily steeped in the ways of jazz."
Ramsey Lewis,"It's corruption from the inside. Not thievery or mischievousness, but falling prey to needing money quickly to pay the execs and shareholders."
Ramsey Lewis,"I think that we have been able to come up with great content in terms of conversation and information. We're trying not to be a documentary, but have a more powerful conversation, and then an 'Oh, by the way, will you play?' sort of thing."
Rashard Lewis,"Offensively, I think we have enough talent to compete with any team in the league. But we have to step up our game defensively and stop teams. We haven't been getting stops when we need them in the fourth quarters. And that's why teams have been coming back on us. But I still think this team is capable of doing something special."
Rashard Lewis,I don't think we necessarily have to get rid of the whole team. Right now it's about pride. Are you going to give up or continue to play basketball and not let teams disrespect us? You have to be a man and stand up and that's what it's all about: stand up and play hard because we're NBA players.
Rashard Lewis,"We're all playing harder as a team. You can feel the intensity. Even in practice, we're going a lot harder and doing a lot more running. You can feel it the next morning when you're stiff and have a hard time getting out of bed."
Rashard Lewis,"It's little things that we're just not doing right. We're getting better in practice. We're in better shape, that's for sure. But in these games, all the progress we're making, it's not showing up."
Rashard Lewis,"Usually guys are counting the days down or planning out their vacation. With this team, if feels like we have 20 or 30 games left. We are playing like we are playing for something and that's the sign of a good basketball team. We're strictly business and the chemistry is coming along. It seems like we're headed in the right direction."
Rashard Lewis,It'll be different for people watching the game and for us a little bit. After Monday's game everything will go back to normal.
Rashard Lewis,"To have a successful team, a championship-caliber team, you have to spend money. You can't keep young guys. We've been a young team ever since I've been on the Sonics. ... And hopefully if they do sell the team, then we'll have an owner that's going to be able to do that for us."
Rashard Lewis,"You can't let the other four starters hurt you. Those guys are good players, too. It's not just about stopping Kobe, but it helps. But they have other dangerous guys on their team."
Rashard Lewis,"We got to get that hunger back. Last year is over with. It's a whole new ballgame. Nobody is going to feel sorry for us. We're not labeled as that sorry team anymore. We might be now, but we were a good team last year and we weren't when we started this year."
Rashard Lewis,"It's an honor to get the invitation, but I don't want to go through a training camp and get cut. I think that would really hurt my feelings."
Rashard Lewis,"He just threw up. About four guys ate some bad chicken last night, Nick [Collison] went home to be with his girl who's having a baby and the other guys got traded. I'm the only one here."
Rashard Lewis,It seemed like they weren't playing hard and [were] just kind of going through the motions.
Rashard Lewis,"To be successful, you've got to have a guy like Chris, not only to win more games, but to get to the next level."
Rashard Lewis,"I think it's going to let us know where we stand, these back-to-back games."
Rashard Lewis,"He just wants to win games and he knows they've had an up-and-down season. They're above.500 now, and I think he's trying to keep it that way. His main focus is getting that team to the playoffs, and he's just trying to win games."
Rashard Lewis,"I'm not going to say this is getting old because we've still got a lot of games to play. If you start giving up, then it's going to be a long season and we're going to continue to get our (butts) kicked."
Rashard Lewis,"I'm pretty sure I will be playing. It still hurts, it's still tight, but I will be wearing a football pad. Just try to get it loose before the game and see if I can go these last two games before the All-Star break."
Rashard Lewis,We did well in not hanging our heads and kept fighting.
Rashard Lewis,We said at halftime that the first one to play defense was going to win the ballgame. We gave up a lot of points in the first half and we felt like we had to step it up on the defensive end.
Rashard Lewis,We talked about it at halftime and said the first team to play defense was going to win this game.
Rashard Lewis,The first team to start playing defense was going to win the ball game. I thought both teams did a bad job of playing defense. We had to start making some stops.
Rashard Lewis,It feels good because we're getting the confidence that we can win close games.
Rashard Lewis,"Sometimes I think about what it would be like if I played college ball. This time of year is special for basketball. All I think about is close games, buzzer-beaters and games that you remember."
Rashard Lewis,"Things are lot different now. He's more of a disciplined, in-your-face type coach. It's something we needed. I feel like we were a little too relaxed around here."
Rashard Lewis,"I don't believe that anybody quit, I really don't; it was just that we had tired legs and maybe couldn't do some of the things that we wanted to. We've been going at it pretty hard with no let-up. ... At some point, that's going to take its toll."
Rashard Lewis,"Pretty much from the beginning of the season until now, guys were unhappy. They wanted to get traded, they didn't want to be in this situation and they wanted to be out of here. I thought it was more of a domino effect for the whole team; that's why we're having the type of season we're having."
Rashard Lewis,He just respects the game of basketball.
Ray Lewis,"A linebacker's job is to knock out running backs, to knock out receivers, to chase the football,"
Ray Lewis,"The things we did give up were just some miscommunication, but that's football. The important thing is we didn't give up a touchdown."
Ray Lewis,"Nobody's more serious about health and fitness than me and staying fit is my top priority, ... That's why I've teamed up with Medifast ... to bring my fans a line of products that are packed with everything the body needs to get in better shape and improve their health. I use the products every day as part of my training."
Ray Lewis,"There are soldiers fighting in Iraq right now that love the game of football. They don't want to turn the TV on every day and listen to the Philadelphia Eagles and Terrell Owens' saga. We're covering the Philadelphia Eagles more than we're covering the New England Patriots, and they're the Super Bowl champions."
Ray Lewis,"There are soldiers fighting in Iraq right now that love the game of football, ... They don't want to turn the TV on every day and listen to the Philadelphia Eagles and Terrell Owens' saga. We're covering the Philadelphia Eagles more than we're covering the New England Patriots, and they're the Super Bowl champions."
Ray Lewis,"Our defense did some great things once again today, ... They made less mistakes in the officials' eyes than we did. Take it for what you want to take it."
Ray Lewis,Terrell has got some big balls.
Stephen Lewis,There's relief the immediate sense of alarm over Japan has passed. Yesterday there was genuine worry Japan's stock market could go into meltdown.
Stephen Lewis,"There are several hundred billion dollars of positions in the carry trade that will be unwound as soon as they become unprofitable. When the Bank of Japan starts tightening we may see some spectacular effects. The world has never been through this before, so there is a high risk of mistakes."
Stephen Lewis,A trial of strength may be emerging on the ECB monetary council between the Frankfurt-based board and the representatives of some of the central banks.
Stephen Lewis,"A trial of strength may be emerging on the ECB monetary council between the Frankfurt-based board and the representatives of some of the central banks,"
Stephen Lewis,Sterling's performance will probably prove the decisive factor.
Stephen Lewis,The situation of people living and dying with AIDS in parts of Africa is so desperate that even the most basic help will bring solace and hope
Stephen Lewis,"There is no question in my mind that the condom crisis in Uganda is being driven and exacerbated by PEPFAR and by the extreme policies that the administration in the U.S. is now pursuing in the emphasis on abstinence,"
Stephen Lewis,"There is no doubt in my mind that the condom crisis in Uganda is being driven by (U.S. programs), ... To impose a dogma-driven policy that is fundamentally flawed is doing damage to Africa."
Stephen Lewis,"If the funds are not there you compromise treatment, care and prevention and compromising these means compromising millions of lives on the African continent."
Stephen Lewis,"There's a steadily diminishing lack of commitment on the part of the world to release money for the Global Fund,"
Stephen Lewis,"One is that if women's sexuality in Africa wasn't under assault, if women were able to say no, if women weren't subject to predatory attacks by men, or predatory behaviour generally, then you would have a disease in Africa called AIDS. But you wouldn't have a pandemic."
Stephen Lewis,"Men haven't changed their behaviour, so women somehow have to be strengthened to be able to ward off the men."
Stephen Lewis,"I was working for the Socialist International, after I left university in 1959, as a researcher."
Stephen Lewis,"I learned later, just as a footnote, that the World Assembly of Youth was a CIA front."
Stephen Lewis,"Unless there is recognition that women are most vulnerable... and you do something about social and cultural equality for women, you're never going to defeat this pandemic."
Stephen Lewis,The pandemic of AIDS is a gender-based disease.
Stephen Lewis,It is always the village women who drive these things.
Stephen Lewis,The United Nations has a lot of capacity on the ground.
Stephen Lewis,I'm still at the end of my rope because I find myself not handling things well when I travel.
Stephen Lewis,"It gives one hope, this great strength of Africa."
Stephen Lewis,"I think when you've travelled around a lot in Africa, you understand something that many people here don't recognize: the extraordinary power that is Africa at village level - at community level."
Stephen Lewis,"Truthfully, when I see what we can accomplish with money on the ground, it's the only time in my life I have wished I was Bill Gates."
Stephen Lewis,"I'm in a great rage now, as I understand how many lives we have lost."
Stephen Lewis,"All I know is that every time I go to Africa, I am shaken to my core."
Stephen Lewis,But I don't want to leave until I see the breakthrough.
Stephen Lewis,"And I went off to Ghana for what was intended to be seven days. I spent what was well over a year in Africa, teaching and travelling."
Stephen Lewis,"Young women, adolescent girls, are more subject to infection, sometimes at a rate of six times that of boys. That tells you a lot about the vulnerability of women."
Tommy Lewis,I kept telling myself I didn't do it. But I knew I had. I know I'll be hearing about this the rest of my life.
Tommy Lewis,"It's something that I feel makes us a better team not just on the field but also in team chemistry and camaraderie. Even though it's football related, it's time that they wouldn't normally be spending together, so the relationships between the guys are definitely accentuated and deepened."
Tommy Lewis,"I think it's going to continue to grow. I think there is a group of students who are really embracing the sport and a group of parents, who might not have made up their minds about letting their kids wrestle at first, who are embracing the sport now, too."
Tommy Lewis,"The neat thing about it was the seniors kind of stepped up and said we needed to have some more consequences for mistakes, because they didn't feel like just doing a play over was good enough. The best thing about it is that it came from them."
Sol LeWitt,"When artists make art, they shouldn't question whether it is permissible to do one thing or another."
Sol LeWitt,"Unless you're involved with thinking about what you're doing, you end up doing the same thing over and over, and that becomes tedious and, in the end, defeating."
Sol LeWitt,The thinking of John Cage derived from Duchamp and Dada. I was not interested in that.
Sol LeWitt,The system is the work of art; the visual work of art is the proof of the System. The visual aspect can't be understood without understanding the system. It isn't what it looks like but what it is that is of basic importance.
Sol LeWitt,"The other great development has been in photography, but that too was influenced by Conceptual art."
Sol LeWitt,The narrative of serial art works more like music than like literature.
Sol LeWitt,"The artist is seen like a producer of commodities, like a factory that turns our refrigerators."
Sol LeWitt,Minimalism wasn't a real idea - it ended before it started.
Sol LeWitt,"Just as the development of earth art and installation art stemmed from the idea of taking art out of the galleries, the basis of my involvement with public art is a continuation of wall drawings."
Sol LeWitt,"In my case, I used the elements of these simple forms - square, cube, line and color - to produce logical systems. Most of these systems were finite; that is, they were complete using all possible variations. This kept them simple."
Sol LeWitt,I was not interested in irony; I wanted to emphasize the primacy of the idea in making art.
Sol LeWitt,"I didn't want to save art - I respected the older artists too much to think art needed saving. But I knew it was finished, even though, at that time, I didn't know what I would do."
Sol LeWitt,I believe that the artist's involvement in the capitalist structure is disadvantageous to the artist and forces him to produce objects in order to live.
Sol LeWitt,"I became interested in making books, starting about 1965, when I did the Serial Project #1, deciding that I needed a small book to show how the work could be understood and how the system worked."
Sol LeWitt,Every generation renews itself in its own way; there's always a reaction against whatever is standard.
Sol LeWitt,During the '70s I was interested in words and meaning as a way of making art.
Sol LeWitt,Conceptual art became the liberating idea that gave the art of the next 40 years its real impetus.
Sol LeWitt,Buying books was a way anyone could acquire a work of art for very little.
Sol LeWitt,Artists teach critics what to think. Critics repeat what the artists teach them.
Sol LeWitt,"Also, since art is a vehicle for the transmission of ideas through form, the reproduction of the form only reinforces the concept. It is the idea that is being reproduced. Anyone who understands the work of art owns it. We all own the Mona Lisa."
Sol LeWitt,A blind man can make art if what is in his mind can be passed to another mind in some tangible form.
Sol LeWitt,Artists of many diverse types began using simple forms to their own ends.
Sol LeWitt,You shouldn't be a prisoner of your own ideas.
Sol LeWitt,Minimal art went nowhere.
Tom Leykis,"[Commenting on the Seattle debut of] Boys Night Out, ... I'm looking forward to providing the men of Seattle with an evening where they can kick back, light up a cigar and enjoy a night to themselves. Women, we can't technically keep you out, but please stay at home."
Tom Leykis,There's a difference... between the kind of woman you would bang and the kind of woman you would marry.
Tom Leykis,"I'm looking forward to providing the men of Seattle with an evening where they can kick back, light up a cigar and enjoy a night to themselves. Women, we can't technically keep you out, but please stay at home."
Tom Leykis,There really is no Johnny Carson anymore. There is no one place a comedian can appear and explode.
Jim Leyland,One thing I'm not going to go through (is) worry about having to take Carlos out after five innings of every game. I would consider other options.
Jim Leyland,"If I was an infielder and I was having a little trouble, I'd at least say hello to the guy. If you're a major league outfielder and you've got Al Kaline and Andy Van Slyke standing there, I'd have to think you might have a question for them at some point."
Jim Leyland,"I didn't know what to expect. I knew there was talent here. But we still have a long way to go. We've got some kids, but we're getting better."
Jim Leyland,He's still in the process of harnessing some of that talent.
Jim Leyland,"He's got talent. Now it's crude, don't get me wrong, and I'm not trying to push the process along. He's just a kid. They (the Tigers' minor league staff) have something to work with."
Jim Leyland,He looked like his old self. That's the thing I'm happiest about.
Jim Leyland,"It starts with relationships in the clubhouse -- building camaraderie. I'm seeing that start to happen a little bit, and I like it. I want everybody talking to everybody, I want everybody kidding with everybody, I want everybody believing in everybody."
Jim Leyland,He had nasty stuff. I'm very pleased. He's making progress.
Jim Leyland,"He's taking good swings, and he's swinging at more strikes. He's showing a little bit more patience at the plate and not chasing bad balls like he was a little earlier in the season."
Jim Leyland,"He's working hard. He looks good. His frame of mind, I think, is real good. I'm real proud of him. I'm very happy with him."
Jim Leyland,What would you think about living in Detroit?
Jim Leyland,"He was a little more tender than normal. This is not anything significant, to our knowledge."
Jim Leyland,It's not anything significant to my knowledge.
Jim Leyland,"The thing I'm happy about is he's in the strike zone hitting and he's doing one (heck) of a job with our pitchers. That's the thing I'm happiest about. I know he's going to get his hits, but right now he's handling that pitching perfect."
Jim Leyland,Tremendous execution. A lot of good things happened on that play for us.
Jim Leyland,"We need our veterans to set an example, like being the first ones there. A veteran is entitled to a bigger paycheck, but not a special set of rules."
Jim Leyland,I doubt there's going to be anyone who pitches himself off the team. It's not a matter of statistics.
Jim Leyland,"This is just the perfect example of a very talented player with a lot of determination. He's a manager's dream-type player. Not only does he come to the park to beat the other team, but he does the little things to beat the other team. To a manager, he's a real delight."
Jim Leyland,"I don't like to make rash decisions when you have something bad like that happen. You're better off to just take your time, don't panic, think it out and then make a decision."
Jim Leyland,"I think if you've got any common sense at all, you watched the way he worked in Spring Training and the way he got off the mound to field balls. If I were them, I'd watch. Kenny shouldn't have to go around and talk to them about it. All they should have to do is observe."
Jim Leyland,"Jeremy was not going to see the ninth inning under any circumstances. To me, that's why we got Todd Jones."
Jim Leyland,"Jeremy was not going to see the middle of the order again, under any circumstances. You can't get caught up in that stuff. That's exactly why we got Todd Jones."
Jim Leyland,"We have a lot choices, and he's certainly one of those choices. Whoever's in that fifth spot is probably going to be a younger guy."
Jim Leyland,"I missed the trick. Some of them were jumping back [on grounders], and I don't blame them."
Jim Leyland,"He just got some balls up. He'll be fine. He's a young pitcher. He'll have growing pains - couple on, couple off. We can live with that."
Jim Leyland,"You gotta look at the other side of the coin. We got the (balls) up and had 11 runs or something and held them to three, then obviously, your pitching had to do a pretty decent job today."
Jim Leyland,"These guys were raised too good. Hey, I don't want guys who won't sign balls for a kid, or who give the front office (flak), or a guy who's not a good human being. I want good people representing the Detroit Tigers organization, too. But I want a different animal, which is the best way to put it. I want to see that mean streak when we go compete."
Jim Leyland,"It was one of those days when they centered some balls off Kenny, and a few that didn't that found holes. That's what happened to us during our streak."
Jet Li,"No matter Fearless is warmly received or not, I hope young Chinese generation can appreciate it from the point of the world rather than being confined to the Chinese culture and movie. It is a narrow idea that Chinese Kong Fu must defeat all the foreigners."
Jet Li,"My personal philosophy stems from the deep understanding of martial arts and Chinese culture, and especially in the past eight years, the Buddhism thoughts shaped my ideology."
Jet Li,"I believe the world is one big family, and we need to help each other."
Robin Li,Over the past six years I've had many difficulties. But I never lost my passion.
Robin Li,Being able to speak the language of Silicon Valley to venture capitalists is very important.
Robin Li,"We achieved robust earnings growth while making significant investments in search technology, products, network capacity, sales and distribution, and most importantly, in people."
Daniel Libeskind,"I think there is a new awareness in this 21st century that design is as important to where and how we live as it is for museums, concert halls and civic buildings,"
Daniel Libeskind,"I think there is a new awareness in this 21st century that design is as important to where and how we live as it is for museums, concert halls and civic buildings."
Daniel Libeskind,To provide meaningful architecture is not to parody history but to articulate it.
Daniel Libeskind,Cities are the greatest creations of humanity.
Roy Lichtenstein,I don't think of form as a kind of architecture. The architecture is the result of the forming. It is the kinesthetic and visual sense of position and wholeness that puts the thing into the realm of art.
Roy Lichtenstein,"You know, as you compose music, you're just off in your own world. You have no idea where reality is, so to have an idea of what people think is pretty hard."
Roy Lichtenstein,"Yes, you know sometimes, we started out thinking out how strange our painting was next to normal painting, which was anything expressionist. You forget that this has been thirty five years now and people don't look at it as if it were some kind of oddity."
Roy Lichtenstein,"Pop Art looks out into the world. It doesn't look like a painting of something, it looks like the thing itself."
Roy Lichtenstein,"Personally, I feel that in my own work I wanted to look programmed or impersonal but I don't really believe I am being impersonal when I do it. And I don't think you could do this."
Roy Lichtenstein,In America the biggest is the best.
Roy Lichtenstein,"I'm not really sure what social message my art carries, if any. And I don't really want it to carry one. I'm not interested in the subject matter to try to teach society anything, or to try to better our world in any way."
Roy Lichtenstein,I'm interested in what would normally be considered the worst aspects of commercial art. I think it's the tension between what seems to be so rigid and cliched and the fact that art really can't be this way.
Roy Lichtenstein,"I think we're much smarter than we were. Everybody knows that abstract art can be art, and most people know that they may not like it, even if they understand there's another purpose to it."
Roy Lichtenstein,"I think that most people think painters are kind of ridiculous, you know?"
Roy Lichtenstein,"I suppose I would still prefer to sit under a tree with a picnic basket rather than under a gas pump, but signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter."
Roy Lichtenstein,"I kind of do the drawing with the painting in mind, but it's very hard to guess at a size or a color and all the colors around it and what it will really look like."
Roy Lichtenstein,"But when I worked on a painting I would do it from a drawing but I would put certain things I was fairly sure I wanted in the painting, and then collage on the painting with printed dots or painted paper or something before I really committed it."
Roy Lichtenstein,"But usually I begin things through a drawing, so a lot of things are worked out in the drawing. But even then, I still allow for and want to make changes."
Roy Lichtenstein,"But certainly the Abstract Expressionists were in a more romantic mode of painting, or give and take, than my paintings are seen to be anyway."
Roy Lichtenstein,"Yeah, you know, you like it to come on like gangbusters, but you get into passages that are very interesting and subtle, and sometimes your original intent changes quite a bit."
Roy Lichtenstein,"There is a relationship between cartooning and people like Mir= and Picasso which may not be understood by the cartoonist, but it definitely is related even in the early Disney."
Roy Lichtenstein,"Picasso's always been such a huge influence that I thought when I started the cartoon paintings that I was getting away from Picasso, and even my cartoons of Picasso were done almost to rid myself of his influence."
Roy Lichtenstein,I don't have big anxieties. I wish I did. I'd be much more interesting.
Roy Lichtenstein,I don't think that I'm over his influence but they probably don't look like Picassos; Picasso himself would probably have thrown up looking at my pictures.
Roy Lichtenstein,In America the biggest is the best
Roy Lichtenstein,I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me.
Roy Lichtenstein,Art doesn't transform. It just plain forms.
Warren Lichtenstein,"We made our commitment to KT&G because we are confident in the strong potential of this company. If the CEO is not willing to consider our proposals as investors, we have no choice but to continue to seek election of our nominees."
Warren Lichtenstein,"We believe such a decision, without justifiable reason, infringes our statutory right to submit shareholder proposals."
Warren Lichtenstein,The company's ability to designate the number of directors up for election ... disenfranchises shareholders.
Gordon Liddy,"If I can go from burglar for the government to talk show host, you can go from entertainer to congressman."
Gordon Liddy,"Obviously crime pays, or there'd be no crime."
Gordon Liddy,Why is it there are so many more horses' asses than there are horses?
Gordon Liddy,The press is like the peculiar uncle you keep in the attic - just one of those unfortunate things.
Nicklas Lidstrom,"We had some pressure on us, and I thought we responded. It's good to get past this hurdle."
Nicklas Lidstrom,"Sweden and Finland, that's huge. We've had great battles in the past."
Nicklas Lidstrom,"I did get a good night's sleep last night, so I think I'm getting close to being back to normal now. It's good to be back in your own house and your own bed and seeing all the family again."
Nicklas Lidstrom,"He's very strong around the net, very strong on the puck. He's good at getting rebounds, goals in close, so we know he's going to be battling in front of the net all series."
Nicklas Lidstrom,"We wanted to have a quick, good start. We had a perfect start. We got two quick goals and spent a lot of time in their end."
Nicklas Lidstrom,We're playing real strong in our own end. We're not giving up a lot of shots and Manny only has to make one save and we're clearing the rebound.
Nicklas Lidstrom,"I played a few pre-season games with him in Detroit, so we've played together before. You just have to read off one another."
Nicklas Lidstrom,"The last two games, he's played strong. He looked confident in there."
Nicklas Lidstrom,"He's a great captain. He leads by example, especially in the playoffs, you can see that, the way he goes out and battles, plays hard. He doesn't say a whole lot, but when he says something, I think the whole team listens to him."
Joseph Lieberman,not to worry about his votes.
Joseph Lieberman,The moment of truth has arrived for Saddam Hussein.
Joseph Lieberman,"That can't go on. We're inviting trouble if it does go on,"
Joseph Lieberman,"I support such a review, ... But the reality is that we don't need the results of a strategic study to know that there are some pressing problems in our military that demand our attention and our assistance now."
Joseph Lieberman,"Based on my initial review, I don't believe that this situation qualifies as an emergency under the National Labor Relations Act because it does not affect an entire industry. Nor is it likely that the president would find that it imperils the national health or safety, which are the qualifications necessary to invoke the national emergency provisions under the act."
Joseph Lieberman,"We don't know enough to know whether any of that influence in any way stopped the administration or agencies of our federal government from protecting average shareholders who lost their life savings when Enron collapsed, ... That's the question we're going to ask."
Joseph Lieberman,I also know that there have been many times in our history when the proximity of an election has induced exactly the kind of leadership and consensus-building that produce progress in our democracy.
Joseph Lieberman,"I hate to see that, but maybe if we're successful with our efforts to bring the president back together with his EPA administrator."
Joseph Lieberman,"I know this man is a person of extraordinary values and vision, committed to his family and his faith, and If I can help the American people see that side of him, then I'll feel very proud about the role in the campaign,"
Joseph Lieberman,"What [the committee] found was systemic and catastrophic failure across the board. Despite the magnitude of Enron's implosion, no one in the system that was supposed to protect investors saw the disaster coming or did anything about it."
Joseph Lieberman,"What [the committee] found was systemic and catastrophic failure across the board, ... Despite the magnitude of Enron's implosion, no one in the system that was supposed to protect investors saw the disaster coming or did anything about it."
Joseph Lieberman,"Today, we can see with our own eyes what global warming is doing. In that context it becomes truly irresponsible, if not immoral, for us not to do something."
Joseph Lieberman,"The promise of education reform can never be fulfilled without adequate funding, and by shortchanging our schools, President Bush is breaking his promise to our children."
Joseph Lieberman,"The danger of terrorists and rogue states is compounded by the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons."
Joseph Lieberman,at a crisis stage.
Joseph Lieberman,"I hope that the president and I hope the leadership of Congress will, before the end of this year, schedule a debate in which we will grant President Bush authority to take action to remove Saddam Hussein,"
Joseph Lieberman,"In this era of uncertainty and conflict, the United States - blessed with the world's strongest military, most ingenious economy, and most tolerant society - remains a model and leader to the world."
Joseph Lieberman,"If we produce separate agendas, we risk conflict and a fragmented approach. But if we work together, our chances of achieving success multiply."
Joseph Lieberman,"As policymakers - and as parents - we have a responsibility to examine the effects of media on our children, a responsibility this legislation can better enable us to fulfill. No one is looking out, in a systematic way, for cumulative impact of today's newer electronic media on our children."
Joseph Lieberman,"And honestly, we don't know yet whether ... we should blame the president, Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Tripp, Judge Starr or the media -- or all of them, to some extent."
Joseph Lieberman,"Clearly appointing a homeland coordinator with only advisory authority is not enough. We need a robust agency to carry out the core functions of homeland defense,"
Joseph Lieberman,"In this campaign, I've put forward a strong, positive vision for America, and that stands in sharp contrast to what Howard Dean offers America today,"
Joseph Lieberman,"It is time for President Bush to deal with the fiscal crisis facing America, but cutting education is the wrong way to fix it."
Joseph Lieberman,"Oh, great for the state. Great for America, but this would have been a terrible blow to our state economically."
Joseph Lieberman,There is no agreement at this point.
Joseph Lieberman,apparently had extramarital relations with an employee half his age and did so in the workplace in the vicinity of the Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate. It is immoral.
Joseph Lieberman,"It's one of the most exciting medical findings of our age, ... Late Edition."
Joseph Lieberman,"We need to rebuild the confidence of the American people ... in our government's ability to protect them from attack, whether it comes from nature or from terrorists, ... The government simply did not act quickly and effectively enough."
Wendy Liebman,"My mother always said don't marry for money, divorce for money"
Wendy Liebman,"I found out why cats drink out of the toilet. My mother told me it's because the water is cold in there. And I'm like, how did my mother know that?"
Wendy Liebman,"I've been on so many blind dates, I should get a free dog."
Wendy Liebman,"My mother always said don't marry for money, divorce for money."
Alex Lifeson,"When Neil called, I have to say that my heart soared. And the reason really was because it said so much about his recovery -- that he was coming back to the world of the living. I mean, even if he wasn't really ready for it, he was making an attempt, and there was that little faint light in him that was glowing again."
Alex Lifeson,"I think that's given inspiration to other musicians. I know, particularly through the 90s, a lot of bands would cite Rush as an influence. I don't think it was so much our music, but more the way we really stuck to our guns."
Alex Lifeson,"You know, we have a long history of covering different periods of this band's development with a live record... a sort of live thing that would be done for three or four records, and that was the intention with this particular package."
Alex Lifeson,"When we signed our deal in 1974, we'd already been together for six years. When they lowered the drinking age in Ontario in 1971 to 18 years, we went from playing two or three high schools in a month to playing clubs two or three times a week."
Alex Lifeson,"When I look out at the audience at some of our shows, I think we are reaching a younger audience... I see lots of people in their 30s and 40s, but I also see a lot of people in their young and middle teens, and that's definitely reassuring."
Alex Lifeson,"Well, I stand by that comment, I think a couple of years ago, I think we all felt the same way, we weren't sure wanted to release another live record."
Alex Lifeson,"We've managed to have a long career that is still quite vibrant, yet we've never had to kow-tow to record companies who said we weren't commercial enough."
Alex Lifeson,"The shock of any trauma, I think changes your life. It's more acute in the beginning and after a little time you settle back to what you were. However it leaves an indelible mark on your psyche."
Alex Lifeson,"Rush has never been a spontaneous group. We may be spontaneous in our writing, we may be spontaneous as individuals in our day to day lives... certainly I think am and always have been, but I think when it comes to Rush and our presentation of our music it's quite controlled."
Alex Lifeson,Not particularly... the reason is because we made a promise to ourselves years ago that whatever we did in the studio we would try to recapture live.
Alex Lifeson,"If there was any one achievement, it would be that we've have done it on our own terms."
Alex Lifeson,"I'd say we do reach somewhat of a younger audience, but I think for the most part that younger audience is picking our music up from a brother or sister or even parent, who is turning them onto the band."
Alex Lifeson,I think we're quite unique in that we do have our own sound and approach and we don't really care what's going on elsewhere... we've never wanted to be part of another trend or movement.
Alex Lifeson,"I mean, you go to the internet and you can see all these conversations and arguments that our fans have about our music and that's wonderful to know, that people would take the time to be that involved."
Alex Lifeson,"Certainly after the tragedy in Neil's life, we were holding out hope for his recovery. It wasn't too promising at the time and obviously you get to the point of thinking that that is it."
Alex Lifeson,"But when Neil called, I have to say that my heart soared. And the reason was, because it said so much about his recovery... that he was coming back to the world of the living."
Alex Lifeson,"But I think the credit has to go to Geddy... he spent a lot of time in the studio with Paul, I think he needed that kind of focus to be in there to be a part of the whole thing, and for the most part he made all the major decisions."
Alex Lifeson,"Both Neil and I had done solo projects where we were the boss and I just thought that if he was willing to get into it, it would really be a good experience for him."
Alex Lifeson,"And on top of that, when we work together we have a wonderful working relationship we push each other we challenge each other we laugh 80% of the time that we are together we're very fortunate."
Ted Ligety,It's a great day. I wish I didn't make that mistake. I was charging the whole way down. I was a bit surprised to have such a good time. With that kind of mistake I didn't expect that. But I need to get those (mistakes) out of my skiing and then maybe I can beat this guy Giorgio Rocca.
Ted Ligety,"I still have one gold, so I'm not so mad."
Ted Ligety,"Part of it was the snow was slicker than we expected and part of it was Olympic jitters - guys are going for it. I still have one gold, so I'm not mad."
Ted Ligety,The way he skis is definitely impossible. At the same time it's tough to come in and win every single race you enter. It's just a tough expectation to have.
Paul Light,"They've already surpassed their available resources. That's a warning sign that $2 billion figure is going to be hard to reach, ... It is not like Sept. 11, in the sense that there's this great reservoir of continued support."
Paul Light,There are a number of offices where you just can't afford a steep learning curve and you need somebody who is able to move quickly and make sharp policy decisions.
Paul Light,The scandal isn't greed in the nonprofit sector. The scandal is under-investment in our own organizations. We're not ready to respond to the uncertainties out there.
Paul Light,"A lot of governments are woefully ill-prepared. If you haven't been contacted by your local government about disaster plans, that's a good sign your government isn't ready."
Paul Light,"We're not in a 'what' crisis, we are in a 'how' crisis,"
Paul Light,Our research shows that Americans are over-confident in the ability of government to respond.
Paul Light,Our research shows that Americans are over-confident in the ability of government to respond. But there are many highly probable scenarios that involve an almost complete breakdown of social order. Katrina showed us that all those structures we depend on can be swept away.
Gordon Lightfoot,"Turning back the pages of my sweet shattered dream, I wonder if she'll ever do the same; And the thing that I call living is just being satisfied With knowing I've got no one left to blame."
Gordon Lightfoot,"I'm not really a bird person or an Audubon guy who studies them, but as I was around them, they interested me."
Gordon Lightfoot,"I try to keep it light and positive most of the time, whereas earlier on I didn't always do that."
Gordon Lightfoot,"I know that we're being inexorably taken over by the Americans. Without a doubt. I don't mean invaded or anything like that, just taken over. By degrees."
Gordon Lightfoot,I don't think they should regulate the music field. I don't see how they can regulate the arts.
Gordon Lightfoot,All that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.
Gordon Lightfoot,You just get the vibes of your surroundings and it rubs off on you.
Dennis Lillee,"They should start at the very top when assessing what went wrong in England. Cricket Australia executives, the coach, the manager, the captain and support staff must be all held accountable for this disaster."
Dennis Lillee,Australia was ambushed by England because way too many people right across the board were living in a comfort zone. The first priority is to appoint a captain who can lead from the front.
Dennis Lillee,"I got the distinct impression Warne was the pseudo-captain during the fifth Test. There is no doubt Warne has an amazing cricket brain - but not only that, any cricket he plays is full of passion, (courage) and determination."
Bob Lilly,"I think when you are the parents of a gifted athlete, the best thing in the world you can do is to encourage them, in my opinion. My dad didn't push me and I didn't push my children in athletics."
Bob Lilly,"I attribute my entire football career, as far as getting me started, getting me interested, keeping me that way was my father. He went to every game even though he was crippled and wasn't real healthy."
Bob Lilly,"Today, free agency takes away a lot of your heroes, they go somewhere else. Some of them don't but a lot of them do-take the higher offer to go somewhere else. And, it turns the fans off because they get attached to the players."
Bob Lilly,"I think Jim Taylor was very underrated, never hear much about him. We played Green Bay every year in exhibition, and generally we played them every couple of years in regular season. And I always thought he was a fierce competitor."
Bob Lilly,"We started playing the Baltimore Colts early, and I was still very impressed with Johnny Unitas, who just passed away recently. I thought he was one of the best quarterbacks at the time when I was very young, he was in his prime."
Bob Lilly,"Some of the money going to the rookies can now be spent on people who have proved their worth. After all, the average playing life of a pro football player is about eight years and it is only fitting that the veterans get something for their efforts."
Adriana Lima,"Modeling is a tough job, your co-workers are your rivals, it really puts a damper on your perspective of other girls."
Adriana Lima,"Fashion is about good energy. Its about feelings. Thats what I have to give the people, good energy and good feelings."

Sondhi Limthongkul,"Please tell the police if they want to arrest us, just issue a warrant since I am not running away."
Sondhi Limthongkul,"Please, as many as possible come to join force to ask His Majesty to give us an impartial government."
Sondhi Limthongkul,"We have no fear. If the government declare state of emergency, they can arrest us. However we are ready to be arrested."
Sondhi Limthongkul,This guy does not believe in democracy. This guy believes in amassing wealth.
Sondhi Limthongkul,This crisis has come to a deadlock that could seriously impact the economy. All of us here see no any other solution without loss of life.
Sondhi Limthongkul,"The crisis has reached an impasse. We, the king's subjects, see no other way out in resolving the crisis without causing bloodshed."
Maya Lin,"We, as a species, never understood how we have changed [the environment]."
Maya Lin,"You should be having more fun in high school, exploring things because you want to explore them and learning because you love learning-not worrying about competition."
Maya Lin,"You have to let the viewers come away with their own conclusions. If you dictate what they should think, you've lost it."
Maya Lin,"You have to have conviction and completely question everything and anything you do. No matter how much you study, no matter how much you know, the side of your brain that has the smarts won't necessarily help you in making art."
Maya Lin,You couldn't put me in a social group setting. I'm probably a terrible anarchist deep down.
Maya Lin,"When I was very little, we would get letters from China, in Chinese, and they' be censored. We were a very insular little family."
Maya Lin,We were unusually brought up; there was no gender differentiation. I was never thought of as any less than my brother.
Maya Lin,"To me, the American Dream is being able to follow your own personal calling. To be able to do what you want to do is incredible freedom."
Maya Lin,The role of art in society differs for every artist.
Maya Lin,"The process I go through in the art and the architecture, I actually want it to be almost childlike. Sometimes I think it's magical."
Maya Lin,"The only thing that mattered was what you were to do in life, and it wasn't about money. It was about teaching, or learning."
Maya Lin,Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think.
Maya Lin,Some artists want to confront. Some want to invoke thought. They're all necessary and they're all valid.
Maya Lin,Our parents decided not to teach us Chinese. It was an era when they felt we would be better off if we didn't have that complication.
Maya Lin,"OK, it was black, it was below grade, I was female, Asian American, young, too young to have served. Yet I think none of the opposition in that sense hurt me."
Maya Lin,"Nothing is ever guaranteed, and all that came before doesn't predicate what you might do next."
Maya Lin,"My parents are both college professors, and it made me want to question authority, standards and traditions."
Maya Lin,"My grandfather, on my father's side, helped to draft one of the first constitutions of China. He was a fairly well-known scholar."
Maya Lin,My goal is to strip things down so that you need just the right amount of words or shape to convey what you need to convey. I like editing. I like it very tight.
Maya Lin,My dad was dean of fine arts at the university. I was casting bronzes in the school foundry. I was using the university as a playground.
Maya Lin,"Math, it's a puzzle to me. I love figuring out puzzles."
Maya Lin,It's only in hindsight that you realize what indeed your childhood was really like.
Maya Lin,"It's funny, as you live through something you're not aware of it."
Maya Lin,"In art or architecture your project is only done when you say it's done. If you want to rip it apart at the eleventh hour and start all over again, you never finish. I was one of those crazy creatures."
Maya Lin,I'm not in a hurry to do a lot of projects. I am very resolved in each project I take on.
Maya Lin,"I went through withdrawal when I got out of graduate school. It's what you learn, what you think. That's all that counts."
Maya Lin,"I was probably the first kid in my high school to go to Yale. I applied almost as a lark. Then, when I got there, I was the dumbest person in your class."
Maya Lin,"I was always making things. Even though art was what I did every day, it didn't even occur to me that I would be an artist."
Maya Lin,I had very few friends. We always ate dinner with our parents. We didn't want to go out. American adolescence was a lot wilder than I would have felt comfortable with.
Maya Lin,Every memorial in its time has a different goal.
Maya Lin,"Even though I build buildings and I pursue my architecture, I pursue it as an artist. I deliberately keep a tiny studio. I don't want to be an architectural firm. I want to remain an artist."
Maya Lin,Art is very tricky because it's what you do for yourself. It's much harder for me to make those works than the monuments or the architecture.
Maya Lin,All my work is much more peaceful than I am.
Maya Lin,"A lot of my works deal with a passage, which is about time. I don't see anything that I do as a static object in space. It has to exist as a journey in time."
Maya Lin,"I really enjoyed hanging out with some of the teachers. This one chemistry teacher, she liked hanging out. I liked making explosives. We would stay after school and blow things up."
Maya Lin,Sometimes you have to stop thinking. Sometimes you shut down completely. I think that's true in any creative field.
Maya Lin,"I probably spent the first 20 years of my life wanting to be as American as possible. Through my 20s, and into my 30s, I began to become aware of how so much of my art and architecture has a decidedly Eastern character."
Maya Lin,I probably have fundamentally antisocial tendencies. I never took one extracurricular activity. I just failed utterly at that level. Part of me still rebels against that.
Maya Lin,I loved school. I studied like crazy. I was a Class A nerd.
Maya Lin,"I loved logic, math, computer programming. I loved systems and logic approaches. And so I just figured architecture is this perfect combination."
Maya Lin,"I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them."
Maya Lin,I didn't have anyone to play with so I made up my own world.
Maya Lin,"How we are using up our home, how we are living and polluting the planet is frightening. It was evident when I was a child. It's more evident now."
Maya Lin,"Growing up, I thought I was white. It didn't occur to me I was Asian-American until I was studying abroad in Denmark and there was a little bit of prejudice."
Maya Lin,For the most part things never get built the way they were drawn.
Maya Lin,To fly we have to have resistance.
Maya Lin,"It terrified me to have an idea that was solely mine to be no longer a part of my mind, but totally public."
Maya Lin,Warmth isn't what minimalists are thought to have.
Maya Lin,I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That's art to me.

Abraham Lincoln,Things may come to those who wait...but only the things left by those who hustle.
Abraham Lincoln,"Do not worry; eat three square meals a day; say your prayers; be courteous to your creditors; keep your digestion good; exercise; go slow and easy. Maybe there are other things your special case requires to make you happy, but my friend, these I reckon will give you a good lift. -"

Abraham Lincoln,I am not concerned that you have fallen -- I am concerned that you arise.
Abraham Lincoln,"Force is all-conquering, but its victories are short-lived."
Abraham Lincoln,No man has a good enough memory to make a successful liar.
Abraham Lincoln,"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. We here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
Abraham Lincoln,"In law it is good policy never to plead what you need not, lest you oblige yourself to prove what you cannot"
Abraham Lincoln,"Let me not be understood as saying that there are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed."
Abraham Lincoln,A jury too often has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor.
Abraham Lincoln,I am glad to know that there is a system of labor where the laborer can strike if he wants to!  I would like to God that such a system prevailed all over the world
Abraham Lincoln,Kindness is the only service that will stand the storm of life and not wash out. It will wear well and will be remembered long after the prism of politeness or the complexion of courtesy has faded away.

Abraham Lincoln,"With high hope for the future, no prediction is ventured."
Abraham Lincoln,"''A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gal.'' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey which catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the highroad to his reason."
Abraham Lincoln,"I desire to so conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside of me."
Abraham Lincoln,I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.

Abraham Lincoln,"The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty."
Abraham Lincoln,"There are few things wholly evil or wholly good. Almost everything, especially of government policy, is an inseparable compound of the two, so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded."
Abraham Lincoln,"Only events and not a man's exertions in his own behalf, can make a President"

Abraham Lincoln,"If the end brings me out all right, what is said against me won't amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, then ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference."
Abraham Lincoln,"I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. Corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong it's reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed."
Abraham Lincoln,"He reminds me of the man who murdered both his parents, and then when the sentence was about to be pronounced, pleaded for mercy on the grounds that he was orphan."

Abraham Lincoln,"If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how -- the very best I can. And I mean to keep on doing it to the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said against me will not amount to anything. If the end brings me out all wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference."

Trevor Linden,"When I got here in the middle of November in 2001, we were under .500, ... We were kind of .500 from that point until Christmas. But the second half of that year was as much fun as I've had in a long time. Then, last year, it was just fun to come to the rink every day. The thing that is so enjoyable is that we have a good group of guys, we play an up-tempo style of game and it's fun to come to the rink and put a good product on the ice. We've been able to win games, and there is nothing better than winning."

Susan Linn,"We have an ongoing concern that parents and babies are being exploited by the media and market industries. Parents have a right to honest information, and they aren't getting it from these baby-video companies."

Marcello Lippi,This is a big injection of confidence.
Marcello Lippi,"I have to be optimistic, I have no choice."
Walter Lippmann,The effort to calculate exactly what the voters want at each particular moment leaves out of account the fact that when they are troubled the thing the voters most want is to be told what to want.
Walter Lippmann,"The principles of the good society call for a concern with an order of being -- which cannot be proved existentially to the sense organs -- where it matters supremely that the human person is inviolable, that reason shall regulate the will, that truth shall prevail over error."
Walter Lippmann,What a shame to waste those great shots on the practice tee.
Walter Lippmann,There is nothing so bad but it can masquerade as moral.
Walter Lippmann,"At the core of every moral code there is a picture of human nature, a map of the universe, and a version of history. To human nature (of the sort conceived), in a universe (of the kind imagined), after a history (so understood), the rules of the code apply."
Walter Lippmann,The disesteem into which moralists have fallen is due at bottom to their failure to see that in an age like this one the function of the moralist is not to exhort men to be good but to elucidate what the good is. The problem of sanctions is secondary.
Walter Lippmann,"Men are mortal, but ideas are immortal."
Walter Lippmann,"The decay of decency in the modern age, the rebellion against law and good faith, the treatment of human beings as things, as the mere instruments of power and ambition, is without a doubt the consequence of the decay of the belief in man as something more than an animal animated by highly conditioned reflexes and chemical reactions. For, unless man is something more than that, he has no rights that anyone is bound to respect, and there are no limitations upon his conduct which he is bound to obey."
Walter Lippmann,"A useful definition of liberty is obtained only by seeking the principle of liberty in the main business of human life, that is to say, in the process by which men educate their responses and learn to control their environment."

Walter Lippmann,Love endures only when the lovers love many things together and not merely each other.
Walter Lippmann,"Culture is the name for what people are interested in, their thoughts, their models, the books they read and the speeches they hear, their table-talk, gossip, controversies, historical sense and scientific training, the values they appreciate, the quality of life they admire. All communities have a culture. It is the climate of their civilization."
Walter Lippmann,Only the consciousness of a purpose that is mightier than any man and worthy of all men can fortify and inspirit and compose the souls of men

Walter Lippmann,The great social adventure of America is no longer the conquest of the wilderness but the absorption of fifty different peoples.
Walter Lippmann,"The best servants of the people, like the best valets, must whisper unpleasant truths in the master's ear. It is the court fool, not the foolish courtier, whom the king can least afford to lose."

Walter Lippmann,In a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men. It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs.
Walter Lippmann,Ages when custom is unsettled are necessarily ages of prophecy. The moralist cannot teach what is revealed; he must reveal what can be taught. He has to seek insight rather than to preach.
Walter Lippmann,The first principle of a civilized state is that the power is legitimate only when it is under contract.
Walter Lippmann,Many a time I have wanted to stop talking and find out what I really believed.
Walter Lippmann,"When distant and unfamiliar and complex things are communicated to great masses of people, the truth suffers a considerable and often a radical distortion. The complex is made over into the simple, the hypothetical into the dogmatic, and the relative into an absolute."
Walter Lippmann,Success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues; tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism.
Walter Lippmann,It is perfectly true that that government is best which governs least. It is equally true that that government is best which provides most.
Walter Lippmann,Social movements are at once the symptoms and the instruments of progress. Ignore them and statesmanship is irrelevant; fail to use them and it is weak.
Walter Lippmann,"The tendency of the casual mind is to pick out or stumble upon a sample which supports or defies its prejudices, and then to make it the representative of a whole class."
Walter Lippmann,"When men can no longer be theists, they must, if they are civilized, become humanists."
Walter Lippmann,"The opposition is indispensable. A good statesman, like any other sensible human being, always learns more from his opposition than from his fervent supporters."
Walter Lippmann,When philosophers try to be politicians they generally cease to be philosophers.
Walter Lippmann,"When all men think alike, no one thinks very much."
Walter Lippmann,People that are orthodox when they are young are in danger of being middle-aged all their lives.
Walter Lippmann,"The study of error is not only in the highest degree prophylactic, but it serves as a stimulating introduction to the study of truth."

Walter Lippmann,Ideals are an imaginative understanding of that which is desirable in that which is possible.
Walter Lippmann,Industry is a better horse to ride than genius.
Walter Lippmann,"No amount of charters, direct primaries, or short ballots will make a democracy out of an illiterate people."
Walter Lippmann,"Most men, after a little freedom, have preferred authority with the consoling assurances and the economy of effort it brings."

Steve Lipscomb,"The second quarter marked the continued successful execution of our strategic plan. Revenues were up 40% as we saw growth in virtually all of our business segments, ... We completed the production and final delivery of Season 3 during the quarter, and continued to grow our international television and product license businesses.

Further, we are moving forward with the Professional Poker Tour(TM) (PPT), and are close to signing a licensing agreement for it. Finally, we are pleased with the initial launch of WPT online."

Steve Lipscomb,"The World Poker Tour is all about letting people live their dreams and celebrities are no different. They all want to be the one counting the money at the Final Table.

We anticipate a blockbuster event!"
Steve Lipscomb,"The PPT gives poker fans non-stop action with the biggest names in the game, ... We believe the success we have had selling the WPT into 116 countries and territories is only the tip of the iceberg. The PPT lets us hold a great pair and gives our TV partners a winning hand, too."

Robert Litan,"[Analysts agree that the potential antitrust implications of the deal are few.] On the surface, the only apparent antitrust problem appears to be the fact that AOL and Time Warner's Roadrunner might be seen as being competing Internet services, ... But Roadrunner is a pipsqueak of a player compared to AOL's service. It's conceivable they could force the divestiture of Roadrunner. But that's not a big deal."
Robert Litan,"Perhaps the EC is going to investigate it. Maybe they fear that a combination of content companies with distribution companies is a problem, but I am wrestling with seeing what the antitrust problem is in the U.S."

Grady Little,The pitching coach came out and I'm sure his words to that pitcher were to try and get a ground ball back to you. I guarantee that's what he told him before he walked away and that's one of those times it happened.
Grady Little,"His ball was alive and he had a smile on his face, so that was great."
Grady Little,"I don't want to put him in a position that curtails his progress. If he's playing enough for our good, don't be surprised if you see him leave here with us. If he won't get enough playing time, he'll start in the Minor Leagues."
Grady Little,"He hasn't felt any pain whatsoever, and that's why we're turning him loose. If everything goes well, he'll be here Saturday."
Grady Little,"He hasn't felt any pain whatsoever, and that's why we're turning him loose. If everything goes well, he'll be here in Saturday. If he's physically able to do this, we're ready for him.

Grady Little,"But I should have known better. I'd been watching these guys hanging breaking balls and walking the bases loaded every day from March through September. I knew, I knew, I knew better than anybody that if I kept relying on them in pressure situations their true colors were going to come out eventually, and that's what you saw tonight."
Grady Little,"We've given up a lot of long balls, and it's purely missing location."

Freddie Ljungberg,"We're not big-headed, but when you play for Arsenal, every time you enter a competition you are trying to win it, and that's what we hope to do."

Vince Lombardi,"The greatest accomplishment is not in never falling, but in rising again after you fall."
Vince Lombardi,The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.
Vince Lombardi,"Winning is not everything, but wanting to win is."
Vince Lombardi,Winners never quit and quitters never win.
Vince Lombardi,"Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing."
Vince Lombardi,"Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing."
Vince Lombardi,"Show me a good loser, and I'll show you a loser."
Vince Lombardi,"If winning isn't everything, why do they keep score?"
Vince Lombardi,Dictionary is the only place that success comes before work. Hard work is the price we must pay for success. I think you can accomplish anything if you're willing to pay the price.
Jack London,"At half past one in the morning, three sides of Union Square were in flames. The fourth side, where stood the great Hotel St. Francis, was still holding out. An hour later, ignited from top and sides, the St. Francis was flaming heavenward."
Jack London,Affluence means influence
Jack London,If a company is distributing images and video then obviously they need bandwidth solutions. But if they are looking to the mass market then they must develop WAP sites.
Jack London,"The scab is a traitor to his God, his mother, and his class"
Jack London,"The scab is a traitor to his God, his mother, and his class."
Jack London,"I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet."
Jack London,Affluence means influence.
Jack London,"I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet."
Jack London,Darn the wheel of the world! Why must it continually turn over? Where is the reverse gear?
Jack London,"The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."
Jack London,San Francisco is gone. Nothing remains of it but memories.
Jack London,"There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive."
Jack London,One cannot violate the promptings of one's nature without having that nature recoil upon itself.
Jack London,"Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but sometimes, playing a poor hand well."
Jack London,"A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog."
Jack London,"If cash comes with fame, come fame; if cash comes without fame, come cash."
Jack London,I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. I write a book for no other reason than to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate.
Jack London,You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.
Steve Loney,"I think you see a lot of size there, and from what I saw of the strength level (during Thursday testing), I think the strength levels were also solid. I do think it's a decent class."
Steve Loney,He's going to have to get a lot of reps. It's not punishment. It's really a good thing for him.
Steve Loney,"As a group, this last week was probably our highest-graded performance."
Steve Loney,"We're going to see some mistakes with him, but he's the type of kid who doesn't make the same mistake twice. He's willing to ask questions some guys are hesitant to ask. I like the way he stays on top of the mental aspect of the game."
Steve Loney,"It's kind of like someone gets the shanks when they're kicking, or when you're hitting the driver in golf. You get the shanks, and you can't get out of it for a while, so don't keep putting (the ball) back on the tee."
Steve Loney,just an execution thing.
Steve Loney,But it would be wrong to say I'm upset. I take it as a compliment that Denny didn't feel like they could go out there and replace me. At least that's what was communicated to me.
Steve Loney,"Any time you sign that contract, you understand the commitment. Those are the things that happen in this profession. You have to accept them."
Steve Loney,"I think it's a good thing. When you coach five guys, you don't see all five. Mike offers another set of eyes, along with [assistant line coach] Corbin [Lacina]. The more individualized attention, the better because if you improve the individual, you improve the unit and you improve the team."
Barry Long,The fact is that to worry or suffer mentally you have to have an opinion. You have to say 'That is bad in relation to me.
Barry Long,"Truth has to be discovered now, from moment to moment."
Barry Long,Truth cannot be taught but it is quickly recognized by the person ready to discover it.
Barry Long,"The only way we can ever get through to the truth is by finding out what we are not. We do that by looking, by observation."
Barry Long,"You do not have to find what is true, when the false is discarded truth is there. It always was. Just keep observing the fact and the change will come automatically and will he lasting."
Barry Long,Nothing makes man more unhappy than the untruth appearing as the truth.
Barry Long,Love is beyond the mind because it is always new.
Barry Long,Love is beyond description; but not beyond demonstrating.
Barry Long,IF YOU LOOK at life's totality you will notice that every living thing exists for something else.
Barry Long,"It is always fresh, always new, always there for the still, innocent mind that has experienced life without needing to hold on to what has gone before."
Barry Long,You can predict exactly what a machine will do if you have sufficient knowledge of it.
Barry Long,The understanding of love comes with the knowledge that you are nothing.
Barry Long,You don't gather knowledge when you are getting to know yourself; you lose it..
Barry Long,Read in the moment and each step will take you closer to complete self-knowledge.
Barry Long,"We are the intelligence that has evolved in time out of the space and matter of the solar system, and specifically the earthâ€¦"
Barry Long,The mind knows it is the master in imagination and the slave of the fact. It will fight you all the way to self-knowledge. And why not? It is the only enemy.
Barry Long,"Many mystics have said, and it is true, that anything you see is not God. Anything you think is not God, neither are visions, lights, moving objects or anything else. Any sensation or feeling is not God. They are all the products of the creation or your imagination."
Barry Long,"... Because in God realization and being one with God the Most High, the unspeakable one, there's no sense whatsoever of ever having done anything yourself. It is all done for you. It's by grace."
Barry Long,"If God exists, God can be experienced; but only by you."
Barry Long,Worry is a purely selfish expression.
Barry Long,If God exists you must have the experience of God in the moment; otherwise you are absent and God cannot exist for you.
Barry Long,"When self-knowledge reveals the answer it will be a living fact in your own experience. At any time you wish to experience the answer it will be there, just as you can say 'It is night' or 'It is day'. You will know, while the rest of the world is arguing and speculating."
Barry Long,Nothing is true in self-discovery unless it is true in your own experience. This is the only protection against the robot levels of the mind.
Barry Long,One of the greatest steps in self-discovery is to see that you are a machine. Only the few who have real knowledge will admit to being machines.
Barry Long,This process of self-discovery is scientific and the invariable rule of science has to be applied - experiment and observe.
Barry Long,"For us who are observers of ourselves there can never be a hidden desire or hidden motivation. If we are always observing ourselves nothing hidden can come in without being spotted, and nothing hidden can get done, because we (the master) are always there."
Barry Long,You can experience consciousness now by experiencing the fact that you exist.
Barry Long,"You live, enjoy life and suffer according to that belief. What you believe, you live; or you do not believe it."
Barry Long,Beauty is and always is. You are absent. Why are you absent? Again your robot mind is the problem. It will not stay still and you cannot make it stay still. It is your master and it separates you from beauty and God.
Barry Long,"Beauty stands at the gate of the kingdom of heaven. It is of the Creator, but not the Creator; and it is all-mighty."
Barry Long,"On the way to God you have to pass through beauty, pure beauty. If you do not pass through beauty it is not God that you find."
Barry Long,Beauty is the only uncreated thing you can experience apart from God.
Barry Long,"You can only get next to God through the effort of preparation. To experience the uncreated, the state of awareness will have to be held for several minutes. You are then between time and the time-less - waiting for the unknown, which will come but cannot be willed."
Barry Long,"You think, you become that thought. And consciousness, or the state of pure awareness, is lost."
Barry Long,"Reason is a mighty faculty but it is still below the state of awareness, of pure experiencing, which is the state you are in when you know 'I exist' or 'I am'."
Barry Long,"At the top of the ladder is awareness, or pure experience - the edge of yourself, and possibly the beginning of God."
Barry Long,"Awareness is experiencing from moment to moment. Reason acts quickly in awareness, a thousand times faster than thought, and you do not even notice it is operating."
Barry Long,"To experience beauty, love, truth and peace, or God, your mind has to be stilled."
Barry Long,"Reasonable acceptance, our way of living, is imperfect. But God, if God exists, must be perfect and beyond reason."
Chris Long,"Tennessee is a great team. They're No. 1 for a reason and they make you pay for your mistakes. We went through a stretch and didn't score, and a lot of it had to do with turnovers."
Chris Long,"They've done some great things this year; everything I've asked of them. However, our intention is to go win."
Chris Long,We don't care where. We just want to play one more football game.
Chris Long,"It really was an enjoyable game for me because we played so well, we played so hard and those seniors had great nights."
Chris Long,"I thought we played exceptionally well on both ends of the floor, particularly on defense. That's where this team has really become good. Hawaii has a good team. We defended them so hard early that they got frustrated. We pushed the basketball on the break as well as we have all year."
Chris Long,It's all about bringing the fans at home into the middle of the action. We want them to feel like they are totally immersed in the Daytona experience.
Chuck Long,"Time stood still, so to speak,"
Chuck Long,"It's something that I've always believed in. It was the basis of our philosophy at Oklahoma, making it competitive every year. I think it just makes your team so much stronger and gives you a better chance to win. It gives everybody an opportunity and keeps people involved, keeps them hungry, and that's what you want."
Chuck Long,Sometimes that's hard for offensive people to suck up their pride. But we needed to do that.
Chuck Long,"We're still looking for a fullback, and something might pop up later in the spring. Fullbacks are hard to find, and we'd like to get some of them in here in the future."
Chuck Long,"We knew what we had coming into the season, we knew we had heavy graduation. We had two new quarterbacks. It was quite possible we would have the first freshman starter since I've been here. We knew we would have some growing pains."
Chuck Long,"Everyone associated with Quicksilver is excited to bring competitive, professional golf back to our championship course."
Chuck Long,Del is a very meticulous person who knows both the run game and the passing game very well. He has great experience at a high level. I put together a list of high-level coordinators and he was on that list.
Chuck Long,"He was very limited in the game and we felt like he deserves a better chance. So, we're going to start him in this game and go from there. We'll keep it open-ended and see what happens in the football game."
Chuck Long,"This staff is used to facing tough schedules. The challenges are great, but I knew that when I took this job. There are no surprises. It's a tough schedule, but that's just the way it is."
Chuck Long,"Two good coaching staffs, two great football teams. I think this will be great for America."
Greg Long,"I fully support their activities. NIU, like most college campuses, can always use more disability-related activities and awareness."
Greg Long,"As long as it can sustain me, I'll continue doing it, ... I like working with animals. I like teaching people. And I love the Everglades, and gators are a main part of the Everglades."
Greg Long,We're in agreement we're in agreement.
Rocky Long,"You wouldn't have guessed that, but since we copied Utah's offense, the quarterback has become an extra running back and the running back gets to be an extra blocker. We know how hard it is to defense because we can't defend the people who run it."
Rocky Long,Brad Smith is about as dangerous quarterback as you can get running the spread offense.
Rocky Long,"We've got a game plan that we're comfortable with, but the rest is up to the players. It's up to them to step up and find a way to handle Missouri's offense."
Rocky Long,We're at the mercy of TV. You want to be on TV.
Rocky Long,"Of course, all 5,000 coaches at this conference are all looking for better jobs and better pay. But at this point, no one on our staff has interviewed with anyone else."
Rocky Long,"I think we've got it worked out, and they'll be able to come, but it might not happen. We hope they'll be here, but you can't deny them the opportunity to play in a bowl game. It's too important to their future."
Rocky Long,"We're not giving up on the spread, but we're not afraid to use our old two-tailback set if our guys aren't producing."
Rocky Long,"If he does anything else similar, he probably won't be on this football team."
Rocky Long,They want to be able to check on football players because they don't trust us. I don't think it's that big a deal for us because - I hate to say it and ruin our streak - but we haven't had a positive steroids test in eight years.
Rocky Long,We wanted to take seven to nine players from the junior-college level. The only drawback is that we wanted them here at mid-term (so they could participate in spring practice). A couple of them won?t be here until after the spring semester.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The human voice is the organ of the soul

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Simplicity in character, in manners, in style; in all things the supreme excellence is simplicity."

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"We have not wings we cannot soar; but, we have feet to scale and climb, by slow degrees, by more and more, the cloudy summits of our time."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"All that is best in the great poets of all countries is not what is national in them, but what is universal"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake somebody."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,I heard the bells on Christmas Day. Their old familiar carols play. And wild and sweet the words repeat. Of peace on earth goodwill to men.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Every man must patiently bide his time. He must wait -- not in listless idleness but in constant, steady, cheerful endeavors, always willing and fulfilling and accomplishing his task, that when the occasion comes he may be equal to the occasion."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,All things come round to him who will but wait.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Look not mournfully into the past, it comes not back again. Wisely improve the present, it is thine. Go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,They who go  Feel not the pain of parting;  it is they  Who stay behind that suffer
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing, Only a signal shown, and a distant voice in the darkness; So on the ocean of life, we pass and speak one another, Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The Laws of Nature are just, but terrible. There is no weak mercy in them. Cause and consequence are inseparable and inevitable. The elements have no forbearance. The fire burns, the water drowns, the air consumes, the earth buries. And perhaps it would be well for our race if the punishment of crimes against the Laws of Man were as inevitable as the punishment of crimes against the Laws of Nature --were Man as unerring in his judgments as Nature."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"As to the pure mind all things are pure, so to the poetic mind all things are poetical"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Sit in reverie, and watch the changing color of the waves that break upon the idle seashore of the mind"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The Laws of Nature are just, but terrible. There is no weak mercy in them. Cause and consequence are inseparable and inevitable. The elements have no forbearance. The fire burns, the water drowns, the air consumes, the earth buries. And perhaps it would be well for our race if the punishment of crimes against the Laws of Man were as inevitable as the punishment of crimes against the Laws of Nature /were Man as unerring in his judgments as Nature."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The greatest firmness is the greatest mercy
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Heights by great men reached and kept were not obtained by sudden flight but, while their companions slept, they were toiling upward in the night."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The leaves of memory seemed to make A mournful rustling in the dark
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Like a French poem is life; being only perfect in structure when with the masculine rhymes mingled the feminine are.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Some men must follow, and some command, though all are made of clay."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,No literature is complete until the language it was written in is dead.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Music is the universal language of mankind

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Joy and Temperance and Repose - Slam the door on the doctor's nose
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"It takes less time to do a thing right, than it does to explain why you did it wrong."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,It is foolish to pretend that one is fully recovered from a disappointed passion. Such wounds always leave a scar.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! / Sail on, O Union, strong and great! / Humanity with all its fears, / With all the hopes of future years, / Is hanging breathless on thy fate!"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Every heart has its secret sorrows which the world knows not, and oftentimes we call a man cold, when he is only sad"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The rays of happiness, like those of light, are colorless when unbroken."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Well has it been said that there is no grief like the grief which does not speak.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,There is no grief like the grief that does not speak
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,There is not grief that does not speak.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it; every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The morning pouring everywhere, its golden glory on the air."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Give what you have to somebody, it may be better than you think."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"All the means of action -- the shapeless masses -- the materials -- lie everywhere about us. What we need is the celestial fire to change the flint into the transparent crystal, bright and clear. That fire is genius.''"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Ah, how good it feels! The hand of an old friend."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship let me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest and dearest!"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we would find in each person's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,A thought often makes us hotter than a fire.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Sail on ship of state, sail on, I union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, with all its hopes of future years, is hanging on thy fate!"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Let us then be up and doing, with a heart for any fate"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Let us, then, be up and doing, With a heart for any fate;  Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labor and to wait"

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime. And, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The talent of success is nothing more than doing what you can do well, and doing well whatever you do without thought of fame. If it comes at all it will come because it is deserved, not because it is sought after."

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The strength of criticism lies in the weakness of the thing criticized.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Critics are sentinels in the grand army of letters, stationed at the corners of newspapers and reviews, to challenge every new author."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Doubtless criticism was originally benignant, pointing out the beauties of a work rather that its defects. The passions of men have made it malignant, as a bad heart of Procreates turned the bed, the symbol of repose, into an instrument of torture."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Intelligence and courtesy not always are combined; Often in a wooden house a golden room we find.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Write on your doors the saying wise and old. ''Be bold!'' and everywhere -- ''Be bold; Be not too bold!'' Yet better the excess Than the defect; better the more than less sustaineth him and the steadiness of his mind beareth him out.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"I feel a kind of reverence for the first books of young authors. There is so much aspiration in them, so much audacious hope and trembling fear, so much of the heart's history, that all errors and shortcomings are for a while lost sight of in the amiable self assertion of youth."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Great is the art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Ah, to build, to build! That is the noblest art of all the arts. Painting and sculpture are but images, are merely shadows cast by outward things on stone or canvas, having in themselves no separate existence. Architecture, existing in itself, and not in seeming a something it is not, surpasses them as substance shadow."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The secret anniversaries of the heart.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Look upon the errors of others in sorrow, not in anger"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"To be seventy years old is like climbing the Alps. You reach a snow-crowned summit, and see behind you the deep valley stretching miles and miles away, and before you other summits higher and whiter, which you may have strength to climb, or may not. Then you sit down and meditate and wonder which it will be."
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"For age is opportunity no less than youth itself, though in another dress, and as the evening twilight fades away, the sky is filled with stars, invisible by day."

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The counterfeit and counterpart of Nature is reproduced in art.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,It is difficult to know at what moment love begins; it is less difficult to know that it has begun.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books."
Ryan Longwell,It's hard to imagine a team running out there without a No. 4. It's weird to think of the Green Bay Packers without him.
Ryan Longwell,Anything that brings down the reputation of any NFL player is not good. No matter if it's one of your biggest rivals or anybody in the league. It's not a good situation.
Ryan Longwell,"Anything that brings down the reputation of any NFL player is not good, ... No matter if it's one of your biggest rivals or anybody in the league. It's not a good situation."
Ryan Longwell,"I showed him how I liked it. The first couple, we adjusted. There's some learning to be done (Friday). But we're pretty close. I'd say it's not as far of a learning curve as it would be if we had to go with Aaron."
Ryan Longwell,"We talk about it often, but I don't know if it's one of those pipe dreams or if it'll come to fruition, ... Obviously that carrot is out there, but it really depends on the organization and what they do. I just know I would be better and he would be better if we were together, because we bring out the best in each other. That's the kind of relationship we have."
Ryan Longwell,"I think there's absolutely a danger in underestimating a team like that, because it can be kind of galvanizing (for them), ... The only thing they have is each other and the football game, and when everybody on the outside is counting teams out, that's when they get dangerous. You definitely don't want to think because of all their distractions they're going to be easier to play, because that's certainly not the case."
Ryan Longwell,(We threw) a lot more balls to him so he can get comfortable.
Alice Longworth,The secret of eternal youth is arrested development.
Alice Longworth,Dorothy is the only woman in history who has had her menopause in public and made it pay.
Alice Longworth,"If you haven't got anything nice to say about anybody, come sit next to me."
Alice Longworth,"My father always wanted to be the corpse at every funeral, the bride at every wedding, and the baby at every christening"
Ray Looze,This is a rarity. We'll remember this for the rest of our lives.
Ray Looze,"When we look back at the results, we need to show improvement on our finishes, starts, relays and that kind of thing. We're going back to the drawing board."
Ray Looze,We are going to be a force to be reckoned with in the future. We have the potential to be a top 10 team.
Ray Looze,I'd just like to see Namesnik get the job. He's a fine coach and one of (Michigan's) most successful swimmers of all time.
Ray Looze,Presley Bard probably has the most potential of anybody in the class. She will help in anywhere from the 50 to the 200 backstroke and will swim sprint freestyle up to 200 freestyle. She also comes from one of the best teams in the Terrapins from Concord.
Ray Looze,I was pleased with how we handled adversity on the road. Our strategy was sound and we took high percentage risks where we put our guys.
Al Lopez,"It's tough to be pitching and having to worry about what a catcher's going to call. If the catcher has a reputation of being a rockhead, the pitcher's gonna have to worry that much more."
Al Lopez,"I'm delighted, ... I don't know of anybody who had a statue built of them while they were living. It's a great feeling."
Al Lopez,"He wasn't firing like he used to, but he was still very fast and had very good control, ... All you had to do was hold your mitt around the strike zone, and it'd be right there."
Al Lopez,I'm delighted. I don't know of anybody who had a statue built of them while they were living. It's a great feeling.
Al Lopez,Everybody says we hated the Yankees. We didn't hate the Yankees. We just hated the way they beat us.
Al Lopez,I usually stick out my hand and hope he puts the ball in it. Except the one time I went out to take Early Wynn out. I stuck out my hand and he hit me right in the stomach with the ball.
Al Lopez,"The manager is by himself. He can't mingle with his players. I enjoyed my players, but I could not socialize with them so I spent a lot of time alone in my hotel room. Those four walls kind of close in on you."
Al Lopez,"Managing can be more discouraging than playing, especially when you're losing because when you're a player, there are at least individual goals you can shoot for. When you're a manager all the worries of the team become your worries."
Al Lopez,They say anything can happen in a short series. I just didn't expect it to be that short.
Al Lopez,"Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it's business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don't love what you're doing and you can't give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. You'll be an old man before you know it."
Andy Lopez,What is the famous line? The best-laid plans of mice and men sometimes go astray. We will see. We need to find a Friday night guy.
Andy Lopez,I'm waiting for two more guys to show up for a flag football game.
Andy Lopez,I guess that UCLA education and 28 years of coaching doesn't count for much with the NCAA. The innings I saw were pretty good.
Andy Lopez,"It's really our first class (to get drafted), and I miss those guys. But it's been great to have them be a part of it this weekend."
Andy Lopez,There's a lot of sloppy baseball being played in college baseball. Either you can be a part of it or you can be above the standard. I saw sloppy baseball on both ends today.
George Lopez,Old School.
George Lopez,The guy is like Honduran-German. Why would you pretend to be (Mexican)? . . . I think he had that intention from the beginning that he was going to play Mexican.
George Lopez,"[How much does golf mean to comedian George Lopez ? When he was in Las Vegas not too long ago to play a round, he was asked to do an opening stand-up gig for Rod Stewart that night, just a quick 45 minutes of work for $130,000. But Lopez said no. He was afraid it might spoil his round if he had to worry about finishing it to get to the hotel on time.] Is he crazy? Does he know how much $130,000 is? ... I know how much it is. I've got $130,000."
George Lopez,I actually graze at several of the homes while I'm playing. There a lot of food going on. I drink and eat and use the restrooms in a lot of the houses. What better way to really get closer to the fans than to steal their soap from the restrooms as they allow you to enter their homes?
George Lopez,"I don't think words can comfort at this time. Just love and support of his family, and for Will to know that millions of people loved his father and mother."
George Lopez,I wanted my character to be accessible and nonthreatening.
George Lopez,I didn't come from a background where I saw a lot of loving couples. All my aunts and uncles were either split up or fighting all the time. The only healthy relationships I saw were on TV.
George Lopez,"When I look at the Gospel, I see how it is speaking to me at this time. I see how to be to others and it helps."
George Lopez,"We're at a critical moment with regard to Sudanese sanctions and the ability to send a clear message to the government in Khartoum that the international community now means business, enough is enough."
Nancy Lopez,"I talk to them if there's something I think they need to ease up on, ... But they're grown women. If there's something you feel, you might have to bite your tongue a little bit. That's called teamwork."
Nancy Lopez,"They're not rookies to me. I had to trust them, and I knew they could do it."
Nancy Lopez,"She is just a great talent. I mean, I remember when I could make all those putts and hit all those shots, and it's fun to see somebody do that and relate with her in some way."
Nancy Lopez,"I want to thank The Villages for all of the support you've given AIM. I can't thank you all enough for being here, and helping all the handicapped children. It means so much. It means so much to me, to Jo and Conner."
Nancy Lopez,Beth will be a good calming influence and I thought they would make a great pair.
Nancy Lopez,"Definitely. I feel that playing the course just makes my players more comfortable, not just with the golf course but with each other and what they're going to share and how they bond."
Nancy Lopez,"I have to look and see what they've done this year, and really -- especially -- the last few events."
Nancy Lopez,"Doubt yourself and you doubt everything you see.  Judge yourself and you see judges everywhere.  But if you listen to the sound of your own voice, you can rise above doubt and judgment.  And you can see forever."
Nancy Lopez,I love the challenge.
Nancy Lopez,"Our players are mad, but it's good mad."
Nancy Lopez,"Doubt yourself and you doubt everything you see. Judge yourself and you see judges everywhere. But if you listen to the sound of your own voice, you can rise above doubt and judgment. And you can see forever."
Nancy Lopez,The pressure makes me more intent about each shot. Pressure on the last few holes makes me play better.
Nancy Lopez,"The simpler I keep things, the better I play."
Nancy Lopez,"Do your best, one shot at a time and then move on. Remember that golf is just a game."
Nancy Lopez,"My swing is no uglier than Arnold Palmer's, and it's the same ugly swing every time."
Nancy Lopez,Great champions have an enormous sense of pride. The people who excel are those who are driven to show the world and prove to themselves just how good they are.
Nancy Lopez,A competitor will find a way to win. Competitors take bad breaks and use them to drive themselves just that much harder. Quitters take bad breaks and use them as reasons to give up. It's all a matter of pride.
Audre Lorde,Even the smallest victory is never to be taken for granted. Each victory must be applauded...
Audre Lorde,Silence has never brought us anything of worth
Audre Lorde,When I use my strength in the service of may vision it makes no difference whether or not I am afraid.
Audre Lorde,"As we come to know, accept, and explore our feelings, they will become sanctuaries and fortresses and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring of ideas-the house of difference so necessary to change and the conceptualization of any meaningful action."
Audre Lorde,Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge
Audre Lorde,"When I dare to be powerful - to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid"

Audre Lorde,"Black writers, of whatever quality, who step outside the pale of what black writers are supposed to write about, or who black writers are supposed to be, are condemned to silences in black literary circles that are as total and as destructive as any imposed by racism."

Konrad Lorenz,Truth in science can be defined as the working hypothesis best suited to open the way to the next better one.
Konrad Lorenz,It is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast. It keeps him young.
Jeffrey Loria,Look at that smile! You ever seen a smile like that?
Jeffrey Loria,"Let me say this about the stadium: There has been very little progress towards a new stadium. And, I was thinking the other day, reflecting back on the last four years, if any of the thousands of fans -- good fans -- who were on that World Series parade route were in touch with their elected officials and expressed their desire to keep the team in South Florida, and keep it going, it probably would have been done by now. I'm very surprised that it hasn't been done by now, especially with our contribution. That's really all I want to say about it. We have options, and we're looking at all our options right now."
Jeffrey Loria,"I spent the whole night thinking of when I went into that building, what was I going to encounter. I think people are hopeful. There were some very sad faces in there, which I found very humbling."
Jeffrey Loria,"He is the right man to lead our team and I'm proud he will start what will be a long, successful managerial career in South Florida."
Jeffrey Loria,Jack has been great. A man who has been around 50 years is an asset.
Jeffrey Loria,The commissioner took a lot of heat for his enthusiasm for the wild card. Turns out it's great for the game. We could end up with the fourth-best record and not make the playoffs. Hopefully our guys will do what they have to do.
Jeffrey Loria,"It's special, no doubt about it,"
Jeffrey Loria,"We feel it got away a little bit, but it was somewhat out of our control."
Jeffrey Loria,"Jack, I want to thank you for all you have done for baseball in South Florida. You've been a winner everywhere you've gone. I'm glad you decided to win a championship with us and all of South Florida. We all look forward to the next chapter. ... Jack's many years of front-office experience will complement what I consider to be one of the best baseball operations in all the game."
George Lorimer,"Education is about the only thing lying around loose in the world, and it's about the only thing a fellow can have as much of as he's willing to haul away."
George Lorimer,"Colleges don't make fools, they only develop them"
George Lorimer,"Because a fellow has failed once or twice or a dozen times, you don't want to set him down as a failure till he's dead or loses his courage."
Pierre Loti,"The moon of a bright silver, which dazzles by its shining, illumines a world which surely is no longer ours; for it resembles in nothing what may be seen in other lands."
Pierre Loti,"Unlike most other children, - especially unlike those of to-day - who are eager to become men and women as speedily as possible, I had a terror of growing up, which became more and more accentuated as I grew older."
Pierre Loti,Through the study of fossils I had already been initiated into the mysteries of prehistoric creations.
Pierre Loti,"The pyramid once passed there was still a short way to go before we confronted the Sphinx, in the middle of what our contemporaries have left him of his desert."
Pierre Loti,Painting and music were the only things I worked at industriously and faithfully.
Pierre Loti,"Often, before returning home, I would take a long and roundabout way and pass by the peaceful ramparts from where I had glimpses of other provinces, and a sight of the distant country."
Pierre Loti,"My sister and my brother, of whom I have not spoken before, were considerably older than I; it seemed almost as if we belonged to different generations."
Pierre Loti,"My emotions lose their force when I endeavor to interpret them, and my words seem very inept."
Pierre Loti,"My books were always full of ink blots, always stained and covered with smeared sketches and pictures, which one draws idly when his attention wanders from his task."
Pierre Loti,It seems to me that it will be very wearisome to be a man.
Pierre Loti,"It is said that many children who live in the central provinces, away from the ocean, have a great longing to see it. I who had never been away from the monotonous country surrounding us looked forward eagerly to seeing the mountains."
Pierre Loti,I still went to church regularly every Sunday; that is we all went there together. I reverenced the family pew where we had assembled for so many years; and apart from that reason I hold it dear because it is associated in my memory with my mother.
Pierre Loti,"I still held fast to my determination to become a minister; it still seemed to me that that was my duty. I had pledged myself, in my prayers I had given my word to God. How could I therefore break my vow?"
Pierre Loti,"I still have in my memory, almost agonizing impressions of a serious illness which I had when I was about eight years old. Those about me called it scarlet fever, and its very name seemed to have a diabolical quality."
Pierre Loti,I recall feeling an almost delicious terror when one day I found myself alone in the midst of tall June grasses that grew high as my head. But here the secret working of self consciousness is almost too entangled with the things of the past for me to explain it.
Pierre Loti,I do not exactly remember at what period I started my museum which absorbed so much of my time.
Pierre Loti,"I am surprised that I cannot recall whether my desire to become a minister transformed itself into a wish to lead the more militant life of missionary, by a slow process or suddenly."
Pierre Loti,"I am sure that the sad days and happenings were rare, and that I lived the joyous and careless life of other children; but just because the happy days were so habitual to me they made no impression upon my mind, and I can no longer recall them."
Pierre Loti,"Egypt, the Egypt of antiquity, at a later time, exercised a mysterious fascination over me. I recognized a picture of it immediately, without hesitation and astonishment, in an illustrated magazine."
Pierre Loti,"But it is true that sometimes an enveloping darkness aids one to clearer vision; as in a panorama building, for example, where the obscurity about the entrance prepares one better for the climax, and gives the scene depicted a more real and vivid appearance."
Pierre Loti,And all around is the desert; a corner of the mournful kingdom of sand.
Pierre Loti,"I was at that time like a fledgling swallow living high up in a niche in the eaves, who from time to time peeps out over the top of its nest with its little bright eyes."
Ronnie Lott,"If Michael Jordan was the standard for hard work in basketball, then Jerry Rice is the standard for football, ... If there's a way to go out for Jerry, this is probably the right way. The gas is out of the tank. He did everything that he could. Most people didn't think he would have the impact that he did on this game. But he came into the league trying to make a team, and that's how he's leaving."
Ronnie Lott,"If you can believe it, the mind can achieve it."
Ronnie Lott,"His boys are at that age where they're throwing the football, ... He sees there are the boys out there playing ball, and I'm almost positive that he went, `My dad used to be out there all the time.'"
Trent Lott,"This much has become clear: although most senators agreed that the president lied under oath while trying to obstruct justice, he will stay in office, ... But we must move forward on the people's business. We must do our job."
Trent Lott,"If he doesn't solve a couple of problems that we've got right now he ain't going to be able to hold the job, because what I'm going to do to him ain't going to be pretty,"
Trent Lott,"I do think we, the president, all of us need to do a better job, do more, ... why we have made this commitment, what is being done now, what we do expect in the process and, yes, why it's going to take more time."
Trent Lott,"John Ashcroft is going to be a very thoughtful, very conscientious attorney general of high integrity. He's going to surround himself with men and women of a variety of backgrounds and races to run that Justice Department in an appropriate way, enforcing the laws on the books,"
Trent Lott,"[And Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont was a] loose cannon, ... He's always had a habit of bartering his vote on crucial legislation for his own pet projects."

Trent Lott,I'm absolutely satisfied ... that there will be time for a debate.
Trent Lott,"Remember, there's not a constitutional crisis here, ... The presidency will be there. The government will be there and be strong after this is over. This is a Clinton crisis. The system is working. There is a process that will work."
Trent Lott,"The Senate is never easy, ... But when you get a new administration and a new Congress, it gives you sort of an opportunity to take a little time out and see what we can do together."
Trent Lott,"Because the administration has indicated it will not support any funding for Amtrak this fiscal year unless Congress enacts Amtrak reforms, it is imperative for the Congress to make its voice heard on Amtrak,"
Trent Lott,"Under the present circumstances, it could be tough to work together, ... especially if the president's congressional allies circle the wagons and try to shut things down."
Trent Lott,"David Gunn has worked very hard to reform Amtrak and has done an excellent job under very difficult circumstances and without sufficient support or funding. Today's action is a step backward,"
Trent Lott,"We believe our choice is clear, ... The first priority of your representatives in Washington must be to fight for the interests of the American family."
Trent Lott,"There are a lot of mixed feelings about it, ... Is there less certainty about its need now to help the economy? Yes, there is."
Trent Lott,"I urge my colleagues to review it ... I believe this is something that could be bipartisan,"
Trent Lott,"This is legislation that is good for America, that's good for our working people in America, ... It will take a lot of vigilance to see that it is complied with, but it is the right thing to do."
Trent Lott,"The vote will not occur in any event before some time during the day tomorrow, ... We don't have an agreement at this point to do anything but to go forward with the vote, but we're exploring all kinds of possibilities and that's where we stand."
Trent Lott,"[Despite his expressed doubts, Lott said he thinks it is important Congress offer its support for U.S. military action should the president think such action is necessary.] Do I have doubts?, ... Yes, but do we have responsibilities? Yes."
Trent Lott,"Sometimes inaction is better than wrong action, so if I can't see a way to come to a reasonable agreement, then the alternative would be to try to find a way to leave that money in place and let the debt be retired,"
Trent Lott,"Unfortunately, the Senate is becoming a black hole of inactivity, ... Let's stop that. The people want action."
Greg Louganis,"Well, unless you're Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, you need the full support of your team."
Greg Louganis,"Well, one time I got a Great Dane. She was black, and I fell in love with her. I've got a pretty nice group of Great Danes at my house in Malibu."
Greg Louganis,"The Games are just a nice, positive way to build friendships, camaraderie and, of course, self-esteem. Plus, the Games are a great opportunity for people to participate in sports who normally wouldn't."

Greg Louganis,One of my dogs is in the movie Beethoven's 2nd.

Greg Louganis,"I wished I'd learned earlier that I was a worthwhile person with better self-esteem, because not having it caused a lot of pain."

Mark Loughridge,reflect the breadth and flexibility of our business model and put us back on track for the rest of the year.
Mark Loughridge,I would encourage you to roll through the over-achievement from the third (quarter) to your full year
Abner Louima,"When they want to seek our vote, they know where to reach us. But I don't see most of them here with us. They know we exist when they need to be elected, but after the election they become blind and deaf when it comes to our problems. ... We demand the government to use its power, as one of the greatest nations in the world, to end police brutality, to end racial profiling."
Abner Louima,"I was under medication. And my memory, it wasn't clear like it is now, today."
Abner Louima,But I'm confident that complete justice will be done in my case.

Courtney Love,I feel like I'm getting my creativity back ... and that I've put a very gnarly drug problem behind me.
Courtney Love,"It's a radical time for musicians, a really revolutionary time, and I believe revolutions are a lot more fun than cash, which by the way we don't have at major labels anyway, so we might as well get with it and get in the game."

Kevin Lowe,"This is a building where dreams come alive,"
Kevin Lowe,That's the beauty of the playoffs. I think the coaches were looking at getting a little more size on that line and he's a shooter. That's the thing. He's got something like (16) power-play goals in the American League. He was starting to take over down there.

John Lowery,This is my eighth-grade pre-algebra class. Some of them are even awake.
Joseph Lowery,"What was not on the national radar screen has exploded onto television screens, ... We know now that the faces of poverty are black and brown, painful and anguished. Let this nation rise up to eliminate poverty and the faces of poverty vanish from the American scene."
Joseph Lowery,would do a lot for his soul and his salvation.
Joseph Lowery,"Rosa Parks was known as the queen mother of the movement. She sat down so that her people could stand up,"
Joseph Lowery,We knew then that history was being made.
Joseph Lowery,"I woke up early this morning with Coretta and Rosa on my heart. And I grabbed a piece of paper and I wrote what a great family reunion is going on ... now they're together, Martin and Coretta, after nearly 40 years apart. What a family reunion. It warmed my heart."
Joseph Lowery,"He missed an opportunity to name somebody to the courts with the spirit of Rosa Parks, with diversity and minority rights."
Kyle Lowry,"We had to use a lot of hand signals. ... This is the kind of atmosphere we practice for - the toughest situations, the toughest arenas."
Kyle Lowry,That's what you practice for. You practice for tough situations.
Kyle Lowry,You've got to deal with it. Every night you are not going to be shooting 55% and hitting 12 threes. Some nights are just going to come down to defense.
Kyle Lowry,You've got to deal with it. Every night you are not going to be shooting 55 percent and hitting 12 3s. Some nights are just going to come down to defense.
Kyle Lowry,"The Big 5 is unique and different from anything around the county, so it was just fun to be out there in this kind of game."
Kyle Lowry,"It was fun and a great atmosphere to play home in front of a Philadelphia crowd, and also to be on the floor with my great teammates. Basically, I'm just grateful to be able to do that."
Kyle Lowry,"My brother always told me not to fear anything. You can't go out there on the court and be afraid to fail, so I just go out there and play as hard as I can, no matter what the outcome is."
Kyle Lowry,That's the only father figure I ever really had.
Kyle Lowry,"I'm not leaning toward anything right now. Whenever me and coach (Jay Wright) meet, and my family meet, we're going to discuss things and see what goes on."
Kyle Lowry,"Coach (Jay) Wright says there are always extra opportunities when other players aren't hitting their shots. If you're patient, it'll come."
Kyle Lowry,It?s an opportunity to fulfill a childhood dream. A lot of people don?t really get to fulfill those things and this is an opportunity that comes once in a lifetime.
Sonny Lubick,"I cannot thank Brady enough for his support of our program. It is very special that he thinks highly of the experience he had at Colorado State. It's nice to know that when individuals leave our program, they remain committed and involved in our continued success by assisting us."
Sonny Lubick,"The guy fumbles it and bobbles it, and that's good. We're running down there 100 miles an hour and don't break down. We probably over ran him, and he gets it to the 40, and all you have to do is complete one pass and that's it."
Sonny Lubick,"Nnamdi has improved significantly; he's running a lot better. He could be ready this week but if we err with him, we'll err on the side of caution."
Sonny Lubick,Defensively we had trouble stopping the running game. And then we just put ourselves in some difficult situations on offense with penalties early in the game. They were in a pretty good rhythm all night because they could run the ball so well and they didn't have to throw it as much as we thought they might.
Sonny Lubick,"They got us right off the bat, and I'm sure their purpose was to loosen us up. I was disappointed we couldn't put together a few more drives, because we were having a very, very difficult time slowing those guys down."
Sonny Lubick,"I'm sure the purpose of that was to loosen us up, so we weren't coming up to support the run so quickly."
Sonny Lubick,"I don't think jobs are at stake for this ballgame. But if you lose it three, four, five times in a row, I'm sure there could be problems for you."
Sonny Lubick,From this point on should be a major stretch from here on out. One of the goals that I have is that we need a few more guys to step up because we will have those injuries where a player will be out for a week to three weeks.
Sonny Lubick,"I don't know when he'll be back. I haven't talked to the doctors, so I'm hoping, but specific types seem to go longer than a week or two weeks."
Sonny Lubick,"Glen's done a great job at Minnesota, ... He's a coach I've always respected and I've enjoyed visiting with him over the years. His teams can always run the ball."
Sonny Lubick,Sometimes we play better under those circumstances. Sometimes we play better on the road with a hostile crowd. We've just got to go out and survive.
Sonny Lubick,"Justin knows that we all have confidence in him as coaches and players, ... Quarterbacks are going to have some adversity and when it happens, they have to be tough enough to fight through it. There's no question in our minds that Justin is tough enough."
Max Lucado,The secret of loving is living loved.
Max Lucado,A man who wants to lead the orchestra must turn his back on the crowd.
Max Lucado,You change your life by changing your heart.
Caroline Lucas,"There is a frustration about how all the Green voices at the general election can be reflected at Westminster, and we will be talking a lot at the conference about invigorating democracy,"
Caroline Lucas,"There is a reduction in the diversity of breeds in order to have the fastest growth, and animals are becoming more susceptible to diseases because of the way they are bred and kept. The search for profits leads to animals and then humans becoming more vulnerable. Our current policies are encouraging farming that overlooks basic husbandry."
Caroline Lucas,If you want action on climate change and not spin and rhetoric only the Greens can deliver.
F. L. Lucas,"The two World Wars came in part, like much modern literature and art, because men, whose nature is to tire of everything in turn... tired of common sense and civilization."
F. L. Lucas,"The only hope I can see for the future depends on a wiser and braver use of the reason, not a panic flight from it."
F. L. Lucas,"The most emphatic place in a clause or sentence is the end. This is the climax; and, during the momentary pause that follows, that last word continues, as it were, to reverberate in the reader's mind. It has, in fact, the last word."
F. L. Lucas,Poetry had far better imply things than preach them directly... in the open pulpit her voice grows hoarse and fails.
F. L. Lucas,Most style is not honest enough.
F. L. Lucas,"Apart from a few simple principles, the sound and rhythm of English prose seem to me matters where both writers and readers should trust not so much to rules as to their ears."
F. L. Lucas,And how is clarity to be achieved? Mainly by taking trouble and by writing to serve people rather than to impress them.
F. L. Lucas,"A man can make himself put down what comes, even if it seems nauseating nonsense; tomorrow some of it may not seem wholly nonsense at all."
F. L. Lucas,"At Munich we sold the Czechs for a few months grace, but the disgrace will last as long as history."
George Lucas,"Now that we have digital technology, we can actually do a shot like this, which we struggled and struggled and struggled with back in the old days. So this was a way to make our dreams come true."
George Lucas,Whatever has happened in my quest for innovation has been part of my quest for immaculate reality
George Lucas,"I was very lucky that we were able to create something that stimulated the imagination of young people,"
George Lucas,"This is about training the work force of the future. Most of the world outside Southern California is pretty far ahead, to tell you the truth. Some of these kids are working with these tools in high school. The [next] Spielberg ... isn't using 8-mm [film]; he's using Hi-8 digital video."
George Lucas,"It's animated, ... It's about the Clone Wars. It's got all our characters fighting the dreaded Federation. And at the same time I'm working on 'Indiana Jones' and I'm working on a film called, 'Red Tail,' which is about African-American fighter pilots.'"
George Lucas,"I was hoping it would, you know, gross somewhere around $30 million or something, which is what most science fiction films -- the best ones -- had done."
George Lucas,"In this film, you begin to see that he has a fear of losing things, a fear of losing his mother, and as a result, he wants to begin to control things, he wants to become powerful, and these are not Jedi traits, ... And part of these are because he was starting to be trained so late in life, that he'd already formed these attachments. And for a Jedi, attachment is forbidden."
George Lucas,"I put all of my resources into pushing the evolution in an industry that is notoriously backwards and I enjoy pushing that envelope,"
George Lucas,"You know, they had supply problems and union disputes and a few design problem to work out. So it took longer than you would think, even for The Empire."
George Lucas,You simply have to put one foot in front of the other and keep going. Put blinders on and plow right ahead.
George Lucas,Working hard is very important. You're not going to get anywhere without working extremely hard.
George Lucas,"Working hard is very important. You have to find something that you love enough to be able to take those risks, to be able to jump over the hurdles, to be able to break through the brick walls that are always going to be placed in front of you."
George Lucas,When you are a beginning film maker you are desperate to survive. The most important thing in the end is survival and being able to get to your next picture.
George Lucas,"'Star Wars' is fun, its exciting, its inspirational, and people respond to that. It's what they want."
George Lucas,"Part of the issue of achievement is to be able to set realistic goals, but that's one of the hardest things to do because you don't always know exactly where you're going, and you shouldn't."
George Lucas,Learning to make films is very easy. Learning what to make films about is very hard.
George Lucas,I thought Star Wars was too wacky for the general public.
George Lucas,Film is not an easy occupation. There's a lot of occupations that are difficult and film is one of them.
George Lucas,"Everybody has talent, it's just a matter of moving around until you've discovered what it is."
George Lucas,Even in high school I was very interested in history - why people do the things they do. As a kid I spent a lot of time trying to relate the past to the present.
George Lucas,"Although I write screenplays, I don't think I'm a very good writer."
George Lucas,"A lot of people like to do certain things, but they're not that good at it. Keep going through the things that you like to do, until you find something that you actually seem to be extremely good at. It can be anything."
George Lucas,The ideals and principles for which Dr King fought have never been forgotten and are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago.
George Lucas,He took me from not being able to write a word in terms of writing screenplays to being the king of wooden dialogue.
George Lucas,"If the boy and girl walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand in the last scene, it adds 10 million to the box office."
George Lucas,Whatever has happened in my quest for innovation has been part of my quest for immaculate reality.
George Lucas,Good luck has its storms.
George Lucas,Kurosawa was one of film's true greats. His ability to transform a vision into a powerful work of art is unparalleled. So it seemed appropriate to name the new digital studio for him.
George Lucas,"Kurosawa was one of film's true greats, ... His ability to transform a vision into a powerful work of art is unparalleled. So it seemed appropriate to name the new digital studio for him."
George Lucas,The secret to film is that it's an illusion.
Larry Lucchino,We have enough to worry about in our own camp let alone worrying about what everybody else says in other camps. I take that as an expression of optimism rather than as a prediction.
Larry Lucchino,He has made it clear that he would like us to consider a trade.
Larry Lucchino,"Between them, Ben and Jed have intimate knowledge of every player in our organization, from top to bottom. They complement each other well with their varied experiences."
Larry Lucchino,You mean I have a lifetime job?
Larry Lucchino,"I think that's terrific for Grady, and wish him great good luck. He's not exactly a Hollywood, L.A. type of guy, but he has a kind of versatility that will hold him in good stead."
Larry Lucchino,He was an offensive force. He was a clubhouse leader ... and just a generally good guy. We will miss him.
Larry Lucchino,"He was an offensive force. He was a clubhouse leader. He was a bit of a cult figure who was enormously popular with the women of Red Sox nation and generally a good guy. We urged Johnny that Boston is a great place for him, that he was a beloved figure here. But in the end he was free to make his decision."
Larry Lucchino,"was given a great new opportunity to stay in Atlanta. For that reason and for family considerations, he has withdrawn from consideration."

Larry Lucchino,"For those of us who have been diagnosed with cancer, time is a precious commodity,"
Larry Lucchino,You really should go to the winter meetings armed to do business.
Larry Lucchino,Are we open for business? Are we listening to proposals and possibilities? We are. This is the time of year when you do that. Our guys at the general managers meetings are certainly approaching this subject with an open mind and are willing to sit and talk to people who have an interest in discussing a transaction for Manny or any of our other players.
Larry Lucchino,"In addition to meeting with clubs to discuss trade possibilities, we do expect our baseball operations staff will have conversations with agents for several of our current free agents as well as representatives for other players on this winter's free agent market, ... We hope and expect it will be a useful week for the Red Sox."
Larry Lucchino,"Walls have crumbled, perceptions of one another have changed, and appreciation of one another has grown. As an enhanced sense of 'team' has emerged, we have rediscovered that, whatever our differences may have been, baseball is at the center of our operations and our lives, and working toward the success of the Red Sox is a commitment which all of us share."
Larry Lucchino,An amicable agreement was reached several weeks ago when the suggestion was made that the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum become the custodian of the ball.
Larry Lucchino,"An amicable agreement was reached, and it provides a permanent home at the Hall of Fame."
Lucretius Lucretius,"Pleasant it is, when over a great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon another's great tribulation; not because any man's troubles are a delectable joy, but because to perceive you are free of them yourself is pleasant."
Lucretius Lucretius,It is great wealth to a soul to live frugally with a contented mind.
Lucretius Lucretius,"Though the dungeon, the scourge, and the executioner be absent, the guilty mind can apply the goad and scorch with blows."
Lucretius Lucretius,"Sweet it is, when on the high seas the winds are lashing the waters, to gaze from the land on another's struggles."
Lucretius Lucretius,The sum of all sums is eternity.
Robert Ludlum,Sins of the Fathers ... Cuba problem.
Robert Ludlum,Life is extremely complicated. I try as best I can to enter the realm of nuances of human behavior and alternatives of that behavior.

Robert Ludlum,I have always preferred conflict of individuals over the battle of extreme ideologies.
Robert Ludlum,Greater economic power will be in the hands of too few.
Robert Ludlum,Characterization is integral to the theatrical experience.
Robert Ludlum,A theater person should know what holds an audience and what does not.
Robert Ludlum,That gentleman will call the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I think they're scared of him. They're merely professional killers; he's in advertising!
Joanna Lumley,What's disconcerting is when you do meet them they look at you with your own eyes in a slightly different face.
Joanna Lumley,"Our cottage is high in the hills, not another house in sight, just some sheep, buzzards, running water and meadows of flowers. It's lovely."
Joanna Lumley,You have to feel more involved than just writing out a cheque. Charity is almost the wrong word-I think people are beginning to feel more responsible for the world.
Joanna Lumley,"We transported eight giraffes, and there are now nine because one gave birth to a male shortly afterwards. They carry their pregnancies very well-they all looked the same."
Joanna Lumley,"We met and married when both of us knew exactly what our jobs were. He was only 32, but he'd been all over the place. I'd been working on films and television shows all over the world."
Joanna Lumley,"Though I was a mother at 21, being a grandmother makes the whole thing absolutely normal and gorgeous. The relief, the joy of being a grandmother is wonderful."
Joanna Lumley,The idea of getting married just to make it socially acceptable and then maybe getting divorced later on seems a creepy way to behave.
Joanna Lumley,NASA space scientists have been studying giraffe skin so they can apply what they learn from it to the construction of spacesuits.
Joanna Lumley,In Kenya you've got the great birds and monkeys leaping through the trees overhead. It's a chance to remember what the world is really like.
Joanna Lumley,"If you're an enthusiast and you love the world like I do, it comes naturally. But I think charity must become more fun to give, more interactive and imaginative."
Joanna Lumley,I've never felt the constraints of social acceptability.
Joanna Lumley,"I've got lots of good friends. I could have affairs. I can read a book all night, put the cat on the end of the bed. I can pick up my passport and go to France. I don't have to ask anybody."
Joanna Lumley,"I've been given this blessing, which is my granddaughter. You're no longer just you. You suddenly fit into the chest of drawers of life."
Joanna Lumley,I'm aware of my body.
Joanna Lumley,I would do anything to keep looking the job. I think you make an extra effort if you're on show.
Joanna Lumley,"I never mind scrubbing floors, vacuuming or bending and carrying stuff. Each time I do it I think, this is instead of going to the gym."
Joanna Lumley,I have a toy giraffe on my bed. I've got photographs over my desk as well as a mask of a giraffe in my kitchen. I am totally hooked.
Joanna Lumley,I find it a great antidote... lipstick and mirrors and hairspray.
Joanna Lumley,"I don't think we know what we're going to get, so the idea of looking for somebody can make it wrong. Make friends and get a life."
Joanna Lumley,I don't think men are that attracted by glamour. I think women are attracted by glamour. I think men are attracted by a sense of friendship.
Lydia Lunch,"I'm a very sympathetic person, but that doesn't always come across in my work because I'm too busy being mad at everything."
Lydia Lunch,I think it's important to encourage gluttony in all its formats.
Lydia Lunch,"I think my speeches are hilarious. I think I'm a natural comedian, but I like denying people the chance to laugh. I want to deny you the relief of the punchline."
Lydia Lunch,"The female format is a beautiful one in which to function. Foolhardy as it may be. I change my image all the time, it's whatever suits me at the moment."
Lydia Lunch,"Sure you're powerless, sure you're just one person, sure you can't change anything... but you don't have to be miserable about it as well."
Lydia Lunch,Part of the charm of what I do is the fact that it's completely unrelated to everything that came before.
Lydia Lunch,'Musician' is not a very respected title. I'm not a musician.
Lydia Lunch,Just because my bank account hasn't swelled astronomically I don't consider myself any less of a success.
Lydia Lunch,"If people could understand how much pleasure they could have by themselves, I think everyone would be a lot saner. I think that people really need a dose of quality time with one's self."
Lydia Lunch,"I'm nihilistic, antagonistic, violent, horrible - but not obliterated, yet. I just refuse to be beaten down. I think it's stubborness that keeps me going."
Lydia Lunch,I'm completely optimistic - I know the end is coming!
Lydia Lunch,I'm a total pleasure seeker. I pursue anything that satisfies me. I usually get it. I have specific needs and I know what they are so I can achieve satisfaction.
Lydia Lunch,I would be humiliated if I found out that anything I did actually became a commercial success.
Lydia Lunch,I used to think feminism was a liberating force - now I see many of those people are just censors under a different name.
Lydia Lunch,"I just prefer instrumental. I don't need to hear what other people are singing. And if I need music as a backdrop to work or to think, I need to have that part of the brain clear - I don't need people feeding their fantasies into my vision."
Henrik Lundqvist,They've got a lot of momentum going.
Henrik Lundqvist,I had really bad luck there.
Henrik Lundqvist,"I'm loving it. I'm living my dream,"
Henrik Lundqvist,"We skated so hard, sometimes it looked like they were standing still."
Henrik Lundqvist,I was upset about giving up the goal. It was pretty tough to face the next two. I had to stop them or the game was over.
Henrik Lundqvist,"Technically, I feel good. Mentally, I need to get more focused. I've made some decisions that haven't been good. I've made some mistakes."
Frank Luntz,"I believe that there are things worth explaining and educating, even if it takes months or years."
Frank Luntz,"If you're a good numbers person, you're a bad language person."
Frank Luntz,"In fact, in more cases than not, when we are rational, we're actually unhappy. Emotion is good; passion is good. Being into what we're into, provided that it's a healthy pursuit, it's a good thing."
Frank Luntz,You owe (DeLay) your majority. He's where he is today because he sacrificed himself to gain those extra seats.
Frank Luntz,"That indicated to everyone that all gloves were off. If you're going to go after the president and the administration that way, there are consequences."
Frank Luntz,"The eureka moment is two reasons why the output-based standard should be adopted: common sense and accountability. Input-based standards don't encourage energy diversity; they don't create any incentives; they don't produce solar, hydro, nuclear."
Roberto Luongo,"It was an exhausting game. It was a good night's work. It looked like it was going to overtime, but we got the power play and got a big goal when we needed it."
Roberto Luongo,"They were throwing everything at the net and trying to crash the net. I got lucky a couple of times, made a couple of good saves and that was it."
Roberto Luongo,"It wasn't worse than any other night -- pretty much the same, ... It'd be harder to take if it was a loss, but I just try to stop the puck. I try to do my job and help my teammates out and give them confidence. I can't control what's going on in front of me."
Roberto Luongo,"We had some mental mistakes, myself included."
Roberto Luongo,"I don't want to give out too much information. It's not 100 percent, but as long as I know I can contribute to the team and not be a detriment with an injury, I'll be in there."
Roberto Luongo,"We didn't have a whole lot of hope left, but there was still a little bit. Obviously, after tonight it would take a major miracle, so there's nothing we can do about it but keep fighting and play hard the rest of the year."
Roberto Luongo,All the goals were from 4 or 5 feet in front of me. There was nothing that beat me from that far out. There's going to be games like that in the new NHL.
Roberto Luongo,"I'd like to have the first one back. The last two goals were kind of freaky goals, but what are you going to do? There's nothing to be ashamed about for me."
Roberto Luongo,They can score goals. All of theirs were from four or five feet in front of me.
Roberto Luongo,"You don't want to say anything like that because we still have two games left against them. We've got to win the last two if we want to have a chance to make the playoffs, and to be honest that's all we're thinking about right now. We don't think about stuff in the past and (whether) we beat them or not, because every game is its own game."
Roberto Luongo,"Hopefully it will keep me fresh. We are also not going to play any back-to-back games until this weekend, so that is also going to be [advantageous]."
Roberto Luongo,"Maybe, but in the exhibition games I got scored on a couple of (shootout attempts). So I still have to adjust a couple of things."
Roberto Luongo,He's the backbone of that team right now. He's opening up a lot of eyes around the league.
Roberto Luongo,There are not going to be any excuses for not making the playoffs this year.
Roberto Luongo,The defense was really good. I didn't find myself with that many chances. Even on the power play they didn't have that much.
Roberto Luongo,"In the first 10 minutes, we came out a little flat but we picked it up and took control. We don t have to put on a show every night. We got the two points and everyone's happy."
Roberto Luongo,His confidence level is way up.
Roberto Luongo,"Once you get in a groove early in the game, I start building some confidence. The more the game advances, the harder it is to beat me."
Roberto Luongo,You don't like to win in situations where you allow four goals. But given the circumstances I'm very pleased with the outcome.
Roberto Luongo,We battled hard at the end; it showed character. We were fortunate to get two points tonight.
Roberto Luongo,It's always special to play for Canada and it was nice because I got a chance to play in the Olympics. They didn't have much. I thought we played pretty well as a team.
Roberto Luongo,It was my first time playing in Italy so I was a little nervous at the beginning. I think I'm used to more shots than that [playing in Florida].
Casey Luskin,"The policy we do prefer is that teachers teach both the strengths and the weaknesses of evolution, without getting into replacement theories like intelligent design."
Casey Luskin,"In the larger debate over intelligent design, this decision will be of minor significance. As we've repeatedly stressed, the ultimate validity of intelligent design will be determined not by the courts but by the scientific evidence pointing to design."
Casey Luskin,"We believe evolution should be taught as a scientific theory that is open to critical scrutiny, not as a sacred dogma that can't be questioned."
John Luther,"We can open it up for Razorback games, the Wal-Mart shareholders meeting, whatever. If there's a bad storm coming through, we might just have a few ham radio operators in the building talking to our storm spotter network."

John Luther,We're simulating a real-life disaster to identify the types of situations we could potentially face.

Martin Luther,"Medicine makes people ill, mathematics makes them sad, and theology makes them sinful"

Martin Luther,"In our sad condition, our only consolation is the expectancy of another life. Here below all is incomprehensible."

Martin Luther,Next to theology I give music the highest place of honor.

Martin Luther,"Who loves not wine, women and song, Remains a fool his whole life long"
Martin Luther,"Cannons and fire-arms are cruel and damnable machines; I believe them to have been the direct suggestion of the Devil. If Adam had seen in a vision the horrible instruments his children were to invent, he would have died of grief."
Martin Luther,I more fear what is within me than what comes from without
Martin Luther,"The reproduction of mankind is a great marvel and mystery. Had God consulted me in the matter, I should have advised him to continue the generation of the species by fashioning them out of clay."
Martin Luther,"All who call on God in true faith, earnestly from the heart, will certainly be heard, and will receive what they have asked and desired, although not in the hour or in the measure, or the very thing which they ask. Yet they will obtain something greater and more glorious than they had dared to ask."
Martin Luther,"If he have faith, the believer cannot be restrained. He betrays himself. He breaks out. He confesses and teaches this gospel to the people at the risk of life itself."
Martin Luther,Reason is the enemy of faith
Martin Luther,Faith is permitting ourselves to be seized by the things we do not see.
Martin Luther,"Faith must trample under foot all reason, sense, and understanding."
