'St. Anger' was fun but we don't need to make that album again."

Gene Upshaw,We're further apart now than when we started. For anyone to believe that we're close is just not reality.

What this proves is that you'll eventually get anyone that uses. If you use, we'll find you. You will be found out and then you will suffer the consequences of the program. That's the way it works."
Gene Upshaw,"We're deadlocked. There's nowhere to go. There's no reason to continue meeting. We're too far apart on our economics, and too far apart on revenue sharing, and we'll go to the uncapped year. There won't be an extension."
Gene Upshaw,We're still trying to get our arms around it [the issue of testing]. There's no doubt we believe it should be tested for. And there's no doubt we believe it should be on the banned list.
Gene Upshaw,"We have done everything medically we could do. We have doctors trained in emergency medicine, in heart problems and other specialties standing by at every game. It's not just internists. It's people who know what to do in every emergency. It just wasn't enough."

We do have a group who believes the reason they have success is they're so much smarter than everyone else. I'm not begrudging them for having that thought, but they have to understand where it all came from and why."
Gene Upshaw,"He piled on. He went beyond what we have in the agreement. When I have an arbitrator go beyond the agreement, I have no choice. Clearly, when you look at this case, his decision even went beyond what the Eagles said in their legal briefs."

Keith Urban,"I think it took me a while to convince Nashville that what I do is genuine and my heart's in the right place, and I love country music."
Brian Urlacher,It's a little different trying to run the ball with eight guys in the box. The Vikings haven't had to face that because of the Randy Moss factor.
Brian Urlacher,"I love when people pick against us because we just go out and prove them wrong. In training camp, there was no doubt in anyone's mind we had the personnel to do it. It was just a matter of staying healthy and going out there and doing it. Knock on wood, we stayed healthy, and it's been a fun season for us so far."
Brian Urlacher,"This is tough for our team, too, because he was one of our leaders. One of the emotional guys out there on the field. He's just an unbelievable guy. At least he didn't injure himself bad. I know that's a blessing for him."

Brian Urlacher,Thank goodness [Moss] is gone so we can do different things to them now. We can put eight guys in the box now. We used to just play cover-2 pretty much the whole game and let them gash us in the running game. I think we'll be able to change that up a little bit.
Brian Urlacher,"We can win these games,"
Brian Urlacher,"Even though you're not in the game, you still like to win and see your teammates do well, so it was a little frustrating. But at the same time, we got out of this game healthy with the people we need to get to the Super Bowl, and that's the number one goal we wanted to take into the playoffs."
Brian Urlacher,There was no doubt in anyone's mind we had the personnel to do it.
Brian Urlacher,"No one believed us back then, but there was really no doubt in our mind how good we can be."
Brian Urlacher,"Today, our defense flew around and had a good time. It was fun out there."
Ivan Urlaub,"We have limited knowledge, or else science and philosophy would not be necessary."
Ivan Urlaub,"If intelligence is the ability to adapt to change, then wisdom is to know how and why to adapt for more than personal or economic gain."
Ivan Urlaub,"Why should humans in their unsurity decide what species are and are not important to humans? Is nature's characteristic ability to naturally select species not the most perfect decision maker we humans have access to on this issue? Just as we expect human children to respect their human elders, let us humans collectively respect our significant elder--Nature."

Andrew Vachss,I'm in pursuit of what cannot be achieved: perfection.
Andrew Vachss,I think people should be consumers of journalism.

Andrew Vachss,I don't take advances for my books.
Andrew Vachss,I don't sign contracts for my books.

James Valentine,"It is a very interesting piece, he says. It has been around a long time and this is a particularly good, vital and lively production full of laughs, gayety and a lot of wit. I think part of the intrigue of the play and the plot is the relationship with Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins. Pickering is always there as a kind of buffer, soother of egos, perhaps. And it's just a very good dramatic piece of theatre."

And there's any number of people who will tell you how great you are in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary."

This combined FBC/CWMF technology is especially suited to solving the challenging problem of delivering a reliable pollution control solution which can be easily retrofitted for the older, higher-emission diesel engines expected to be in service for years to come. CDT will be offering licensing opportunities and technology transfer programs for the CWMF technology to establish manufacturing and distribution partnerships that meet worldwide retrofit and original equipment manufacturer needs."

Jim Valvano,"Now, I look at where I am now and I know what I wanna to do. What I would like to be able to do is to spend whatever time I have left and to give, and maybe some hope to others."
Jim Valvano,It's so important to know where you are.
Jim Valvano,"If you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full day. That's a heck of a day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to have something special."
Jim Valvano,"I'll also tell you that five hundred thousand people will die this year of cancer. And I'll also tell you that one in every four will be afflicted with this disease, and yet, somehow, we seem to have put it in a little bit of the background."
Jim Valvano,I will thank God for the day and the moment I have.
Jim Valvano,"I talked about my family, my family's so important."
Jim Valvano,"How do you go from where you are to where you wanna be? And I think you have to have an enthusiasm for life. You have to have a dream, a goal. And you have to be willing to work for it."
Jim Valvano,Don't give up. Don't ever give up.
Jim Valvano,"Cancer can take away all of my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, it cannot touch my heart, and it cannot touch my soul."
Jim Valvano,"And if you see me, smile and maybe give me a hug. That's important to me too."
Jim Valvano,"And I'm going to work as hard as I can... for cancer research and hopefully, maybe, we'll have some cures and some breakthroughs. I'd like to think I'm going to fight my brains out to be back here again next year for the Arthur Ashe recipient. I want to give it next year!"
Jim Valvano,"I just got one last thing, I urge all of you, all of you, to enjoy your life, the precious moments you have. To spend each day with some laughter and some thought, to get you're emotions going."
Jim Valvano,"I can't tell you what an honor it is, to even be mentioned in the same breath with Arthur Ashe. This is something I certainly will treasure forever."
Jim Valvano,"Now I'm fighting cancer, everybody knows that. People ask me all the time about how you go through your life and how's your day, and nothing is changed for me."
Jim Valvano,"But try if you can to support, whether it's AIDS or the cancer foundation, so that someone else might survive, might prosper, and might actually be cured of this dreaded disease."
Jim Valvano,"Be a dreamer. If you don't know how to dream, you're dead."

Jim Valvano,"My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me."
Kevin VanDam,We are like a second family; we spend so much time in the same places. It helps to have friends out there to accomplish anything from things as simple as going out to dinner and picking up laundry to telling each other where the best ramps are or even where to get a fishing license. That's when you look to your team: for those non-fishing-related things.
Kevin VanDam,It's a very exciting experience to take center court with the likes of Shaq right before tip-off. It was great to be a part of the festivities and it is a real honor for our sport.
Kevin VanDam,"It's great to see their enthusiasm. The learning curve's a lot steeper for them, being out there with a pro. It means so much to the kids, but it's really exciting for all of us."

Nicole Vanderbilt,"If they do not shift their efforts to alleviate technology issues and improve customer service in the coming months, they risk losing the customers they spent so much to acquire."
Nicole Vanderbilt,Consumers don't feel like they're being had because there's more information available.
Nicole Vanderbilt,"Consumers are far more sensitive with buying gifts than they are with buying personal items. They're more concerned in making sure items arrive on time, if they're damaged, those kinds of issues."
Mike Vanderjagt,"When you kick 250 field goals for an organization, you are going to have some good ones and bad kicks. This was a bad one."
Mike Vanderjagt,"Peyton is the Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan of football. I'd give him a little leeway. . ."
Mike Vanderjagt,I don't accept failure. I have no idea what happened. The snap was good. The hold was good.
Mike Vanderjagt,"I hit it good, but it wasn't even close. I looked up and couldn't believe it. I have no idea why it went where it went. I would've bet a lot of money that ball was going in. I can't explain it."
Kiki Vandeweghe,"We have great security here. They responded very, very quickly. They are, in my view, some of the best in the business."
Kiki Vandeweghe,"The first reaction is you hope he's OK, and he is, and that's great news. I have talked to him. He's doing well. Obviously, he's a little shaken up. But he's doing fine."
Kiki Vandeweghe,"He's got a lot of skill in spotting talent, and he's got a lot of experience."
Kiki Vandeweghe,"Everybody is very happy. No doubt Buck could have signed for more elsewhere, but what a statement he made (by returning)."
Kiki Vandeweghe,"I don't know where it turns out. Some of the decisions are harder than others. With any team, there's going to be changes."
Kiki Vandeweghe,"It's my job to worry about that stuff, of course. The common ground is they love basketball, they're both passionate about the game, both want to win. Starting from there, there is hope."
Kiki Vandeweghe,He got a great (recent) MRI report. My suggestion is to see how it goes. That would be my advice. Not to rush back. But not to make any quick decisions and see how it goes. Because you can never tell what happens in a month.
Raoul Vaneigem,Work to survive; survive by consuming; survive to consume:  the hellish cycle is complete
Raoul Vaneigem,Who wants a world in which the guarantee that we shall not die of starvation entails the risk of dying of boredom?
Raoul Vaneigem,"The same people who are murdered slowly in the mechanized slaughterhouses of work are also arguing, singing, drinking, dancing, making love, holding the streets, picking up weapons and inventing a new poetry."
Raoul Vaneigem,"Ideally a book would have no order in it, and the reader would have to discover his own."

Raoul Vaneigem,"We can escape the commonplace only by manipulating it, controlling it, thrusting it into our dreams or surrendering it to the free play of our subjectivity."
Raoul Vaneigem,"People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have a corpse in their mouth."

Elizabeth Vargas,I'm very thankful. The generosity is overwhelming. It's good to see there are people willing to help.
Elizabeth Vargas,They would tell you that they were just doing their soldierly duty. But in doing so they remind us again what a remarkable group of people can accomplish under the greatest of pressure and we are grateful.
Elizabeth Vargas,We're way overdue on a woman sitting in one of those Big Three chairs.
Jason Vargas,It just goes to show how much talent there is in our minor-league system.
Jason Vargas,"That's my whole goal to contribute, keep my team in the ball game, and win ball games. We're out here to win."
Jason Vargas,"I think of Jered as another regular guy. He was highly sought-after coming out of college. On the field, he's a great guy. Off the field, he's a great guy. We just push for each other. We kind of think of each other as friends. If we ever had to go head-to-head, then, yeah, we'd compete."
Jason Vargas,"He's a great guy to throw to. I've thrown to him a couple of years now between college and the Minors, and he's a great guy behind the plate. I trust throwing to him. His size hasn't been an issue for me. He just might not have grown into his body yet. He's still young, like all of us here. But he's learned how to call and catch from a great pitching coach [Troy Buckley at LBS]. And for me, personally, he calls a good game."
Jason Varitek,"He's done such a good job trying to make the organization better and the team better at the big-league level. It's going to be very tough to see a guy like him go, especially at a time like this."
Jason Varitek,"It's all about making sure his knee is healthy and everything. He's still getting his pitching strength back. I'm sure [Foulke's knee isn't] like it's going to feel six months from now in any way, shape or form."
Jason Varitek,"What I think and what goes on is not public knowledge. Good or bad, it's handled in here. That's all I can really tell you without telling you too much."

Jason Varitek,That was a huge course of events.
Jason Varitek,We played motivated baseball.
Jhonen Vasquez,Why does this person who is sitting behind a desk and never watches cartoons is arguing about what cartoons should be like. Its so creepy realizing that this person is a lunatic.
Jhonen Vasquez,When I'm writing the book I'm laughing at just how overblown the characters seemed. How full of himself he seems. But I didn't get far enough in the series to really drive the joke of it home.
Jhonen Vasquez,Usually when I get a letter from a parent it's because they buy my stuff. I don't really get a whole lot of negative response in general.
Jhonen Vasquez,Some robot who never made me laugh didn't think was funny or didn't think the audience would understand. I guess that's television.
Jhonen Vasquez,Retro looking stuff but a lot of these guys doing these shows are my age or younger. I was just disgusted. I hated being around that kind of thing. Not that it affected what I did because when it comes down to it I was doing my own show.
Jhonen Vasquez,Johnny was the very first book I did.
Jhonen Vasquez,"It's sort of what the Johnny and Devi stories are about, the idea of always being a slave to something."
Jhonen Vasquez,In certain ways it is incredibly damaging considering the stuff I did before certainly wasn't for kids.
Jhonen Vasquez,I'm just doing little bits and pieces for other magazines right now.
Jhonen Vasquez,"I'm definitely incredibly attracted to the aesthetic of what is typically deemed goth stuff, but. A lot of my experience growing up was in being around that kind of thing, and it's just what sinks into a person's brain."
Jhonen Vasquez,I think there is something a little too self conscious about enjoying being an outsider.
Jhonen Vasquez,I take little bits and pieces of ideas that I may or may not believe in but I give them to this character and he runs with them. I have fun with however he handles the situation.
Jhonen Vasquez,"I love the show and a lot of what came out of it, like some of the people I met and got to work with, but those were truly some of the unhappiest days of my life."
Jhonen Vasquez,"I got to draw monsters, robots and write funny stories. I loved doing that stuff and working with the actors. But it got to be less and less that stuff and more about trying to be everywhere and not being able to do one thing very enjoyably."
Jhonen Vasquez,I don't want little kids reading my comics.
Jhonen Vasquez,I could go through a lot of my old emails from when I first started doing comics. Back then the lowest age of fans was like 15 or 16 up to people in their 20's and 30's.
Jhonen Vasquez,"Goth culture, as mired in the past as it is, even it goes through changes, so Goth when I was growing up is not what it is now. When I think of Goth culture as it is at the moment I think of mall culture."
Jhonen Vasquez,Ever since I'm done with Zim everyone thinks that I'm going to go back to comics. I've been flooded with emails asking me if I'm working on the new Johnny over and over again.
Jhonen Vasquez,"But I couldn't draw as fast as she requested. Thus, I tried to create the worst abomination of a comic that I could, so as to make her not want comics anymore. That abomination, my friends, was Happy Noodle Boy."
Jhonen Vasquez,Because of the audience I get and the fact that these people aren't traditional comics buyers I don't think the comic industry looks at that and thinks that is a very respectable thing. I'm very used to it. I'm not the guy who wins awards and gets mentioned in magazines.
Jhonen Vasquez,At this very moment I'm behind on a compilation that Slave Labor is doing for Free Comic Book Day.
Jhonen Vasquez,As I got farther and farther along in the series I did less and less preparation. I didn't use outlines or sketches. I just had a vague idea of what I wanted to tell and then the dialogue just came to me as I was inking the page.
Jhonen Vasquez,All the power to them but I'm not interested in making yet another show that looks like some other show.
Jhonen Vasquez,"After doing Johnny I wanted to just do something, I wouldn't say innocent, but to not have any care in the world. Lots of setups and horrible happenings but its funny."
Jhonen Vasquez,But now I have a lot of little kids who watched Invader Zim whenever they could find it on television.
Michael Vaughan,"This is so special to come to the palace, meeting the queen here and being here with all the rest of the boys."
Michael Vaughan,"This is so special to come to the palace, meeting the Queen here and being here with all the rest of the boys. She was saying she watched the series avidly - but not all the time, because it all got too tense for her and was a bit nerve-wracking. It is fantastic to be here for the whole side."
Michael Vaughan,We can't go anywhere without people wishing us luck. It's great to know that the nation will be right behind us when we take on the Aussies.

Michael Vaughan,"I fully expected two more hard days of cricket, but I said before the match that it needed a couple of magical performances and, thankfully for us, Steve produced one today."
Michael Vaughan,It was a fantastic game of cricket and we came within a wicket of going 2-1 up. I'm very pleased with the team and the way we dominated the whole match against a tough Australian side. Three weeks ago we were written off and 5-0 we kept hearing. There are a few tired bodies and minds on both teams but it's great the way this series has got the nation talking about it.
Michael Vaughan,"I just feel unfit to play cricket at the moment though I'd want to be available for both forms of the game. One of my ambitions is to go with England to the World Cup and do very well, which we haven't done for a long time. Of course I'd compromise if the specialists recommended that I give up one-day cricket."
Michael Vaughan,"South Africa played the better cricket over the five day and put us under a lot of pressure,"
Michael Vaughan,I'm baffled by the international standard of cricket
Michael Vaughan,It's a bit of a lottery but we played some good cricket. Today was our day. I don't think it will have any impact on the five-day matches to come.
Michael Vaughan,"Cricket has captured the imagination of the nation, this if fantastic, beyond a dream. When England players win at any sport, the fans are the best in the world."
Michael Vaughan,"[The obvious question on everyone's lips is now: Can England win the Ashes.] We're playing good cricket, ... Challenges have been thrown at us over the last few weeks and we've done alright in the last few. The Oval I'm sure will be an epic like the last three. Can we do it for the last game? I'm not too sure if we can but sure we will do."
Michael Vaughan,"Along with the rest of the country, I will be following the team's progress in the final Test with great interest and wish you the best of luck in your battle to regain the Ashes."
Michael Vaughan,"We've not won here for 21 years, that should come as an incentive to the boys."
Michael Vaughan,"I think the newspaper headline might have over-exaggerated the comments in the book,"
Michael Vaughan,"My warmest congratulations to you, the England cricket team and all in the squad for the magnificent achievement of regaining the Ashes."

Bill Vaughn,A real patriot is the fellow who gets a parking ticket and rejoices that the system works.

Bill Vaughn,"Suburbia is where the developer bulldozes out the trees, then names the streets after them."
Bill Vaughn,It would be nice if the poor were to get even half of the money that is spent in studying them.
Bill Vaughn,Maybe the answer to Selective Service is to start everyone off in the army and draft them for civilian life as needed.
Bill Vaughn,"Now that women are jockeys, baseball umpires, atomic scientists, and business executives, maybe someday they can master parallel parking."
Bill Vaughn,The groundhog is like most other prophets; it delivers its prediction and then disappears.
Bill Vaughn,"If there is anything the nonconformist hates worse than a conformist, it's another nonconformist who doesn't conform to the prevailing standard of nonconformity."
Bill Vaughn,An optimist stays up until midnight to see the new year in. A pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves.
Bill Vaughn,"We hope that, when the insects take over the world, they will remember with gratitude how we took them along on all our picnics."
Bill Vaughn,A citizen of America will cross the ocean to fight for democracy but won't cross the street to vote in a national election
Bill Vaughn,By the time you're eighty years old you've learned everything. You only have to remember it.
Bill Vaughn,Youth is when you're allowed to stay up late on New Year's Eve. Middle age is when you're forced to.
Vince Vaughn,You don't worry about being liked. You have to be yourself.
Vince Vaughn,"I never heard of anyone crashing a wedding, but the producer of the movie who developed it, he said that when he was younger, he did crash weddings."
Vince Vaughn,It's really nice that the truth can finally come out.
Vince Vaughn,I loved Old School. I thought Old School was very different than a lot of the comedies that had come out. And that character I liked. I tried to ground him very much in reality and play him very much finding things important to him that are somewhat ridiculous.
Vince Vaughn,"My sense of humor has served me well,"
Vince Vaughn,They're all really funny.
Vince Vaughn,"I thought it would be fun to start in Hollywood and take a road trip to a lot of the great places in California,"
Vince Vaughn,kind of like a traveling comedy circus.
Vince Vaughn,"You know, the better scripts I've seen lately have been comedy scripts."
Vince Vaughn,"They're all regulars at the world famous Comedy Store in Los Angeles, ... They've been on 'The Tonight Show,' they've been on 'Premium Blend' on Comedy Central, they've been in movies and television shows, and they're all really great stand-ups."
Vince Vaughn,"It's a great chance to get on the bus and drive across America,"
Marquis De Vauvenargues,Great thoughts always come from the heart.
Marquis De Vauvenargues,All grand thoughts come from the heart.
Marquis De Vauvenargues,"When a thought is too weak to be expressed simply, it should be rejected."
Marquis De Vauvenargues,Men sometimes feel injured by praise because it assigns a limit to their merit; few people are modest enough not to take offense that one appreciates them.
Marquis De Vauvenargues,There is nothing that fear and hope does not permit men to do.

Atharva Veda,"At night, when you retire to sleep, feel that you are entering the green-room after the scene, but with the dress of your role on; for perhaps the role is not yet over and you have not yet been permitted to take the dress off. Perhaps, you have to make another entrance the next morning. Do not worry about that. Place yourself fully at His Disposal; He knows; He has written the play and He knows how it will end and how it will go on; Yours is but to act and retire."

Atharva Veda,"You know only the present and what is happening before your eyes. You do not know that the present is related to the past and is preparing the course of the future. It is like the headlines and titles of a film on the screen; as the letters gleam one after the other, you read them and pass on to the next that comes to view.

Mike Veeck,"I'd walk into the park with him. He'd be holding my hand and he had this funny gait, and everyone would say hello to him: the vendors, the security guy, the receptionist.

Ken Venturi,There are two great rules of life: never tell everything at once
Ken Venturi,It was my last hurrah to win in my hometown. Harding was a special place to say goodbye.
Ken Venturi,"In those days, it was as good as any country club around, ... The golf course was immaculate. Everyone really took care of it, they fixed their ball marks and divots. And if someone did not [fix the course], they were told about it and they did not make the mistake again."
Ken Venturi,"Nobody, not even Palmer, is bigger than the Game, ... I firmly believe that he did wrong and that he knows that I know he did wrong."
Ken Venturi,There are two great rules of life: never tell everything at once.
Ken Venturi,Victory is everything. You can spend the money but you can never spend the memories.
Ken Venturi,I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.
Guy Verhofstadt,"Let us face it: in the world today, money and economic strength remain more powerful arguments than the number of people you represent."
Guy Verhofstadt,The idea that the world can unite without being regulated is clearly an illusion.
Guy Verhofstadt,"The people's patience is at its end. Our economy, the prosperity of our people, is in danger."
Guy Verhofstadt,"There is a crisis,"
Guy Verhofstadt,"The conviction that ideas which threaten our freedom, our democracy and our families can never be allowed to win."
Dick Vermeil,There are a lot of votes in this building. There are a lot of opinions.
Dick Vermeil,"Many times, early losses can put so much pressure on the younger quarterback that he never really gets a chance to grow. The big thing in developing a quarterback is patience. If you thought he was good enough in the first place, then ..."
Dick Vermeil,I remember how I felt after the last play. It made all the stress and the hard work worthwhile.
Dick Vermeil,We picked a guy that can make a more immediate impact to the success of our football team now than anybody we would have picked in the first round. There wasn't anybody in the first round who could come in and do for us what Trent Green can do for us. That's a fact.
Dick Vermeil,"I think our defense is better than we played (Monday) night and I think our offense is better, but obviously we proved we don't play super every weekend, ... They whipped me, they whipped my coaches and they whipped my football team."
Dick Vermeil,We've got to go down there and be the best football team they could send down there. There's an opportunity to go win a football game.
Dick Vermeil,"We took the ball away and won the football game. If we don't take it away, we don't win the game."
Dick Vermeil,"They couldn't have picked a better team to send down there and play well ? that's the way we're approaching it. We'll go down there and play our best football game of the year. The guys are in a good frame of mind. They accept it. We would have liked it to be a different way, but we have no choice."
Dick Vermeil,"We just did not play well ... just multiple things, multiple wounds. Best thing about the game is that I don't think we got anybody injured. We got some feelings hurt, but I don't thing anybody got injured."
Dick Vermeil,Obviously we weren't getting it done going in the direction we were going. We had to make some changes and spend some money and when we went after somebody we had to get them. We've gone after defensive players before and didn't get them. This year we got a few of them.
Dick Vermeil,We felt we actually got things going in the right direction last week. We won the football game last week and lost. That was one we felt we should have won. We dominated the game and we lost. [Monday] we dominated the game and we won.
Dick Vermeil,"Common sense would tell you that when you see your starting quarterback out there practicing, and knowing what he has gone through and all the little concerns and all the things you think about when you go through what he went through, it's a relief to see him back on the field and having fun and throwing the ball down field 50 yards, strikes, ... I think that's all behind us now."
Dick Vermeil,"If you don't invest very much, then defeat doesn't hurt very much and winning is not very exciting."
Dick Vermeil,"A position isn't going to be handed to him in a Christmas package. He's going to have to compete, and he knows that. I didn't really actively recruit hard to get this guy. I wanted him to come on his own."
Dick Vermeil,"He's got good hands. He's got a feel for the game. To my knowledge, he's never been the starter. That's the difference now, he is the starter. He is our guy. We expect him to step up and play like that athlete that you all saw out there."
Dick Vermeil,"He?s big, strong and fast. He runs with anger. He?s mad when he carries the ball. You don?t see him duck and dive."
Dick Vermeil,"The ability of the defensive teams to take away what you do is much greater in the NFL than in college. What you do well now, they might eliminate on Sunday. So you've got to make sure you can keep branching off onto other things."
Dick Vermeil,"The ability of the defensive teams to take away what you do is much greater in the NFL than in college, ... What you do well now, they might eliminate on Sunday. So you've got to make sure you can keep branching off onto other things."
Dick Vermeil,"He has the ability to slow the game down, and he executes extremely well, ... He has to have a supporting cast, and I'm talking about the offensive line. Quarterbacks like Kurt Warner need good pass protection. He's not going to panic. He's going to hold onto the ball and go through the progressions."
Jules Verne,"Was I to believe him in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this massive globe? Had I been listening to the mad speculations of a lunatic, or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius? Where did truth stop? Where did error begin?"

Jules Verne,Liberty is worth paying for.
Jules Verne,"Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls."
Jules Verne,"The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we going now, and what was reserved for the future?"
Jules Verne,"Science, my lad, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth."
Jules Verne,"We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer."
Jules Verne,"On the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds- a thick and impenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily extended as far as the Rocky Mountains. It was a fatality!"
Jules Verne,"I believe cats to be spirits come to earth. A cat, I am sure, could walk on a cloud without coming through."
Jules Verne,"We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones."
Jules Verne,"The sea is everything. It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all sides."
Scott Verplank,"Oh, they have potential to burn. This should be a good year. This is an odd year, right? And every odd year, they seem to do a good job."
Scott Verplank,"For the most part, depending on the conditions, the golf course still lends itself to a large variety of players being able to do well and possibly win the golf tournament. You know, we don't get that very many weeks anymore."
Scott Verplank,"The way golf has changed, my game still works. There's just barely enough skill left in the game where I can still play."
Scott Verplank,"None of us played any good, to be honest. When the wind picks up, the golf course changes immensely."
Scott Verplank,I feel good about the way I'm scoring. My golf swing still feels like I took two months off.
Scott Verplank,"None of us played any good, to be honest. The wind picked up, the golf course changes immensely. I was just a little quick. I don't know whether it was the wind or nerves or whatever it was."
Scott Verplank,"I always enjoy coming out here. I have a lot of friends out here. I've played the tournament a number of times. So really, I'm just going to hope that the weather stays great the week we're here."
Scott Verplank,I think it's a step in the right direction. It rewards a guy playing well at that time.
Gianni Versace,"For me, the summer will be pure gray -- mother-of-pearl gray, very pale gray. To me, this is the big statement for summer. Then we have light blue, light turquoise, lots of pink."
Gianni Versace,"I don't want to suggest go shorter (because) I invented long. It's become so pretentious in fashion, but it's about educating the style of the people. And people have to educate themselves and express their individuality."
Gianni Versace,"That is the key of this collection, being yourself. Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live."
Gianni Versace,"My dream was always to be a composer, but fashion came very easily."
Gianni Versace,"What women need today is classic things with an age, with fantasy, with a quality. Dresses you can live with. Sometimes it's the fabrics who win, sometimes it's the shape, but I always rework on themes that make Versace a classic name with serenity."
Gianni Versace,I like the body. I like to design everything to do with the body.
Alexander Vershbow,"The United States, like other U.N. members and especially as a Security Council member, will keep its cards close to the vest in terms of its preferences until very late in the process."
Alexander Vershbow,The United States is eager to resume negotiations as soon as possible so that we can make rapid progress toward the elimination of North Korea's nuclear programs. Our negotiators are packed and ready to go.
Alexander Vershbow,We have a lot of hard work ahead of us and I look forward to working with you to clear the way and the obstacles.
Alexander Vershbow,"Koreans - whose food bill as a percentage of income is higher than for citizens of almost all other OECD members - will enjoy lower food prices and a greater selection of fruits and vegetables. Money saved on food can be invested in education, leisure, and cutting-edge IT services - exactly the type of sectors that need to grow to provide future generations with well-paying jobs."
Alexander Vershbow,The key thing we want to see is consistency and application of the laws and regulations as they were written.
Marshall Vest,"A mild winter has allowed the U.S. to avoid much higher energy prices, particularly for natural gas and home heating oil, which could have seriously slowed the expansion. As we head into the spring quarter, the nation's economy is essentially at full capacity with growing pressures on inflation."
Marshall Vest,"The Fed has been right there to catch the economy. We may live in a riskier world, but we've entered a period of longer expansions with shorter, milder recessions."
Marshall Vest,"The world economy has become much more open and global. Greenspan was in favor of all that, as most economists are."
Marshall Vest,Land is beginning to be a problem.
Boris Vian,"There are only two things: love, all sorts of love, with pretty girls, and the music of New Orleans or Duke Ellington. Everything else ought to go, because everything else is ugly."
Boris Vian,"The three great moments of my life had to be the concerts of Ellington in 1938, Dizzy in '48, and Ella in '52."
Boris Vian,"The problem is the following, black music is increasing encumbered by white elements, often pleasant but always superfluous, easily and advantageously replaced with black elements."
Boris Vian,"One ends up relying on pure musical inspiration, and failing that, the music won't lead to anything good, or it will alienate all but the most die-hard fans."
Boris Vian,"Of course, it's fun to play with Blacks."
Boris Vian,"I played the trumpet a bit like a porker, I think."
Boris Vian,Have you noticed with inflexible necessity of the me to insert itself between the sol which precedes it and the sol which follows it.
Sid Vicious,I got that job.
Sid Vicious,"I just cash in on the fact that I'm good looking, and I've got a nice figure and girls like me."
Sid Vicious,"I'm not chic, I could never be chic."
Sid Vicious,I'm not vicious really. I consider myself to be kindhearted. I love my mum.
Sid Vicious,"We're really quite nice and friendly, but everyone has a beastly side to them, don't they?"
Sid Vicious,"I'll die before I'm 25, and when I do I'll have lived the way I wanted to."
Sid Vicious,"You can't arrest me, I'm a rockstar."
Sid Vicious,"You just pick up a chord, go twang, and you're got music."
Sid Vicious,I've only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror.
Sid Vicious,"The band broke up because I couldn't bear Rotten anymore because he was an embarrassment with his silly hats and his, like, shabby, dirty, nasty looking appearance."
Sid Vicious,"(Sid's suicide note:)WE HAD A DEATHPACT I HAVE TO KEEPMY HALF OF THEBARGAIN.PLEASE BURY MEPTONEXT TO MY BABY.BURY ME IN MYLEATHER JACKET,JEANS AND MOTORCYCLE BOOTSGOODBYE"
Sid Vicious,"Today everything's a conflict of interest,"
Sid Vicious,American audiences are just the same as any other audiences. Except a bit more boring.
Marcus Vick,One fumble slipped out of my hands. The other fumbles was my ball security and me being reckless out there.
Marcus Vick,I have never owned a gun. I don't carry a gun. I have no idea why the police came to my house and arrested me later that night. I had a cell phone and someone mistook for a gun. Guns are dangerous. You never know when they might go off.
Marcus Vick,That kind of hurts me. Maurice and Lawrence were definitely guys who had a bad past. They're not even in the league anymore. But I'm a hard worker. I'm going to keep on fighting through my ups and downs. That's the difference between me and them.
Marcus Vick,"We got the win, so it doesn't matter, ... But otherwise, the three interceptions made my night terrible. I don't like that at all."
Marcus Vick,I really can't tell yet how people feel about me. But why wouldn't people have an open mind about me? I'm not a bad guy and I plan to tell the truth.
Marcus Vick,"I don't feel like I was forcing things. Sometimes I had to get rid of the ball and hope my receivers made a play. Unfortunately, they didn't."
Marcus Vick,I embarrassed my family. My family didn't speak to me for weeks after that.
Marcus Vick,"I love my older brother. He paved my life for me. He put my whole family on his back in college. But there's ups and downs with that. When things are going good, he's a great person to have as your brother. When bad things happen, everybody knows about it."
Marcus Vick,"I apologize for letting my emotions get the best of me Saturday, ... What I did was wrong and I am sorry."
Marcus Vick,"It was everything I expected, ... I could've done a little better throwing the ball. But they have a great defense."
Marcus Vick,The defense has been giving us great opportunities.
Marcus Vick,"I feel very in control. It's just breaking the huddles and getting the guys to the huddle, and getting a snap count called correctly and know where to go with the ball."
Marcus Vick,"This gives our guys a lot of confidence, by getting two wins in other people's stadiums. It's going to be big when we go back home (this) week."
Marcus Vick,"It seems they put all their confidence into their cornerbacks, so we're really going to see how good they are,"
Marcus Vick,Beamer said. ''They're winning kids. They're humble kids. They've got a lot of ability. You like being around them. They're in control on the field. That's about everything you like out of a quarterback.
Michael Vick,I can't put it into words. It's an adrenaline rush. I think you have to be a quarterback with scrambling ability to understand it.
Michael Vick,the biggest drive we've had all year. It was the moment of truth.
Michael Vick,To have the kick blocked. It kind of put everything into perspective - like maybe it just ain't our year. Things are not going the right way for us.
Michael Vick,It wasn't how it was drawn up. I had to make some extra moves. ... Tried to make some magic.
Michael Vick,"I think I have a lot of learning to do. Back at Virginia Tech, I threw the ball enough, but not as much as I would have liked to. I think in the NFL you have a lot more chances to throw the football downfield. It's going to be a challenge."
Michael Vick,"I think that is our identity, ... We run the football whether it's Warrick, T.J. or me. That's what makes our game go. If that's the way it's going to be, as long as we keep winning and as long as I make my plays when I have to, things are all good."
Michael Vick,I don't know what's going to happen. You never know. I can't put my faith in any team. You have to be alert for all things. I'm just playing it by ear and I'm not predicting anything.
Michael Vick,That's tough. We weren't prepared for that. We didn't play a game all year in the cold weather. Its not an excuse. We still had a chance to win the game. But it was tough.
Michael Vick,"Sometimes your emotions just take over. I know Marcus. He's not the kind of kid that's going to do something like that on purpose. That's just something he's got to live with, and now it's just time to move on."
Michael Vick,"The way I feel and from what the doctors tell me, I don't feel like it's serious. We just took the precaution to come out."
Queen Victoria,"Men never think, at least seldom think, what a hard task it is for us women to go through this very often. God's will be done, and if He decrees that we are to have a great number of children why we must try to bring them up as useful and exemplary members of society."
Queen Victoria,"What you say of the pride of giving life to an immortal soul is very fine dear, but I own I cannot enter into that: I think much more of our being like a cow or a dog at such moments: when our poor nature becomes so very animal and unecstatic"
Queen Victoria,Do not to let your feelings (very natural and usual ones) of momentary irritation and discomfort be seen by others; don't (as you so often did and do) let every little feeling be read in your face and seen in your manner . . .
Queen Victoria,"None of you can ever be proud enough of being the child of SUCH a Father who has not his equal in this world -- so great, so good, so faultless. Try, all of you, to follow in his footsteps and don't be discouraged, for to be really in everything like him none of you, I am sure, will ever be. Try, therefore, to be like him in some points, and you will have acquired a great deal."
Queen Victoria,Great events make me quiet and calm; it is only trifles that irritate my nerves.
Queen Victoria,We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat. They do not exist.
Queen Victoria,An ugly baby is a very nasty object - and the prettiest is frightful.
Queen Victoria,"I don't dislike babies, though I think very young ones rather disgusting."
Queen Victoria,"The great event of the evening was Jenny Lind's appearance and her complete triumph. She has a most exquisite, powerful and really quite peculiar voice, so round, soft and flexible and her acting is charming and touching and very natural."
Shane Victorino,I was in middle-school - or younger - when Kenny started playing and he's been a great player all these years.
Shane Victorino,"That's one thing that he wants us to do here, play solid. Making little mistakes here and there will cost runs. That's what he wants to stress more than anything else. Wins look good, but if you don't do everything fundamentally sound, you're not getting anything out of the spring."
Shane Victorino,"From everything I've heard and read, I feel comfortable. But no one from management told me I'm the fourth outfielder, so I'm a little on edge."
Shane Victorino,I hope that's what is going to happen. A little play like (Rollins' hustle play) changed the whole aspect of the game.
Shane Victorino,"It's in his character. He wants to be that guy. He wants to carry that load, and that's a special characteristic to have."
Gore Vidal,"Each writer is born with a repertory company in his head. Shakespeare has perhaps 20 players, and Tennessee Williams has about 5, and Samuel Beckett one -- and maybe a clone of that one. I have 10 or so, and that's a lot. As you get older, you become more skillful at casting them."
Gore Vidal,It makes no difference whom you vote for -- the two parties are really one party representing four percent of the people.
Gore Vidal,"It is marvelous indeed to watch on television the rings of Saturn close; and to speculate on what we may yet find at galaxy's edge. But in the process, we have lost the human element; not to mention the high hope of those quaint days when flight would create ''one world.'' Instead of one world, we have ''star wars,'' and a future in which dumb dented human toys will drift mindlessly about the cosmos long after our small planet's dead."
Gore Vidal,Laughing at someone else is an excellent way of learning how to laugh at oneself; and questioning what seem to be the absurd beliefs of another group is a good way of recognizing the potential absurdity of many of one's own cherished beliefs.
Gore Vidal,"I find in most novels no imagination at all. They seem to think the highest form of the novel is to write about marriage, because that's the most important thing there is for middle-class people."
Gore Vidal,I like the way you always manage to state the obvious with a sense of real discovery.
Gore Vidal,What other culture could have produced someone like Hemingway and not seen the joke?
Gore Vidal,"The last best hope of earth, two trillion dollars in debt, is spinning out of control, and all we can do is stare at a flickering cathode-ray tube as Ollie ''answers'' questions on TV while the press, resolutely irrelevant as ever, asks politicians if they have committed adultery. From V-J Day 1945 to this has been, my fellow countrymen, a perfect nightmare."
Gore Vidal,"If most men and women were forced to rely upon physical charm to attract lovers, their sexual lives would be not only meager but in a youth-worshiping country like America painfully brief."
Gore Vidal,"Whenever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies."
Gore Vidal,What other culture could have produced someone like Hemmingway and not seen the joke?
Gore Vidal,There is no such thing as a homosexual or a heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices.
Gore Vidal,The behaviour of President Bush on 11 September certainly gives rise to not unnatural suspicions.
Gore Vidal,"It is the spirit of the age to believe that any fact, no matter how suspect, is superior to any imaginative exercise, no matter how true."
Gore Vidal,"I'm all for bringing back the birch, but only between consenting adults."
Gore Vidal,"As the age of television progresses the Reagans will be the rule, not the exception. To be perfect for television is all a President has to be these days."
Gore Vidal,"Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little."
Gore Vidal,That is sad until one recalls how many bad books the world may yet be spared because of the busyness of writers.
Gore Vidal,We're not a democracy.
Gore Vidal,Television is now so desperately hungry for material that they're scraping the top of the barrel.
Gore Vidal,Writing fiction has become a priestly business in countries that have lost their faith.
Gore Vidal,"We must declare ourselves, become known; allow the world to discover this subterranean life of ours which connects kings and farm boys, artists and clerks. Let them see that the important thing is not the object of love, but the emotion itself."
Gore Vidal,Andy Warhol is the only genius I've ever known with an I.Q. of 60.
Gore Vidal,"All children alarm their parents, if only because you are forever expecting to encounter yourself."
Gore Vidal,"Write something, even if it's just a suicide note."
Gore Vidal,"Think of the earth as a living organism that is being attacked by billions of bacteria whose numbers double every forty years. Either the host dies, or the virus dies, or both die."
Gore Vidal,A narcissist is someone better looking than you are.
Gore Vidal,There is something about a bureaucrat that does not like a poem.
Gore Vidal,The four most beautiful words in our common language: I told you so.
Gore Vidal,"By the time a man gets to be presidential material, he's been bought ten times over."
Gore Vidal,"Many writers who choose to be active in the world lose not virtue but time, and that stillness without which literature cannot be made."
Gore Vidal,"That loyal retainer of the Chase Manhattan Bank, the American president."
Gore Vidal,"Today's public figures can no longer write their own speeches or books, and there is some evidence that they can't read them either."
Gore Vidal,"Now you have people in Washington who have no interest in the country at all. They're interested in their companies, their corporations grabbing Caspian oil."
Gore Vidal,The corporate grip on opinion in the United States is one of the wonders of the Western world. No First World country has ever managed to eliminate so entirely from its media all objectivity - much less dissent.
Gore Vidal,The theater needs continual reminders that there is nothing more debasing than the work of those who do well what is not worth doing at all.
Gore Vidal,"Until the rise of American advertising, it never occurred to anyone anywhere in the world that the teenager was a captive in a hostile world of adults."
Gore Vidal,"Some writers take to drink, others take to audiences."
Gore Vidal,"On 16 September 1985, when the Commerce Department announced that the United States had become a debtor nation, the American Empire died."
Gore Vidal,"All in all, I would not have missed this century for the world."
Gore Vidal,"To a man, ornithologists are tall, slender, and bearded so that they can stand motionless for hours, imitating kindly trees, as they watch for birds."
Gore Vidal,A good deed never goes unpunished.
Gore Vidal,"In writing and politicking, it's best not to think about it, just do it."
Gore Vidal,"Never have children, only grand children."
Gore Vidal,"Democracy is supposed to give you the feeling of choice, like Painkiller X and Painkiller Y. But they're both just aspirin."
Gore Vidal,"The more money an American accumulates, the less interesting he becomes."
Gore Vidal,"There's a lot to be said for being nouveau riche, and the Reagans mean to say it all."
Gore Vidal,There is no human problem which could not be solved if people would simply do as I advise.
Gore Vidal,"Our form of democracy is bribery, on the highest scale."
Gore Vidal,One is sorry one could not have taken both branches of the road. But we were not allotted multiple selves.
Gore Vidal,"Fifty percent of people won't vote, and fifty percent don't read newspapers. I hope it's the same fifty percent."
Gore Vidal,"As societies grow decadent, the language grows decadent, too. Words are used to disguise, not to illuminate, action: you liberate a city by destroying it. Words are to confuse, so that at election time people will solemnly vote against their own interests."
Gore Vidal,"What is in question is a kind of book reviewing which seems to be more and more popular: the loose putting down of opinions as though they were facts, and the treating of facts as though they were opinions."
Gore Vidal,"In America, the race goes to the loud, the solemn, the hustler. If you think you're a great writer, you must say that you are."
Gore Vidal,"It is the spirit of the age to believe that any fact, no matter how suspect, is superior to any imaginative exercise, no matter how true"
Gore Vidal,"A talent for drama is not a talent for writing, but is an ability to articulate human relationships."
Gore Vidal,"By 1948, the Italians had begun to pull themselves together, demonstrating once more their astonishing ability to cope with disaster which is so perfectly balanced by their absolute inability to deal with success"
Gore Vidal,"The genius of our ruling class is that it has kept a majority of the people from ever questioning the inequity of a system where most people drudge along, paying heavy taxes for which they get nothing in return."
Gore Vidal,The greatest pleasure when I started making money was not buying cars or yachts but finding myself able to have as many freshly typed drafts as possible.
Larry Vieira,We came back from 5-2 and the momentum went our way but we came up just a little short. I thought we did a great job.
Larry Vieira,We got caught too deep in the zone and they have the speed to take advantage of those mistakes. We knew they were very fast and we tried to neutralize that the entire game.
Larry Vieira,This is really Joe's second year of playing goalie. He's an excellent athlete and is really learning how to do it. Tonight they exposed his weaknesses. But they exposed us because we had someone in the penalty box all night.
Larry Vieira,"We were very flat in the beginning, but we made a miraculous comeback. We could have won that game. We are slowly moving in the right direction, the only piece of the puzzle that is missing is the discipline...we still take too many penalties."
Butch Vig,"We had no intention of it being a full-time band or of even touring. We just thought, let's make a cool, interesting record,"
Butch Vig,"He brought in a great energy and great vibe that had been lacking from our sessions. After he came, a lot of new songs came out and we just felt inspired again."
Butch Vig,"We were on tour so we couldn't make it. But we saw the movie in Tucson with a regular audience during its opening weekend. By the time we left the theater, there were like 500 kids standing outside and asking for autographs, so we had our own little mini-premiere."
Butch Vig,"We didn't tell the audience that this was a setup,  that we were shooting a video, ... It was weird;  there was this huge, like, 'Ahhh.' I heard this groan and  moan, and then everybody started going 'Booooo' and yelling  'Bull-shit!' and throwing stuff up on the stage. Most people  thought that she had been arrested. The song is about trying  to find your own freedom as an individual and to avoid the  repression that's coming down on individual rights from the  right-wing, so-called Moral Majority."
Alain Vigneault,"That's what happened there. The guy didn't do (his research), and he paid the price."
Alain Vigneault,"We limited one of the best power plays in the league to nothing. And if it weren't for a giveaway in the third period, we could have shut them down completely."
Alain Vigneault,There's no game tonight if Flats is not sharp. You have to be honest with the performance he put together here. Wade Flaherty was the difference. I've challenged him a little bit lately and he responded like a real pro.
Alain Vigneault,"Out of the 21 players that were dressed (last) night, theoretically, seven of them are going to leave (today)."
Alain Vigneault,It's not going to stop him from playing (today) ... to my knowledge. He said he's going to be fine.
Alain Vigneault,"A big momentum switch there. Our power play had some great chances, to give up that ... (it) really hurt us."
Alain Vigneault,"In all the games, we worked really hard. This was a tough grind here. The schedule was backwards. It made it that much more challenging for us. I'm happy with the way we played throughout the trip."
Alain Vigneault,"This is two games in a row where our offensive opportunities are as high as they've ever been. The chances (to score) must have been 25-5 tonight. I'm happy with the way our guys played. Obviously, I would have liked for the power play to put the game away ... but the guys are working hard."
Alain Vigneault,"We're looking at getting him 50 games, plus the playoffs. He didn't even play 50 last year combined with the playoffs (Flaherty played 48 total), that's why I've been careful with his playing time and rest time."
Alain Vigneault,"This was one of his strongest games all year long, at both ends of the rink. He made some really solid plays in our end, along the boards. And when you do that, a lot of times it pays off at the other end."
Alain Vigneault,"They took the lead, and we just didn't stop. Even though it was a 2-1 game, it was one of the more entertaining games of the year. Both teams played with a lot of courage."
Alain Vigneault,"If you look at the overall season, he's been a very consistent and steady force back there. He's very poised and plays within his limits. That's been his strength."
Alain Vigneault,We generated zero chances in the first. Nothing. I believe we've got a better offensive team than we've shown the past two games here.
The Vikings,"A good football team, tough defensive team with great skill players. We must survive the onslaught [at beginning], take our licks and move on. We must minimize their big plays. If we keep close, we have a shot."
The Vikings,it was just a great job of execution.
The Vikings,"Red McCombs is still running this team, ...  I would doubt that Fowler had much to do with it at all."
Bruce Vilanch,"It's over. Once you see they've got a list, people have already stopped listening."
Bruce Vilanch,"It is something I'm still sticking to. I'm still working out, and I'm still on Zone food. I'm still losing weight."
Bruce Vilanch,What makes me laugh? Richard Nixon always made me laugh.
Bruce Vilanch,"They make a humongous profit, but the people that work on the shows don't get paid a lot because they're working on the Oscars show. It's the biggest show in the world."
Bruce Vilanch,"Sometimes there are people you can't make jokes about because the situation is embarrassing, especially if they're going to be there. It's just cruel."
Bruce Vilanch,I've written about 15 screenplays and they all sold - they were all sold on pitches.
Bruce Vilanch,I've never had to write a spec script.
Bruce Vilanch,"I write screenplays that don't get made and pilots that don't get picked up, and I re-write other people's movies, and those are all different kinds of fees."
Bruce Vilanch,"I mean, when I started out I was billing per hour, like a shrink because you would sit with somebody and work. But most of it, if it's for a live show it's usually a buy-out. A flat fee."
Bruce Vilanch,I do a lot of screen re-writing.
Bruce Vilanch,"Generally with the Oscars or the Emmys there isn't much you can do until the nominations are announced. Then you know what kind of year you're dealing with - what's been overlooked, what the issues are."
Bruce Vilanch,Eddie Izzard is absolutely brilliant. I would love to write something for him.
Bruce Vilanch,"It's the biggest party in the world, and you have to keep the whole thing percolating, which is difficult because a lot of awards most people don't care about."
Bruce Vilanch,"It's really live television, the way God meant it to be."
Antonio Villaraigosa,"has worked to relieve traffic congestion, reduce the impact of development on city streets and ensure the safety of the millions of drivers who commute on Los Angeles streets."
Antonio Villaraigosa,"Chief Bratton and I are committed to providing a police department that's transparent, accountable and inclusive, ... The days of closed-door internal investigations that do little to advance the public's confidence are over. With today's actions, the LAPD is opening up itself to review by its peers in the law enforcement community and actively seeking to improve its own operations."
Antonio Villaraigosa,Hispanic Heritage Month gives us a significant opportunity to celebrate the culture and contributions of Hispanics to the city of Los Angeles. I'm so proud to be a part of a city that thrives on its diversity and takes time out to recognize this strength in special ways like this.
Antonio Villaraigosa,"Many of these jobs are quality, middle-class jobs, ... The film industry is pivotal to the city's economy. ... In fact, the average scripted features -- television and commercial productions -- have a direct production-related economic impact of $150,000 to $250,000 each day they're in production."
Antonio Villaraigosa,"We're a community built for the Olympic Games. We have world-class sporting venues and we have a history of success,"
Antonio Villaraigosa,I got to grow up with a mother who taught me to believe in me.
Camilo Villegas,"You never know. I'm sure she's down about it. She's only 16 and she's going to keep learning. She's got a lot of pressure on her, but she handled herself well out there."
Camilo Villegas,There's a lot of golf to be played.
Camilo Villegas,I don't know (if I was a natural). I did practice. I just had fun. I never had pressure from my parents to play the game. They were always very supportive and they helped me and things worked out pretty well.
Camilo Villegas,"It was a fun round out there. Obviously, I didn't get off to a great start, I was 1 over going into (No.) 8, but chipped in and made eagle and got it going from there."
Camilo Villegas,I've been saying all year that my main goal is to keep having fun and learning.
Camilo Villegas,"She was having fun out there today. I told her yesterday on the 18th hole, I go, 'Michelle, we'll have a good one tomorrow. We'll have fun.' And she did. She got relaxed and it's a little bit easier to play like that."
Camilo Villegas,"That two-iron, that's my baby,"
Camilo Villegas,"That 2-iron, that's my baby,"
Camilo Villegas,The support here was awesome. A lot of people from Central and South America flew in. It's fun.
Camilo Villegas,The support was awesome. The parents are here and a lot of people from central and South America flew in. They have always supported me and it's good to give them a little smile back.
Tom Vilsack,"If we used that fortress mentality and created a sense of security and security zones, and wait for the insurgents to come to us and don't go after them . . . and protect the people inside that zone, allow them to feel more comfortable and more confident and allow them to get an economy going . . . then at that point Iraqis are going to be more willing to assume the front lines of that fortress."
Tom Vilsack,"I think early in the process it might have had a hard time meeting our eligibility standards for high school athletics,"
Tom Vilsack,"We have the Department of Corrections, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Transportation, our emergency management division (and) our Iowa National Guard working with local folks to try to put hundreds of thousands of sandbags in appropriate locations to try to reduce the damage and the impact. ... It's just a race against time."
Tom Vilsack,"The generosity of Iowans once again on exhibit,"
Tom Vilsack,"I'm concerned about the anxiety and stress of the families here in Newton and in the Amana area,"
Adam Vinatieri,"It was a beautiful night, ... Toward the end of the game, it didn't feel like there was any wind at all."
Adam Vinatieri,"When I'm flipping through the channels at home and see ESPN, I'll automatically stop and see what's going on. It's great. The reason we're so successful is because of the fans, and the reason why the fan base is so big is because of the TV deals, including ESPN."
Adam Vinatieri,This team has a lot of heart.
Adam Vinatieri,It's hard to say goodbye.
Adam Vinatieri,"He does it over and over again. As long as we have a minute left in the game, he and the boys just find a way to get it done. It's pretty impressive just watching the guys work and do their jobs so well."
Adam Vinatieri,"When he's out there in a jersey and helmet, it will be fun to see. ... He's an overachiever who's always going one million miles an hour. He'll give us a physical and mental lift, and the fans will appreciate seeing him back on the field."
Adam Vinatieri,"It means a lot to me because I respect the guy so much. He's a great football player, a great man."
Amanda Vincent,I don't know what I would be doing. I had no job skills.
Amanda Vincent,"There is a lot of money to be had in the trade, ... Per kilogram, sea horses retail for more than the price of silver."
Amanda Vincent,"Not only are they magnificent creatures, but sea horses also represent a conversion of the world's most pressing conservation issues. The recovery of sea horses will indicate that our seas are becoming healthier."
Amanda Vincent,"Of the 32 species of sea horses in the world, only four have been studied underwater. We need to increase our most basic understanding of these fish ? how long they live and where their seasonal migrations are."
Amanda Vincent,"There is a lot of money to be had in the trade. Per kilogram, sea horses retail for more than the price of silver."
Fay Vincent,"This is a great honor and an historic moment in the history of the Hall of Fame. What a great sadness there is that we didn't do this 30 or 40 years earlier. . . . These people who were candidates were greatly honored by being candidates, I'm sure, but it would have been nicer had we been able to do this 30 or 40 years ago and have so many more alive. So, I'm sorry we're late, but I'm proud that we're doing it."
Fay Vincent,"So his choices are he can do nothing and sort of fudge it -- but you can't get away with that. The public and Congress are going to want something done. ... I've said this about Bud, and I think I'm right, his first instinct is always wrong. The second is almost always right."
Fay Vincent,"I don't think Bud really has any choice now. If he does nothing, Congress will surely jump in again. They're going want answers about Bonds. I think there's very little room for Bud to maneuver here. Baseball needs to have its own independent investigation."
Jeff Vincent,"I am very pleased with our performance today. I wasn't sure what to expect. We have only had one speed workout this year. We've been working a lot on mileage. I thought the girls ran great. Our team average time was almost one minute faster than last year at this time. You have to be excited about that. This was the first varsity race for two of our girls. I thought they did an outstanding job for their first race. Once they get some experience under them, we will be much better. We are running great right now. This will be a good year."

Swami Vivekananda,"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is way great spiritual giants are produced."

For me, it was always more obsessive. I could listen to the same Jonathan Richman song over and over again. I came at it as a fan, but not a 'follow the beat' kind of fan.

Sarah Vowell,"I didn't come from any kind of academic background, but I lived in a college town and I knew people who weren't without pretense. There was this idea in the town that if something was European it would be good."
Sarah Vowell,History is full of really good stories. That's the main reason I got into this racket: I want to make the argument that history is interesting.

Mike Vrabel,Our worst game last year was opening night against the Colts. We need to take this and build on it and move forward. We think we're a better defense than what we showed . . . but we need to go out and prove it.
Mike Vrabel,Kevin always makes up for his mistakes.

Mike Vrabel,It's not done just to get a guy into the game.
Mike Vrabel,"As a team, we've yet to form our identity. But every year we've proven we can play great football down the stretch. You get the sense that people are worried, but I think it's a little early to start hitting the panic button."

Mike Vrabel,"When we went to [the 4-3 defense], there were a lot negative plays. The defense gave them a lot of trouble with [Richard] Seymour and Jarvis."
Mike Vrabel,We'll find out ... as this season progresses. We've always had the ability to change things simply to give us the best chance to win. It's not done just to get a guy into the game.
