Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"I try to do the right thing at the right time. They may just be little things, but usually they make the difference between winning and losing."

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"When the line started to blur between the fans and the players, sometimes things can get ugly."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. That's a terrible burden."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,The transition was difficult. It's hard to stop something that you've enjoyed and that has been very rewarding.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,The game has basically not changed since I ended my career.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,My most memorable moment came in 1985 as we beat the Boston Celtics.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,Michael Jordan and Magic and myself all learned how to play the game in college programs that emphasized the team.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"Jackie Robinson, as an athlete and as someone who was trying to make a stand for equality, he was exemplary."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,In athletics there's always been a willingness to cheat if it looks like you're not cheating. I think that's just a quirk of human nature.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,I wanted to play baseball!
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,I think the NBA will certainly survive without Michael Jordan.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"I felt that a number of people might have questioned my loyalty, but I continue to be a patriotic American."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"I feel that there has been progress made since I was a boy on matters of race, but we have a long way to go."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"My mother had to send me to the movies with my birth certificate, so that I wouldn't have to pay the extra fifty cents that the adults had to pay."
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,You can't win unless you learn how to lose.
King Abdullah,Obviously we are fully committed to the peace process.

King Abdullah,"We see eye-to-eye, and we know there is a commitment by this new prime minister and a very strong working relationship between him and (Palestinian Authority) President (Yasser) Arafat."
King Abdullah,"the damage to other countries is tremendous, and we don't believe that the prices should be at these levels."
King Abdullah,This is the first time I'm going to sign an agreement with any country.
Shinzo Abe,"There is no wavering in our relationship of trust, ... We have not overcome deflation yet so the priority should be on that. We'd like the BOJ to cooperate."
Shinzo Abe,I think we received wide support from the public on this point.
Shinzo Abe,"It is important to explain fully to the local areas with sincerity. We will also think, of course, about the development promotion of the communities."
Shinzo Abe,We aim to achieve general progress in relations between North Korea and Japan.
Shinzo Abe,Surveys like this are also conducted by other countries. We should handle this calmly under international law.
Shinzo Abe,Japan will calmly proceed with its activities in line with international law.
Shinzo Abe,"Generally speaking, we don't think that land-to-sea or very short-range missiles, even if fired from North Korea, have a particular immediate impact on our national security."
Shinzo Abe,The Land Ministry will take thorough measures to work closely with local authorities to fully investigate the buildings handled by the architects as to whether their earthquake resistance data has been falsified or not.

Shinzo Abe,"Up to now I have also, as one citizen ... made visits. I would like to continue to hold such feelings from now on."
Shinzo Abe,maintain a monetary-easing environment.
Shinzo Abe,"We made the issue at stake in these elections very clear: whether Japan should go ahead with structural reforms, or stop them. As a result, we've gained the support of a wide section of the population."
Shinzo Abe,"The government and the BOJ will work as one to defeat deflation, and we hope the BOJ will keep taking effective monetary policy and earn the markets' trust."
Shinzo Abe,"Since the (suicide), Japan also urged all our staffers in China to use caution against spy activities, and warned all embassies abroad."
Shinzo Abe,"We will respect the result of the referendum, but on the other hand, we would like to reach an agreement in the Japan-U.S. negotiations."
Ralph Abernathy,I'm sick and tired of black and white people of good intent giving aspirin to a society that is dying of a cancerous disease.
Ralph Abernathy,"Bring on your tear gas, bring on your grenades, your new supplies of Mace, your state troopers and even your national guards. But let the record show we ain't going to be turned around."
Ralph Abernathy,"I don't know what the future may hold, but I know who holds the future."
John Abraham,I don't think we were battered at all. We just missed tackles. They were self-inflicted wounds.
John Abraham,"I've seen him use it well, and I think it's something I can definitely use,"
John Abraham,"I feel like I'm in shape, but the football shape and getting hit and the pounding is different from doing drills and the stuff I've been doing."
John Abraham,"(The defeat) is big, but it's a long season. We're not going to give away the season yet."
John Abraham,"It was a business decision. We just felt this was the right time for me to come in. There's no love lost, there's no harm. I'm coming in with an open mind and ready to play, no grudges at all."
Peter Abrahams,Many have changed so much that they have lost the magic of the dream that carried them on their own bootstraps.
Peter Abrahams,We have a comprehensive calendar of events unlike any other in the city.

JJ Abrams,I've been dying to work with Simon since I saw Shaun of the Dead.
JJ Abrams,"I've been dying to work with Simon since I saw Shaun of the Dead,"
JJ Abrams,"The whole thing was reported entirely without our cooperation. People learned that I was producing a 'Star Trek' film, that I had an option to direct it, they hear rumors of what the thing was going to be and ran with a story that is not entirely accurate."
JJ Abrams,"I couldn't believe it, ... I started on a Monday and turned in the outline on a Friday. On the Saturday they called and said, 'OK, we're making it.'"
Lisa Abron,Now we've got to pray and hope somebody gives us a wildcard.
Lisa Abron,Unlucky 13. I don't know how they're going to determine it. I hate to be in this type of position. I've always been able to determine how it's going to be. Now we have to sit here. It's making me uneasy. I don't like to be in this position.
Lisa Abron,We were excited to win. I give credit to my girls. They worked hard. Now we try to get ready for district.
Lisa Abron,She went for a lay-up and came down kind of funny.
Ralph Acampora,"In technology, I think I would go with the big ones. I'd go with IBM ( IBM : Research , Estimates ). That would be my first pick in the technology area."
Ralph Acampora,"Unfortunately, what has precipitated this decline is a real fear of interest rates rising. Personally and professionally, I think interest rates go a little higher than most people expect and until that happens, until we see the end of that fear, I think the market between now and the end of June is going to be very, very nervous."
Ralph Acampora,I think quite often when you get to a round number you have a lot of anxiety. This backing off is healthy. It takes some of the enthusiasm out.
Dean Acheson,No people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies
Dean Acheson,I learned from the example of my father that the manner in which one endures what must be endured is more important than the thing that must be endured
Dean Acheson,Time spent in the advertising business seems to create a permanent deformity like the Chinese habit of foot-binding.
Dean Acheson,Always remember that the future comes one day at a time.
Lakshman Achuthan,"To put this in perspective, a couple of years into recovery, we should be seeing 250,000 to 300,000 new jobs per month. We're not there yet."
Lakshman Achuthan,How much better is the Corvette today than 30 years ago? What is that improvement worth? It's not worth zero.
Lakshman Achuthan,[Rising home values] are making people feel they don't need to save.
Lakshman Achuthan,I don't think we're going to see jobs collapse or disappear. There is a bit of fear in the air with what's been going on with oil prices and the hurricane that there's going to be some kind of collapse. But I think this economy is resilient.
Lakshman Achuthan,"The not-too-hot, not-too-cold 'Goldilocks' economy envisaged by many economists could turn out to be a mirage."
Lakshman Achuthan,"One of the things recessions do is uncover weak links. When you're in a strong economy, a bull market, you can paper over a lot of things. When you get under some strain, these things show up."
Lakshman Achuthan,"Everything is falling into place, with the way our cyclical indicators are behaving. We should see the direction of job growth continue to improve."
Kathy Acker,"You know, I've been told that by some of the writers in the generation above me: You'll be able to write when you've found a voice."
Kathy Acker,You know I've had work banned.
Kathy Acker,"Well, I think writing is basically about time and rhythm. Like with jazz. You have your basic melody and then you just riff off of it. And the riffs are about timing."
Kathy Acker,"Well, fear and homophobia are both pervasive."
Kathy Acker,We've been very bad at understanding why the right-wing does things.
Kathy Acker,"We get on the bandwagon in all sorts of ways - you know minor ways and major ways - like what you've just encountered which isn't censorship exactly, it was something sort of uglier in a way."
Kathy Acker,"Traveling around I don't think people are that horrible, I think they just don't know."
Kathy Acker,"The literary culture, if you examine it, the high literary culture is that which preserves the government and you know it's really the talk for those who have."
Kathy Acker,That's what the right-wing is good at: figuring out the left wing.
Kathy Acker,I think it's really important to find out why people hurt you or try to oppose you or whatever.
Kathy Acker,I question: do we really understand the differences between modernist and postmodernist?
Kathy Acker,"I might be writing what people expect me to write, writing from that place where I might be ruled by economic considerations. To overcome that, I started working with my dreams, because I'm not so censored when I use dream material."
Kathy Acker,"I mean, they censor your work when they're scared of it."
Kathy Acker,"I mean, once work's out there it's meant to be used."
Kathy Acker,There's a backlash against womyn that's really bad right now.
Kathy Acker,I found my voice was a reaction to all that voice stuff.
Kathy Acker,But guys such as Allen and William are more supportive than most men.
Kathy Acker,And I'm working at trying to find a kind of language where I won't be so easily modulated by expectation.
Kathy Acker,"You know I think many writers are dangerous to the establishment. I mean, they go against all the rules that you're told writing."
Kathy Acker,You can do whatever you want with my work.
Kathy Acker,"Yeah, I mean, I put work out there for people to use and I'm grateful when you use it."
Kathy Acker,Some of the stuff about Yogi energy is really fascinating.
Kathy Acker,One of the reasons I think the ultra right-wing has such power in this country is that no one talks out.
Kathy Acker,"On the surface we all act like we all love each other and we're free and easy, and actually we're far more moralistic than any other society I've ever lived in."
Kathy Acker,"I'm very staid compared to my students, actually."
Kathy Acker,"I'm really fascinated and you know I've been wondering about that usage of language, various breathing techniques and why in these practices language is being used in another way."
Kathy Acker,I write it to get it out of me. I don't write it to remember it.
Kathy Acker,I wasn't really into body piercings until I found that about half my female students had them.
Kathy Acker,I understand that when people read my books that there's something there - but I don't identify with it.
Kathy Acker,"I understand that postmodern literature probably means people like DeLillo, The Fiction Collective, but I don't get it that those writers are really influenced by postmodern theorists."
Kathy Acker,I think what we have in this country is a little more dangerous in a way because it can't be seen fully. It's sorta internal censorship. We censor each other.
Kathy Acker,I think the best thing in cases of censorship or things like this is to get as much media as possible.
Kathy Acker,"I don't think what happens in this country is censorship, I should say that. It's something else. It's not banning. It's something else."
Kathy Acker,"First of all, writing at best - certainly fiction writing - more and more I think is magic."
Kathy Acker,But I still don't have a clear idea of what my voice is.
Duane Ackerman,"Our cultures are a good fit, given the history and the vision of these two fine companies."
Duane Ackerman,Valencia has done an excellent job of building and guiding a very thoughtful and effective diversity and inclusion strategy at our company. Her long history of service at BellSouth and in the community combined with her breadth of business knowledge makes her a tremendous asset to this Board.
Duane Ackerman,Results for the quarter remained strong despite extraordinary challenges we faced with Hurricane Katrina.
John Adair,"At the moment, they police don't come down here unless they have to - that's why the bus was set on fire - so that the police would have to respond and come down here. And when they did, some of the lads were waiting and had a crack at them."
John Adair,"The police aren't the most popular people right now,"
John Adair,Teamwork is no accident.It is the by-product of good leadership.
John Adair,"The chief executive who knows his strengths and weaknesses as a leader is likely to be far more effective than the one who remains blind to them. He also is on the road to humility -- that priceless attitude of openness to life that can help a manager absorb mistakes, failures, or personal shortcomings."
Red Adair,"It scares you: all the noise, the rattling, the shaking. But the look on everybody's face when you're finished and packing, it's the best smile in the world; and there's nobody hurt, and the well's under control."
Red Adair,"I've done made a deal with the devil. He said he's going to give me an air-conditioned place when I go down there, if I go there, so I won't put all the fires out."
Red Adair,Retire? I don't know what that word means. As long as a man is able to work and he's productive out there and he feels good - keep at it.
Red Adair,"I've got too many of my friends that retired and went home and got on a rocking chair, and about a year and a half later, I'm always going to the cemetery."
Red Adair,"If you think it's expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur."
Abigail Adams,A little of what you call frippery is very necessary towards looking like the rest of the world
Abigail Adams,"I am more and more convinced that man is a dangerous creature and that power, whether vested in many or a few, is ever grasping, and like the grave, cries, ``Give, give.''"
Abigail Adams,"Well, knowledge is a fine thing, and mother Eve thought so;  but she smarted so severely for hers, that most of her daughters have been afraid of it since"
Abigail Adams,"If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice, or representation."
Abigail Adams,"I begin to think, that a calm is not desirable in any situation in life. Man was made for action and for bustle too, I believe."
Abigail Adams,"Well, knowledge is a fine thing, and mother Eve thought so; but she smarted so severely for hers, that most of her daughters have been afraid of it since."

Abigail Adams,A little of what you call frippery is very necessary towards looking like the rest of the world.
Abigail Adams,"Wisdom and penetration are the fruit of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure. Great necessities call out great virtues."
Abigail Adams,Great necessities call out great virtues.
Abigail Adams,I've always felt that a person's intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic.
Abigail Adams,"We have too many high-sounding words, and too few actions that correspond with them."
Abigail Adams,"If we mean to have heroes, statesmen and philosophers, we should have learned women."
Abigail Adams,"These are times in which a genius would wish to live.  It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed. The habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties.  Great necessities call out great virtues."
Abigail Adams,"I begin to think, that a calm is not desirable in any situation in life ... Man was made for action and for bustle too, I believe."
Abigail Adams,"Arbitrary power is like most other things which are very hard, very liable to be broken."
Abigail Adams,Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands. Remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
Abigail Adams,"Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and diligence."
Amy Adams,"That's the bottom line -- that no one gets hurt, no one gets injured, or hurts someone else while they're on the road."
Amy Adams,It was a lot of fun. I felt like I was being allowed to sit at the big kids' table. It was very overwhelming - all of the history in that room.
Amy Adams,"[His posse of longtime pals provides another outlet.] They carry on like your classic 'boys will be boys,' ... knows who his friends are."
Ansel Adams,"No matter how sophisticated you may be, a large granite mountain cannot be denied - it speaks in silence to the very core of your being"
Ansel Adams,I have often thought that if photography were difficult in the true sense of the term -- meaning that the creation of a simple photograph would entail as much time and effort as the production of a good watercolor or etching -- there would be a vast improvement in total output. The sheer ease with which we can produce a superficial image often leads to creative disaster.
Ansel Adams,The only things in my life that compatibly exists with this grand universe are the creative works of the human spirit.
Ansel Adams,"There are no rules for good photographs, there are only good photographs."
Ansel Adams,"A true photograph need not be explained, nor can it be contained in words."
Ansel Adams,"These people live again in print as intensely as when their images were captured on old dry plates of sixty years ago... I am walking in their alleys, standing in their rooms and sheds and workshops, looking in and out of their windows. Any they in turn seem to be aware of me."
Ansel Adams,"The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance."
Ansel Adams,"In my mind's eye, I visualize how a particular... sight and feeling will appear on a print. If it excites me, there is a good chance it will make a good photograph. It is an intuitive sense, an ability that comes from a lot of practice."
Ansel Adams,"We must remember that a photograph can hold just as much as we put into it, and no one has ever approached the full possibilities of the medium."
Ansel Adams,A good photograph is knowing where to stand.
Ansel Adams,"Millions of men have lived to fight, build palaces and boundaries, shape destinies and societies; but the compelling force of all times has been the force of originality and creation profoundly affecting the roots of human spirit."
Ansel Adams,Photography is more than a medium for factual communication of ideas. It is a creative art.
Ansel Adams,"When I'm ready to make a photograph, I think I quite obviously see in my minds eye something that is not literally there in the true meaning of the word. I'm interested in something which is built up from within, rather than just extracted from without."
Ansel Adams,Twelve significant photographs in any one year is a good crop.
Ansel Adams,Myths and creeds are heroic struggles to comprehend the truth in the world.
Ansel Adams,"Photography, as a powerful medium of expression and communications, offers an infinite variety of perception, interpretation and execution."
Ansel Adams,"A great photograph is one that fully expresses what one feels, in the deepest sense, about what is being photographed."
Ansel Adams,Sometimes I do get to places just when God's ready to have somebody click the shutter.
Ansel Adams,"There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man, beyond history, and beyond science. The moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define; we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit."
Ansel Adams,Some photographers take reality... and impose the domination of their own thought and spirit. Others come before reality more tenderly and a photograph to them is an instrument of love and revelation.
Ansel Adams,The negative is comparable to the composer's score and the print to its performance. Each performance differs in subtle ways.
Ansel Adams,Dodging and burning are steps to take care of mistakes God made in establishing tonal relationships.
Ansel Adams,There are always two people in every picture: the photographer and the viewer.
Ansel Adams,To photograph truthfully and effectively is to see beneath the surfaces and record the qualities of nature and humanity which live or are latent in all things.
Ansel Adams,"No man has the right to dictate what other men should perceive, create or produce, but all should be encouraged to reveal themselves, their perceptions and emotions, and to build confidence in the creative spirit."
Ansel Adams,In wisdom gathered over time I have found that every experience is a form of exploration.
Ansel Adams,A photograph is usually looked at - seldom looked into.
Ansel Adams,"When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence."
Ansel Adams,There is nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept.
Ansel Adams,Landscape photography is the supreme test of the photographer - and often the supreme disappointment.
Ansel Adams,"I tried to keep both arts alive, but the camera won. I found that while the camera does not express the soul, perhaps a photograph can!"
Ansel Adams,It is my intention to present - through the medium of photography - intuitive observations of the natural world which may have meaning to the spectators.
Ansel Adams,"Yosemite Valley, to me, is always a sunrise, a glitter of green and golden wonder in a vast edifice of stone and space."
Ansel Adams,It is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save the environment.
Ansel Adams,"You don't take a photograph, you make it."
Ansel Adams,There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept.
Ansel Adams,Not everybody trusts paintings but people believe photographs.
Brian Adams,"Everybody has been down on our running game since (star Marcus Green graduated). We went out to prove a point tonight, and I think we did."
Brian Adams,"We've got power outages pretty much across the entire county,"
Brian Adams,We've got power outages pretty much across the entire county.
Brian Adams,"People got to get use to us. We do things they're not use to, they do things we don't do."
Brian Adams,We have a good opportunity.
Brian Adams,"After getting off the ferry, we had a tough time getting our land legs back. We suffered the Friday Harbor funk. By the time the second half started, we were playing well for a pretty long stretch there, but then we fell back."
Brian Adams,The impact is that they are just kids in our district like any other students.
Brian Adams,It will be hard to replace those goals Joel Adeline had. We'll have to play more of a team game instead of relying on one player.
Brian Adams,"In the second half, La Conner tightened their defense. They packed defenders into the box ... the ball kept deflecting off people."
Brian Adams,"His lungs were full of water, and his brain shut the body down."
Bryan Adams,"I'm working on a new album. I've written 30 songs, five of those are good, and three I really love."
Bryan Adams,I am here to perform for humanity.
Bryan Adams,"Sure it?s motivation, ... You want to do your best and our two main goals every year (are) to win the conference championship and to make that playoffs."
Bryan Adams,Thoughts are things; they have tremendous power. Thoughts of doubt and fear are pathways to failure. When you conquer negative attitudes of doubt and fear you conquer failure. Thoughts crystallize into habit and habit solidifies into circumstances.
Bryan Adams,I was shocked; I didn't know what it really was. I thought it was a disease you got from eating too much sugar.
Bryan Adams,It's a very funny play. The music is just tremendous; it's a comedy with opera mixed in.
Bryan Adams,"I got in trouble with the police, and that was a rude awakening. That was it. I'd seen the bottom of the pit, and it was time to scrape myself out of it."
Bryan Adams,"I always knew I'd be in music in some sort of capacity. I didn't know if I'd be successful at it, but I knew I'd be doing something in it. Maybe get a job in a record store. Maybe even play in a band. I never got into this to be a star."
Bryan Adams,"Trying to manage diabetes is hard because if you don't, there are consequences you'll have to deal with later in life."
Bryan Adams,"I only write music for myself, I don't try and appeal to anyone else."
Bryan Adams,"There's a saying, 'It's easy to write songs, but very difficult to write great songs.' I'm going through that right now."
Bryan Adams,I am really looking forward to returning to Dubai as always. The audiences are always receptive to my music and Dubai as a city never ceases to amaze me ... it is constantly changing.
Bryan Adams,"From what I recollect, the audiences in India are very discerning and know how to appreciate real music."
Bud Adams,"I hope we get a guy who can be our leader for about 10 years. It's time for that, I think."
Bud Adams,"He doesn't seem to be able to stay out of trouble. I think he'll get out of that habit, though. I think the coaches let him know that he'll stay out of trouble or he won't be around long."
Bud Adams,"Chris looked pretty good, I thought, in two playoff games. If he's over his injury -- and I think he is -- he could move into the spot."
Bud Adams,"We want to get a collective bargaining agreement done with Gene (Upshaw) and I don't see why we're having such a holdup at this time. He has his reasons and we have our reasons, but it's not a healthy situation to have."
Douglas Adams,"Some say that the universe is made so that when we are about to understand it, it changes into something even more incomprehensible. And then there are those who say that this has already happened."
Douglas Adams,A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and body can connect with the universe and move bits of it about.
Douglas Adams,"Ah, this is obviously some strange usage of the word 'safe' that I wasn't previously aware of"
Douglas Adams,"It is known that there are an infinte number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely products of a deranged imagination."
Douglas Adams,"One of the most blissful joys of the English language is the fact that one of its greatest practitioners ever, one of the guys on the very top table of all, was a jokesmith. Though maybe it shouldn't be that big a surprise. Who else would be up there? Austen, of course, Dickens and Chaucer. The only one who couldn't make a joke to save his life would be Shakespeare."
Douglas Adams,It's no coincidence that in no known language does the phrase As pretty as an airport appear
Douglas Adams,"There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.There is another theory which states that this has already happened."
Douglas Adams,The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.
Douglas Adams,I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
Douglas Adams,Flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
Douglas Adams,"For a moment, nothing happened.Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen."
Douglas Adams,"Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the drug store, but that's just peanuts to space."
Douglas Adams,The knack of flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
Douglas Adams,It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.
Douglas Adams,The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.
Douglas Adams,"You live and learn. At any rate, you live."
Douglas Adams,"To give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity."
Douglas Adams,I don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't believe it.
Douglas Adams,"We have normality. I repeat, we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem."
Douglas Adams,"If somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just give 'em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves."
Douglas Adams,"If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands."
Douglas Adams,"It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job."
Douglas Adams,The impossible often has a kind of integrity which the merely improbable lacks.
Douglas Adams,"It is a rare mind indeed that can render the hitherto non-existent blindingly obvious. The cry 'I could have thought of that' is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didn't, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too."
Douglas Adams,Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
Douglas Adams,The mere thought hadn't even begun to speculate about the merest possibility of crossing my mind.
Douglas Adams,Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.
Douglas Adams,"The difficulty with this conversation is that it's very different from most of the ones I've had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees."
Douglas Adams,"In order to fly, all one must do is simply miss the ground."
Douglas Adams,This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays.

Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected."

Rick Adelman,"If I'm in my last year and things don't work out,"
Rick Adelman,Ron made James work for the shots he got. One thing Ron makes guys do is work for every shot.
Rick Adelman,Ron made James work for the shots he got. One thing Ron makes guys do is work for every shot. We always wanted someone in his way. He's a great player but we didn't want him to get to the basket - we wanted other people to beat us.
Rick Adelman,"He's made a huge impact defensively. He takes on the better players, makes them work. He's a great team defender. He gave us new energy."
Rick Adelman,"Ron made James work for all the shots he got. We did not want to let him get to the basket, which Ron did a great job of. We wanted to make other people beat us tonight. Fortunately, they didn't."
Rick Adelman,Ron made James work for the shots he got. We really wanted to have somebody in his way when he came off picks. We just didn't want him to get to the basket or get on any kind of roll. We wanted to make other people beat us.
Rick Adelman,"We made him work, he took 20 shots to score 15 points."
Rick Adelman,"You have to get in his vision. You can't let him think he has an angle or a gap to attack to â€” he's too quick. But he got to the basket a number of times, and, yeah, he beat his guy, and we were very slow reacting."
Rick Adelman,He's maturing and knowing and understanding what he has to do to be successful. I think he's kind of imposing his will on people rather than just taking what people force him to do. . . . He's just playing with a lot more confidence. . . . I don't see any reason why he wouldn't continue to play at that level in the playoffs.
Rick Adelman,"Everything is so new. We're trying to get a sense of what guys can do. So far, they've responded. Every day we've mixed it up with people playing with different people."
Rick Adelman,"We're just trying to get one of those eight (playoff) spots, we don't care where it is. It's going to be a fight right down to the end."
Rick Adelman,"We're a group that hasn't been together that long. I think if we move the ball and trust each other, we're going to be okay."
Rick Adelman,He did as well as he could. He hadn't been working out that much because he didn't expect the trade. I thought he was winded and tried to get him some shorter minutes in the second half.
Rick Adelman,I've said all year if we don't have Mike and Brad playing well we're going to struggle.
Rick Adelman,"When Mike's out of the game, we really struggle offensively. We need him on floor."
Rick Adelman,"That was our philosophy. Go at him. Make him try to defend. It?s hard to post him up. We moved the ball pretty well, and we got him to react to people coming at him."
Rick Adelman,"The patience at the end of the game there when Brad hit the three was terrific. We had plenty of time, we moved the ball around and they made a mistake and left Brad standing there. Then in the overtime we took control, especially when Odom fouled out."
Rick Adelman,He's been a terrific young guy. He hasn't had an opportunity to play much because he is playing behind veteran guys but we are very high on him. We think he is going to be a player in this league. He is the type of kid who every day he comes to work. He works hard and never gives in. That is a great attitude to have.
Rick Adelman,"We definitely caught a break after they had such a hard game last night. It wasn't pretty, but I'll take it."
Rick Adelman,Now we are going to the playoffs on a positive note and we'll see what happens tomorrow night and prepare for whoever we play.
Rick Adelman,"I saw Brent shoot that shot so many times last night, I can't tell you. And I always liked Brent before."
Rick Adelman,"I just thought in the first quarter (that) we made a lot of mental mistakes defensively that we can't make against this team. And in the second quarter, they shot it so well that it just snowballed. We got very impatient offensively, and that just played right into their hands."
Rick Adelman,"There's nobody we can't go out and compete against. But again, it's such a new group. I always knew what to expect with the group in the past, but I don't know what to expect if we keep winning. Are we going to be able to sustain it and make it?  These guys have done an unbelievable job of coming together as a team."
Rick Adelman,"I don't care if we're playing home or not. We just ran into a better team. Their starting five has played together for a while. They executed very well, and they shot it very well. We looked like a team that is inexperienced playing together."
Rick Adelman,"This is the type of home game that really gives you a boost. We've made a huge climb. Now that's we're over (.500), we have to stay over it."
Rick Adelman,"This was a great win for us. We've been struggling, injured, with four games in five nights. But we stayed with it and got it done."
Rick Adelman,It was a great win for us. We've been struggling. Four games in five nights is tough and our guys stayed with it and got the win. We didn't have some of our people on the bench and we really needed those guys to be consistent.
Rick Adelman,We're going to have to win some games on the road if we're going to get in the playoffs.
Rick Adelman,"When you're eight games under .500, things don't look very good. But I liked the way we finished."
Rick Adelman,"We haven't been playing well these last seven games and our offense was the thing hurting us the most. Guys were trying to do everything on their own and we need to get back to trusting our teammates and passing the ball. We weren't paying much attention to detail in these last seven games, but we were better tonight."
Rick Adelman,We got to win that game. Simple as that.
Rick Adelman,Our guys did everything but win the game.
Rick Adelman,"When it was tied, we didn't do what you have to do to win a game like this. We were impatient and we forced the issue and it cost us the game."
Rick Adelman,"You can't expect him not to have feelings about this, but I expect him to be able to handle things. It's not been an easy situation. It's not the best thing to happen when you're on a six-game road trip."
Rick Adelman,He's been a solid player on both ends of the court for us. He brings a lot of energy and plays hard every night.
Rick Adelman,"Our energy level tonight was up. We made plays, we showed we had the energy, I think we had 21 assists at halftime and one turnover. Our offense was efficient tonight. We haven't been playing well these last seven games and our offense was the thing hurting us the most. Guys were trying to do everything on their own and we need to get back to trusting our teammates and passing the ball. We weren't paying much attention to detail in these last seven games, but we were better tonight."
Rick Adelman,"Ronnie hasn't been trying to force the issue, he's playing under control. We know he can make shots and guard people, and he has a great work ethic. I think he has a great chance to stick in this league for a long time."
Rick Adelman,"We still control our own destiny and teams still have to catch us. In the past seven games, we haven't been paying attention to detail. Guys were trying to do it themselves. We wanted to come out with a different energy and we showed it tonight. Hopefully we can build off this, but we'll find out at Golden State (on Friday)."
Rick Adelman,"It's still in our control. We're ahead of them. If we win games, they can't catch us. That's the bottom line. If we don't win games, then we open it up for them to get back in it."
Rick Adelman,It was just a really good win to get. It has to help our confidence and make us realize that we can be a good team if we keep playing the way we we're playing.
Rick Adelman,We get these lulls where we our concentration wanders at both ends of the court.
Rick Adelman,There were about five or six opportunities they got just from a lack of concentration on our part. We just have to keep our minds on what we're trying to do defensively. We didn't do that.
Rick Adelman,We needed to take it to them in the third quarter and not lose our concentration. I wasn't going to let them let it go. Either we respond and take control of the game or (the Nuggets) were going to do it. I just didn't want to let it slip away.
Rick Adelman,It was a really solid win. At the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth we tightened it up defensively.
Rick Adelman,"We always talk about basketball stuff, ... She'll talk to me about the practice, what she observed. She's very knowledgeable. She's been very good as a coach up there. They really do play hard, do the right thing."
Rick Adelman,"He did fine, better than I thought. I think he was excited to start playing basketball again."
Sheldon Adelson,"Why do I need succession planning? I'm very alert, I'm very vibrant. I have no intention to retire."

Casey Affleck,You sleep with people all the time that you hate.

Casey Affleck,"If I can't see the humor in it, how am I going to be funny?"

Andre Agassi,"You could ask any sports bookie and they're going to tell you what the odds are,"
Andre Agassi,"When you're young, you can sleep in till 12,"
Andre Agassi,"[The answer probably would be that he would need to move halfway up to the service line before his serves would be able to land at the same angle into the court.] A lot of guys can serve 135 [miles an hour] but the trajectory is the main issue, ... You're lunging and then it's up and you can't reach it."
Andre Agassi,"There's other guys - I've played a lot of them, I mean, so many years - (against whom) there's a safety zone, there's a place to get to, there's something to focus on, there's a way,"
Andre Agassi,"So now all of a sudden I'm faced with the reality that I can actually go enjoy the Open this year, because I'm doing a few things right, which is nice to feel, ... Yeah, I like where I am right now."
Andre Agassi,"Each set my quality picked up, and in the fourth set we were both playing well."
Andre Agassi,"I tell you what I do take pleasure in is accomplishing things that I question myself,"
Andre Agassi,"I think I've always had the shots. But in the past, I've suffered too many mental lapses. Now, I'm starting to get away from that and my mental discipline and commitment to the game are much better. I think I'm really taking a good look at the big picture. That's the difference between being around for the final or watching the final from my sofa at home."
Andre Agassi,"It felt good, it was pain free. I've just got to run faster now, that's all."
Andre Agassi,"If I feel that sharp pain on the court, it's impossible to play. That's what happened in Paris. I couldn't do anything. But normally the pain I live with is just during the cool down, the recovery. I don't mind a little pain in the evening after a hard day's work, to be quite honest, as long as I can go back out there the next day and be fully ready to go."
Andre Agassi,"The third and fourth set, I felt I was a bit living on the edge with my serve. He was getting a lot of good swings at it, had me under a lot of pressure. But the fifth, I had a few good easy hold games and started to relax a little bit more and hit my spots a little bit better, so that helped me to relax on my return games, as well."
Andre Agassi,"He's lost three matches all year, ... He's probably won, what, 70 (actually 71)? Yeah, he's definitely beatable (laughter). I just don't like those odds."

Andre Agassi,"I threw myself in with eagerness and desire, but it was just too much, too soon."
Andre Agassi,"I prepare to be there under any circumstances, which in many years has been less than ideal,"
Andre Agassi,"I know he's been playing well and he's been picking up his standard, ... I've got to believe he's only gotten better. But you know, it's something I'm looking forward to: a good quality match for sure."
Andre Agassi,"In every match I play, I grow in my appreciation for this opportunity, this chance to be out there playing at the U.S. Open for another match, another time,"
Andre Agassi,"You know my dad pushed me to believe that I was going to be the best. I just never thought of life without tennis, even looking forward."
Andre Agassi,"Yes, for a long time but I admired her and respected everything that I could sort of see in her from a distance, the pillars of her life, the loyalties, the relationships. It all got my interest and also the looks."
Andre Agassi,"Well, you know, I've bonded with a lot of people over the years, you know. We played the same tournaments year after year and we go back to the same place and many times the seats have been full and that has meant the world to me for sure."
Andre Agassi,"Well, I actually tell my son that I don't have any hair because he asked me the same question that I gave it to him when he was born, so he actually still believes that. He's five years old."
Andre Agassi,Tennis was always sort of a - a learning. It was a vehicle for me to discover a lot about myself. And the things that I sort of discovered at times I not only didn't want to see it for myself but I certainly didn't want millions of people to see it.
Andre Agassi,"Sometimes it's just harder to remind yourself about what you're doing and why you're doing it... Other times, you have a great desire for it, but physically you're not responding the way you want. That presents other challenges. Then sometimes it all comes together."
Andre Agassi,"Some moments it feels longer, other moments it feels like it's flown by; you can't believe you've done it all that time... Overall, you have a strong sense for the full spectrum that you've sort of traveled."
Andre Agassi,"My father actually moved out from Chicago just so he could play tennis 365 days a year, so it was - it was a place we played every day. We played before school. We played after school. We woke up. We played tennis. We brushed our teeth in that order."
Andre Agassi,I've been motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me. There still is plenty out there to get motivated by.
Andre Agassi,I've been criticized for not having perspective in the past and I thought that of myself many times but not there.
Andre Agassi,I'm going to go down swinging... I'm sure as heck not going to go home and say I had a bad tournament.
Andre Agassi,I think one of the greatest joys I have now in my career and in my profession is to be playing at an age where I can appreciate it more than I used to... It's a whole different lens you look through the older you get.
Andre Agassi,I had my moments for sure but I wasn't confrontational. And sometimes you get on the court and you'd find yourself very confrontational. It was all a discovery.
Andre Agassi,"Having a family was something I always dreamed about and looked forward to, certainly to find somebody that you want to have a family with."
Andre Agassi,"First of all, let me say, 1:15 in the morning, for 20,000 people to still be here, I wasn't the winner, tennis was. That's awesome. I don't know if I've ever felt so good here before."
Andre Agassi,"But, I would say when I was four years old and I was at the Alan King Tennis Tournament and I was hitting with all the pros that would come to town. They would get me on the court or take notice and that stayed with me."
Andre Agassi,"It means a lot to you, to be out there. The highs are pretty high, and the lows are pretty low. You know, it's easy to feel like you let the team down. I mean, at the end of the day we still got to figure out a way to get through the tie."
Andre Agassi,"I question myself every day. That's what I still find motivating about this. I don't have the answers, I don't pretend that I do just because I won the match. Just keep fighting and maybe something good happens."
Andre Agassi,"I had moments of my actions and words not reflecting who it is I am - if that defines a punk, then yes, absolutely."
Andre Agassi,If you don't practice you don't deserve to win.
Andre Agassi,"You don't cheat anybody out of their experience, whatever it is."
Andre Agassi,I'm going to have to pick my shots and play great tennis.
Andre Agassi,"It has meant a lot to me to challenge the best players in the world and to beat them. And it means a lot to me to be out here and fighting for the title and, you know, it hurts not to win it."
Andre Agassi,I feel old when I see mousse in my opponent's hair.
Andre Agassi,Nothing can substitute for just plain hard work. I had to put in the time to get back. And it was a grind. It meant training and sweating every day. But I was completely committed to working out to prove to myself that I still could do it.
Andre Agassi,I got a hundred bucks says my baby beats Pete's baby. I just think genetics are in my favour.
Andre Agassi,Being number two sucks.
Andre Agassi,"What makes something special is not just what you have to gain, but what you feel there is to lose."
Andre Agassi,"Over the last 20 years, I've come full circle, ... To be here at an age where I can take in that sort of love and be at an age where I can embrace it is a tremendous feeling."
Andre Agassi,"He's always been a real dangerous player, ... You never know when somebody comes of age or game. (For) some people, it happens a lot earlier than others. I haven't played him in a while. Certainly watching his wins over the last couple weeks have been great, not only here, but also in New Haven (where Blake won the title). He just looks like he's doing a lot of things well. There's no question he's doing something better than he used to do."
Andre Agassi,He was too good. I would suggest to his next opponent that he doesn't look to me for advice

Shai Agassi,We have the potential ability to grow fourfold by looking at the number of employees in a corporation versus the number of users that are professional users of SAP.
James Agate,"Intelligence: I was asked tonight why I refuse to have truck with intellectuals after business hours. But of course I won t. 1. I am not an intellectual. Two minutes talk with Aldous Huxley, William Glock, or any of the New Statesman crowd would expose me utterly. 2. I am too tired after my day's work to man the intellectual palisade. 3. When my work is finished I want to eat, drink, smoke, and relax. 4. I don't know very much, but what I do know I know better than anybody, and I don't want to argue about it.

Jessica Alba,"This is a beautiful action thriller -- it's a great date movie -- age appropriate,"

Jason Aldean,"I remember being 4 or 5 years old, sitting in front of a record player with headphones listening to my dad's albums,"
Jason Aldean,"I can definitely relate to a few things in the song. Going mudding on a dirt road, going to football games, I did a few of those things."
Jason Aldean,"I got off stage and this guy walked up to me. He's like this ball of energy. His name was Lawrence Mathis, a manager. He said. 'I like what you're doing, and I'd like to talk to you. What are your plans? What are you doing?' I said, 'You caught me at a bad time, because I'm probably moving home in a couple of months.' But I met with him that next Monday and told him what was going on. He said, 'Give me a year to work with you.' I said, 'l don't have a year. I've got six months, at best.' He said, 'All right. Six months.' Five weeks later we got offered a deal from Broken Bow."
LaMarcus Aldridge,It was just leave the middle to me and get to all their shooters.
LaMarcus Aldridge,"We're just trying to get ourselves back on track, so when this thing gets rolling to the NCAA Tournament, we'll have everything ready to go. If we finish strong, I think we still have a chance (at a No. 1 seed)."
LaMarcus Aldridge,It was really hard to sleep with it because you can't move at all.
LaMarcus Aldridge,I work on that in practice all the time. But I usually don't have to use it much.
LaMarcus Aldridge,I shot a lot of free throws in practice with Coach watching me.
LaMarcus Aldridge,"I don't think we were trying to prove anything to the country. We were just trying to get ourselves back on track so that when this thing gets rolling to NCAA, we'll be locked and ready to go. If we finish out strong and win our next couple of games, anything can happen. Any of the other No. 1 seeds could lose. We still have a chance (to be a top seed)."
LaMarcus Aldridge,"I go back and watch films with Coach. He shows me spots when I can disappear, as far as not wanting the ball or not being aggressive or being too passive. If I'm not wanting the ball, I'm not being aggressive. I'm just out there for no reason."
LaMarcus Aldridge,"Big Baby pushed me out of the lane. I didn't do what I was supposed to do. I missed shots. I tried to do other things, like rebound and block shots."

Michelle Alexander,"We'll start ramping up (today) with full practice. But we're hosting the Big Sky tournament, so we're going to be short practice time. It might put us at a disadvantage."
Michelle Alexander,"They made adjustments at half-time and we didn't. Their press killed us, and our girls just looked like they were worn out."

Shaun Alexander,"My mom told me a long time ago that the running back was a great position, but it's also the craziest. She's like, 'You know everybody's chasing you, right?' Once you chose to be a running back, you take the good with the bad."
Shaun Alexander,"My mom told me a long time ago that running back was a great position, but it's also the craziest. It just comes with the position."
Shaun Alexander,"The holes open, the holes close and we take advantage when we can get them. I think the running game was OK."
Shaun Alexander,"When I started here, we went 6-10 and watched other teams dance on our field to our music. I've seen us go from a team people laughed at to a team people have to respect. Now we're at the Super Bowl trying to build a dynasty."
Shaun Alexander,"Mike is just so key for us as a team, as a group of young men trying to grow up."
Shaun Alexander,I kind of put them in everybody's locker and then took off.
Shaun Alexander,"I think that we have a lot of guys that really need to rest up. They are playing hurt and playing beat up, which is football. But I think the timing is going to be good for us."
Shaun Alexander,This contract is truly a blessing. To be the highest running back ever is quite an honor. It's pretty good.
Shaun Alexander,"In my heart of hearts,"
Shaun Alexander,"I don't live my life trying to prove anything. I set high goals for myself. I set high goals for my team, and as a group, we just try to achieve them. Contracts are contracts. They're just part of the business that's after football, but it has nothing to do with what we do on the field."
Shaun Alexander,"You are making Mike look like a genius. Hopefully, we can prove you right Sunday."
Shaun Alexander,It's funny. Thank God everybody is safe.
Shaun Alexander,It's really funny because it was already in my mind to come in anyway. I prayed about it. It was just time. I knew this team could be special. I just felt like it was my time to come in. Tim made that offer as a gesture of goodwill when he didn't know me. It's all going to work out. I believe in that.
Shaun Alexander,"I believe that Seattle is really, really close to being a dominant football team. We can have a great tradition for a long time. I want to be a part of that. But fair is fair. My gut tells me Seattle will be fair."
Shaun Alexander,"I think whenever you play football, at any time it could be your last play. I think that's the great thing about this sport. Every week and every play, you have to play like it's your last. I'll just go out there and play hard, and that's the best I can do."
Shaun Alexander,"I think that, come January, we will be one of the offenses that everybody is going to fear. Everybody forgets that Jacksonville and Atlanta have a very good defense. I think we've done well against them."
Shaun Alexander,"We realized what it takes to beat good teams. We got to see it in one crazy environment. D.C. has some loud, great fans. That was an eye-opener for us."
Shaun Alexander,"We're a passing team, there's no doubt about that, and we always have been. When you look up at the end of the year, we're going to have a lot of yards on the ground, and we're going to score a lot of touchdowns."
Shaun Alexander,"We're just a team, and that's the greatest compliment that you can give."
Shaun Alexander,"Jerome is in a class of his own. He's much bigger than anybody else, and for him to have that speed and to be able to sidestep people, and then run through people, that puts him in a different class."
Shaun Alexander,"It was an emotional roller coaster -- going from Christmas, then your aunt dies, and then all the stats come out and you might get all these records. I've been asked, 'How do you feel?' Tired. I'm really blessed we do have this week off where I can kind of grab a hold back to reality."
Shaun Alexander,I told some of the guys before the game that playing aggressive and playing with passion is a choice. I said that everybody should make the choice today.
Shaun Alexander,"Ever since (childhood), I realized that one of the coolest things in the game is scoring touchdowns. And I think mentally that still drives me."
Shaun Alexander,"My first day here, just like my first day at Alabama, I went and got the record books and looked it all up. It was like, 'OK, how hard is it going to be for me to get this thing?' I started setting goals to get them fast."
Shaun Alexander,"He is definitely coming. This is my best friend. He'll be there, probably wearing a Pittsburgh jersey, but that's OK."
Shaun Alexander,"I walked in expecting to see Ken lying in a bed, ,"
Shaun Alexander,"Time heals all wounds, unless you pick at them."
Shaun Alexander,"I am a better running back every time I step on the field. I try to get better each game, each summer, each season."

Sherman Alexie,If I wasn't writing poems I'd be washing my hands all the time.
Daniel Alfredsson,It's great to see a fighting spirit in us and not quitting. It used to be a lot easier holding guys up in the neutral zone and making it a lot tougher for the other guys to come in to fore check. You can't do that anymore so once you get some momentum it's hard to stop it.
Daniel Alfredsson,I'm sure everybody is going to support Ted Saskin because he is the right man for the job. He did a good job for us in the collective bargaining agreement negotiations and I believe everybody wants to move forward.
Daniel Alfredsson,They are a young team that works really hard and tries to be a spoiler. We played well and had our chances and the first goal was going to be big obviously and it didn't go our way.
Daniel Alfredsson,The optimum would be to have him (Hasek) in net but he's injured and we're happy the way Ray has been playing. He's going to be the guy for us.
Daniel Alfredsson,"But you learn from it and you move on. Nobody can take this (pointing at his gold medal) away from us, either."
Daniel Alfredsson,We all smelled the fear of that game against Switzerland. Hopefully we can bring that out tomorrow as well.

Daniel Alfredsson,"They did for Canada, so why not?"
Daniel Alfredsson,"I would be very surprised if we were able to get an agreement. We're not going to accept a hard cap, but it's good we're talking."
Daniel Alfredsson,"Buffalo's goaltending wasn't the best they had, and we took advantage of that. When you get off on the wrong foot, it's tough to get back, and I think that's what we did to their goalies."
Daniel Alfredsson,"Buffalo's goaltending wasn't the best they had, and we took advantage of that, ... When you get off on the wrong foot, it's tough to get back, and I think that's what we did to their goalies."

Muhammad Ali,It's not bragging if you can back it up.
Muhammad Ali,Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes to win when the match is even.
Muhammad Ali,My way of joking is to tell the truth. That's the funniest joke in the world.
Muhammad Ali,It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe.
Muhammad Ali,I wish people would love everybody else the way they love me. It would be a better world.
Muhammad Ali,"I know where I'm going and I know the truth, and I don't have to be what you want me to be. I'm free to be what I want."

Bruce Allen,"With the fan support that we have in this stadium, in this city and in this state, we are going to be the most attractive team for free agency whether we have a salary cap or no salary cap. We have the resources to compete either way. Just tell us what the rules are and we'll play by them."
Bruce Allen,"Clearly, it makes it easier once you know what the rules are. If it is an uncapped year, there is not as much danger as you would think for '07. It makes it important you know the rules once the league year starts, those are the rules you are playing with and it's fair for everybody. ... We are going down two paths right now, preparing for each."
Bruce Allen,"We talked a lot about individual responsibility, ... We talked about being a part of a team, which he understood well. It's not the behavior you expect from a coach, whether part-time or full-time. ... I'm not going discuss publicly what we'll do as a club as far as discipline."
Bruce Allen,"I met with Jay Gruden this morning and talked a lot about individual responsibility. We talked about being a part of a team, which he understood well.

Unfortunately, as I said just a few days ago, I'm not going to discuss publicly what we'll do as a club as far as discipline."
Bruce Allen,It's never been our policy to discuss any type of team punishment. We've talked to Torrie and he knows exactly where he stands right now.

Bruce Allen,We're living in a cycle that is very volatile.
Bruce Allen,"It was never our intention to make any cuts until the final moment. They had moved the deadline first to 10 p.m. (Thursday), so we were going to work right up to 9:59."
Bruce Allen,The penalty is severe. ... It's 25% of his possible income for the year. He is absolutely going to have a tattoo on him for quite a few years. ... It has a dramatic effect on his career. But he can overcome it by performing well and never again being associated with this.
Bruce Allen,"Matt showed a lot, not only kicking field goals, but in kickoffs."
Bruce Allen,He's been an outstanding performer and his next stop will be getting fitted for a (Hall of Fame) bust in Canton. I don't think there's any doubt that everybody's intention is for him to retire as a Buccaneer.
Bruce Allen,He was the best quarterback we thought could help us right now. And the fact that he has experience allowed us to look at enough tape ... we feel very comfortable we know what we're getting.

Bruce Allen,"I've talked to about a dozen doctors,"

George Allen,One of the most difficult things everyone has to learn is that for your entire life you must keep fighting and adjusting if you hope to survive. No matter who you are or what your position is you must keep fighting for whatever it is you desire to achieve.

George Allen,"I am confident that with the wholesome character of our American people, justice will prevail and liberty will endure."
George Allen,Each of us has been put on earth with the ability to do something well. We cheat ourselves and the world if we don't use that ability as best we can.
George Allen,Success is what you do with your ability. It's how you use your talent.

James Allen,"To put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly, and accomplish masterfully."
James Allen,The suspicious believe everybody to be suspicious; the liar feels secure in the thought that he is not so foolish as to believe that there is such a phenomenon as a strictly truthful person; the envious see envy in every soul; the miser thinks everybody is eager to get his money;...and the abandoned sensualist looks upon the saint as a hypocrite
James Allen,"As water, when transmuted into steam, becomes a new, more definite and wide-reaching power, so passion, when transmuted into intellectual and moral force, becomes a new life, a new power for the accomplishment of high and unfailing purposes."
James Allen,"A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his thought forces upon the object which he has set before him. He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings. This is the royal road to self-control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails again and again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must until weakness is overcome), the strength of character gained will be the measure of his true success, and this will form a new starting point for future power and triumph."
James Allen,"Passion in all its forms is a mental thirst, a fever, a torturing unrest. As a fire consumes a magnificent building, reducing it to a heap of unsightly ashes, so are men consumed by the flames of passions, and their deeds and works fall and perish."
James Allen,To begin to think with purpose is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment.

James Allen,"When mental energy is allowed to follow the line of least resistance and to fall into easy channels, it is called weakness"
James Allen,"Self is ingenious, crooked, and, governed by subtle and snaky desire, admits of endless turnings and qualifications, and the deluded worshippers of self vainly imagine that they can gratify every worldly desire, and at the same time possess the Truth"
James Allen,You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration
James Allen,"If a man will understand how intimately, yea, how inseparably, self-control and happiness are associated, he has but to look into his own heart, and upon the world around,...Looking upon the lives of men and women, he will perceive how the hasty word, the bitter retort, the act of deception, the blind prejudice and foolish resentment bring wretchedness and even ruin in their train."
James Allen,"Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound"
James Allen,The outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to reflect their inner beliefs
James Allen,"Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built."
James Allen,"The law of harvest is to reap more than you sow. Sow an act, and you reap a habit. Sow a habit and you reap a character. Sow a character and you reap a destiny."
James Allen,"Let there be nothing within thee that is not very beautiful and very gentle, and there will be nothing without thee that is not beautiful and softened by the spell of thy presence."
James Allen,"A man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer of the man with his surroundings."
James Allen,It is a process of diverting one's scattered forces into one powerful channel.
James Allen,"The more intense the nature of a man, the more readily will he find meditation, and the more successfully will he practice it."
James Allen,"Circumstances do not make the man, they reveal him."
James Allen,"The man who sows wrong thoughts and deeds and prays that God will bless him is in the position of a farmer who, having sown tares, asks God to bring forth for him a harvest of wheat."
James Allen,"A man has to learn that he cannot command things, but that he can command himself; that he cannot coerce the wills of others, but that he can mold and master his own will: and things serve him who serves Truth; people seek guidance of him who is master of himself."
James Allen,"As in the rankest soil the most beautiful flowers are grown, so in the dark soil of poverty the choicest flowers of humanity have developed and bloomed."
James Allen,You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as you dominant aspiration.
James Allen,"In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result."
James Allen,He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would accomplish much must sacrifice much.
James Allen,"Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound."
James Allen,To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to achieve.
James Allen,"Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so you shall become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil."
James Allen,"The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom."
James Allen,The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do.
James Allen,A man is literally what he thinks.
James Allen,"To begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment."
James Allen,For true success ask yourself these four questions: Why? Why not? Why not me? Why not now?
James Allen,"When mental energy is allowed to follow the line of least resistance and to fall into easy channels, it is called weakness."
James Allen,They who have conquered doubt and fear have conquered failure.
James Allen,No temptation can gravitate to a man unless there is that is his heart which is capable of responding to it.
James Allen,"Work joyfully and peacefully, knowing that right thoughts and right efforts inevitably bring about right results."
James Allen,Whether you be man or woman you will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.
James Allen,"If you real desire is to be good, there is no need to wait for the money before you do it; you can do it now, this very moment, and just where you are."
James Allen,"Our life is what our thoughts make it. A man will find that as he alters his thoughts toward things and other people, things and other people will alter towards him."
James Allen,All that you accomplish or fail to accomplish with your life is the direct result of your thoughts.
James Allen,"Above all be of single aim; have a legitimate and useful purpose, and devote yourself unreservedly to it."
James Allen,Harmony is one phase of the law whose spiritual expression is love.
James Allen,"The very fact that you are a complainer, shows that you deserve your lot."

James Allen,"The man who cannot endure to have his errors and shortcomings brought to the surface and made known, but tries to hide them, is unfit to walk the highway of truth."
James Allen,Happiness is mental harmony; unhappiness is mental inharmony.
James Allen,You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.
James Allen,"Your difficulty is not contained, primarily, in the situation which gave rise to it, but in the mental state with which you regard that situation and which you bring to bear upon it."
James Allen,"The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn, the bird waits in the egg, and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities."
James Allen,All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts
James Allen,He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would accomplish much must sacrifice much
James Allen,"A man sooner or later discovers that he is the master-gardener of his soul, the director of his life."
Marcus Allen,"You've got to be extremely careful, because you could be with a great team, and you could be the product of a great team. There are some players that stand out despite the teams that they play on, and there are some players that are good because of the team that they're with."
Marcus Allen,"You know, I think when I reflect on it, I think there's certainly a sense of history. When you have ambitions to play this game, you want to be one of the best ever, and you want to play so well and be so effective that you want people to remember your name 100 years from now."
Marcus Allen,"To be a winner of that, and to fall in the long line of traditional great backs at USC, to have your name in perpetuity, the fact that your parents are like icons... that's the greatest thing."
Marcus Allen,"That's why, to experience that, you know for a fact that a human being is capable of so much more, because to go to that place and to step outside yourself and observe yourself do these things, while the rest of the world is moving in slow motion, is really incredible."
Marcus Allen,"It's always hard - if you're not the best player on your team, how can you be the best player in college?"
Marcus Allen,"It really lasted the whole game, because I was really untouchable, unstoppable that game. But it was heightened on one particular play, and that was the longest run where everything completely slowed down. My awareness was so keen, it was so heightened, it was really amazing."
Marcus Allen,It actually took me a year to learn how to play running back - to understand what they were doing defensively and then what our guys were doing every single play.
Marcus Allen,"I was saying earlier that it's really strange - you can almost step outside yourself and observe yourself running, and that's what I was doing."
Marcus Allen,"I was happy that right away we played Tennessee, I was happy that we played Oklahoma right off the top. Those games certainly helped me."
Marcus Allen,I just think that we're capable of so much more; we don't utilize all our capacity like we should.
Marcus Allen,"I just felt like reflecting on my junior year, when I didn't know what I was doing, I left a lot of stuff out there. Actually, I gained close to 700 yards more and I took myself out of a lot of games."
Marcus Allen,"Going in, I knew I wasn't one of the top ones, because I didn't even make the pre-season All-American team. That shows you what people thought of me right there, so I knew I had to go to work."
Marcus Allen,"Even as voters, we try to keep up with the guys as much as possible, mainly through television or ESPN."
Marcus Allen,"At USC, if you're running back there, and you do gain you over 1,500 yards, people see you as a candidate, but not one of the top ones."
Marcus Allen,"But Barry, to me, is head and shoulders above everybody."
Marcus Allen,"But there is something to the fact that we don't see games on the West Coast, or we don't see games on the East Coast, and stuff like that. It's so unfair, because there is a bias that takes place."
Mark Allen,"They've always wanted to (unionize) and now they legally can. It's obviously going to cost us more money, but we're going to try to make a positive out of it, ... We will have a professional working relationship."
Mark Allen,"It was my first time in front of the television cameras and my home crowd so I'm delighted by the way I played and the result,"
Mark Allen,"[University Police Officer Mark Allen said it was a typical football weekend.] It doesn't appear there were any serious injuries, ... Everything went smoothly for a Penn State football weekend."
Mark Allen,We are providing a good place for everybody. We are trying to keep family units together and give them some privacy. They've had enough shellshock as it is.
Mark Allen,Some vehicles always have been right -- inspired from the beginning.
Mark Allen,It's been a brilliant season. Two of the squad members are also representing Yorkshire at basketball and we wish them well too.
Paul Allen,We've basically sold our position in USAI. We're very much focused on bearing down on cable and interactive television.
Paul Allen,"We've basically sold our position in USAI, ... We're very much focused on bearing down on cable and interactive television."
Paul Allen,"If I have to sell the team or if it can't continue, that will be sad. But sports franchises really only work if the community and ownership are in a mutually beneficial partnership."
Paul Allen,"Our attempt to send the first privately funded astronaut into suborbital space will be the next step in that process. If successful, it will be a major milestone in private space exploration."
Paul Allen,"Being aware of what this has done to our corporate reputation, we're not happy about it."
Paul Allen,"We looked more carefully at our emergency generator and our fuel supply, and our capability to provide uninterrupted power if we lost power,"

Paul Allen,"We believe Tim will solidify the football culture of the Seahawks,"
Paul Allen,I am very excited to be supporting one of the world's most visionary efforts to seek basic answers to some of the fundamental question about our universe and what other civilisations may exist elsewhere.
Paul Allen,"The possible is constantly being redefined, and I care deeply about helping humanity move forward."
Paul Allen,"What should exist? To me, that's the most exciting question imaginable. What do we need that we don't have? How can we realize our potential?"
Paul Allen,"When it comes to helping out, I don't believe in doing it for the media attention. My goal is to support the organizations that need help."
Paul Allen,"In my own work, I've tried to anticipate what's coming over the horizon, to hasten its arrival, and to apply it to people's lives in a meaningful way."
Paul Allen,"We've had some tough times, but we've hung in there."
Paul Allen,"The best museums and museum exhibits about science or technology give you the feeling that, hey, this is interesting, but maybe I could do something here, too."
Ray Allen,"It may sound like a small thing, but I think Bob is less concerned about things that don't have to do with basketball,"
Ray Allen,"I was frustrated in the game because it seemed that teams were forcing me to work so hard for shots coming off the perimeter, ... It got to a point where we started off having to take too many long shots, too many tough shots."
Ray Allen,He (Butler) turned it on and made some shots and I was just trying to stay with him. I tried to keep him away from the ball and he still made some tough shots.
Ray Allen,Everyone has to do their job. Everyone has to buy into it and believe in what we're trying to do regardless of who's playing and who's not.
Ray Allen,"It was good to see Nate, but we were trying to win tonight. There's a lot to be said for his time here, because he did a lot of great things."
Ray Allen,We forced them to take shots on the perimeter. We kind of took what they were trying to do away from them.
Ray Allen,"Everybody ran. We got buckets in a lot of different ways. We kept running, we kept pushing it."
Ray Allen,"People decide if they want to be led, they'll be led. If they decide they don't want to be part of the system, they'll buck it."
Ray Allen,A tough woman. That lady has touched more people than I've ever known.
Ray Allen,"We know we are a better team than what we have displayed over the last week, ... Every night is an opportunity to prove that, and tonight we got on the same page a little bit more than we have."
Ray Allen,I'll give it to him. He had a heck of a night making shots with a hand in his face.
Ray Allen,Mike would spend the night at the house. We'd stay up late and then get up in the morning and go to practice. Everything he did just emulated exactly what I was doing out there on the floor and you see what he can do now.
Ray Allen,"It was Chinese music. I couldn't understand it, but it had a good beat to it."
Ray Allen,"I don't mind a guy going at me at both ends of the floor, I can respect that. But when guys start throwing elbows and when they kick you when you're down, that's dirty basketball and I don't respect guys like that."
Ray Allen,"I told Reggie he played a great game. He didn't respond. But I told him, 'Win or lose, man you played well.' Hopefully he feeds off that. He's young and has a lot of basketball left to play."
Ray Allen,I never apologize for blowing anybody out. I love it. Let us have our moment to be able to play.
Ray Allen,"He is going through a phase now where he's learning or he has to learn what it's like to deal with pain. And to be able to play through it and go out and still be good with that pain, because at some point we've all had to face it."
Ray Allen,"We're learning some things about ourselves being steady down the stretch. You know me, I try to just take one game at a time, but I can see progress. Guys are in better shape. We practice harder and things are coming together."
Ray Allen,"Free Soil, Unfree Labor: Cave Johnson Couts and the Binding of Indian Workers in California, 1850Ã‚Â­1867."
Ray Allen,"They still have some strings on you. You can't get hurt. Some guys have gotten hurt before they signed the big contract. I'm out here making sure, very gingerly, that I don't get hurt."
Ray Allen,"You hate to see something like that happen to a good person. Unfortunately, in this situation it's not about being good people in this job. In this line of work, it's about wins. And that's how we'll all be judged."
Ray Allen,"Records are always made to be broken. I have a long way to go, games to play, threes to hit. The key is getting to playoff basketball."
Ray Allen,Our track record hasn't been good. We've lost so many close games in this building this season. We're learning some things about ourselves.
Ray Allen,"Inside the first 20 to 25 games of the season, we were losing these games, getting beat by two and three points. Over the last 10 games, it seems like we're starting to win these games and putting some good things together."
Ray Allen,The shots were there for me tonight. It was a fun game to play because it went back and forth.
Ray Allen,It's no fun to think about individual success when as a team you don't make the playoffs. I don't really take pride in what I did because the team didn't do well.
Ray Allen,"[The idea] is to go out to have fun. I think everybody is trying to feel each other out at the beginning, and the defense isn't ever present at the start. By the fourth quarter, the game grows a personality and everybody starts to play defense. Things really start to get competitive."
Ray Allen,"They just came out on fire. In the first half of the season we would kind of hang our head when we got down, but tonight we didn't hang our heads. We kept fighting. We kept our composure."
Ray Allen,"It's something I had to deal with and however I can keep my family safe and allow them to live a comfortable life that's what I try to do,"
Ray Allen,Tonight I was just off. I can't make any excuse. I just didn't make shots.
Ray Allen,I was just off. I'm not going to make any excuses. I just didn't make shots.
Ray Allen,We started the first half tonight with that same muddy approach. We were lethargic and didn't have much enthusiasm. The attitude was there in the second half.
Ray Allen,"I look at how we got beat and I thought the hustle points and the energy points were all gauged through offensive rebounds. I thought in the second half they got so many second-chance opportunities they could really run. It just seemed like they were going up our guys' backs. When you don't get any offensive rebounds and they start going the other team's way, it's almost like a snowball effect."
Ray Allen,"It was a very weird feeling, I'm not going to lie to you. My emotions were torn a little bit."
Ray Allen,"I always thought Bob, he seemed like the guy who knew it all. I have no doubt in my mind he has the ability to do the job and do it in a fashion that everybody will be pleased."
Ray Allen,"The discipline stuff, I'm going to leave that to the coaches and management,"
Ray Allen,"At certain times, the whole 'Let's play hard and leave it all on the floor' conversation is corny. I hate saying it, but I have to because that's what we do in sports. That's how we exist. That's how we motivate each other to be better every night. If you don't believe in the team system, that's the look guys gave me a lot of times. 'This is corny. I'm not going to be part of it. This is just me.' And that attitude isn't going to help any team."
Ray Allen,You have to stand up and be heard. You have to make a coach see you.
Ray Allen,"If you come out one night and you're cheating the game, cheating yourself, cheating your teammates, you know it inside. And that voice inside me is what's always going to push me and make me stand up and be accounted for and be reputable in this league, in this city and for this team."
Ray Allen,I think we all believe we're a good team.
Ray Allen,"I think his career in basketball has come to the pinnacle at this point where he can celebrate everything he's done with his former players, current players, the players who will come after all of us. This is a testimony to how great of a coach he is, but as a person first and foremost just by the simple fact that he has this much support from everybody he's been around and everyone who's been under his tutelage."
Ray Allen,"It's just dirty basketball. It's plain, outright, dirty basketball. I don't mind the competition, someone going at me on both ends of the floor ... but when guys start throwing elbows and kick you when you're down, that's dirty basketball and I don't respect guys like that."
Ray Allen,"I don't look at [an age limit] as a bad thing. I think we're helping out younger guys, not hurting them."
Rick Allen,"People want to be entertained again. Our music is like 'Star Wars' for the ears. The production, the music -- it's all about entertainment."
Rick Allen,"No matter how many times we play these songs live, we don't tire of them. We love that some of them have become a soundtrack to people's lives - that people remember where they were when that song became important to them. Hey, that's the way we feel when we hear an old David Bowie or T.Rex song."
Rick Allen,The emphasis is back on really good songs. And it's nice to return to our larger than life sound.
Rick Allen,Twenty applicants were viable football candidates.
Rick Allen,I think he brings enthusiasm and love for the game. He seems to get the best out of a kid and is a good role model for the kids. He is a nice fit for us. We are excited to have the opportunity to have him here hopefully for a long time.

Woody Allen,"To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering, one must not love. But then, one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to suffer; to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love. To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy. Therefore, to be happy, one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness."

Woody Allen,"The good people sleep much better at night than the bad people. Of course, the bad people enjoy the waking hours much more."
Woody Allen,"If you'd like to know how to get from the Big Apple to the Big Easy, take Highway Love, and you'll get there."
Woody Allen,"I've often said, the only thing standing between me and greatness is me"
Woody Allen,She wore a short skirt and a tight sweater and her figure described a set of parabolas that could cause cardiac arrest in a yak.

Woody Allen,"Early in life, I was visited by the bluebird of anxiety"
Woody Allen,"Of all the wonders of nature, a tree in summer is perhaps the most remarkable; with the possible exception of a moose singing ''Embraceable You'' in spats."
Woody Allen,"What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? In that case, I definitely overpaid for my carpet."
Woody Allen,The lion and the calf shall lie down together but the calf won't get much sleep.
Woody Allen,"Right now it's only a notion, but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept, and later turn it into an idea."
Woody Allen,It's not that I'm afraid to die. I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Woody Allen,It seemed the world was divided into good and bad people. The good ones slept better while the bad ones seemed to enjoy the waking hours much more.
Woody Allen,"I'm not afraid to die, I just don't want to be there when it happens."
Woody Allen,Dying is one of the few things that can be done as easily lying down.
Woody Allen,"In California, they don't throw their garbage away - they make it into TV shows."
Woody Allen,My one regret in life is that I am not someone else.
Woody Allen,In Beverly Hills... they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Woody Allen,I think being funny is not anyone's first choice.
Woody Allen,"The food here is terrible, and the portions are too small."
Woody Allen,I don't have to 'freedom-kiss' my wife when what I really want to do is French-kiss her.
Woody Allen,I've never been an intellectual but I have this look.
Woody Allen,"Some guy hit my fender, and I told him, 'Be fruitful and multiply,' but not in those words."

Woody Allen,Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening at once.
Woody Allen,"Not only is there no God, but try finding a plumber on Sunday."

Woody Allen,Eighty percent of success is showing up.
Woody Allen,His lack of education is more than compensated for by his keenly developed moral bankruptcy.
Woody Allen,I was nauseous and tingly all over. I was either in love or I had smallpox.
Woody Allen,"If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans."
Woody Allen,I want to tell you a terrific story about oral contraception. I asked this girl to sleep with me and she said 'No.'
Woody Allen,Bisexuality immediately doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.
Woody Allen,If only God would give me some clear sign! Like making a large deposit in my name at a Swiss bank.
Woody Allen,"Man consists of two parts, his mind and his body, only the body has more fun."
Woody Allen,I tended to place my wife under a pedestal.
Woody Allen,Tradition is the illusion of permanance.
Woody Allen,"I'd call him a sadistic, hippophilic necrophile, but that would be beating a dead horse."
Woody Allen,Who bothers to cook TV dinners? I suck them frozen.
Woody Allen,I ran into Isosceles. He had a great idea for a new triangle!
Woody Allen,Seventy percent of success in life is showing up.
Woody Allen,I'm astounded by people who want to 'know' the universe when it's hard enough to find your way around Chinatown.
Woody Allen,I have bad reflexes. I was once run over by a car being pushed by two guys.
Woody Allen,"Harvard makes mistakes too, you know. Kissinger taught there."
Woody Allen,"When we played softball, I'd steal second base, feel guilty and go back."
Woody Allen,Most of the time I don't have much fun. The rest of the time I don't have any fun at all.
Woody Allen,I don't think my parents liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.
Woody Allen,"My luck is getting worse and worse. Last night, for instance, I was mugged by a quaker."
Woody Allen,"I am thankful for laughter, except when milk comes out of my nose."
Woody Allen,"He was so depressed, he tried to commit suicide by inhaling next to an Armenian."
Woody Allen,I'm such a good lover because I practice a lot on my own.
Woody Allen,"Why are our days numbered and not, say, lettered?"
Woody Allen,Eternal nothingness is fine if you happen to be dressed for it.
Woody Allen,I had a terrible education. I attended a school for emotionally disturbed teachers.
Woody Allen,"I'm very proud of my gold pocket watch. My grandfather, on his deathbed, sold me this watch."
Woody Allen,"Life is full of misery, loneliness, and suffering - and it's all over much too soon."
Woody Allen,"Comedy just pokes at problems, rarely confronts them squarely. Drama is like a plate of meat and potatoes, comedy is rather the dessert, a bit like meringue."
Woody Allen,"To you I'm an atheist; to God, I'm the Loyal Opposition."
Woody Allen,"Life doesn't imitate art, it imitates bad television."
Woody Allen,"If you're not failing every now and again, it's a sign you're not doing anything very innovative."
Woody Allen,You can live to be a hundred if you give up all the things that make you want to live to be a hundred.
Woody Allen,"In my house I'm the boss, my wife is just the decision maker."
Woody Allen,Organized crime in America takes in over forty billion dollars a year and spends very little on office supplies.
Woody Allen,"It is no secret that organized crime in America takes in over forty billion dollars a year. This is quite a profitable sum, especially when one considers that the Mafia spends very little for office supplies."
Woody Allen,"I let the cast improvise a lot, especially with the slang, where they would say 'g and t' for gin and tonic. I wouldn't say that. I would say 'dicey' when they would say 'dodgy.' I learnt a lot."
Woody Allen,"The talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have, instead of what you don't have."
Woody Allen,Just don't take any class where you have to read BEOWULF.
Woody Allen,"Music has always helped my films. In 'The Curse Of The Jade Scorpion,' you can hear 'Sunrise' by Glenn Miller, an idol of my childhood, in the surprise ending. I like mixing comedy with suspense and action."
Woody Allen,And my parents finally realize that I'm kidnapped and they snap into action immediately: They rent out my room.
Woody Allen,"When I was kidnapped, my parents snapped into action. They rented out my room."
Woody Allen,I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.
Woody Allen,Students achieving Oneness will move on to Twoness.
Woody Allen,It shows exactly what you can do if you're a total psychotic.
Woody Allen,I am two with nature.
Woody Allen,"As the poet said, 'Only God can make a tree,' probably because it's so hard to figure out how to get the bark on."
Woody Allen,"If my films don't show a profit, I know I'm doing something right."
Woody Allen,"Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons."

Woody Allen,"If my films make one more person miserable, I'll feel I have done my job."
Woody Allen,I failed to make the chess team because of my height.
Woody Allen,I will not eat oysters. I want my food dead. Not sick. Not wounded. Dead.
John Allison,The value system we have at BB&T is also my personal value system.
John Allison,"Ninety percent of our stuff is there. We were planning to sell this house as quick as we can and move there, and now we understand, the best reports we're getting that our house there is underwater."
John Allison,"Traditionally, we haven't scored very well in the region, but a lot of times in the past we were so much better than the competition that it didn't matter. This year, we're not as good, and the competition is better. Hopefully, with those two things, we'll get fired up and shoot a good score."
John Allison,"The idea that a citizen's property can be taken by the government solely for private use is extremely misguided, in fact it's just plain wrong."
Gloria Allred,What pregnant woman do you know that would be fine with her husband having a girlfriend? Who is he kidding?
Gloria Allred,"It's rather a bit mysterious as to why they would even do this, ... It's my understanding that they have already been provided with those records."
Gloria Allred,Amber in good faith always believed that Mr. Flores was her child's father.
Gloria Allred,"It would not surprise me if she testified at the trial, ... They obviously have made a determination that they will have enough evidence in order for the judge to decide that this case should be bound over for trial without Ms. Frey's testimony."
Gloria Allred,The more I know about men the more I like dogs.
Maureen Allyn,"We should see an upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP based on this [trade] number. But whatever it does to the GDP, it does not suggest that we're starting on a big roar of strength."
Maureen Allyn,I really do believe this technological revolution qualifies as a big one that is going to have a long-lasting impact.
Maureen Allyn,The rest of the world is not in good shape and exporting to them is a tough slog.
Maureen Allyn,"A strong dollar takes away companies' pricing power because imported goods come in a lot cheaper, and it impacts earnings because they can't raise prices."
Maureen Allyn,"Companies have to learn to live with keeping their costs down. They're not going to get pricing power not in our lifetime, I'm afraid. The world is just much too competitive."
Maureen Allyn,The August jobs report gave Wall Street just what it wanted.
Maureen Allyn,"If you can lay off all those people at GM and still have 66,000 new jobs created last month, that's really pretty strong."
Maureen Allyn,Growth took them by surprise last year so I think this is paying back for all that growth we had last year.
Maureen Allyn,"We're finding some footing, but the problem is, the job [numbers are] lagging. Even if we get [economic] growth, we're still going to see job losses. We're really at a very critical moment where we kind of have to start seeing a little bit of good news or the bad news starts piling up."
Maureen Allyn,I think we're going to have to begin to believe that we're not in an inflationary environment. Sooner or later it's going to sink in.
Maureen Allyn,"Realistically, they've done a lot already. The economy may be sleepy, but you don't need to hit it with everything you've got."
Maureen Allyn,You really don't want to do any sudden moves. The economy is doing really well. Why fix it? It doesn't need fixing.
Maureen Allyn,Greenspan's testimony to Congress is always an event and probably more so this time than usual. We are looking at the Fed with a bias to tightening and we have to get some warning of whether he is going to act on that or not. So what I am looking for is a clear signal.
Maureen Allyn,What we're getting are increasing signs of caution on the part of consumer. You simply can't be in this society and read all the headlines about job losses going on without wondering if this is going to apply to you sometime.
Maureen Allyn,At least it's a beginning... They'll do more if they need to.
Fernando Alonso,"You know how it is with women,"
Fernando Alonso,The last 10 laps went really slowly. I just wanted to cross the line and enjoy the victory with the team and the grandstand opposite the pits where most of the people were coming from the Renault factory.
Fernando Alonso,These eight points are like a victory to me.
Fernando Alonso,"It was a bit of a surprise for us that we had problems in Hungary. But in reality, I think the car could have been pretty competitive with a trouble-free race."
Fernando Alonso,Thanks to luck and thanks to the mechanics who did a perfect stop again.
Fernando Alonso,"This was a good, fighting win and I want to dedicate it to the mechanics and the team, for some fantastic pit stops and the right strategy."
Fernando Alonso,To become part of a team with such a desire to succeed and passion for performance is a dream come true for any Formula One driver. Obviously I will be sad to leave Renault but sometimes possibilities come along which are just too good to miss.
Felipe Alou,"It is good to do that, but sooner or later Barry is going to play in the field. Because on opening day, what will we do? ... It's not like it's going to be every game he's DH. For us as a team, it can't be that way."
Felipe Alou,"He gave me the best at-bat that I have seen this year, ... I'm not just talking about our                                                                                                                          team. I'm talking about any team. Right out of hospital."
Felipe Alou,"That's always been the thing about him. He'd go along fine, and then he'd get into trouble and give up three or four runs and not get out of it."
Felipe Alou,"The talent there [with Montreal] was prospects. When we brought a prospect to camp, he very much had a job, ... Over here, prospects have to break through a lot to make it."
Felipe Alou,He had a great batting practice today. He hit a bunch of balls into the water.
Felipe Alou,Mo's really not getting many pitches to hit. He doesn't have the patience of Barry Bonds .
Felipe Alou,"He didn't have one great pitch, but he got hitters out with intelligence and command."
Felipe Alou,It was really obvious what went on to the players and managers. I hope what is being done will stop what was going on and also stop any possibility of further problems. I certainly hope this will be the end of it.
Felipe Alou,Barry played in the outfield during practice today and looked pretty good. Barry is having fun again. He didn't have any fun last year because he was hurt.
Felipe Alou,"He's still in the hands of the trainers and doctors. When we're given the green light, we'll stick him in there."
Felipe Alou,We were right. But it turned out to be a disaster.
Felipe Alou,"[The devil made him do it: There's little question San Francisco radio talk-show host Larry Krueger deserved to be fired for calling some Giants] brain-dead Caribbean hitters hacking away at slop. ... a messenger of Satan, and I believe there is no forgiveness for Satan."
Felipe Alou,That's the way it is. I don't believe one particular outing is going to make a difference. He's the kind of guy who doesn't really care who's on the other side.
Felipe Alou,He made tons of big pitches. It is hard to believe that a guy making his first start would be so sharp. You do not find a guy throwing eight innings on his first start.
Felipe Alou,I saw balls that were hit where he had to run and stop. I didn't see much favoring in the knee. He's so much better than he was in spring training. That was a real workout.
Felipe Alou,"What I did wasn't just for Latin players. I did this because I want to live in an America where no one regardless of their skin color has to hear that stuff anymore. For too long, I had to listen to that stuff, and it wasn't right and it isn't right now."
Felipe Alou,"They used to say when I was a kid, 'Well, he's a Babe Ruth.' Any kid my age who hit a home run they would say 'Wow, he's a Babe Ruth' - in the Dominican. I didn't hear people say 'He's a Hank Aaron.' There's something mystic about the Babe, the name. ... Santa Claus."
Felipe Alou,"I didn't think a guy of that age and stature [would do as well], but Finley is a pro."
Felipe Alou,There was a lot of intensity. I didn't think a guy of that age or stature could do that. The guy's a pro.
Moises Alou,I'm learning not to get so angry. Bonds is going to get a lot of walks. I have to take advantage of those opportunities.
Moises Alou,He always tries to do what's best for the team. No question about that. I hate to take him out of the game and have one of the kids bat fourth in a late-inning situation. You don't want a young kid to come up three times in extra innings.
Moises Alou,"No question, Ray was a leadoff guy until last year, because of circumstances -- injuries to Barry and Mo. I would like him to be the leadoff guy, but Winn is a pretty good one, too, and Omar is, too, but he prefers to bat second."
Moises Alou,"Not every athlete is ready for fruit-scented hand cream. Moises Alou of the San Francisco Giants, who doesnâ€™t wear batting gloves when he hits, disclosed last season that he urinates on his hands to prevent calluses."
Herb Alpert,My first instinct was not to do it. I didn't want to trample on ( Whipped Cream ).
Herb Alpert,"It's certainly an honor. When I got the call I didn't sure how to react, to tell you the truth. It wasn't until my wife's gynecologist called and congratulated me that I figured we were onto something."
Herb Alpert,"This special event at Vibrato brought together many people sharing a common bond - a love of jazz and a desire to support its future, ... It gave them the opportunity to indulge in both passions - to celebrate the great artistry of Dave Brubeck, and to support the Brubeck Institute, a program at the University of the Pacific which, through its Fellowship Program and Summer Jazz Colony, serves to train and nurture the next generation of great jazz artists and innovators."
Herb Alpert,Is there an audience for it? I don't know. I don't think it's the audience who bought it originally. But there's a younger audience that might appreciate it. These are good songs.
Herb Alpert,"You know, the record business is much different than being artist on stage."
Herb Alpert,"With tape, you capture the impact, but you bring in some other elements. Sometimes those elements are good and sometimes, they're not."
Herb Alpert,"When I finish an album and I find myself listening to it in the car, because it makes me feel a certain way, that's the time to try to let other people know about it."
Herb Alpert,"We were like a trial for the digital process, and I found that in that particular timeframe, there were too many problems with it."
Herb Alpert,We finally got our big break when Ed Sullivan put us on his show.
Herb Alpert,"We always felt that if you do something with quality and integrity, then it's going to come back to you."
Herb Alpert,This was during a period when I was producing Brazil '66 records and got infected by Brazilian music.
Herb Alpert,"There's something interesting about playing live; you're in the moment, and I think it would be beneficial."
Herb Alpert,The trumpet was not a lyrical singing instrument.
Herb Alpert,The reaction to this album has just been fabulous around the world... and I've had offers to perform from around the world and I'm tempted to do it. I've got itchy lips.
Herb Alpert,The Japanese seem to be a loyal audience.
Herb Alpert,"Selfishly, I make music for me. I like to make music. I like looking for songs. I like working with interesting musicians. I like producing records. It's something I will always do."
Herb Alpert,Mexican Shuffle was a turning point of the Brass.
Herb Alpert,"It's very clean. With tape, you get noise."
Herb Alpert,"It's - as opposed to tape where you have a magnetic tape that's excited by frequencies that you hit, digital was a process where musical sounds are transferred to numbers and stored as numbers."
Herb Alpert,Instrumental music can spread the international language.
Herb Alpert,"If you look at a record under a microscope, the high frequencies are short jagged edges... and the low frequencies are long swinging ones are deep bass sounds. When it cut it at half speed, you're getting more of those on the record."
Herb Alpert,I'm sure I'll go back again and record in the digital process.
Herb Alpert,"I'm an old-timer in the business from the sense that when you do something that you feel good about there might be another person out there who feels the same way, or a hundred or a couple million."
Herb Alpert,"I was taken in by the bravado and the sounds of Mexico... not so much the music, but the spirit."
Herb Alpert,"I was obligated to do a bunch of concerts and a television show, but something in my stomach was telling me this wasn't what I wanted to do."
Herb Alpert,I practice every day. I've been doing it since I was eight.
Herb Alpert,I never thought of myself as a trumpet player in the traditional sense: I never played in a big band... I didn't struggle the normal way.
Herb Alpert,I like to listen to classical music... I like mainline jazz.
Herb Alpert,"I like to listed to the adventurous guys - the Coltranes, Miles Davis, the guys who just let it loose."
Herb Alpert,I find that it's nice to work with somebody and spin off on someone else's feelings. You get a little jaded by yourself.
Herb Alpert,"I don't think radio is selling records like they used to. They'd hawk the song and hawk the artist and you'd get so excited, you'd stop your car and go into the nearest record store."
Herb Alpert,I confess that I listen to my own music for my own pleasure.
Herb Alpert,"Although there was a point with the Tijuana Brass where we were playing for such huge crowds that I kind of lost contact. At one point, the only connection I had with the audience was with people out there lighting cigarettes."
Herb Alpert,"He has a method that likens the musician to an athlete, so I do physical exercises designed to keep a musician in shape in order to perform the function, which is to play music."
Herb Alpert,Clifford Brown was in the jazz circles considered to be probably the greatest trumpet player who ever lived.
Herb Alpert,"I wake up in the morning, I do a little stretching exercises, pick up the horn and play."
Philip Alston,An independent investigation is essential because these killings have huge implications for efforts to establish the rule of law in Iraq.
Philip Alston,"Under international law, widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population are crimes against humanity."
Philip Alston,"When defense lawyers are murdered, the rule of law is doubly at stake. Human rights law requires that all murders be investigated in a credible manner. Moreover, defense attorneys are critical to a fair trial, and their systematic assassination threatens the entire process."
Philip Alston,The dangerous escalation of the conflict in recent days is a direct consequence of killings being allowed to run unchecked.
Dana Altman,He misses playing. He prepared really hard for his senior year. It has been tough on him.
Dana Altman,"I talk to the players all the time about not making excuses. I'm probably the worst at making excuses. You've just got to keep going. The players have shown a lot of resiliency, and I appreciate that."
Dana Altman,"The guys played with some energy tonight. We got a few shots down, which helped us get going. This time of year, when you don't play for 13 days, that's really a long time."
Barry Alvarez,That's two weeks in a row we've had to come back. Finally getting rewarded with a victory helps morale.
Barry Alvarez,"Coach Mason could have taken a safety, but that's his call and I'm not going to second-guess him."
Barry Alvarez,"(Hampton) isn't the most gifted athlete that we have, yet he takes so much pride in how he plays, he's on every special team and I just thought it would send a strong message to our special-team guys that we appreciate them and that's the type of effort and that's the type of play that we're looking for."
Barry Alvarez,"When we win big games, our running backs play well."
Barry Alvarez,We always talk about being a spark and swinging the momentum of the game and that swung it.
Barry Alvarez,"They all recruit hard, they play solid football, they all have a good plan. It's not just someone trying to out-formation you, they know what it's all about. I think the coaching in this league is very strong."
Barry Alvarez,"I feel pretty good about (the retirement) because frankly there are not too many guys in my business who can do it. I feel grateful the university has been so good to me and my family. I have a chancellor that has been very supportive of me, and his cooperation on what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it. I think that is very unique to have a situation like that."
Barry Alvarez,"They came in and took my blood pressure about 10 minutes after the game, and it was off the charts,"
Barry Alvarez,I'm going to take the blame on that one ... because I called the swift kick. We should have just kicked it deeper. We flat out gave them three points. It's my fault for calling it.
Barry Alvarez,Matt was probably 205 pounds when we recruited him. But we could see what kind of athlete he is. He has a big frame (6-foot-6). He'll get on the field. He's very athletic. He's really going to be something some day.
R. Ambedkar,The relationship between husband and wife should be one of closest friends.
R. Ambedkar,"So long as you do not achieve social liberty, whatever freedom is provided by the law is of no avail to you."
R. Ambedkar,"Justice has always evoked ideas of equality, of proportion of compensation. Equity signifies equality. Rules and regulations, right and righteousness are concerned with equality in value. If all men are equal, then all men are of the same essence, and the common essence entitles them of the same fundamental rights and equal liberty... In short justice is another name of liberty, equality and fraternity."
R. Ambedkar,My definition of democracy is - A form and a method of Government whereby revolutionary changes in the social life are brought about without bloodshed. That is the real test. It is perhaps the severest test. But when you are judging the quality of the material you must put it to the severest test.
R. Ambedkar,"If I find the constitution being misused, I shall be the first to burn it."
R. Ambedkar,"I feel that the constitution is workable, it is flexible and it is strong enough to hold the country together both in peacetime and in wartime. Indeed, if I may say so, if things go wrong under the new Constitution, the reason will not be that we had a bad Constitution. What we will have to say is that Man was vile."
R. Ambedkar,"History shows that where ethics and economics come in conflict, victory is always with economics. Vested interests have never been known to have willingly divested themselves unless there was sufficient force to compel them."
R. Ambedkar,I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved.
R. Ambedkar,"Given the time and circumstances, nothing under the sun shall stop this country from becoming a super power.Being grateful has limitations, no man can be grateful at the cost of his dignity, no woman at the cost of her chastity and no country at the cost of its freedom.I hope that Mr. Gandhi will not drive me to the necessity of making a choice between his life and rights of my people, for I shall never consent to deliver my people bound hand and foot to the orthodox for generations to come."
R. Ambedkar,"Law and order are the medicine of the body politic and when the body politic gets sick, medicine must be administered."
R. Ambedkar,"Why does a human body become deceased? The reason is that as long as the human body is not free from suffering, mind cannot be happy. If a man lacks enthusiasm, either his body or mind is in a deceased condition.... Now what saps the enthusiasm in man? If there is no enthusiasm, life becomes drudgery - a mere burden to be dragged. Nothing can be achieved if there is no enthusiasm. The main reason for this lack of enthusiasm on the part of a man is that an individual looses the hope of getting an opportunity to elevate himself. Hopelessness leads to lack of enthusiasm. The mind in such cases becomes deceased.... When is enthusiasm created? When one breaths an atmosphere where one is sure of getting the legitimate reward for one's labor, only then one feels enriched by enthusiasm and inspiration."
Mark Amdahl,"I'm going to play man-to-man, I think. If we play zone, she'll have 50 (points)."
Mark Amdahl,"If we get out in the open court, there's some unbelievable things the girls have done this year."
Mark Amdahl,The girls are ready to start open gym already.
Mark Amdahl,"A coach is only as good as his players are, I think. They had a goal and they really have stuck with it. They deserve to be here."
Mark Amdahl,"Shooting 34 percent in the state basketball tournament, I don't think you're going to win a lot of games."
Gil Amelio,"While the operating results are disappointing, we made significant progress toward executing our strategic plans during the quarter,"
Gil Amelio,"(The earnings) represent real progress, ... The key is growth margins went in the right direction, unit volume increased quarter on quarter, and expenses came down. We threw off over $300 million in cash. All of those were in the right direction. So I think we're on our way."
Gil Amelio,"While the operating results are disappointing, we made significant progress toward executing our strategic plans during the quarter."
Gil Amelio,"The key is growth margins went in the right direction, unit volume increased quarter on quarter, and expenses came down. We threw off over $300 million in cash. All of those were in the right direction. So I think we're on our way."
Gil Amelio,The hardest part of this job is that you have to be more than a manager. You have to be a rock star. And I'm not that good a rock star.
Gil Amelio,"People have said that NeXT is 5 to 7 years ahead of the competition... Candidly, we made the same assessment. That's why I made the acquisition."
Stephen Ames,"It's just another tournament, just another major."
Stephen Ames,"I guess overall you've got to believe that you have a great golf swing and it's working. If you start worrying about if your golf swing is there or not, you're going to fall."
Stephen Ames,"It's always been a special place ... for golf. There's a lot of mystique behind the place. Like Arnold (Palmer) and Jack (Nicklaus) are saying, they're slowly destroying the golf course. It's not the same golf course that it used to be."
Stephen Ames,It's not the same golf course that it used to be.
Stephen Ames,It's been a big burden trying to play golf. Other things play on your mind. I'm happy to be in this position again. It's been a long battle.
Stephen Ames,"When you live in Calgary and take 10 weeks off from golf, you're just trying to get back to basics."
Stephen Ames,It's always been a good golf course to my eyes.
Stephen Ames,the best golf course I've played in Canada.
William Ames,"Although the whole man partakes of this grace, it is first and most appropriately in the soul and later progresses to the body, inasmuch as the body of the man is capable of the same obedience to the will of God as the soul."
William Ames,The ordinary ministry is that which receives all of its direction from the will of God revealed in the Scriptures and from those means which God has appointed in the church for its continual edification.
William Ames,"Nothing exists from eternity but God, and God is not the matter or a part of any creature, but only the maker."
William Ames,"Faith is the virtue by which, clinging-to the faithfulness of God, we lean upon him, so that we may obtain what he gives to us."
William Ames,"Active creation is conceived as a transitive action in which there is always presupposed an object about which the agent is concerned; it is virtually but not formally transitive because it makes, not presupposes, an object."
William Ames,"This subsistence, or manner of being of God is his one essence so far as it has personal properties."
William Ames,"Therefore, the church is not absolutely necessary as an object of faith, not even for us today, for then Abraham and the other prophets would not have given assent to those things which were revealed to them from God without any intervening help of the church."
William Ames,"The worship which directs itself toward God as our good regards him either as he is ours at present, in faith, or as he is to be ours, in hope."
William Ames,The world has not been in existence from eternity nor could it have been according to the present dispensation and ordering of things.
William Ames,The will of God is single and totally one in Him.
William Ames,"The will of God is eternal because He does not begin to will what He did not will before, nor cease to will what He willed before."
William Ames,"The starting point of sanctification is the filthiness, corruption, or stain of sin."
William Ames,"The relative property of the Son is to be begotten, that is, so to proceed from the Father as to be a participant of the same essence and perfectly carry on the Father's nature."
William Ames,The goodness of a thing created is the perfection of its fitness for the use which it serves. Now that use is either particular or universal.
William Ames,The good pleasure of God is an act of the divine will freely and effectively determining all things.
William Ames,The efficiency of God may be understood as either creation or providence.
William Ames,"The counsel of God is, as it were, his deliberation over the best manner of accomplishing anything already approved by the understanding and the will."
William Ames,The attributes of God tell us what He is and who He is.
William Ames,Sanctification is the real change in man from the sordidness of sin to the purity of God's image.
William Ames,"Sanctification is not to be understood here as a separation from ordinary use or consecration to some special use, although this meaning is often present in Scripture, sometimes referring to outward and sometimes to inward or effectual separation."
William Ames,"In the exercise of God's efficiency, the decree of God comes first. This manner of working is the most perfect of all and notably agrees with the divine nature."
William Ames,In contentment and joy are found the height and perfection of all love towards our neighbor.
William Ames,Hence the end of the world should be awaited with all longing by all believers.
William Ames,Hearing the word is the devout receiving of the will of God.
William Ames,"Hearing here, therefore, means any receiving of the word of God whether it be communicated to us by preaching, reading, or any other way."
William Ames,For this is our most perfect duty and yet least known to us by nature: Whatever we conceive or will should be joined with the good of our neighbor.
William Ames,"Everyone who understands the nature of God rightly necessarily knows that God is to be believed and hoped in, that he is to be loved and called upon, and to be heard in all things."
William Ames,"But the church cannot confer the necessary gifts for this ministry, and cannot prescribe for God those upon whom he should confer them."
William Ames,"An idea in man is first impressed upon him and afterwards expressed in things, but in God it is only expressed, not impressed, because it does not come from anywhere else."
Henri Frederic Amiel,An error is the more dangerous in proportion to the degree of truth which it contains
Henri Frederic Amiel,Doing easily what others find difficult is talent; doing what is impossible for others is genius.
Henri Frederic Amiel,Work while you have the light. You are responsible for the talent that has been entrusted to you.
Henri Frederic Amiel,The only substance properly so called is the soul.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Society lives by faith, and develops by science."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Our true history is scarcely ever deciphered by others. The chief part of the drama is a monologue, or rather an intimate debate between God, our conscience, and ourselves. Tears, grieves, depressions, disappointments, irritations, good and evil thoughts, decisions, uncertainties, deliberations --all these belong to our secret, and are almost all incommunicable and intransmissible, even when we try to speak of them, and even when we write them down."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Sacrifice still exists everywhere, and everywhere the elect of each generation suffers for the salvation of the rest."
Henri Frederic Amiel,To shun one's cross is to make it heavier.
Henri Frederic Amiel,We are never more discontented with others than when we are discontented with ourselves.
Henri Frederic Amiel,A thousand things advance; nine hundred and ninety-nine retreat: that is progress.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"The philosopher is like a man fasting in the midst of universal intoxication. He alone perceives the illusion of which all creatures are the willing playthings; he is less duped than his neighbor by his own nature. He judges more sanely, he sees things as they are. It is in this that his liberty consists -- in the ability to see clearly and soberly, in the power of mental record."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"The man who insists upon seeing with perfect clearness before he decides, never decides. Accept life, and you must accept regret."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark."
Henri Frederic Amiel,The fire which enlightens is the same fire which consumes.
Henri Frederic Amiel,The thirst for truth is not a French passion
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Mozart has the classic purity of light and the blue ocean; Beethoven the romantic grandeur which belongs to the storms of air and sea, and while the soul of Mozart seems to dwell on the ethereal peaks of Olympus, that of Beethoven climbs shuddering the storm-beaten sides of a Sinai. Blessed be they both! Each represents a moment of the ideal life, each does us good. Our love is due to both."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Thought is a kind of opium; it can intoxicate us, while still broad awake; it can make transparent the mountains and everything that exists."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Materialism coarsens and petrifies everything, making everything vulgar, and every truth false."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"It is not what he had, or even what he does, which expresses the worth of a man, but what he is."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Women wish to be loved without a why or a wherefore; not because they are pretty, or good, or well-bred, or graceful, or intelligent, but because they are themselves."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Sacrifice, which is the passion of great souls, has never been the law of societies."
Henri Frederic Amiel,Clever people will recognize and tolerate nothing but cleverness.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Every life is a profession of faith, and exercises an inevitable and silent influence."
Henri Frederic Amiel,Self-interest is but the survival of the animal in us. Humanity only begins for man with self-surrender.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Great men are true men, the men in whom nature has succeeded. They are not extraordinary -- they are in the true order. It is the other species of men who are not what they ought to be."
Henri Frederic Amiel,To do easily what is difficult for others is the mark of talent. To do what is impossible for talent is the mark of genius.
Henri Frederic Amiel,Doing easily what others find difficult is talent; doing what is impossible for talent is genius.
Henri Frederic Amiel,In health there is freedom. Health is the first of all liberties.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark"
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Tell me what you feel in your room when the full moon is shining in upon you and your lamp is dying out, and I will tell you how old you are, and I shall know if you are happy"
Henri Frederic Amiel,Truth is not only violated by falsehood; it may be equally outraged by silence
Henri Frederic Amiel,Every life is a profession of faith and exercises an inevitable and silent influence.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"True love is that which ennobles the personality, fortifies the heart, and sanctifies the existence."
Henri Frederic Amiel,To marry unequally is to suffer equally.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Liberty, equality - bad principles! The only true principle for humanity is justice; and justice to the feeble is protection and kindness."
Henri Frederic Amiel,Tears are the symbol of the inability of the soul to restrain its emotion and retain its self command.
Henri Frederic Amiel,To know how to suggest is the art of teaching.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Our duty is to be useful, not according to our desires, but according to our powers."
Henri Frederic Amiel,The best path through life is the highway.
Henri Frederic Amiel,Woman is the salvation or the destruction of the family. She carries its destiny in the folds of her mantle.
Henri Frederic Amiel,Destiny has two ways of crushing us -- by refusing our wishes and by fulfilling them.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Women wish to be loved not because they are pretty, or good, or well bred, or graceful, or intelligent, but because they are themselves."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"In every loving woman there is a priestess of the past -- a pious guardian of some affection, of which the object has disappeared."
Henri Frederic Amiel,We must have the courage to be happy
Henri Frederic Amiel,True humility is contentment.
Henri Frederic Amiel,Pure truth cannot be assimilated by the crowd; it must be communicated by contagion.
Henri Frederic Amiel,Common sense is the measure of the possible; it is composed of experience and prevision; it is calculation applied to life.

Henri Frederic Amiel,"Cleverness is serviceable for everything, sufficient for nothing."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Cleverness is serviceable for everything, sufficient for nothing"
Henri Frederic Amiel,Charm is the quality in others that makes us more satisfied with ourselves.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Our systems, perhaps, are nothing more than an unconscious apology for our faults --a gigantic scaffolding whose object is to hide from us our favorite sin."
Henri Frederic Amiel,Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. Gratitude is the completion of thankfulness. Thankfulness may consist merely of words. Gratitude is shown in acts.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"To know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living."
Henri Frederic Amiel,Life is short. Be swift to love! Make haste to be kind!
Henri Frederic Amiel,"A lively, disinterested, persistent liking for truth is extraordinarily rare. Action and faith enslave thought, both of them in order not to be troubled or inconvenienced by reflection, criticism or doubt."
Henri Frederic Amiel,For purposes of action nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will.
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Action is coarsened thought; thought becomes concrete, obscure, and unconscious."
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Action and faith enslave thought, both of them in order not be troubled or inconvenienced by reflection, criticism, and doubt."
Henri Frederic Amiel,For purposes of action nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will
Henri Frederic Amiel,"Man becomes man only by his intelligence, but he is man only by his heart."
Henri Frederic Amiel,I'm not interested in age. People who tell me their age are silly. You're as old as you feel.
Ed Amoroso,It's CNN for security geeks.
Ed Amoroso,My security team monitors just about everything.
Ed Amoroso,"There is no way to actively portray where security problems are coming from because all attacks look the same, and that forces you to assume the worst every time."
Tori Amos,Women must understand that simply attacking or hating men is just another form of disempowerment. A woman has to realize that when she makes a man crawl it doesn't give her power.
Tori Amos,"It's as if the horses have come to take us back, to descend, to find the dark side. By dark I mean what's hidden, not necessarily satanic."
Tori Amos,"When you stop putting yourself on the line, and you don't touch your own heart, how do you expect to touch other people?"
Tori Amos,"If you can't create physical life, you find a life force. If that's in music, that's in music. I started to find this deep, primitive rhythm, and I started to move to it. And I held hands with sorrow, and I danced with her, and we giggled a bit."
Tori Amos,"You can't control your popularity; I know I'm an acquired taste - I'm anchovies. And not everybody wants those hairy little things. If I was potato chips, I could go a lot more places, but I'm not."
Tori Amos,I think all the boys that write the screaming stuff would write the best love songs.... because they have the most to hide. The guys that are in the most pain are usually the ones with the biggest hearts.
Tori Amos,Anger is natural. It's part of the force. You just have to learn to hang out with it.
Tori Amos,I know I'm an acquired taste - I'm anchovies. And not everybody wants those hairy little things.
Tori Amos,"Give me life, give me pain, give me myself again."
Tori Amos,"There's room for everybody on the planet to be creative and conscious if you are your own person. If you're trying to be like somebody else, then there is isn't."
Tori Amos,"I'm a musician first, a food-lover second, a dirty mouth with feet, and a girl last time I checked."
Tori Amos,"Musically, I always allow myself to jump off of cliffs. At least that's what it feels like to me. Whether that's what it actually sounds like might depend on what the listener brings to the songs."
Tori Amos,"Our generation has an incredible amount of realism, yet at the same time it loves to complain and not really change. Because, if it does change, then it won't have anything to complain about."
Tori Amos,"Healing takes courage, and we all have courage, even if we have to dig a little to find it."
Tori Amos,"Some people are afraid of what they might find if they try to analyze themselves too much, but you have to crawl into your wounds to discover where your fears are. Once the bleeding starts, the cleansing can begin."
Tori Amos,"For the most part, pianos are female to me. Sometimes they're dykes, and they're always good fun."
Tori Amos,Many people lock a part of themselves away. It's a bit sacred.
Tori Amos,"You know that saying, bad things don't happen to good people? That's a lie."
Tori Amos,Sometimes you have to do what you don't like to get to where you want to be.
Tori Amos,"I think you have to know who you are. Get to know the monster that lives in your soul, dive deep into your soul and explore it."
Tori Amos,What girls do to each other is beyond description. No chinese torture comes close.
Tori Amos,"In our minds, love and lust are really separated. It's hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with, and isn't afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe."
Tori Amos,Some of the most wonderful people are the ones who don't fit into boxes.
Tori Amos,"I usually get myself into situations that cause sparks. I mean I'm a girl that likes the storms. I love feeling alive, I love walking out in the cold in my bare feet and feeling the ice on my toes."
Tori Amos,Guys would sleep with a bicycle if it had the right color lip gloss on. They have no shame. They're like bull elks in a field.
Tori Amos,I have so many different personalities in me and I still feel lonely.
Tori Amos,The violence betwen women is unbelievable. Women try to make each other crawl so that their knees are bleeding.
Tori Amos,"Your worst enemies are made when you ignore people. Those boys in America who shot dead classmates recently, didn't do that because they woke up with a positive self image that morning and then felt like slaughtering their friends. No, they felt igno"
Anacharsis Anacharsis,"Written laws are like spiders' webs, and will, like them, only entangle and hold the poor and weak, while the rich and powerful will easily break through them."
Anacharsis Anacharsis,"Written laws are like spider's webs; they will catch, it is true, the weak and the poor, but would be torn in pieces by the rich and powerful."
Anacharsis Anacharsis,"Wise men argue cases, fools decide them."
Trey Anastasio,"I'm really excited to get back on the road and start playing the new songs live, ... The road is where the songs grow legs and begin evolving on their own in new and interesting ways. Shine is opening a new door for my music and I can't wait to find out what's on the other side."
Trey Anastasio,"It was just such a sense of discovery happening that night, ... We did a tour in the spring -- this is God's honest truth -- and it wasn't really together yet. At 10,000 Lakes Festival, every time we played a song, the chemistry was there. I knew the next phase had begun. Since then, it has gotten better and better."
Trey Anastasio,"It's a thrill to be on Columbia Records. Columbia has been home to a lot of my favorite artists -- like Bob Dylan, Miles Davis, and Bruce Springsteen -- and it feels great to be working with people who really understand what I'm trying to do and allow me the freedom to go in new musical directions. I'm very proud of the way Shine has turned out and I hope everyone enjoys listening to it as much as we enjoyed making it."
Trey Anastasio,"Set the gearshift for the high gear of your soul, you've got to run like an antelope out of control!"
Trey Anastasio,"I am a prince I have it all, and I hear your foot steps on the wall, I wait in silence for your call, and take a shot and watch you fall."
Carlo Ancelotti,We're heading for our third final in four years and we want to do our very best to not let that go.
Carlo Ancelotti,It is a great moment. Now we are thinking about the derby and about putting some space between us and Inter.
Carlo Ancelotti,"It was a victory born more out of strength than quality, which is rare for us."
Carlo Ancelotti,I've signed up until 2008 and I am happy.
Carlo Ancelotti,We're stronger at the back and opponents are having a hard time scoring goals against us. Scoring goals is not our problem. We've always done that.
Carlo Ancelotti,If we do things properly we have no reason to fear Barcelona.
Carlo Ancelotti,The defeat at Lecce left me disappointed as we lost an important opportunity in the league but this game will be a different story.
Carlo Ancelotti,We didn't deserve this defeat. I think we have played at the same level as Barcelona. We've had good opportunities to score but we've missed them.
Carlo Ancelotti,"We suffered a lot in the first 25 minutes. Then we gradually took control of play. It was a match we could have won, and also lost. The penalty was not sensational, but the arm and the hand of Bayern defender should not have been there."
Carlo Ancelotti,"We are in impressive form, we play with enthusiasm. Self confidence helped my players to overcome a difficult start."
Carlo Ancelotti,Surprising results are possible. Concentration is a decisive factor.
Carlo Ancelotti,We believe we can do it.
Carlo Ancelotti,The absence of goals is a false problem for him.
David Andersen,"Honestly, it is a matter of what the students want. Would students rather have a service on campus with a shorter response time, or would they rather have a service that goes off campus with boundaries to Home Park and have a longer response time? Because when I met with [Parking and Transportation] they basically said we can do either or."
David Andersen,"Although this is still in the planning stage, it is something we are pushing for. These are great ways to raise money because sometimes students want to give [donations], but don't have cash on them. We've gotten good responses from both the Bursar's Office and Auxiliary Services."
David Andersen,The compromise we made with the AA this time was a fair one. It is a privilege for us to use these courts and in order to continue using them we need to work together so that the courts stay in good condition.
David Andersen,"It is only open to students now and we basically worked out an agreement with the AA where they are still going to pay for maintenance, but the CRC is in charge of operating the facility. They check people's BuzzCard, maintain the facility, and check for non-marking shoes."
Kurt Andersen,"It's high and low (culture), and we're casting a net wide. Almost everyone knows of these things; it's not like we're bringing them some obscure things."
Kurt Andersen,"When I talk to college students about Spy, it's like I'm describing something that happened in the 19th century. We were very lucky. We started Spy at a time when our generation had arrived at full adulthood and wanted to connect to its anti-establishment youth."
Kurt Andersen,"We're focusing on particular works  films, books, pieces of music, architecture  that deserve the name 'icon' and have this influence on our culture. Everybody knows those things, but almost because they're icons, people don't look below the fact of them."
Kurt Andersen,"We're focusing on particular works â€” films, books, pieces of music, architecture â€” that deserve the name 'icon' and have this influence on our culture. Everybody knows those things, but almost because they're icons, people don't look below the fact of them."
Andy Anderson,"It's the triple-whammy of tax planning: tax-free contributions, tax-free earnings and tax-free distributions. There are very few opportunities like that,"
Andy Anderson,"That's the type of response parents need. They need to know what's going on now, not three hours from now."
Andy Anderson,"The farmers received false information a long time ago. There was all kinds of misinformation put out there to them about this 40-acre thing, and what they could do."
Andy Anderson,"It makes your heart beat, ... We love to blow the walls out ... Of all the guys who started out at Sun, we are one of the few rock 'n' roll groups left. We're survivors."
Andy Anderson,"[The Stones] thought nothing of ... music, golf, football and girls."
Andy Anderson,"Nobody drank, ... We were clean livin' rock 'n' rollers, good 'ol boys who just wanted to make music and took everything for granted. We didn't want a million dollars, we wanted more gigs."
Andy Anderson,I'm not going to endorse something that I can't show would be a benefit to residents.
Bob Anderson,"We believe that this project will not have a negative impact on the environment or on the bird's ecosystem, ... we're all very interested in saving the bird."
Bob Anderson,"Traditionally, the single downside of the online program has been the credit-card payment requirement. But we have computers in the office here where individuals can pay cash and take the test, so we expect the program to grow even more."
Bob Anderson,"Our children are our most precious thing. There has to be consequences when a man breaks into another man's home. (Reinhardt) has a good background, but he did a bad thing."
Chris Anderson,"Because the Olympics tend to be in different time zones, we're prepared to not watch events live. It's a fantastic opportunity for Web video."
Chris Anderson,"Thats a critical time in kids lives when they need discipline, and he had it. And he had school spirit. Back then, you were proud to represent your team and your city and your school."
Chris Anderson,Those were the songs that were getting people out dancing. We found people were happy listening to it all night long.
Chris Anderson,it's all in the conversation.
Chris Anderson,I noticed that. Their coach told me I was going over the time and that's the first time anyone's said I was taking too long.
Chris Anderson,"He molded a lot of young kids. He was a tough, fair and likable guy as a coach."
Chris Anderson,"It was cool. My coach doesn't really look for me to score. I just look to play defense, rebound and run the floor, and I guess everything else will come."
Chris Anderson,"This is a clear illustration of a president's ability to raise the profile of a chosen issue. Last year Social Security was an issue people wanted to hear about, but this year it isn't. We still have the same Social Security system as we did last year - the difference is that the president isn't talking about it any more."
Christine Anderson,I learned that you have to have faith in the music.
Christine Anderson,"Life ain't more than gameboard spaceWith hoops to jump and dreams to chaseAnd one day fate'll put us all in our placeGoing going goneAnd one day God might come on backWith a summer tan and a CadillacTime, he'll laugh, why I just lost trackWhat else could he really say?"
Christine Anderson,"Dreaming is not enough. You have to go a step further and use your imagination to visualize, with intent! Forget everything you've ever been taught, and believe it will happen, just as you imagined it. That is the secret. That is the mystery of life."
Christine Anderson,"I believe anything is possible.Research into quantum physicsproves that a system changessimply by someone observing it.Therefore, all you have to do is beawake and aware of your environment,and that enables you totransform everything around you.It sounds like hocus pocus, butscientists are coming to realize thatjust thinking about something canmake it happen. Turns out maybefaith can move mountains."
Christine Anderson,"No matter what, ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. Any doubts must be put out of your mind. If you find yourself thinking something negative, figure out who it was who put that thought in your head... then acknowledge that it's not your thought, push it out of your mind, and say, I'm awesome!"
Christine Anderson,"What is important to remember is that people are resilient, and people do have the ability to build again."
Dave Anderson,We have seen research that shows visitors appreciate the museum more if a value is assigned to the visit.
Dave Anderson,Odor is one of the major issues. The waste also has a higher nutrient level as blood is rich in protein and nitrogen and those nutrients have to be properly disposed of.
Dave Anderson,The perfect going-away gift for a college student-athlete. A dictionary.
Dave Anderson,Dennis Conner is Pete Rose in deck shoes.
Dave Anderson,I think some basic lessons are just the perfect way to start. The advantage of having lessons at Diamond Lake is that it's very gentle terrain.
David Anderson,"We're doing this for our neighbors and to save lives and property,"
David Anderson,They had a sort of quiet insistence that you keep alive the memory of those who marked the path.
David Anderson,"It seems like we have a rivalry every week. CU hates us. BYU hates us. Air Force doesn't care for us and Wyoming really hates us. Every week, we're playing for some sort of trophy or plaque. That's what is unique about college football."
David Anderson,"I like science fiction and I read it a lot - if I were a collector, I would bid for his works,"
David Anderson,We had a lot of bad feelings built up from the last Reagan game. I think this makes up for it.
David Anderson,And that is really causing a split between people of faith and the secular world.
David Anderson,I thought it would be a good learning experience for the students to come out and to help give back to the community a little.
David Anderson,I feel like it is a dictatorship instead of a democracy.
David Anderson,"The Internet lets us do that for first time in the history of computers. It lets us, in effect, make them into one big parallel supercomputer."
David Anderson,"It all revolves around Coach Willy. He's been my coach and my mentor since I was four years old. When we're swimming, he doesn't even have to say anything. Just the thought of him being there forces you to try harder."
David Anderson,"Addressing these challenges requires vision and leadership. An appreciation and understanding of the business strategy, the role of IT service management and ICT strategies in line with business objectives, as well as an open exchange of information, are essential in achieving effective and proactive management of the ICT infrastructure."
David Anderson,The need is now and now is the time to meet future needs ... My greatest anxiety is getting everything ready at home so I can go tomorrow.
Harry Anderson,Not a single living patient was left in the hospital.
Harry Anderson,I don't know why he chose to post that. There was sufficient food and water in that hospital for at least another four days when we evacuated.
Harry Anderson,"That's the exact right answer, from beginning to end,"
James Anderson,It's good that we have a 150-plus advantage. We would work on it and make it into a bigger total. We will see how the situation is by tea.
James Anderson,"Bill said the stuff that he had to say. I'm very optimistic that they're going to make progress, and I'm very hopeful."
James Anderson,"He made arrangements to get those kids back to her, ... He took that all upon himself."
James Anderson,It's our stated intention to hold for the long-term. There's no set target for when we'll prepare to sell.
James Anderson,I had a clear path to the lane. I was able to get some steps to gather myself. My eyes just lit up.
John Anderson,I can't describe it. No words can describe it.
John Anderson,We have a clear strategy for creating sustainable shareholder value by becoming the market leader in the online gaming industry and continuing to provide our members with a comprehensive range of gaming activities in a secure and trusted environment.
John Anderson,We are working with our trade organization to get our arms around the problem.
John Anderson,It appears no proscribed weapons or potential weapons have got through security inappropriately. There may be lessons that are learned about unforeseen tools being used.
John Anderson,"That was an unbelievable performance for a 10-year old boy. This was a pressure-packed situation where, if we lose, we go home and Mike showed unbelievable poise while out there on the mound."
John Anderson,He has a hard shot off a quick release. It's hard to get the puck off his stick.
John Anderson,That game typifies our year. Flaherty is an NHL goalie and we're not the only team he's shut down. They took advantage of the few mistakes we made. Five mistakes equals five goals.
John Anderson,"All connect going toward the same outcome, which is to improve the fitness of our folks."
John Anderson,"Today's announcement marks an important step in our goal to become the market leader in the global online gaming entertainment industry and will enable us to increase further our brand profile, recognition and credibility."
John Anderson,"You give me five days' notice of a disaster, and we'll handle it well, ... We don't know where [a fire] is going to hit. Our evacuation routes are limited."
John Anderson,That's a very good team he faced. He held up well under other circumstances.
John Anderson,"That challenges you, gives you an idea what your strengths and weaknesses are."
John Anderson,It teaches me to be a leader. The catcher is the leader of the (baseball) infield and the quarterback is the leader on offense.
John Anderson,I think the record and number of career wins he has are reflective of his ability to recruit talent and get that talent to play at a high level.
Jon Anderson,"Its because it is about playing music together and enjoying it. Other groups are so caught up in getting from this point to that point, not the music. This is about the music. Collectively we have the maturity to handle this and see it through now."
Jon Anderson,You have a growing network and the computers need to be advanced. Most counties have a network administrator and staff.
Jon Anderson,"The thought of having a kid stricken with cancer just floored me. My children are everything to me,"
Jon Anderson,I think one of the great moments of my life was when I could write musician on my passport.
Jon Anderson,I love X-Games music.
Jon Anderson,"I know when I started I would have been happy to sound like the Beatles or Joe Tex or whoever. You want to sound like most bands, you want to sound like their records and that's how you learn your chops."
Jon Anderson,The major factor in lumber and structural-panel demand in North America is new housing.
Kevin Anderson,"One of the things that was kind of shocking for humans... was to come to terms with was the fact that, hey, we may not be the center of the universe."
Kevin Anderson,"The benefits gained from this process are not originally what we anticipated, however we have gained a knowledge base of what our next steps should be. Based on the prototype, it will enable us to move forward to our original goal of converting our public Web site to XML."
Kevin Anderson,"It's amazing, ... They will always support you here and it's brilliant to win in front of your home crowd."
Kevin Anderson,"I think my father would want to be remembered as an example, but not just in his field. He would want to serve as an example of how anyone from nowhere could apply themselves and one day make a difference."
Kim Anderson,"You three (county commissioners) sitting here have the power to end this today, but you won't,"
Kim Anderson,"From its inception, the festival has been a celebration of reading and literature of the state. It's not an academic conference. And it's been a huge success."
Kim Anderson,"That's a team we beat here at home, but the thing you have to understand about that game is their leading scorer was out and one of their other starters was out. So, we know going down there that will be a completely different game."
Kim Anderson,Many thanks for your part in our history.
Kim Anderson,"After I graduated, I was like, OK, what do I do now? ... And nothing was as great as playing in a band with R.L. So I just called and said, 'What if I just moved to Kansas City?'"
Kim Anderson,We couldn't do this without the generosity of the writers in this state. But they always seem so excited to get together with each other and their readers in this setting.
Kim Anderson,It was huge because we had struggled the two games previously. I like the manner in which we did it. I thought we came out and were very aggressive defensively.
Kim Anderson,"It's a credit to those kids. They didn't win too many games over the last three years, [but they came back.] ... Congratulations on a great year for them."
Kim Anderson,It's definitely a unique thing that all the girls think is fun and cool.
Kim Anderson,We're learning about some different healthy choices in food and some different recipes.

Laurie Anderson,Why do you have to translate and decode things? Just let the image be. It will have a special kind of reality that it won't once it's decoded.
Laurie Anderson,The thing that's characteristic of my performance is that I literally do drag the whole studio onto the stage.

Laurie Anderson,"One of the things I learned from working on the Olympics was, the world does not need another big multimedia show."
Laurie Anderson,"My work is more about trying to ask good questions and not trying to come up with big shows. Every fashion company is doing that, every car company is doing that."

Laurie Anderson,"As a New Yorker, I'm someone who lives on an island and looks across to America."
Laurie Anderson,"A lot of words in English confuse the idea of life and electricity, like the word livewire."

Louie Anderson,I have added a lot. There's some Vegas stuff and hotel stuff and a whole chunk on health.
Louie Anderson,"I've been in Vegas. That's where you get into the money thing. Boy, you get greedy in Vegas, you know. That's the only place that you can bet $25, get it up to $500 and refuse to quit."
Louie Anderson,I have a very warm spot in my heart for Vegas.
Louie Anderson,"I'm a 7 o'clock act. My people want to go to a show, a dinner and then go home and go to bed."
Louie Anderson,"You have to be funny about it and honest about it. You can't leave yourself out of that mix. You have to be honest enough to say, I'm that messed-up one in the family."

Louie Anderson,We all think we're going to get out of debt.
Louie Anderson,"Minnesotans really think they run the whole world, I love that."

Louie Anderson,"Dr. Phil was very helpful and caring. I believe he helped all of us there and watching how to better relate, understand, and communicate with our families and loved ones. Dr. Phil recommended reading my new book."

Louie Anderson,I started a big part of my career in Vegas.
Marian Anderson,"A singer starts by having his instrument as a gift from God . . . When you have been given something in a moment of grace, it is sacrilegious to be greedy."
Marian Anderson,"When I sing, I don't want them to see that my face is black. I don't want them to see that my face is white. I want them to see my soul. And that is colorless."
Marian Anderson,None of us is responsible for the complexion of his skin. This fact of nature offers no clue to the character or quality of the person underneath.
Marian Anderson,"A singer starts by having his instrument as a gift from God... When you have been given something in a moment of grace, it is sacrilegious to be greedy."

Mark Anderson,"If they have good growing space with no overhead utilities, there are still good species of oak that will do well. Willow oak is an excellent tree. The problem is not having willow oaks but having so many, and so many the same age."
Mark Anderson,The band as an entity has evolved and matured with their stage performance and song writing. I couldn't be more proud of the individual members and the band. Each has accomplished so much with their instruments. I love what they are doing right now and I think they are great at it. I catch myself being a fan sometimes.
Mark Anderson,"Microsoft has a tremendous amount of patience, which can be inspiring or distressing, depending on your point of view, ... they will have waited so long for so little and have been willing to spend a long, long time in the red."

Mark Anderson,Enforcement and fines are not always the appropriate form of action. There are people who are deserving and meet the qualifications; it's wonderful we have people to step in and help; there are repairs that have gone above code compliance.
Matt Anderson,That is what we are looking for from everyone. Constant improvement.
Matt Anderson,Cuba has health indicators that are comparable to those of developed nations.
Matt Anderson,"The field conditions were terrible and the girls were freezing cold, but they were able to overcome that. Their game came together and they played really well."

Patrick Anderson,"It was possible for people with a high school education to get a job that paid $75,000 to $100,000 and six weeks of paid vacation. Those jobs are disappearing. The ... low-skill, upper-middle-class way of life is in danger."

Richard Anderson,Dogs are my favorite people.
Richard Anderson,"If I didn't calculate it just right, it's going to be a disaster. But I have done quite a few measurements."

Sparky Anderson,was like going to graduate school.
Sparky Anderson,We are the only two that ever talked all the way through batting practice. That is unheard of.
Sparky Anderson,"The trick is to realize that after giving your best, there's nothing more to give."

Sparky Anderson,"It's a terrible thing to have to tell your fans, who have waited like Detroit's have, that their team won't win it this year. But it's better than lying to them."
Sparky Anderson,I don't want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to Johnny Bench.
Sparky Anderson,"They say the first World Series is the one you remember most. No, no no. I guarantee you don't remember that one because the fantasy world you always dreamed about is suddenly real."

Sparky Anderson,"I only had a high school education and believe me, I had to cheat to get that."
Sparky Anderson,Casey knew his baseball. He only made it look like he was fooling around. He knew every move that was ever invented and some that we haven't even caught on to yet.
Sparky Anderson,"The great thing about baseball is when you're done, you'll only tell your grandchildren the good things. If they ask me about 1989, I'll tell them I had amnesia."
Sparky Anderson,The only thing I believe is this: A player does not have to like a manager and he does not have to respect a manager. All he has to do is obey the rules.
Sparky Anderson,A baseball manager is a necessary evil.
Sparky Anderson,"If I ever find a pitcher who has heat, a good curve, and a slider, I might seriously consider marrying him, or at least proposing."
Sparky Anderson,Just give me 25 guys on the last year of their contracts; I'll win a pennant every year.
Sparky Anderson,I don't believe a manager ever won a pennant. Casey Stengel won all those pennants with the Yankees. How many did he win with the Boston Braves and Mets?
Sparky Anderson,"People who live in the past generally are afraid to compete in the present. I've got my faults, but living in the past is not one of them. There's no future in it."
Steve Anderson,It's probably one of those things where if she (Allen) had detained him and brought him immediately to the police department ... nothing ever would have come from it probably. The problem started when she started trying to get money out of the family.
Steve Anderson,"It's usually driven by who's buying whom, personalities and their influence with the board."
Steve Anderson,"Call of Duty 2 is nothing short of spectacular. The visuals are stunning and the authentic weapons, battles, and missions make this one incredible game with a level of sophistication and detail not seen in other mobile games. We have optimized the Call of Duty experience for the mobile user, making it not only a companion to the console version, but a standalone, complete mobile gaming experience in its own right."
Steve Anderson,It's really unfair to the animals.
Tom Anderson,There weren't enough rail anchors and the rail had worn away.
Tom Anderson,"It's clearly the number one factor with giving some comfort and some relief to the family, just knowing that so many people had so much concern and so much appreciation."
Tom Anderson,The close-knit community and quality lifestyle available in these communities is coupled with its accessibility to central business districts.
Tom Anderson,Most of this country's wealth is in real estate and small business ownership. And investors over 40 are clamoring for the tax-deferred or tax-free benefits of holding their tangible assets in IRA accounts.
Marc Andreessen,You can't determine whether to build a bridge by counting the number of swimmers. Consumers don't care about technology at the end of the day.
Marc Andreessen,"We're technically agnostic. Our services support Sun and Oracle, but a lot of customers have been asking that we support Microsoft as well."
Marc Andreessen,This is the start of a revolution unlike any we've ever seen.
Marc Andreessen,"We have to make this stuff much more simple at every step of the chain. That's our opportunity. We've come a long way, but we still only reach three percent of the world population. We can make this more widespread."
Marc Andreessen,"The Net used to be 50 percent men and 50 percent men pretending to be women,"
Marc Andreessen,"Most of the software ideas of the late '90s which people tried and failed on--customer relationship management, marketing analytics, supply chain management, B2B procurement--those ideas all made sense and had good business justifications. But the tech wasn't quite there. Many customers who bought early feel bitter. But at some point those things will hit the mainstream and work."
Marc Andreessen,absolutely committed to giving [Navigator] 1.0 away for personal use.
Marc Andreessen,I think it's all really positive for the industry. It will force the industry to make the changes that are required to make the Internet viable in the long run.
Marc Andreessen,"I'm looking forward to my new role, which will allow me to combine my desire to focus more time on getting involved with start-ups with the opportunity to contribute to AOL's future success,"

John Andrews,It puts a price on the value of prairie dog habitat.
John Andrews,All new construction in Cedar City is in danger of being stopped in prairie dog habitat.
John Andrews,"Like all alcoholics, I would start New Year's Eve promising to control how much I drank. In the morning, I'd wake up hoping to God I hadn't hurt anyone on the drive home. It's the hardest time of year for recovering substance abusers because you're surrounded by overindulgence -- it's impossible to escape, and there's little empathy for those who have struggled with addiction."
John Andrews,"As the investigation continued, a sixth body was located, all apparently the victims of a homicide."
Keith Andrews,"I told our girls that we want to hit the boards and immediately go inside. I think we had eight or nine rebounds right away early. Come out with a little more aggression. That's what we got to do. We want to be the aggressor. We can't sit back and wait. That's what we've got to do Saturday too, come out and go after it and play hard from the beginning."
Keith Andrews,"Two different halves really. The first half we just get 16 points and we struggle really, and (Bonner) did what they wanted. Second half we outscored them 37-19."
Keith Andrews,PROGNOSIS for Web Applications continues our precise performance monitoring tradition. We count thirty-five percent of all Global 1000 companies amongst our 600-plus existing customers. This product will appeal to these companies as well as the many enterprises whose web applications are now critical to the business and require proven real-time monitoring and alerting technology.
Keith Andrews,"Despite our agreement on Monday, we felt it was essential to add a factor that safeguarded the employees' pension scheme. This was rejected by the trade union which prevented them from endorsing or accepting the rest of the offer."
Keith Andrews,Her ability to post-up strong and being able to get into position and finish.
Mickey Andrews,We're disappointed. What it presents now is a challenge for someone to take over. We have to ask our freshmen not to play like freshmen.
Mickey Andrews,He really made a lot of progress as well.
Mickey Andrews,"(Rolle) has a passion to become a great player, at least he has demonstrated that."
Mickey Andrews,You've got to have passion to play football. We had it on the goal line. But we didn't play like that all the time on the field.
Mickey Andrews,It tells me he has a lot of courage. It was more important to him that he worked. He couldn't have hurt it any worse.
Mickey Andrews,Coach Bowden gave a statement on that. The only thing I'll say is that we're disappointed. What it presents now is a challenge for someone else to step in and take over.
Mickey Andrews,I kind of figure I have the best [assistant-coaching] job in America.
Mickey Andrews,We have faced adversity all year. How you handle adversity is extremely important. Our problem is that we have not had the total depth that we have had in years past. What it presents now is a challenge for someone else to step in and take over.

Joaquin Andujar,"There is one word in America that says it all, and that one word is, 'You never know.'"
Maya Angelou,"I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow. I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things:a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll miss them when they're gone from your life. I've learned that making a living is not the same thing as making a life. I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance. I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands; you need to be able to throw some things back. I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision. I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. I've learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone. People love a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the back. I've learned that I still have a lot to learn. I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."
Maya Angelou,How important it is for us to recognize and celebrate our heroes and she-roes!
Maya Angelou,We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.
Maya Angelou,"You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. Please remember that your difficulties do not define you. They simply strengthen your ability to overcome."
Maya Angelou,"Since time is the one immaterial object which we cannot influence -- neither speed up nor slow down, add to nor diminish -- it is an imponderably valuable gift. Each of us has a few minutes a day or a few hours a week which we could donate to an old folks home or a children's hospital ward. The elderly whose pillows we plump or whose water pitchers we refill may or may not thank us for our gift, but the gift is upholding the foundation of the universe."
Maya Angelou,"Each of us has the right and the responsibility to asses the road which lie ahead and those over which we have traveled, and if the feature road looms ominous or unpromising, and the road back uninviting-inviting, then we need to gather our resolve and carrying only the necessary baggage, step off that road into another direction. If the new choice is also unpalatable, without embarrassment, we must be ready to change that one as well."
Maya Angelou,Then I went back to my mother when I was 13 and she was ready for me.
Maya Angelou,"The white American man makes the white American woman maybe not superfluous but just a little kind of decoration. Not really important to turning around the wheels of the state. Well the black American woman has never been able to feel that way. No black American man at any time in our history in the United States has been able to feel that he didn't need that black woman right against him, shoulder to shoulder -- in that cotton field, on the auction block, in the ghetto, wherever."
Maya Angelou,"I am serious, so I laugh a lot. You need to laugh. You don't laugh enough. I don't trust anyone who doesn't laugh."

Maya Angelou,"Mrs. Parks is for me probably what the Statute of Liberty was for immigrants. She stood for the future, and the better future."
Maya Angelou,The future is plump with promise.
Maya Angelou,"I believe talent is like electricity. We don't understand electricity. We use it. You can plug into it and light up a lamp, keep a heart pump going, light a cathedral, or you can electrocute a person with it. Electricity will do all that. It makes no"
Maya Angelou,Education helps one case cease being intimidated by strange situations.
Maya Angelou,"Those of us who have gathered here, ... we owe something from this minute on, so this gathering is not just another footnote on the pages of history."

Maya Angelou,"i believe the most important single thing, beyond discipline and creativity is daring to dare"
Maya Angelou,"Courage allows the successful woman to fail-and learn powerful lessons-from the failure-so that in the end,she didn't fail at all."
Maya Angelou,Have enough courage to trust love one more time. And always one more time.
Maya Angelou,"One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential.  Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency.  We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest."
Maya Angelou,"You may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may trod me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I'll rise."
Maya Angelou,"I believe we are still so innocent. The species are still so innocent that a person who is apt to be murdered believes that the murderer, just before he puts the final wrench on his throat, will have enough compassion to give him one sweet cup of wat"
Maya Angelou,Some people unable to go to school were more educated and even more intelligent than college professors.
Maya Angelou,"I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision."
Maya Angelou,"She's my sister friend and I pray for her and her children. Everybody, please give a good thought, a positive thought for Coretta."
Maya Angelou,"All of childhood's unanswered questions must finally be passed back to the town and answered there. Heroes and bogey men, values and dislikes, are first encountered and labeled in that early environment. In later years they change faces, places and maybe races, tactics, intensities and goals, but beneath those penetrable masks they wear forever the stocking-capped faces of childhood."
Maya Angelou,"Nature has no mercy at all. Nature says, I'm going to snow. If you have on a bikini and no snowshoes, that's tough. I am going to snow anyway."
Maya Angelou,"The quality of strength lined with tenderness is an unbeatable combination, as are intelligence and necessity when unblunted by formal education."
Maya Angelou,Some of us are timid. We think we have something to lose so we don't try for that next hill.
Maya Angelou,A bizarre sensation pervades a relationship of pretense. No truth seems true. A simple morning's greeting and response appear loaded with innuendo and fraught with implications. Each nicety becomes more sterile and each withdrawal more permanent.
Maya Angelou,"Any book that helps a child to form a habit of reading, to make reading one of his deep and continuing needs, is good for him."
Maya Angelou,I don't believe the accident of birth makes people sisters or brothers. It makes them siblings. Gives them mutuality of parentage. Sisterhood and brotherhood is a condition people have to work at.
Maya Angelou,When a man tells you who he is...believe him.
Maya Angelou,All God's children need traveling shoes.
Maya Angelou,God puts rainbows in the clouds so that each of us- in the dreariest and most dreaded moments- can see a possibility of hope.

Piers Anthony,"I hope to read a Harry Potter novel soon, to see what it's all about. I admit to being annoyed that many good light fantasy writers have had trouble getting published, in England and elsewhere, when it is obvious the readers were waiting for us all along."
Piers Anthony,I have always admired the work of Phil Farmer and was glad for the chance to work with him. Readers today may be too young to remember his classics like The Lovers.
Piers Anthony,I don't want ever to be guilty of what my critics claim: doing formula without original elements.
Piers Anthony,"I do one Xanth novel a year, because at the moment that is all that publishers will accept; they don't want any other type of fiction from me, so Xanth pays my way."
Piers Anthony,"I did not know at first that it would be a series; I discovered after the first novel that I had more to say about it, so I did another. And another, and then the readers demanded yet more."
Piers Anthony,"Have a working spouse, because you won't earn a living from writing - not at first, if ever. My wife worked for years to support us."

Piers Anthony,At the time I wrote Xone I had never been on the Internet.
Piers Anthony,"At present I answer about 100 letters a month, and read 300 emails."
Piers Anthony,"As for collaboration - I have done a lot, 26 books, and found publishers increasingly resistive to them. It's not that the books are bad; editors won't even read them."
Piers Anthony,All things make sense; you just have to fathom how they make sense.
Piers Anthony,That most dangerous of opponents: the one who took pains to comprehend the position of his adversary.
Susan B. Anthony,"Men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less."
Susan B. Anthony,"Sooner or later we all discover that the important moments in life are not the advertised ones, not the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these."
Susan B. Anthony,"Women, we might as well be dogs baying the moon as petitioners without the right to vote!"
Susan B. Anthony,White men have always controlled their wives' wages. Colored men were not able to do so until they themselves became free. Then they owned both their wives and their wages.
Susan B. Anthony,"Trust me that as I ignore all law to help the slave, so will I ignore it all to protect an enslaved woman."
Susan B. Anthony,This is rather different from the receptions I used to get fifty years ago. They threw things at me then but they were not roses.
Susan B. Anthony,"The older I get, the greater power I seem to have to help the world; I am like a snowball - the further I am rolled the more I gain."
Susan B. Anthony,No man is good enough to govern any woman without her consent.
Susan B. Anthony,I think the girl who is able to earn her own living and pay her own way should be as happy as anybody on earth. The sense of independence and security is very sweet.
Susan B. Anthony,I shall earnestly and persistently continue to urge all women to the practical recognition of the old Revolutionary maxim. Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.
Susan B. Anthony,"I don't want to die as long as I can work; the minute I can not, I want to go."
Susan B. Anthony,"I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do, because I notice it always coincides with their own desires."
Susan B. Anthony,"Oh, if I could but live another century and see the fruition of all the work for women! There is so much yet to be done."
Susan B. Anthony,"I beg you to speak of Woman as you do of the Negro, speak of her as a human being, as a citizen of the United States, as a half of the people in whose hands lies the destiny of this Nation."
Susan B. Anthony,Failure is impossible.
Marie Antoinette,"If the people have no bread, let them eat cake."
Marie Antoinette,"I was a queen, and you took away my crown, a wife, and you killed my huband, a mother, and you took my children away from me. All I have left is my blood. Take it. but do not make me suffer long."
Marie Antoinette,"No one understands my ills, nor the terror that fills my breast, who does not know the heart of a mother."
Marie Antoinette,"I was a queen, and you took away my crown; a wife, and you killed my husband; a mother, and you deprived me of my children. My blood alone remains: take it, but do not make me suffer long."
Marie Antoinette,Courage! I have shown it for years; think you I shall lose it at the moment when my sufferings are to end?
Marie Antoinette,Off to her bed.
Marie Antoinette,Let them eat cake.
Michelangelo Antonioni,You know what I would like to do: make a film with actors standing in empty space so that the spectator would have to imagine the background of the characters.
Michelangelo Antonioni,"But, you know, Cronaca isn't more innovative than what comes after."
Michelangelo Antonioni,"All the characters in my films are fighting these problems, needing freedom, trying to find a way to cut themselves loose, but failing to rid themselves of conscience, a sense of sin, the whole bag of tricks."
Michelangelo Antonioni,"We live in a society that compels us to go on using these concepts, and we no longer know what they mean."
Michelangelo Antonioni,"I don't want what I am saying to sound like a prophecy or anything like an analysis of modern society... these are only feelings I have, and I am the least speculative man on earth."
Michelangelo Antonioni,"When man becomes reconciled to nature, when space becomes his true background, these words and concepts will have lost their meaning, and we will no longer have to use them."
Michelangelo Antonioni,When I am shooting a film I never think of how I want to shoot something; I simply shoot it.
Michelangelo Antonioni,Till now I have never shot a scene without taking account of what stands behind the actors because the relationship between people and their surroundings is of prime importance.
Michelangelo Antonioni,"Scientific man is already on the moon, and yet we are still living with the moral concepts of Homer."
Michelangelo Antonioni,"Normally, however, I try to avoid repetitions of any shot."

Michelangelo Antonioni,Hollywood is like being nowhere and talking to nobody about nothing.
Michelangelo Antonioni,"A scene has to have a rhythm of its own, a structure of its own."

Michelangelo Antonioni,In Blow-up I used my head instinctively!
Michelangelo Antonioni,"I mean simply to say that I want my characters to suggest the background in themselves, even when it is not visible. I want them to be so powerfully realized that we cannot imagine them apart from their physical and social context even when we see them in empty space."
Michelangelo Antonioni,"I can never understand how we have been able to follow these worn-out tracks, which have been laid down by panic in the face of nature."

Minna Antrim,"The ''Green-eyed Monster'' causes much woe, but the absence of this ugly serpent argues the presence of a corpse whose name is Eros."
Minna Antrim,A homely face and no figure have aided many women heavenward.
Michel Aoun,"Syria is trying to strengthen its hegemony in Lebanon by controlling more and more institutions,"
Michel Aoun,one of the great journalists who never hesitated or was afraid to say the truth and defend Lebanon.
Michel Aoun,The weakness of the current security services in dealing with such crimes ... led to all these explosions.
Michel Aoun,"I have been given some information that confirms the presence of Syrian intelligence agents still operating inside Lebanon. This includes the infiltration by Syria of the Lebanese security forces, some of whom are acting for Syria."

Michel Aoun,We have called for the boycott of the parliamentary elections because Lebanon is under Syrian control.
Michel Aoun,"This is legal process that now is up to the international community, because there is more than one country implicated."

Guillaume Apollinaire,"It's raining my soul, it's raining, but it's raining dead eyes."
Leo Apotheker,The U.S. will continue to be our growth driver. There are many opportunities for us in this marketplace.

Leo Apotheker,We have lost zero customers to Oracle's OFF SAP program.
Fiona Apple,"When you're surrounded by all these people, it can be even lonelier than when you're by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don't feel like you can trust anybody or talk to anybody, you feel like you're really alone."
Fiona Apple,What's really good is African drum music.
Fiona Apple,There aren't many poster children for cool angst. Everybody thinks it's cool if you're the bad girl.

Fiona Apple,"My whole life, people have been saying, Why are you so angry?"

Fiona Apple,"I'm not used to not having enough time to live with the songs. Usually, if I write something, I live with it for a little while."
Fiona Apple,I'm not a control freak.
Fiona Apple,"I'm incredibly impressed by people who organize to achieve a goal, and believe that they can make a difference and then go ahead and do just that. I think it's incredible."

Fiona Apple,Five years from now I'm probably going to look back on the things I'm doing and cringe.

Christina Applegate,"How do you survive Christmas? You drink a lot. And drink a lot, right. Drink a lot and drink a lot."
Major Applewhite,"You don't have to accept it. If you accept it, you're giving up. I didn't understand it when it happened to me. Looking back, I think it was good I didn't understand it."
Major Applewhite,"There's time where you have to have fun, ... The grind of the camp becomes too much for the psyche of a college player. You have to always, constantly try to be on the same page with your players. You can't let them get too far away where you can't tell what they're thinking or what they're feeling. At the same time, it's not a sit-around-the-camp-fire session every day where we are discussing our feelings."
Major Applewhite,People don't understand I felt I had accomplished all I wanted as a player in football.
St. Aquinas,"Sorrow can be alleviated by good sleep, a bath and a glass of wine"
St. Aquinas,"As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten, for the active power of the male seed tends to the production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the production of a woman comes from defect in the active power"

Luis Aragones,"I don't think this result will influence what happens on Wednesday, but I am not going to deny that the squad will have lost a little self-belief."

Luis Aragones,On paper they are inferior to us so our aim is to score as many goals as possible so that we don't lose out to our rivals on goal difference.
Luis Aragones,"What's essential is to win. And if it's by two goals, that's better than one. And if it's by three, even better. I think we're superior in terms of our technical ability and we have to use this to make sure of victory. I think we can win both here and there. I'm sure we'll be in Germany."

Luis Aragones,"This game is the most important for me as the coach of Spain. In fact probably ever,"

Luis Aragones,"There was too much anxiety, hastiness and disorganization. There were occasions when we had four forwards all in a line and that's no good. On the left wing we didn't overlap enough."
Luis Aragones,"Our opponents took advantage of our anxiety. They had one attack in the first half, scored and then made good use of the situation."
Luis Aragones,"Ivory Coast is a good team and has an advantage because it's just played the African Cup final. Although Spain hasn't played for a while, I hope the players can put on a good display."

Diane Arbus,"If I were just curious, it would be very hard to say to someone, ''I want to come to your house and have you talk to me and tell me the story of your life.'' I mean people are going to say, ''You're crazy.'' Plus they're going to keep mighty guarded. But the camera is a kind of license. A lot of people, they want to be paid that much attention and that's a reasonable kind of attention to be paid."
Diane Arbus,"Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true."
Diane Arbus,Everybody has that thing where they need to look one way but they come out looking another way and that's what people observe. You see someone on the street and essentially what you notice about them is the flaw. It's just extraordinary that we should have been given these peculiarities. Something is ironic in the world and it has to do with the fact that what you intend never comes out like you intend it.
Diane Arbus,"I work from awkwardness. By that I mean I don't like to arrange things. If I stand in front of something, instead of arranging it, I arrange myself."

Diane Arbus,"The more specific you are, the more general it'll be."
Diane Arbus,Most people go through life dreading they'll have a traumatic experience. Freaks were born with their trauma. They've already passed their test in life. They're aristocrats.

Diane Arbus,I really believe there are things nobody would see if I didn't photograph them.

Bruce Arena,It's likely that we have two teams from Europe. I'm not going to worry about it one way or the other.
Bruce Arena,He's an extremely graceful athlete. He's a player with an excellent first touch and great vision. He has very good attacking qualities. But we've seen him in what I would call an amateur level.
Bruce Arena,"A dominant team in sports is exciting, and it gives everybody something to shoot for. This year maybe there's a chance somebody could do that [in MLS]."
Bruce Arena,There's a strong likelihood he'll be at camp. He has shown a lot of progress and we need to take a look at him.
Bruce Arena,"Some were hunches, others were potential, others, we have until June 12 and think we can turn this player around."
Bruce Arena,"Why? Because it's January and you can't worry about it. I don't think we had a bad performance, but I didn't think anybody stepped up and had a big performance."
Bruce Arena,"Tim continues to be a very talented goalkeeper that we think, given time and the right opportunity, is going to continue to improve and be a terrific goalkeeper at the international level. One day he will be the No. 1 goalkeeper for the U.S."
Bruce Arena,"This is an opportunity for some fresh faces, and we're going to see what they are about at the international level. This game is important because it can eliminate some players from consideration, and it can improve the situation of others."
Bruce Arena,"With only one international fixture date next year, this is an excellent opportunity to get our group together as we continue to shape our team for the World Cup."
Bruce Arena,He just fell short. Anyone can have a good argument that Taylor belonged. There's no justice in a situation like that.
Bruce Arena,We've seen great improvement out of Clint this year. He's a player who is competing for a spot on the World Cup roster and I think he demonstrated he's progressed a lot.
Bruce Arena,He's shown steady improvement throughout the camp.
Bruce Arena,"The Gold Cup is the biggest headache on the schedule. We want to be respectful of the confederation championship and put our best team out there and try to win it. However, our focus has to be on World Cup qualifying. Those 10 games are the most important."
Bruce Arena,"Over the next month or so we'll really see the value the Gold Cup had for us. Because of injuries and suspensions, a few guys had to play a bit more than we anticipated, and that can only make our squad deeper in the long run."
Bruce Arena,We view this camp and the games in January and February as critical towards our preparation for Germany.
Bruce Arena,"They're in a position we were in, you want to get it done sooner than later. This is a game where their sights are clearly to win, as it was for Guatemala the last time we were in Guatemala. It will be interesting to see."
Bruce Arena,The only thing that experience tells me is you can't be 100% sure about any player.
Bruce Arena,Having the opportunity to get a feel for the stadium and the environment here is very valuable.
Bruce Arena,The results in Guatemala (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 defeat) were not as critical to me. This one is. We want to end the year on a high note.
Bruce Arena,"There's everything here for players and families to both experience the culture of Germany as well feel comfortable that this is a city that is similar to cities in the United States. And it's a perfect match: great restaurants, lots of entertainment, lot of things to do, a great hotel, great training facilities. Everything we want is here."
Bruce Arena,"For the first time ever, we are going to demand players have the discipline and commitment to actually maintain fitness. We have seen a wide range of attitudes and actual physical conditions with MLS players in the past, and if that is the case next time around they're not going to be eligible to make the World Cup roster."
Bruce Arena,"The fact that he is the only three-time winner of the award is a testament to the consistency, commitment and dedication he has displayed throughout his career."
Bruce Arena,"His stock has risen considerably, and given the circumstances in our entire pool, Kerry is going to be in there right until the end when we're looking to finalize our roster."
Bruce Arena,"I think you can't overreact from one game, the Norway game, and ignore the Canada game. You judge players over time, not over a game. As he continues to move forward we'll have a better feel for the direction he's headed. Obviously, he's getting better. From my perspective, I need to see if he's developing into a guy who should be a player on the World Cup roster and can help us win a game."
Bruce Arena,"Canada is traditionally a very solid team, and this game will be a good test for our domestic players as we begin the critical process of building a roster for the 2006 World Cup. We are looking forward to playing in San Diego, a city with a rich soccer history. It should be an excellent event."
Bruce Arena,"The Costa Rica team will play very strong, very fast in the beginning of the game, try to get an early goal and write their ticket to Germany."
Bruce Arena,"It's like going from college basketball to the NBA.

Dick Armey,stay focused on the singular question: Is taxing marriage appropriate?
Dick Armey,every year there is that magic moment when everybody says we can agree. That moment is at hand. We do not want to deny our members the opportunity to seize that moment.
Dick Armey,"If we do this job right, and we have the ability to do so, we can allow the people of this country to fulfill one of the great American ideals: having a tax code that they realize is civil and decent (and) treats them with respect. They can then comply with that code out of a sense of civic duty and personal responsibility and voluntary compliance."
Dick Armey,"I would like to think that no American president would even consider using the military to help him remain in office, ... But the fact that Americans are expressing these doubts shows that the president is losing his ability to lead."
Dick Armey,"After months of lies, the president has given millions of people around the world reason to doubt that he has sent Americans into battle for the right reasons, ... The fact that Americans are expressing these doubts shows that the president is losing his ability to lead.

David Armstrong,"When the board members examined the options, they decided that putting up a new building with all the latest technology would make the most sense. In the remodeling scenarios presented to the board, the district would spend a lot of money and still have old buildings that were just retrofitted.

Michael Armstrong,"We're putting the best brand in communications with the best broadband infrastructure in America,"

Michael Armstrong,"This agreement will turn a non-strategic investment into cash that we can use to pay down debt,"
Michael Armstrong,"This gives us a very persistent presence in these portals and browsers, with voice-over-IP [Internet protocol], ... The ability to attach other services and applications to that voice service was very much a part of our strategy."

Salvation Army,People are being generous and I want them to but every penny that comes in here marked disaster goes to disaster. We don't keep anything locally for overhead. It all goes to disaster.
Salvation Army,"The Salvation Army was there from day-one, ... They were providing shelter before the storm hit.

Will Arnett,Arrested Development opened a lot of doors for me.
Will Arnett,"And then we've got Blades of Glory, and we've got Brothers Solomon, and I've got a script in development with this guy Chuck Martin who used to write on Arrested, and, you know, we have a few things in various stages of development."
Will Arnett,"Yeah, you know, within the context of TV families, these are pretty unsavory characters."

Will Arnett,"Well, we were never coming back to Fox... that was clear."
Will Arnett,"Well, no, I didn't because I didn't even know the nominations were coming out. I gotta say, it wasn't even on my radar. I hadn't... I hadn't even thought about it."
Will Arnett,"There's a lot of lying and these are people who are incredibly flawed, and not in very sort of empathetic ways, either. Some of the things they do are pretty awful and some of the things they do to each other are pretty awful."
Will Arnett,The show had run its course on the Fox network.
Will Arnett,"Look, I get it; you come home, you work hard, and you turn on your TV... You kind of want to escape a little bit and be taken away by something. Our show required you to pay attention, and if that's not what you wanted to do, then it wasn't going to be for you, and that's OK."
Will Arnett,"It doesn't look great if you cancel the reigning Best Comedy Program, you know, you're gonna take a hit from a... from sort of a public relations standpoint."
Will Arnett,"I mean, I gotta say one of the greatest victories on that show was when we got picked up for the back nine of the first season, and they made it a full order."
Will Arnett,"But since day one, we've always been kinda up against it. So at the end, it's not surprising that we were kind of led along for so many months and didn't know what the fate of the show was gonna be. It was... in a weird way, just kind of that was the way it's always been."
Will Arnett,"But as a result of that, there was, once the show ended, there was this talk for sort of four, five months about what was going to happen, and if we were going to move to Showtime, and if we were going to be bought by ABC or whatever."
Will Arnett,"Because I think a lot of people felt like, ultimately - and this isn't the first time I've said this, so I'll bore you again with it - but ultimately it was... I think it felt like homework a bit for people."
Will Arnett,"And we... right from moment one, we were always kinda up against the wall a little bit when it came to the future of the show. There were always rumors."
Will Arnett,"And I think that at a certain point, after all the time and all the conjecture and everything that had kind of gone on surrounding this show, I think that Mitch just felt like it was time to let it go. It was best for the show."

A class of men may often itself not either fully understand its wants, or adequately express them; but it has a nearer interest and a more sure diligence in the matter than any of its proctors, and therefore a better chance of success."

Jason Arnott,The crowd is going to be into the games. We can't play too nervous. We have to play our style of game.
Jason Arnott,You want to play loose but you want to play with that fear that one goal can cost you. That's what we did in the second period. We just let it all on the line and felt we had nothing to lose. That's what we have to do [in Game 3].
Jason Arnott,"When I came in, there was so much cheating and so many tricks, and they've pretty much taken that out. Now, it comes down to reactions, quickness and your teammates. The guy who wins usually did a better job."
Jason Arnott,You can't blame it on Marty.
LaVar Arrington,I have youth. That's a beautiful thing. I'm hungry. I'm by no means a content individual. I'm not content with where I'm at. I don't need to be motivated. I'm motivated. I'm ready to go.
LaVar Arrington,"I'm just trying to figure out where we go from here. This one's got me confused. We're just letting them get away, the same way, over and over again."
LaVar Arrington,"That was pretty cool, huh? ... I was thinking, 'Wow, I'm really in here.' It was a great deal. Man, I had an opportunity to be a part of what I've been a part of for so many years. It was nice getting back out there on a regular basis."
LaVar Arrington,I could easily be in different situations. I'm healthy. My personal life is wonderful. I attribute a lot of my happiness to my wife. We have discussions on what goes on here and on everything else. We always take the positives out of things.

LaVar Arrington,"You see it in my eyes? Red eyes? ... I was trying to get it done, man."
LaVar Arrington,"You see it in my eyes? Red eyes? ... I was trying to get it done, man. I didn't care who was hitting me, what was happening. Fearless. I was just happy to be out there with the fellows. That was my biggest thing. It was just painful watching them out there fighting."
LaVar Arrington,"It's a learning experience that I've gone through over this whole process, and I feel like I could have made a difference in some of those games we let get away, but who's to say that I would have? ... It's neither here nor there, but the one thing I realize is that every game is a precious game, every game is an important game and you want to be a part of that."

LaVar Arrington,"If the direction [of the team] is going away from me and going toward other things, ... then as a man I have to accept that and have to move on and figure out what's next for me if that's the situation that's in front of me. But by no means am I going to sit here and whine and complain."
LaVar Arrington,still control our own [playoff] destiny.
LaVar Arrington,"The worst part of this whole situation is people start trying to tag you for your character,"

Carlos Arroyo,"I didn't think it was going to be kind of weird, but it (was). I was having fun. I love those guys and I miss them."
Carlos Arroyo,A lot of people have opened their eyes now. The game is getting played more and more all around the world. We get more respect now than we used to.
Carlos Arroyo,"I think just looking back at this game, we all have to sit down and think about the energy level that we brought out the second half of the game. We're the underdog every game now and we just have to bring that energy out with us every game from the beginning."
Carlos Arroyo,We're playing our best basketball right now. We're playing together. That's the main thing.
Carlos Arroyo,"Hopefully he's still hungry, and he's going to get a chance here. It's up to him to take advantage of it."

Antonin Artaud,"But how is one to make a scientist understand that there is something unalterably deranged about differential calculus, quantum theory, or the obscene and so inanely liturgical ordeals of the precession of the equinoxes."
Antonin Artaud,"Ah! How neatly tied, in these people, is the umbilical cord of morality! Since they left their mothers they have never sinned, have they? They are apostles, they are the descendants of priests; one can only wonder from what source they draw their indignation, and above all how much they have pocketed to do this, and in any case what it has done for them."
Antonin Artaud,"And what is an authentic madman? It is a man who preferred to become mad, in the socially accepted sense of the word, rather than forfeit a certain superior idea of human honor. So society has strangled in its asylums all those it wanted to get rid of or protect itself from, because they refused to become its accomplices in certain great nastinesses. For a madman is also a man whom society did not want to hear and whom it wanted to prevent from uttering certain intolerable truths."
Antonin Artaud,"There is in every madman a misunderstood genius whose idea, shining in his head, frightened people, and for whom delirium was the only solution to the strangulation that life had prepared for him"
Antonin Artaud,"Written poetry is worth reading once, and then should be destroyed. Let the dead poets make way for others. Then we might even come to see that it is our veneration for what has already been created, however beautiful and valid it may be, that petrifies us."
Antonin Artaud,"The race of prophets is extinct. Europe is becoming set in its ways, slowly embalming itself beneath the wrappings of its borders, its factories, its law-courts and its universities. The frozen Mind cracks between the mineral staves which close upon it. The fault lies with your moldy systems, your logic of 2 + 2 = 4. The fault lies with you, Chancellors, caught in the net of syllogisms. You manufacture engineers, magistrates, doctors, who know nothing of the true mysteries of the body or the cosmic laws of existence. False scholars blind outside this world, philosophers who pretend to reconstruct the mind. The least act of spontaneous creation is a more complex and revealing world than any metaphysics."
Antonin Artaud,"It is not opium which makes me work but its absence, and in order for me to feel its absence it must from time to time be present."
Ron Artest,"We just have to see what we did back then, and see what we're doing now. We're going to have to finish the last games off strong. I felt pretty good out there. Right now we're not playing both ends of the floor each game, only sometimes."
Ron Artest,I know him. He's a cool cat. I think he's from the 'hood. It's good he's showing us some support. I can't wait until he comes to Indiana. Indiana fans are looking forward to seeing him.
Ron Artest,Nah. I'm not looking to do that. I'm keeping the same perception.
Ron Artest,"(Music star) Jay Z, he pays millions of dollars for promotion, and I'm getting it for free."
Ron Artest,"They both have a knack for making tough shots, and it kind of separates them from all the other players. They?re really quick, strong and can jump. So it separates them from all the other players that?s trying to get to where they are."
Ron Artest,"It's like when you smoke cigarettes, you've got to take that nicotine patch and break that habit. We've got a habit of losing right now. We need to get, like, a nicotine winning patch. We've got to break that habit of losing, because it can become a habit. . . . We're working hard to break that habit."
Ron Artest,It's the first time in a long time that I've been complimented on my leadership skills. Partly it was my fault that I hadn't been complimented in the past. Maybe some people just weren't recognizing.
Ron Artest,"That's gonna be fun, ... I love the tension. I love when everything's going wrong ... In the NBA, they don't promote guys like me. They like guys who like Cheerios, good guys. But I find a way to promote myself."
Ron Artest,"I'm going to continue playing hard and out of control, like a wild animal that needs to be caged in. I'll let the referees handle it."
Bea Arthur,"I love cooking, I love reading, I love anything that doesn't take too much exercise!"

Bea Arthur,"Down in Florida it was an older audience, and it was interesting to see how they responded to things compared to other audiences, it's been very interesting."
Bea Arthur,"Some people say I'm only happy when I'm working, or not working, I'm happy whether I'm working or not, my animals, my kids, anything."

Mickey Arthur,We need to win the series (against New Zealand). I won't be happy if we don't.

Mickey Arthur,"They have hit more than enough balls, they've caught more than enough catches. It's now about getting away and tuning in mentally and getting right for the test match that's coming."
Bob Arum,"There had never been a black guy up to that point who had been a television commentator in the U.S., so I suggested he hire a black guy to do the TV. He thought it was a great idea, so we tried to get Willie Mays."
Bob Arum,Because we're not very happy with some of the underhanded things that HBO has pulled in this situation. But it's unfair for me to get into it right now. They're not here and I'm sure you'll read about it in court papers that are going to be filed.
Bob Arum,"It's a disaster ready to happen again, ... Why is HBO doing this? Is money so important, or are these guys who are the big names so important?"
Bob Arum,"It's a disaster ready to happen again. Why is HBO doing this? Is money so important, or are these guys who are the big names so important?"
Bob Arum,"The one criticism I have about Don is that he doesn't have any restraint. You make a buck, but it doesn't have to be your last buck."
Gord Ash,The good news is that there is nothing structurally wrong with Ben's shoulder. It's a muscular problem and he's going to make a full recovery. The bad news is that he's probably not going to recover in time to pitch again this season.
Gord Ash,"We're understanding how key it is. In the American League, it didn't matter."
Gord Ash,"In a few days, he should be fine. He feels a little better today. He's continuing to progress."
Gord Ash,"It's going to be the doctor's call. Obviously he's very familiar with the injury and the progress, having examined him numerous times during the winter."
Gord Ash,"He went through some treatment today and the doctors are continuing to be encouraged, but he's really still in that active rest period. We don't think this is going to be a quick fix."
Gord Ash,"He's eligible tomorrow and we'll make that determination then. You don't want to make a roster move until you're 100 percent sure. It's looking good, though."
Gord Ash,"We're big believers in it. In the National League, it is so important because you don't want to have to use two players to make one move."
Mary Kay Ash,Central banks don't have divine wisdom. They try to do the best analysis they can and must be prepared to stand or fall by the quality of that analysis.
Mary Kay Ash,We fall forward to succeed.
Mary Kay Ash,"We must have a theme, a goal, a purpose in our lives. If you don't know where you're aiming, you don't have a goal. My goal is to live my life in such a way that when I die, someone can say, she cared."
Mary Kay Ash,"No matter how busy you are, you must take time to make the other person feel important."
Mary Kay Ash,Most people live and die with their music still unplayed. They never dare to try.
Mary Kay Ash,"We treat our people like royalty. If you honor and serve the people who work for you, they will honor and serve you."
Mary Kay Ash,A good goal is like a strenuous exercise -- it makes you stretch.
Mary Kay Ash,A mediocre idea that generates enthusiasm will go farther than a great idea that inspires no one.
Mary Kay Ash,A mediocre idea that generates enthusiasm will go further than a great idea that inspires no one.
Mary Kay Ash,Sandwich every bit of criticism between two layers of praise.
Mary Kay Ash,Dare to risk public criticism.
Mary Kay Ash,"Pretend that every single person you meet has a sign around his or her neck that says, ''Make me feel important.'' Not only will you succeed in sales, you will succeed in life."
Mary Kay Ash,"For every failure, there's an alternative course of action.  You just have to find it.  When you come to a roadblock, take a detour."
Mary Kay Ash,"Honesty is the cornerstone of all success, without which confidence and ability to perform shall cease to exist."
Mary Kay Ash,"Aerodynamically, the bumble bee shouldn't be able to fly, but the bumble bee doesn't know it so it goes on flying anyway."
Mary Kay Ash,The speed of the leader is the speed of the gang.
Mary Kay Ash,Every silver lining has a cloud.
Paddy Ashdown,A very small bunch of corrupt politicians believe that allowing Radovan Karadzic to stay at liberty is more important than this country having a future in NATO and peace for its citizens.
Paddy Ashdown,"Ten years after Dayton, that these two primary architects of these appalling crimes should still be free is a failure on all sides."
Paddy Ashdown,"The present Europe is unfinished business unless the Balkans are a part of it,"
Arthur Ashe,"I'm very happy for him. . . . He was heartbroken here once, ... But that's all over now. I told him he had to face these things in life . . . to make a man of himself."
Arthur Ashe,"Every time you win, it diminishes the fear a little bit. You never really cancel the fear of losing; you keep challenging it."
Arthur Ashe,"Regardless of how you feel inside, always try to look like a winner. Even if you are behind, a sustained look of control and confidence can give you a mental edge that results in victory."
Arthur Ashe,"Trust has to be earned, and should come only after the passage of time."
Arthur Ashe,"Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome."
Arthur Ashe,My potential is more than can be expressed within the bounds of my race or ethnic identity.
Arthur Ashe,"Later, I discovered there was a lot of work to being good in tennis."
Arthur Ashe,"If I were to say, ''God, why me?'' about the bad things, then I should have said, ''God, why me?'' about the good things that happened in my life."
Arthur Ashe,"I may not be walking with you all the way, or even much of the way, as I walk with you now."
Arthur Ashe,I keep sailing on in this middle passage. I am sailing into the wind and the dark. But I am doing my best to keep my boat steady and my sails full.
Arthur Ashe,I have tried to keep on with my striving because this is the only hope I have of ever achieving anything worthwhile and lasting.
Arthur Ashe,Do not feel sorry for me if I am gone.
Arthur Ashe,"Clothes and manners do not make the man, but where he is made they greatly improve his appearance."
Arthur Ashe,A wise person decides slowly but abides by these decisions.
Arthur Ashe,"I accepted the face that as much as I want to lead others, and love to be around other people, in some essential way, I am something of a loner."
Arthur Ashe,"I don't care who you are, you're going to choke in certain matches. You get to a point where your legs don't move and you can't take a deep breath. You start to hit the ball about a yard wide, instead of inches."
Arthur Ashe,Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Arthur Ashe,"You learn about equality in history and civics, but you find out life is not really like that."
Arthur Ashe,There is a syndrome in sports called ''paralysis by analysis.''
Arthur Ashe,The ideal attitude is to be physically loose and mentally tight.
Arthur Ashe,You've got to get to the stage in life where going for it is more important than winning or losing.
Arthur Ashe,"When we were together, I loved you deeply and you gave me so much happiness I can never repay you."
Arthur Ashe,"What it is controlled cool, in a way. Always have the situation under control, even if losing. Never betray an inward sense of defeat."
Arthur Ashe,We must reach out our hand in friendship and dignity both to those who would befriend us and those who would be our enemy.
Arthur Ashe,"We must believe in the power of education. We must respect just laws. We must love ourselves, our old and or young, our women as well as our men."
Arthur Ashe,I have always drawn strength from being close to home.
Arthur Ashe,I guess I started too early because I just thought it was something fun to do.
Arthur Ashe,I don't want to be remembered for my tennis accomplishments.
Arthur Ashe,"From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life."
Arthur Ashe,"If you're paid before you walk on the court, what's the point in playing as if your life depended on it?"
Arthur Ashe,"When bright young minds can't afford college, America pays the price."
Arthur Ashe,"True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost."
Arthur Ashe,One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation.
Peter Ashkenaz,"The rules are established by the companies. As we understand it, the requirements for these programs are that you can't have access to prescription drug coverage and still qualify for the program. They can change that. It's up to them; it's not up to us."
Peter Ashkenaz,"With millions of people in the program, you are going to see all sorts of different scenarios. This (situation) is unfortunate."
Peter Ashkenaz,"You have to remember that Congress created the Part D program to begin January 1, 2006. So we put all the contingencies in place to handle as much as we did."
Issac Asimov,Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
Issac Asimov,"The trouble is that racial stereotypes, unfavourable to everyone but white men of northwest European extraction, were completely accepted, and indeed, scarcely noted in those days of only forty years ago [the 1930s] (except perhaps by the members of the groups victimized thereby)."
Issac Asimov,"University President: Why is it that you physicists always require so much expensive equipment? Now the Department of Mathematics requires nothing but money for paper, pencils, and erasers...and the Department of Philosophy is better still. It doesn't even ask for erasers."
Issac Asimov,"Scientific apparatus offers a window to knowledge, but as they grow more elaborate, scientists spend ever more time washing the windows."
Issac Asimov,A poor idea well written is more likely to be accepted than a good idea poorly written
Issac Asimov,"If I am right, then [religious fundamentalists] will not go to Heaven, because there is no Heaven. If THEY are right, then they will not go to Heaven, because they are hypocrites."
Issac Asimov,"Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today -- but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all."
Issac Asimov,"In 1936, I first wrote science fiction. It was a long-winded attempt at writing an endless novel...which died. I remember one sentence, Whole forests stood sere and brown in midsummer."
Issac Asimov,"I sit here and think, with more than a little astonishment, that I have been writing and publishing Science Fiction now for just three-eighths of a century. This isn't bad for someone who only admits to being in his late youth- or a little over thirty, if pinned down."
Issac Asimov,"Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is"
Issac Asimov,"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds the most discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' (I found it!) but 'That's funny'"
Issac Asimov,"Meanwhile, fears of universal disaster sank to an all-time low over the world"
Issac Asimov,It has been my philosophy of life that difficulties vanish when faced boldly
Issac Asimov,A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. [The Second Law of Robotics]
Issac Asimov,"Until I became a published writer, I remained completely ignorant of books on how to write and courses on the subject... they would have spoiled my natural style; made me observe caution; would have hedged me with rules."
Issac Asimov,"No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be."
Issac Asimov,"Meanwhile, fears of universal disaster sank to an all time low over the world."
Issac Asimov,I don't believe in personal immortality; the only way I expect to have some version of such a thing is through my books.
Issac Asimov,"He had read much, if one considers his long life; but his contemplation was much more than his reading. He was wont to say that if he had read as much as other men he should have known no more than other men."
Issac Asimov,Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what's right.
Issac Asimov,"Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest."
Issac Asimov,"There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere."
Issac Asimov,Creationists make it sound as though a 'theory' is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night.
Issac Asimov,All sorts of computer errors are now turning up. You'd be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men.
Issac Asimov,"I write for the same reason I breathe - because if I didn't, I would die."
Issac Asimov,"Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know - and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance."
Issac Asimov,"To insult someone we call him bestial. For deliberate cruelty and nature, human might be the greater insult."
Issac Asimov,"To introduce something altogether new would mean to begin all over, to become ignorant again, and to run the old, old risk of failing to learn."
Issac Asimov,People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.
Issac Asimov,A subtle thought that is in error may yet give rise to fruitful inquiry that can establish truths of great value.
Issac Asimov,The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.
Issac Asimov,Those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.
Issac Asimov,"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'"
Issac Asimov,"If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster."
Issac Asimov,"From my close observation of writers... they fall into two groups: 1) those who bleed copiously and visibly at any bad review, and 2) those who bleed copiously and secretly at any bad review."
Issac Asimov,"Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today - but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all."
Issac Asimov,"Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is."
Issac Asimov,"Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition."
Issac Asimov,"It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety."
Issac Asimov,"If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them."
Issac Asimov,The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.
Issac Asimov,"It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be."
Issac Asimov,I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.
Issac Asimov,I am not a speed reader. I am a speed understander.
Issac Asimov,"If the doctor told me I had six minutes to live, I'd type a little faster."
Issac Asimov,"Nothing interferes with my concentration. You could put on an orgy in my office and I wouldn't look up. Well, maybe once."
Issac Asimov,"And above all things, never think that you're not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning"
Issac Asimov,"When I read about the way in which library funds are being cut and cut, I can only think that American society has found one more way to destroy itself."
Issac Asimov,"Science fiction writers foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not."
Issac Asimov,Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right.
Issac Asimov,"Writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers."
Issac Asimov,"I have been told that a young would-be composer wrote to Mozart asking advice as to how to compose a symphony. Mozart responded that a symphony was a complex and demanding form and that it would be better to start with something simpler. The young man protested, 'But Herr Mozart, you wrote symphonies when you were younger than I am now.' And Mozart replied, 'I never asked how.'"
Bashar Assad,We cannot accept what we see on our television every day of the bombing of innocent civilians. There are hundreds now every day.
Bashar Assad,"We have the urge to reach a state of peace, but we have no urge to compromise an inch of our territory nor do we accept our sovereignty to be impinged on,"
Bashar Assad,"I have declared that Syria is innocent of this crime, and I am ready to follow up action to bring to trial any Syrian who could be proved by concrete evidence to have had connection with this crime,"
Mary Astell,"Women are not so well united as to form an Insurrection. They are for the most part wise enough to love their Chains, and to discern how becomingly they fit."
Mary Astell,". . . he who only or chiefly chose for Beauty, will in a little Time find the same Reason for another Choice."
Mary Astell,"But, alas! what poor Woman is ever taught that she should have a higher Design than to get her a Husband?"
Kemal Ataturk,A nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten
Kemal Ataturk,A nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten.
Kemal Ataturk,Justice is the infrastructure of proprietorship.
Kemal Ataturk,A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.
Kemal Ataturk,"Sovereignty is not given, it is taken."
Robert Atkins,Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.
Robert Atkins,"It's so logical and so simple. Fat is the backup fuel system. The role it plays in the body is that when there's no carbohydrate around, fat will become the primary energy fuel. That's pretty well known."
Robert Atkins,Don't fix what's not broken.
Robert Atkins,"There are many, many people who have lost 100 pounds and kept it off."
Robert Atkins,"My patient population has a low recidivism rate, but if they haven't made up their minds that it is permanent, then of course, they will fail."
Robert Atkins,"I was gaining weight very rapidly and read about the idea of restricting carbohydrates as an alternative to going hungry. I had a big appetite, so that was the only thing I would even consider."
Robert Atkins,"I think that if a person wants to remain vegetarian, they're just going to have to go hungry."
Brooks Atkinson,I have no objections to churches so long as they do not interfere with God's work
Brooks Atkinson,In the 1920s dramatists attacked their subjects as if the inequities could be resolved. Some of the traditional optimism of America lurked behind most of the early plays. But not now. There is no conviction now that the problem will be solved.
Brooks Atkinson,"The evil that men do lives on the front pages of greedy newspapers, but the good is oft interred apathetically inside"
Brooks Atkinson,"Nothing a man writes can please him as profoundly as something he does with his back, shoulders and hands. For writing is an artificial activity. It is a lonely and private substitute for conversation."
Brooks Atkinson,Every man with an idea has at least two or three followers
Brooks Atkinson,"It takes most men five years to recover from a college education, and to learn that poetry is as vital to thinking as knowledge."
Brooks Atkinson,It seems not to have been written. It is the quintessence of life. It is the basic truth.
Brooks Atkinson,"The most fatal illusion is the narrow point of view. Since life is growth and motion, a fixed point of view kills anybody who has one."
Brooks Atkinson,"Drop the last year into the silent limbo of the past. Let it go, for it was imperfect, and thank God that it can go."
Brooks Atkinson,Don't be condescending to unskilled labor. Try it for a half a day first.
Brooks Atkinson,People everywhere enjoy believing things that they know are not true. It spares them the ordeal of thinking for themselves and taking responsibility for what they know.
Brooks Atkinson,Good plays drive bad playgoers crazy.
Brooks Atkinson,There is no joy so great as that of reporting that a good play has come to town.
Brooks Atkinson,In every age 'the good old days' were a myth. No one ever thought they were good at the time. For every age has consisted of crises that seemed intolerable to the people who lived through them.
James Atlas,"He describes himself as a mild depressive, and he goes through just terrible suffering, much of it self-generated. And yet he's also an extremely buoyant person who finds a great deal in life to entertain and instruct and amuse him. He has a kind of vivacity about him. He's very funny, and he's very obsessed with certain themes."
James Atlas,"In writing this book I'm writing about my own life, a generation removed. But in the larger sense ... it was my discovery of Bellow's work, his voice that became for me the inspiration for this book. I was always fascinated by his life and wanted to know more about it."
James Atlas,I doubt the garrulous archive bequeathed us by the tape recorder will prove as memorable as Henry James's thank-you notes.
James Atlas,"He himself has said you can follow the patterns and real events in his life by reading his books, which doesn't mean you can figure out his life by reading his books. Simply that the events in his life are the starting points for the books that he writes. But that's just the beginning."
James Atlas,A penumbra of somber dignity has descended over his reputation.
Ed Atorino,"This Cantor Fitzgerald issue is a serious hurdle. Without that [quote service], Dow Jones [Markets] doesn't have much of a franchise. It's a key asset."
Ed Atorino,"Houghton was the last 'independent' educational publisher left. To get into the school market, Houghton was the last one."
Ed Atorino,"The real problem is structural: retail consolidation, difficulties in the classified auto space and competition from other media."
Ed Atorino,You're not going to see a (buying and selling) frenzy. For the time being it should ... give investors some comfort there is some value out there.
David Attenborough,"You know, we could say yes, they were about to exterminate sea horses and now they aren't... But it isn't a solution to the world's problems."
David Attenborough,"Oh, my capacity for guilt is enormous. I'm all the time thinking I'm not doing the things I should be doing, not doing enough of it, or I said I'd be vice-president of something or other, and what I have I done? Nothing."
David Attenborough,It's lost on me. I can just about tell if it's got a jet engine or one of those funny things on the front!
David Attenborough,"It's not just that we are dependent on the natural world for our food and for the very air we breathe-which is, of course, the case-and that the very richness of the natural world continues to provide us with all kinds of assistance."
David Attenborough,"I'm especially involved, for example, in the Richmond Environmental Centre. That's one of those things you can hardly say no to."
David Attenborough,"It is curiosity, quite right-a divine curiosity. A characteristic of the gods is curiosity."
David Attenborough,Crying wolf is a real danger.
David Attenborough,"I'm absolutely strict about it. When I land, I put my watch right, and I don't care what I feel like, I will go to bed at half past eleven. If that means going to bed early or late, that's what I live by. As soon as you get there, live by that time."
David Attenborough,"Television of course actually started in Britain in 1936, and it was a monopoly, and there was only one broadcaster and it operated on a license which is not the same as a government grant."
David Attenborough,An understanding of the natural world and what's in it is a source of not only a great curiosity but great fulfillment.
David Attenborough,It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement; the greatest source of visual beauty; the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living.
David Attenborough,I asked the airline staff what I was going to do with all the animals as I didn't have any food for them. They were very unhelpful.
David Attenborough,People are not going to care about animal conservation unless they think that animals are worthwhile.
David Attenborough,I like animals. I like natural history. The travel bit is not the important bit. The travel bit is what you have to do in order to go and look at animals.
David Attenborough,I am not over fond of animals.
David Attenborough,Neither have I said we have got to do this because of some pharmaceutical advantage there may or may not be. The moral issue is that we should not impoverish this world.
David Attenborough,"The reverse side of the coin in having this extraordinary ability to go anywhere, is that no one anywhere is remote any more."
David Attenborough,I think a major element of jetlag is psychological. Nobody ever tells me what time it is at home.
Colleen Atwood,"While researching design, I was inspired globally, from Peru to Turkey to Africa to Japan-from the 5th century through to today."
Colleen Atwood,"The reward is that you can actually create a world separate from reality with a story, actors, music, and camera design. When it works it can entertain, move people and teach us all."
Colleen Atwood,"The first Chicago was definitely a product of its time, and Chicago the musical is definitely a contemporary look at another time."
Colleen Atwood,"The designs were based on quite a lot of research of what a movie musical is, filtered through the eyes of today. If we'd gone strictly with the '20s, the movement would have been impaired."
Colleen Atwood,The costumes had to serve the choreography.
Colleen Atwood,"Some of the kimonos took as long as four to five months to make, with all the layers that go into it."
Colleen Atwood,"Sleepy Hollow had a lot of action in it, even though it was a fairy-tale movie."
Colleen Atwood,"Planet of the Apes was a gigantic challenge, making the clothes work so people could do stunts and action in the clothes. I really learned a lot about that in that movie."
Colleen Atwood,"On Planet of the Apes, I had a very knowledgeable team who knew good materials, but I had one main source person who worked online and on the street continually looking for the proper materials."
Colleen Atwood,"Knowing who the actors were as you were designing them helped, with Catherine's beauty and Renee's frailty, they directed me visually just by who they were."
Colleen Atwood,"In real life, a lot of people at that level will have their kimonos made especially for them."
Colleen Atwood,"In Chicago, I walked in knowing what the dancers were going to need."
Colleen Atwood,"I've been lucky in the things I've got to work on. I've been able to keep it fresh, always getting to do different kinds of things."
Colleen Atwood,"I've always loved movies, art and clothes."
Colleen Atwood,"I'd seen the current stage production and the 1975 production of Chicago. I liked them both very much, but I didn't use them necessarily as inspiration."
Colleen Atwood,"I really like the original Apes costumes. The colors were great, and the use of heavy materials was something that influenced me for this film."
Colleen Atwood,"I had to work out that it was something that could move, without having everybody in spray painted leotards."
Colleen Atwood,"Each simian had a much different body suit, so besides trying to define class across species, there was a definite attempt to dress each group in different styles."
Colleen Atwood,Costumes are the first impression that you have of the character before they open their mouth-it really does establish who they are.
Colleen Atwood,"Chicago is partly a fairy tale because it's inside one person's head, so that part of it's made up and the rest of it is reality."
Colleen Atwood,"As a designer, you have to solve a lot of problems. Even though people are wearing clothes that are supposed to look beautiful, they'll have to do all kinds of things."
Colleen Atwood,"If you want someone to feel warm, you dress them in a warm color and put a warm light on them and you get the picture. Sometimes, all that needs pushing a little bit to help tell the story."
Colleen Atwood,Sometimes a contemporary film like Silence of the Lambs is difficult. To make it look real but interesting is always a challenge.
Kevyn Aucoin,"There are two types of people in the world: people who are passionate about things, and people who've had their passion punched, beaten, or whatever out of them."
Kevyn Aucoin,The faces I see in the modeling industry can get dull.
Kevyn Aucoin,"When I was growing up, the men in my life were abusive; women were the ones I ran to for comfort."
Kevyn Aucoin,"I'm going to insult a whole industry here, but it seems like TV is for people who can't do film. I'm not talking about actresses; I'm talking about lighting people. Lighting on TV is just so... it's sinful, it really is."
Kevyn Aucoin,I'd rather have huge success and huge failures than travel in the middle of the road.
Kevyn Aucoin,"Yes, but everyone is beautiful to someone."
Kevyn Aucoin,"That's why I began doing makeup in the first place: I was hoping that through helping people see the beauty in themselves, I could try and find it in me."
Kevyn Aucoin,I'm very passionate about what I do.
Kevyn Aucoin,I think the responsibility lies with the fashion world as a collective. We have to demand more variety.
Kevyn Aucoin,I spent much of my life hiding.
Kevyn Aucoin,I also have this incredible love for women.
Kevyn Aucoin,"Growing up, my ideals were Barbra Streisand, Cher, and my mom."
Kevyn Aucoin,Another thing that's pathetic is this rule that you have to look ugly to get respect as an actress. Jessica Lange had to make herself look really bad to prove that she had amazing talent.
Kevyn Aucoin,"Today I choose life. Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it."
Kevyn Aucoin,"Beauty is about perception, not about make-up. I think the beginning of all beauty is knowing and liking oneself. You can't put on make-up, or dress yourself, or do you hair with any sort of fun or joy if you're doing it from a position of correction."
Kevyn Aucoin,"Today I see beauty everywhere I go, in every face I see, in every single soul."
Kevyn Aucoin,"Soon I realized that if beauty equalled forgiveness, I was never going to be forgiven."
Kevyn Aucoin,"Perfection is boring. If a face doesn't have mistakes, it's nothing."
Kevyn Aucoin,Life is too short to spend hoping that the perfectly arched eyebrow or hottest new lip shade will mask an ugly heart.
Kevyn Aucoin,Beauty has a lot to do with character.
W. H. Auden,"When I find myself in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes."
W. H. Auden,"A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language."
W. H. Auden,"No good opera plot can be sensible, for people do not sing when they are feeling sensible."
W. H. Auden,Music is the best means we have of digesting time.
W. H. Auden,The words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living.
Wystan Hugh Auden,"No poet or novelist wishes he were the only one who ever lived, but most of them wish they were the only one alive, and quite a number fondly believe their wish has been granted."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"It takes little talent to see clearly what lies under one's nose, a good deal of it to know in which direction to point that organ."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"All sins tend to be addictive, and the terminal point of addiction is damnation."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"We are here on earth to do good to others. What the others are here for, I don't know."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"When I am in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a drawing room full of dukes."
Wystan Hugh Auden,A false enchantment can all too easily last a lifetime.
Wystan Hugh Auden,"To pray is to pay attention to something or someone other than oneself. Whenever a man so concentrates his attention -- on a landscape, a poem, a geometrical problem, an idol, or the True God -- that he completely forgets his own ego and desires, he is praying. The primary task of the schoolteacher is to teach children, in a secular context, the technique of prayer."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest."
Wystan Hugh Auden,It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.
Wystan Hugh Auden,No good opera plot can be sensible:... people do not sing when they are feeling sensible.
Wystan Hugh Auden,"Left to itself the masculine imagination has very little appreciation for the here and now; it prefers to dwell on what is absent, on what has been or may be. If men are more punctual than women, it is because they know that, without the external discipline of clock time, they would never get anything done."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"If the most significant characteristic of man is the complex of biological needs he shares with all members of his species, then the best lives for the writer to observe are those in which the role of natural necessity is clearest, namely, the lives of the very poor."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"To the man-in-the-street, who, I'm sorry to say, is a keen observer of life. The word ''Intellectual'' suggests straight away. A man who's untrue to his wife."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"see without looking, . . . hear without listening, . . . breathe without asking."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"Fame often makes a writer vain, but seldom makes him proud."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"May it not be that, just as we have to have faith in Him, God has to have faith in us and, considering the history of the human race so far, may it not be that ''faith'' is even more difficult for Him than it is for us?"
Wystan Hugh Auden,"Evil is unspectacular and always human, and shares our bed and eats at our own table."
Wystan Hugh Auden,"The critical opinions of a writer should always be taken with a large grain of salt. For the most part, they are manifestations of his debate with himself as to what he should do next and what he should avoid."
Wystan Hugh Auden,Criticism should be a casual conversation.

Chris Ault,"However, the inconsistencies of our program, coupled with a poor home record have resulted in a loss of confidence from our community, as evidenced by our last two home games.

Marcus Aurelius,The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.
Marcus Aurelius,How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.
Geno Auriemma,"It's been kind of hectic in some ways because you're here, there and everywhere trying to cram as many activities in as you can in a short period of time. But I think the closer you get to the actual event, the more it hits home with what's real about it opposed to in the beginning it's just an idea, just a thought."
Geno Auriemma,Look at last year's tournament and see who did what.
Geno Auriemma,I don't want to be afraid to run and be afraid to lose and worry about it. I just want to go and run and up down the floor and make some plays and see what happens. That's when we're at our best.
Geno Auriemma,Our coaches said don't worry about her. She's hitting about one 3-pointer a game. It seemed like she made one about every five minutes.
Geno Auriemma,We don't score on sheer individual talent. Sometimes we run stuff just to run stuff without an idea what we're going to get from it.
Geno Auriemma,This game was indicative of our level of talent versus theirs. We started the game exactly the way I wanted to.
Geno Auriemma,"The strength of your league is what is going on in the middle. We have always been good at the top. But we will have teams finishing 10th, 11th 12th in our league who are pretty darned good, and I don't know that anybody else has that."
Geno Auriemma,There's a lot of soul searching that has to go on. Maybe we just don't have it in us. Maybe we're just not good enough right now.
Geno Auriemma,It's interesting when you know somebody when they're 17 and they come out of high school and spend some time with them on the college level. I remember the Duke game was one of the best games she ever had when I was there. Things like that just stick out in your mind.
Geno Auriemma,"Her conditioning is so-so. I think the rest was really good. But the rest kind of hurts you conditioning-wise because I don't care how long you ride the bike or are in the training room working out or in the pool, you've got to (get in) basketball shape playing basketball. We'll see how many (minutes) she can go and the same thing New Year's Eve (against Army) and then go from there."
Geno Auriemma,"When you get to be a senior, a certain amount of responsibility falls on your shoulders, like all of it. Everything that happens on our team, you're responsible for it and you can't not take responsibility for it just because you're not playing. ... I think (Turner) understands that now and she was really different the last couple of days in practice."
Geno Auriemma,"I think players sometimes don?t understand fully the amount of responsibility on their shoulders. As a senior, you have to take on that responsibility every day -- practice, games, travel, locker room, you name it. I think in the Big East tournament, they really, really, really did that. They took it to heart and made sure all the little things that lead to winning were taken care of. I really admire them for that."
Geno Auriemma,"I think we have a reputation of being a really good NCAA tournament team. There does seem to be a little more of an edge to our game, a little more of a focus. I don't think we get up tight. I see teams that get very, very tentative and tense at tournament time and I don't see us being like that generally. I think our approach as a coaching staff is pretty laid back. We want to reward our kids for a great season."
Geno Auriemma,I think there's been a lot of progress made and I can usually tell by where the ball ends up. Like does the ball end up in the right player's hand and what's going on in that possession.
Geno Auriemma,"There's 22 practice days between [today] and our first game [Nov. 12]. You would like to lay the foundation, like you would with a house, and the success of your team depends on what you build those 22 practice days. Last year, we were never able to get after it because of those situations. I don't see that as an issue right now, cross your fingers."
Geno Auriemma,"Barbara said she knew it was in as soon as she shot it. She's told me a lot of lies over the last four years, but that was the biggest one I've ever heard."
Geno Auriemma,I can't tell you how many times I've been offered jobs in that league that no one ever knew about. I can't tell you how many times I've talked to people seriously about jobs in that league. This one just happened to make it to that point ... to the newspapers.
Geno Auriemma,I'm not sure what happened. Something clicked. Renee has a habit of doing that. She looks kind of lost and not sure and then she looks like the best guard in the country.
Geno Auriemma,"When you lose this game, there's nothing worse. There's nothing worse because this is the game that gets you to the place where all good things can happen. This is the hardest hurdle to get over, because you need 12 more months then to get back here and you didn't put yourself in a position to win the national championship."
Geno Auriemma,"It?s just so overwhelming because as a kid you go to the Hall of Fame, you look around and you read everything and you just never imagine seeing your picture or your stuff right there. It probably won?t really, really hit me until induction weekend, when it?s going to be unbelievable probably."
Geno Auriemma,"I just put it up on the board. The look in their eyes, I don't know what they thought it was going to be, given how they played. But sometimes when you see it ... I don't think there was any more I had to say after that. I think there comes a point where a kid looks at themselves and says, this is what I have to do or I'm not going to be able to help in any way."
Geno Auriemma,"Nerves are not an issue. To me, Ann Strother is a perfect example of someone who came in here as a freshman and was never afraid to take the big shot, to have the ball in crucial situations. Some kids are just different and they have it in them. She does."
Geno Auriemma,We played pretty good defense and took good care of the ball and got people involved in offense that we wanted to get involved. We got the right shot at the right time. We accomplished a lot.
Geno Auriemma,"We have won some big games on the road against some good teams, which has given the group the confidence that you need to play in these games. I don?t know that we went in feeling like we were good enough to win this thing last year. I think maybe we thought we were, but I?m not sure we really believed it."
Geno Auriemma,"Right now, it seems like Will has made a commitment to herself to be one of the better players at her position in our league. And certainly it's not beyond the realm of possibilities for will. If you think about it, she's got all the ingredients."
Geno Auriemma,The new contract is a reflection of the university's commitment to me and my commitment to the university.
Geno Auriemma,"You're going to do a lot of amazing things in college, ... It'll be a shame if no one sees you do them."
Geno Auriemma,I believe the way the game played out at Rutgers really stung them like nothing ever did before. I think there was a tremendous amount of soul searching and really trying to come to grips with who we are and what our strengths are and what our faults are and what we need to do.
Geno Auriemma,I remember saying that. It was right around the baseball playoffs. I always thought it was pretty cool how a manager would send a pitcher ahead to the next city to wait for his team. I wanted to give Will the opportunity to do that. Why sit around for five months doing nothing? I figured she could be up there scouting out the hotels and restaurants and sightseeing tours for us.
Geno Auriemma,"I don?t think she deserved any more than that, but it?s certainly beneath her ability. So, hopefully, she takes it as kind of an incentive to want to do more, want to be recognized for being better than that."
Geno Auriemma,"My hope is that sometime in the next 24 hours, we play as close to our ability as we can. I wouldn't be at all disappointed if around 11:30 [Tuesday night], I'm saying that's the best game we played all year. That would be pretty good. Right now, we need to play one of the best games we've played."
Geno Auriemma,"At this time of year, everything is about confidence. About your ability to make the play that needs to be made at the time it needs to be made. That's everything at this time of year. And the bottom line is, if you have those guys that make those plays, you win."
Brad Ausmus,"Not only to get the strikeout and get out of the inning, but you don't have to worry about facing Albert with the bases loaded."
Brad Ausmus,"your hands get cold, your feet get cold, but if you can't find a way to keep your mind off that stuff in a World Series, you probably shouldn't be in it."
Brad Ausmus,"I don't think he's moving out here to be living close to me, per se, ... I think the idea of living in this climate and his affinity to golf is a big attraction for Baggy. There are tons of golf courses out here, but I've never played golf with him out here."
Brad Ausmus,He's the face of baseball in the city of Houston.
Paul Auster,"I find it impossible to start a project without the title in mind. I can sometimes spend years thinking of the title to go with the thing that's forming in my head. A title defines the project somehow and if you keep finding the ramifications of the title in the work it becomes better, I'm convinced of this."
Paul Auster,"The funny thing is, as a young person I was trying to write prose, and I wrote a lot of it, but I was never satisfied with the results. Two of the novels I wound up finishing and publishing later I started very early on, in my early 20's, In The Country Of Last Things and Moon Palace. Both of those books I worked a great deal on but never quite got a grip on either one."
Paul Auster,"And that's why books are never going to die. It's impossible. It's the only time we really go into the mind of a stranger, and we find our common humanity doing this. So the book doesn't only belong to the writer, it belongs to the reader as well, and then together you make it what it is."
Paul Auster,"Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever."
Paul Auster,There's hope for everyone. That's what makes the world go round.
Paul Auster,"I don't know if she should worry too much, I mean some of our greatest writers have had movies made of their books, lots of Hemingway novels were turned into movies, it doesn't hurt the book."
Paul Auster,"It's extremely difficult to get these jobs because you can't get a job on a ship unless you have seaman's paper's, and you can't get seaman's papers unless you have a job on a ship. There had to be a way to break through the circle, and he was the one who arranged it for me."
Paul Auster,"It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not."
Paul Auster,You can't put your feet on the ground until you've touched the sky.
Paul Auster,"The book is your book. You have been responsible for every single thing on every page, every comma, every syllable is your work."
Paul Auster,"All I wanted to do was write - at the time, poems, and prose, too. I guess my ambition was simply to make money however I could to keep myself going in some modest way, and I didn't need much, I was unmarried at the time, no children."
Paul Auster,"I was always interested in French poetry sort of as a sideline to my own work, I was translating contemporary French poets. That kind of spilled out into translation as a way to earn money, pay for food and put bread on the table."
Paul Auster,"If you're not ready for everything, you're not ready for anything."
Paul Auster,"I don't think that you can be prescriptive about anything, I mean, life is too complicated. Maybe there are novels where the author has not in the least thought about it in terms of film, which can be turned into good films."
Paul Auster,"You see, the interesting thing about books, as opposed, say, to films, is that it's always just one person encountering the book, it's not an audience, it's one to one."
Paul Auster,"We construct a narrative for ourselves, and that's the thread that we follow from one day to the next. People who disintegrate as personalities are the ones who lose that thread."
Paul Auster,"I guess I wanted to leave America for awhile. It wasn't that I wanted to become an expatriate, or just never come back, I needed some breathing room. I'd already been translating French poetry, I'd been to Paris once before and liked it very much, and so I just went."

Alfred Austin,Tears are the summer showers to the soul.
Alfred Austin,Exclusiveness in a garden is a mistake as great as it is in society.
Alfred Austin,"The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just on the body, but the soul."
Alfred Austin,Show me your garden and I shall tell you what you are.
John Austin,It can't be done. We don't rely on this to make any money. Breaking even would be good enough.
John Austin,We're in a different ball game now. We're going to be shedding a lot of the low-education manufacturing jobs.
John Austin,"There's still this cultural hangover from a different era, when you could get a good job without a postsecondary education. That era is over."
John Austin,"The MCP1316 - MCP1322 voltage supervisors incorporate several attractive features on a single chip, resulting in enhanced design flexibility, reduced board space, and lower system costs.

Sasha Azevedo,Life is a gift. Never take it for granted.
Paul Azinger,"I don't hate it as much today (Thursday) as I did yesterday (when the pro-am was played in strong winds). We players fuss and moan and complain that all the courses on Tour are the same and when somebody finally builds something different like this, what do we do? We fuss and moan and complain."
Paul Azinger,That's just a testament to the golf courses. It's a diverse test. They put bunkers in places where those big boys will find them and I won't. It's different this week.
Paul Azinger,"It's hard for me to look at it, because it's looking into a future that I don't have. I don't have any tenure out here. I'm still looking at this week and next week. I'm trying to play good, because I need to play well."
