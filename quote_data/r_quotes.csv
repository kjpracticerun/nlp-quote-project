Daniel Radcliffe,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

Paula Radcliffe,"I thought I was in good 10k shape, but the weather was against front-running. It was just too windy, ... My legs feel OK, I just did not have the pace at the end in the last 1,000 meters."

Paula Radcliffe,It's totally different from last year because I came in with good shape with no health worries so it was about going out there and running well and enjoying it.
Gilda Radner,"While we have the gift of life, it seems to me the only tragedy is to allow part of us to die -- whether it is our spirit, our creativity or our glorious uniqueness"
Gilda Radner,"I wanted a perfect ending, now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious amiguity."

Marla Rae,"In Oregon, our police and firefighters are using communications equipment that dates back 30-plus years."
Marla Rae,"And then with the Pacific States (Marine Fisheries Commission), to look to the appropriate amendments to federal law. Knowing that it takes an act of Congress rather than an act of the commission."
Marla Rae,We would have no regulatory authority over anything other than native wildlife. This would throw our whole wildlife-integrity plan into chaos.
Akbar Rafsanjani,We want to assure you (the Gulf region) that we are at the service of the whole region.
Akbar Rafsanjani,It is not possible to wrongly accuse such a nation (Iran) ... and then send its dossier to the security council and drag the region step by step towards a critical situation.
Akbar Rafsanjani,They want to deprive Islamic nations of having nuclear energy knowledge and always keep them backwards.

Bobby Rahal,Then I was just trying to make my way back up. I got Andretti going into three. I got a good run on him and just passed him. Then I caught Pablo and snuck by him on the backstraightaway.
Bobby Rahal,"I don't think they want to admit that her draw is helping them, but it's the truth. Everyone from sponsors to teams to the IRL is benefiting from her. She's having the Tiger effect on TV ratings."

Technology is central to the success of any racing organization, and Logicalis has been a critical partner is helping Rahal Letterman Racing continue to be a championship team. We are looking forward to the next three years with Logicalis."
Bobby Rahal,"I told them (the other drivers) I admired them and appreciated them because they're out racing these cars for people to see. These (cars) aren't hangar queens. They (the racers) are very selfless about sharing their love for these cars with everybody here. You could tell from the reception, with cars in the paddock area, that a lot of these fans here are excited to see these cars again."

You could tell from the reception, with cars in the paddock area, that a lot of these fans here are excited to see these cars again."
Bobby Rahal,"Jeff is a driver that I think has a great deal of potential and a very bright future. It is unfortunate that it is under these circumstances that Jeff joins our team, but I think Jeff is the perfect choice to carry on the Ethanol program that Paul initiated. Jeff has paid his dues and worked his way up through the ladder system. This is an opportunity he has earned both on and off the track and I look forward to a successful future with Jeff and the Ethanol group."
Bobby Rahal,"If you are at all romantic about racing, it is so much fun to drive these cars and to really appreciate what they were like in a great era of Formula One,"
Bobby Rahal,"You don't have to worry about whether the car is set up right or not, you know it is, and it's down to you. Ultimately, that's what every driver wants."
Bobby Rahal,"What's really hit me over the years is that you go to every race and see all the well-wishers, and you really feel like you are connected with people after all these years."
Bobby Rahal,We tried to create advantages. We were never complacent.
Bobby Rahal,"We ran three cars last year. Unfortunately, as time went on, we did have to let a few people go, which we regretted, but just because of the situation."
Bobby Rahal,"Today, the competition is considerably more intense."
Bobby Rahal,There's a tremendous number of the Daytona Prototypes.
Bobby Rahal,The place where I had so much success as a driver would be where I had my first win as a team owner.
Bobby Rahal,The fans know that I have been giving it my all and that we had the good judgment to when to say when.
Bobby Rahal,Obviously it's critical that the three cars are able to contribute to the program. I think that certainly has given much of the reason as to why we did so well at Indy over the last several years.
Bobby Rahal,My son is racing his first 24-hour this year with Porsche.
Bobby Rahal,"In racing, I wanted to be a winner and to be a winner, you have to be willing to roll the dice."
Bobby Rahal,"In 1982 when I showed up, the average age of the drivers in the series was something like 40, 41. The crowds were small. There was not much prize money. The competition wasn't very tight."

Bobby Rahal,"I guess it is the sense of personal satisfaction that racing gives you that I am probably going to miss, because in racing you get that feedback very quickly."

Bobby Rahal,Competitiveness has been a big thing for me.
Bobby Rahal,Being injured is something that happens in this sport. Anybody who gets into it understands that.
Bobby Rahal,"As anybody will tell you that's ever driven one of those races, so many things can happen. Just staying out of everyone's way is half the battle."
Daron Rahlves,This is hard to swallow. It's not the way I wanted it to end. If you win a gold medal at the Olympics it doesn't matter what else you've done. I definitely wanted to walk away from here on top.
Daron Rahlves,"The way I was skiing downhill, I was on the podium in three events. But the super-G, it's the one event I just haven't had the confidence in like the downhill and giant slalom. I had the wrong thoughts in my head. I just wasn't super confident getting into the starting gate."
Daron Rahlves,"The way I was skiing downhill this year, I was on the podium in three events, but with super-G, it's the one event I just haven't had the confidence in like in the downhill and giant slalom. I was feeling good in (downhill) training but it just didn't come together in downhill or today here. I just shake my head at the way I was skiing. I needed to be clean and smooth and I just wasn't doing that."
Hasim Rahman,"He underestimates my power. My power is a big factor and will set the tone for this fight. Once he gets hit with it, I'm not so sure what adjustments he can make."
Hasim Rahman,I'm turning the corner. I'm putting in hard work. I will not be denied. I'm just waiting to be sworn in as the next heavyweight champion.
Hasim Rahman,"[At the announcement, Rahman came to the podium wearing a chef's hat and holding a tray of food.] I just had some chicken Kiev prepared for him, because I am so happy he's not chicken anymore, ... We're finally getting in the ring. I'm glad he's all healed up. I just hope and pray he doesn't stub his toe or prick his finger before November 12th."
Hasim Rahman,"This is like fighting a bully. When you stand up and fight back like you're not scared, the air goes right out of them. He'll be scared of me."
Hasim Rahman,"He showed tremendous heart in his fight with Lennox Lewis, and he did show desire, ... He proved he was a champion. I really respect this man. I really feel like he can hurt me if I come with any less than my A-plus game."
Hasim Rahman,"Vitali retired so there is no question who the champion is,"
Hasim Rahman,"I'm going to bloody him up, swell him up and punish him."
Hasim Rahman,"I'm going to bloody him up, swell him up and punish him. He can't just lay on the outside and beat me on the outside, so he's got to come in. When he comes in, I'm going to punish him. He'll be a bloody mess in the first round if he stands in front of me."
Hasim Rahman,"I'm going to bloody him up, swell him up and punish him. I'm going to make him find a way out of there; he's going to get out of there just one way or another. You know, he can go out on his own volition or he can get carried out of there. One way, he's getting out of there before 12."
Hasim Rahman,It might go six rounds or less. He'll be a bloody mess in the first round if he stands in front of me.
Aishwarya Rai,the most beautiful woman in the world.
Aishwarya Rai,"Someone said to me this week that you are a Greek goddess with the soul of an Indian. What is the finest complement you have ever received? The one that touched you the most,"
Aishwarya Rai,I always believed that my silence on several topics will be an advantage in the long run.
Aishwarya Rai,I don't want to win any brownie points for giving good copy to the press. I've been extremely dignified and well-behaved while dealing with journalists. So many journalists who have interacted with me have come away pleasantly surprised.
Aishwarya Rai,"for me, it went beyond being a beauty queen. For me, it was about being the 20-year-old girl from India on international platform and a lot of people actually would assume that I wasn't even educated in India because of the way I'd speak. And they'd be like, 'Have you studied in India? Do you actually speak English out there?' and, I was like, 'This is so interesting that so many people know so little about my country.' and this is exactly what I wanted to do when I set out on this little mission in my head."
Aishwarya Rai,I'm not the type who'll yell about my achievements from the rooftops.
Aishwarya Rai,My family is my strength and my weakness.
Kimi Raikkonen,I am really hoping for a trouble-free weekend as the car feels good and I feel I can get some good results in it.
Kimi Raikkonen,"Congratulations to Fernando, but he better be prepared for me and the team to fight him hard for the rest of the season. I will now focus on winning the constructors title for the team and go flat out for the last two races."
Kimi Raikkonen,"I would have won the race but for that,"
Kimi Raikkonen,"I will try to win the race because we have a quick car. If we get through the first corner without problems, I can have a good race. I have nothing to lose."
Kimi Raikkonen,It was a perfect race for the team.
Kimi Raikkonen,"We had a perfect race and it was unfortunate for the team what happened in the last few laps because we could have had a one-two and we deserved it,"
Kimi Raikkonen,"It's going to be hard,"
Kimi Raikkonen,"We got those 10 points back. We are definitely back in the championship, back and fighting again."
Kimi Raikkonen,"There's no doubt we have the fastest package, I'm winning races and I'm feeling well in the team, so why would I even consider changing teams?"
Kimi Raikkonen,"I don't think there is any doubt we have the fastest package,"
Kimi Raikkonen,"I have seen graphics and it looks like a good layout with a mix of challenges, such as slow and fast corners, long straights and elevation changes, and I am looking forward to the challenge."
Kimi Raikkonen,"It was unfortunate what happened (to Montoya) near the end, ... We deserved to have both cars on the podium."
Kimi Raikkonen,I have only seen illustrations of the new livery until now but they do it no justice. It looks fantastic and should create a bit of a stir when we drive it on tracks around the world. If we can make the car as fast as it looks then we will be in good shape.
Franklin Raines,"People are buying new homes, existing homes at record levels. And that just shows the underlying strength of the economy and the optimism of families that this is still a good time to buy a home even though interest ratesÃŠ on mortgages have risen substantially,"
Franklin Raines,We think that it's unwise to put into the constitution a mechanism that enshrines for all time a particular way of measuring the budget.
Franklin Raines,"Well, you know, we've got a lot of stimulus in the economy already from the tax cut, from the lowered interest rates, and also from the refinancing of mortgages."
Franklin Raines,"Well, we're just now seeing the reductions in mortgage rates. The mortgage rates are based on the ten-year rate and the Fed controls the overnight or the shorter rates."
Franklin Raines,"Well, there are about 10 million children that aren't covered by health insurance. About 3 million qualify for Medicaid but don't get it, so we're going to reach out and bring more of those kids into the Medicaid program."
Franklin Raines,"Well, now, and there's - for every dollar the federal government spends, there's real people on the other side, and so when we talk about reductions that are going to affect providers, that's going to affect hospitals and doctors and others."
Franklin Raines,"Well, it's been great for new home purchasers, particularly first-time purchasers. I think this is a good time to be thinking about buying a home."
Franklin Raines,"Well, I think the best form would be to put money directly in the pockets of consumers."
Franklin Raines,"Well, I think as long as people are talking about stimulus, I think the Fed will be thinking about cutting rates because monetary policy is the better way to go because you can turn it on and turn it off."
Franklin Raines,We're just sort of like the Eveready bunny. And we just keep going and we expect that to continue because of the strength of that housing market.
Franklin Raines,We think if the economy remains weak that we could see mortgage rates trail down and we think that we could see rates below seven percent into early next year.
Franklin Raines,"We believe our overall fiscal policy is providing an environment where businesses can prosper, but we believe tax cuts should be aimed at people."
Franklin Raines,"We are shrinking the size of the federal government as a percent of our economy from over 21 percent of the economy to 19 percent of the economy. At the same time, we're growing the private economy."
Franklin Raines,"They flooded liquidity in the marketplace but the mortgage rate is based much more on expectations of inflation. So if the average investor believes that there is inflation coming, they'll move that rate up."
Franklin Raines,"The automatic stabilizer is unemployment insurance, food stamps, additional coverage of Medicaid."
Franklin Raines,"That is - the reason for that is that home prices are only going to go up. Now, they've never gone down nationwide in our - since we've been keeping track of this."
Franklin Raines,"So from the housing standpoint, steady as you go, I think, would be the best medicine."
Franklin Raines,"Right now we think that rates will stay low, that you'll be able to get a mortgage below seven percent and that's kicked off a refinance boom that's going to put more money in the pockets of consumers."
Franklin Raines,Right now the long-term investors are telling us that they're not as concerned about inflation and so we're seeing these rates now move into the marketplace and out to the street - rates that individuals can get.
Franklin Raines,"If there's a severe recession, the automatic stabilizers will come into effect, and we will still try to reduce the structural deficit, but we will not try to keep cutting the budget so that we keep worsening a severe recession."
Franklin Raines,"I think if you go beyond a year - if this continues into the system in the out years, I think there is a risk and that - that we could have a negative reaction in the bond market and that will offset the good that was attempted to be done."
Franklin Raines,And so we have to be careful with looking at additional stimulus that we don't provoke an increase in the bond rate and then offset a lot of the stimulus we've already got.
Franklin Raines,And so the danger for the housing industry is if we see interest rates rise.
Franklin Raines,"And so Fannie Mae produces very strong results for investors in - when interest rates are high and when interest rates are low, in recession and during booms."
Bonnie Raitt,There wouldn't be any rhythmic music if not for sexuality. Sensuality and sexuality is at once complex and simple. It shouldn't be cheapened by a girlie show.
Bonnie Raitt,"[And while the audience waited patiently for what turned out to be a rather perfunctory] Something to Talk About, ... I Can't Make You Love Me."
Bonnie Raitt,"Sometimes I'm more true when I'm up onstage than I'm able to be in my regular life. It's not as exciting to be at home, but I've got to learn how to make that work, and then I will be an ordinary woman."
Bonnie Raitt,"I'm certain that it was an incredible gift for me to not only be friends with some of the greatest blues people who've ever lived, but to learn how they played, how they sang, how they lived their lives, ran their marriages, and talked to their kids."
Bonnie Raitt,I don't think there's ever been any music quite like what we came up with.
Bonnie Raitt,"The consolidation of the music business has made it difficult to encourage styles like the blues, all of which deserve to be celebrated as part of our most treasured national resources."
Bonnie Raitt,I would rather feel things in extreme than not at all.
Bonnie Raitt,I've watched my peers get better with age and hoped that would happen with me.
Bonnie Raitt,"I think my fans will follow me into our combined old age. Real musicians and real fans stay together for a long, long time."
Mahinda Rajapakse,"Your personal involvement in the post-tsunami reconstruction efforts of our country has been a great source of strength to all of us,"
Mahinda Rajapakse,"All those who bring honor to our country at world class sports events such as the Olympic Games, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games will be richly rewarded."
Mahinda Rajapakse,"I will protect the unitary character of the country,"
Mahinda Rajapakse,"I will have direct talks with the LTTE and take steps to correct the shortcomings in the ceasefire agreement,"
Mahinda Rajapakse,I am also ready to review the ceasefire agreement.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"You must learn to work without me. You cannot be here always, you have other works to do. You have come from different countries all over the world. For a few days you will be here with me. If you become addicted to my physical presence, then rather than being a help, it may become a disturbance. Because then when you go away, you will miss me. Your meditation should be such here, that it can happen without my presence. Then, wherever you go, the meditation will not in any way be affected."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,The answer is in yourself. I just tell you the potential of your being.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,Pleasure is more distracting.... Pleasure tends to make you unconscious.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"I am trying in every possible way to drop all those things, which in the past have been barriers for the revolution to continue and grow."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"I'm not going to give you a map. I can give you only a great passion to discover. Yes, a map is not needed; great passion, great desire to discover is needed. Then I leave you alone. Then you go on your own."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,In pain you can be more meditative than in pleasure.â€
Bhagwan Rajneesh,A mother is something absolutely new.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"But your mind is very complex, very tricky. It makes simple things complicated. -- that's its work. And for centuries it has been trained for only one thing, to make things so complicated that your life becomes impossible."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"One should become so capable that even the closest instrument of mind can be put aside and can be put off. It can be done, it has been done, but it has not been done on a great scale. But more and more it will be done. This is what I am trying to do here with you."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"Mind is really a tape recorder. But it is not continuously on, not twenty-four hours on. When needed, the witness, the man of meditation, the man of awareness, is capable of putting the mind on or off. He puts it on when there is some need...."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,...And I am not saying that when you are reborn as a no-mind you cannot use the mind. The mind has its limited uses. Use it.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"The root problem of all problems is mind itself. The first thing to be understood is what this mind is, of what stuff it is made; whether it is an entity or just a process; whether it is substantial, or just dreamlike. And unless you know the nature of the mind, you will not be able to solve any problems of your life."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,When you want any memory you can use the mind just as you can put on your tape recorder.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"Just think of a man who wants to sit but cannot sit because he says,  I have legs -- how can I sit?  Or, think of a man who wants to keep quiet and silent and cannot keep quiet and silent because he says,  I have a mind.  It is the same."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,My message of love is absolutely simple; nothing can be more simple than that.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"Your mind has become expert in destroying you, because your life consists of simple things."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,Laughter brings you to reality as it is.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"From this point, silence and intelligence are just two aspects of the same thing."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"My vision of a real humanity is of a world consisting not of families, not of nations, not of races, but only of individuals."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"My vision of a real humanity is of pure individuals relating to each other, but not tied in any relationship. They will be loving to each other, but not being possessive of each other. They will be sharing with each other all their joys and all their blessings, but never even in their dreams thinking of dominating, thinking of enslaving the other person."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"If what I am saying has anything of truth in it, it will be understood by your heart. But the mind has to give way."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,I am happy whatever you become; just remain truthful and sincere to your own being.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,Become innocent and you will be bridged with God.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,Drop the mind and you will become available to God.
Bhagwan Rajneesh,I would simply like to be forgiven and forgotten. There is no need to remember me. The need is to remember yourself!
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"The truth is that existence wants your life to become a festival...because when you are unhappy, you also throw unhappiness all around."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"Drop this ego, drop this idea that you are somebody special."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"Doubt helps your intelligence, sharpens it. Questioning makes you aware of many possibilities of which you may not have been aware before."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"I don't have a goal, because existence has no goal. It simply is, flowering, blossoming, dancing - but don't ask why. Just an overflow of energy, for no reason at all. I am with existence."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"The master does not give you any answer that you can doubt. This non-questioning consciousness is the answer. And it is your experience; you cannot doubt it, it is there."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"With me, a new chapter in the history of consciousness begins."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"We transcend the illusions of body and mind, and the separation perpetuated by these illusions. In this dimension, we re-discover the nature of Love for the One Spirit, of which we are all a part."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"We exist solely because we have a body and a mind â€“ a mind that arises out of the body. If this were true, we would cease to exist after our body was gone."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,The world is not a problem; the problem is your unawareness
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"From now on, do whatsoever you want, but do it with awareness. Easy and natural are the keys. Don't repress anything, be your own self."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"Logic ridicules love, and love smiles knowingly at the whole foolishness of logic."
Bhagwan Rajneesh,"The only way to know something absolutely is to experience it for yourself; anything less is theory, speculation, and belief."
Sir Walter Raleigh,"Use your youth so that you may have comfort to remember it when it has forsaken you, and not sigh and grieve at the account thereof."
Sir Walter Raleigh,"All, or the greatest part of men that have aspired to riches or power, have attained thereunto either by force or fraud, and what they have by craft or cruelty gained, to cover the foulness of their fact, they call purchase, as a name more honest. Howsoever, he that for want of will or wit useth not those means, must rest in servitude and poverty."
Sir Walter Raleigh,"Who so desireth to know what will be hereafter, let him think of what is past, for the world hath ever been in a circular revolution; whatsoever is now, was heretofore; and things past or present, are no other than such as shall be again: Redit orbis in orbem."
Sir Walter Raleigh,"He that doth not as other men do, but endeavoureth that which ought to be done, shall thereby rather incur peril than preservation; for who so laboreth to be sincerely perfect and good shall necessarily perish, living among men that are generally evil."
Sir Walter Raleigh,"Historians desiring to write the actions of men, ought to set down the simple truth, and not say anything for love or hatred; also to choose such an opportunity for writing as it may be lawful to think what they will, and write what they think, which is a rare happiness of the time."
Sir Walter Raleigh,Hatreds are the cinders of affection.
Rossi Ralenkotter,We looked at it simply from point of reaching leisure travelers.

Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who've never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, comtempt, and general indiference, and they call it love.

In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have never achieved his title. Do not lose your knowledge that man's proper estate is an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads.

Ayn Rand,Every aspect of Western culture needs a new code of ethics -- a rational ethics -- as a precondition of rebirth.
Ayn Rand,"Why do they always teach us that it's easy and evil to do what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? It's the hardest thing in the world--to do what we want. And it takes the greatest kind of courage. I mean, what we really want."
Ayn Rand,"People create their own questions because they are afraid to look straight. All you have to do is look straight and see the road, and when you see it, don't sit looking at it- walk."

Rick Rashid,Microsoft Research is a pioneer in the area of digital maps. Its TerraServer system has provided millions of users with online access to geographically indexed map and image data since 1998.
Rick Rashid,"Our primary research location will always be in Redmond, but Cambridge is a stand-alone lab, ... We're not dictating their research."
Rick Rashid,Pen-based computing has the potential to alter the way students and teachers interact.
Rick Rashid,"The opportunity to have Roger [Needham] involved is what really brought us to Cambridge,"
Rick Rashid,Your notebook knows all that about you already. We think we could put this information to use.
Rick Rashid,These devices will eventually replace paper print media. We are reaching a point in the future where any surface can be an interactive surface. Input and output will soon be equal.
Rick Rashid,This center is an example of the kind of research environment that will drive innovation in the future.
Rick Rashid,"Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellows represent the best new professors in computing disciplines today. The intellectual curiosity and capacity that each fellow has demonstrated is inspirational, and we will watch their careers develop with interest."
Rick Rashid,"Today, it's hard to find anything we do as a company that hasn't been influenced by the research group."
Sheikh Rashid,building codes and regulations will be reviewed to ensure public security.
Sheikh Rashid,"We will ensure law and order during polling,"
Sheikh Rashid,We have no desire to become involved in a heated conflict. We will do whatever it takes to defend our country.
Safa Rashtchy,"With growth pushed off until 2007 and beyond, we would not be active buyers yet but rather look for potential catalysts over the next year."
Safa Rashtchy,"Amazon is handling the competition fairly well, but it is not pulling away from the pack (of other Internet retailers),"
Safa Rashtchy,"It is a positive move. Investors almost hated the e-commerce business because a it was low margin operation, ... What they like about Internet media companies is they get 80-to-90 percent margins on advertising and sponsorships agreements. Why bring it down by selling something that has no margins?"
Safa Rashtchy,"Yahoo is the largest destination for brand advertisers. Unfortunately, it has been overshadowed by search."
David Raskin,"In this phase you learned who some of those extraordinary people were and you learned about the pain, all the never ending pain, their loved ones still feel."
David Raskin,"The defendant rejoices in all that pain. He told you that himself. He loved it because he was responsible for it. He loved it because it meant to him, mission accomplished."
David Raskin,It is time to put an end to all this. It is time to put an end to his hatred and venom.
David Raskin,"Just because we can't comprehend this kind of evil, doesn't mean he suffers a mental illness. We will never understand evil like this."
Tom Rath,The hurricane and its aftermath will overarch all other agenda items for the rest of this year and maybe beyond.
Tom Rath,"The hurricane and its aftermath will overarch all other agenda items for the rest of this year and maybe beyond,"
Tom Rath,Each treats the other with a great deal of respect. The relationships between the offices have been very professional and looking at both sides.
Tom Rath,Never underestimate the long-term influence of filling others' buckets.
Tom Rath,It's the old cliche. You go into the group looking for a way of processing the grief you are dealing with. And then you end up helping others with their pain and helping yourself. The power of the shared experience in those meetings is amazing.
Tom Rath,"I talk about an enthusiasm deficit, and I think we have a little bit of that. They say we need to get our act together. They still love this president. But they want to see movement on the things that brought us to power. We took the government over and promised to fix things."
Tom Rath,"It's March, and there are congressional elections in November, and at some point it's every person for himself."
Tom Rath,"We know how to do this... there's kind of an elegant dance, as they say."
Tom Rath,"Simply try to turn your next conversation with someone who is negative into a more positive moment. See what happens. In most cases, they will turn around and be more positive in their next interaction."
Michael Ratner,"The Supreme Court has not closed the doors of justice to the detainees imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. This is a major victory for the rule of law and affirms the right of every person, citizen or non-citizen, detained by the United States to test the legality of his or her detention in a U.S. Court."
Michael Ratner,"This could be a big break if Pappas testifies as to why those dogs were used and who ordered the dogs to be used. It's a steppingstone going up the chain of command, and that's positive. It might demonstrate that it wasn't just a few rotten apples."
Michael Ratner,The conscience of our nation is up for grabs.
Michael Ratner,It is not debatable whether the president can order electronic eavesdropping once Congress has passed a law making it criminal to do so. It is impeachable. The fact that we are sitting in 21st century America debating the issue of presidential power is ridiculous to me.
Justin Rattner,"We really need to get to a point where the systems support the users, rather than users supporting the systems."
Justin Rattner,"Even though we've been under competitive pressure, and you might think we've lost a certain enthusiasm for what we're doing, that's far from the truth."
Justin Rattner,We need to design our systems to fit within this set of thermal envelopes.
Joseph Ratzinger,"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered to an intrinsic moral evil, and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder."
Joseph Ratzinger,"Our hearts are full of sadness, yet at the same time (full) of joyful hope and profound gratitude."
Joseph Ratzinger,We can learn from him that suffering and the gift of himself is an essential gift we need in our time.
Maurice Ravel,The only love affair I have ever had was with music.
Maurice Ravel,"Another significant influence, other than Chabrier - is from Satie, who had a notable effect on Debussy, on myself, and, to tell the truth, on the majority of modern French composers."
Maurice Ravel,"My intention here is to make it clear that not a single cell of my composition, here in regard to The Raven, is found by chance or intuition, that the composition moved towards perfection with the precision and inevitability of a mathematical equation."
Maurice Ravel,"Music, I feel, must be emotional first and intellectual second."
Maurice Ravel,"For Debussy the musician and the man I have had profound admiration, but by nature I'm different from him. I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of the symbolism of Debussy."
Simon Raven,"Nobody minded what you did in bed or what you said about God, a very civilized attitude in 1948."
Simon Raven,"How can I go on with this? Please God, let me win a football pool."
Simon Raven,"Scholarship was one thing, drudgery another. I very soon concluded that nothing would induce me to read, let alone make notes on, hundreds and hundreds of very, very, very boring books."
Simon Raven,"Gentlemen can now only behave as such, or be tolerated as such, in circumstances that are manifestly contrived or unreal."
Simon Raven,I loved the Army as an institution and loathed every single thing it required me to do.
Simon Raven,"And so, at the age of thirty, I had successively disgraced myself with three fine institutions, each of which had made me free of its full and rich resources, had trained me with skill and patience, and had shown me nothing but forbearance and charity when I failed in trust."
Simon Raven,"Art for art's sake, money for God's sake."
John Rawls,The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance.
John Rawls,Certainly it is wrong to be cruel to animals and the destruction of a whole species can be a great evil. The capacity for feelings of pleasure and pain and for the form of life of which animals are capable clearly impose duties of compassion and humanity in their case.
John Rawls,The bad man desires arbitrary power. What moves the evil man is the love of injustice.
John Rawls,"Ideally citizens are to think of themselves as if they were legislators and ask themselves what statutes, supported by what reasons satisfying the criterion of reciprocity, they would think is most reasonable to enact."
John Ray,Never meet trouble halfway
John Ray,"Many without punishment, none without sin."
John Ray,"The honester the man, the worse luck"
John Ray,True luck consists not in holding the best of the cards at the table; luckiest he who knows just when to rise and go home

John Ray,Never meet trouble half-way.
John Ray,Misery loves company.
John Ray,"Just to hear that baby hollering and crying, that was the thing."
John Ray,"These settlements represent the latest in a series of achievements aimed at resolving significant claims in Enron's bankruptcy proceedings. We are pleased that these settlements enable us to collect additional value for the creditors, and, at the same time, resolve claims against the estate so that we can accelerate distributions to all creditors."
John Ray,"Industry is fortune's right hand, and frugality its left."
John Ray,Beauty is power; a smile is its sword.
Man Ray,"An original is a creation motivated by desire. Any reproduction of an originals motivated be necessity. It is marvellous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms. To create is divine, to reproduce is human."
Man Ray,One of the satisfactions of a genius is his will-power and obstinacy.
Man Ray,"An original is a creation motivated by desire. Any reproduction of an originals motivated be necessity. It is marvelous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms. To create is divine, to reproduce is human."
Man Ray,A creator needs only one enthusiast to justify him.
Man Ray,"I paint what cannot be photographed, that which comes from the imagination or from dreams, or from an unconscious drive."
Man Ray,"Of course, there will always be those who look only at technique, who ask 'how', while others of a more curious nature will ask 'why'. Personally, I have always preferred inspiration to information."
Man Ray,Don't put my name on it. These are simply documents I make.
Man Ray,"I photograph the things that I do not wish to paint, the things which already have an existence."
Man Ray,"It has never been my object to record my dreams, just the determination to realize them."
Man Ray,All critics should be assassinated.
Man Ray,"To me, a painter, if not the most useful, is the least harmful member of our society."
Rachael Ray,"I've just sort of gone with the flow and I ended up here. Crazy. I'm not going to start planning anything, my life is way better than anybody could have planned it."
Rachael Ray,"It was check-to-check living,"
Rachael Ray,"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share. Our show's going to be all about taking a bigger bite out of life."
Rachael Ray,"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share. Our show's going to be all about taking a bigger bite out of life. I want people to see themselves in this show because life is full of messes and successes, and getting there is half the fun."
Rachael Ray,"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share, ... Our show's going to be all about taking a bigger bite out of life."
Rachael Ray,"People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share, ... Our show's going to be all about taking a bigger bite out of life. I want people to see themselves in this show because life is full of messes and successes, and getting there is half the fun."
Rachael Ray,Ask the locals. They can point you in the direction of the area's shopping district where you'll be sure to find something different and unique that pleases you.
Robert Ray,We just decided to slow things down and be more solid with our passing. We were trying to make too much happen in the first half instead of just waiting for things come to us.
Robert Ray,"If there is a warrant and done by the courts, I would agree. But they're trying to do it without using the courts. I just don't trust them."
Robert Ray,"The process serves to vindicate that no person -- even a president -- is above the law,"
Robert Ray,"If your intention is to go to trial, you turn to Ted Wells,"
Robert Ray,"The market is looking for a more efficient platform. At the growth rate we are going at now, I think we might start stepping on a few toes."
Sam Rayburn,Leadership must be established from the top down.
Sam Rayburn,"You cannot be a leader, and ask other people to follow you, unless you know how to follow, too."
Sam Rayburn,Too many critics mistake the deliberations of the Congress for its decisions
Sam Rayburn,"I will not deny that there are men in the district better qualified than I to go to Congress, but gentlemen, these men are not in the race."
Janet Rayfield,"The knee is getting tighter, which is good. It's a long season and the 10 days of rest that she'll get will probably make her a lot stronger for the next seven Big Ten games, which is more important than having her for this one game."
Janet Rayfield,Six goals in 180 minutes is good offensive production and if we can carry those numbers into the fall we will be dangerous. Ella had a very productive day and was consistently dangerous. Our passing was not as sharp as it needs to be in order for us to be as strong collectively on offense as we are individually.
Janet Rayfield,"Regardless of results or performance, the ability to interact and impact the young student-athletes involved in the Chicago SCORES program was a great opportunity for all of our student-athletes. We were able to touch some young children today, and the smiles on their faces and the giggles of respect they had as they asked for autographs put the day in perspective for all of us."
Lee Raymond,"I'm not trying to criticize the traders, ... Obviously, the probability of a shortage is higher than it has been in the past."
Lee Raymond,"We would be absolutely amazed, although pleasantly surprised, if the Federal Trade Commission said we did not have to rationalize some assets,"
Lee Raymond,"This year's second-quarter results benefited from higher liquids production, increased petroleum product and chemical sales volumes, and improved downstream margins."
Lee Raymond,"With the improvement in oil prices, second quarter net income increased 18 percent from the first quarter of 1999, in contrast to the seasonal earnings decline that we usually see from the first to the second quarter of each year,"
Lee Raymond,"The improvement in earnings reflected higher U.S. natural gas realizations and refining margins, both of which were very strong early in the second quarter, but declined significantly as the quarter progressed, ... The decline in these key earnings drivers, along with crude oil prices, has continued into the third quarter."
Lee Raymond,"History teaches us that punitive measures, hastily crafted in reaction to short-term market fluctuations, will likely have unintended negative consequences."
Lee Raymond,"In the exploration and production area, for example, Mobil's and Exxon's respective strengths in West Africa, the Caspian region, Russia, South America and North America line up well, with minimal overlap, ... Our respective deepwater assets and deepwater technology also complement each other well."
Lee Raymond,Our earnings in the third quarter reflect the impact of the relatively volatile industry environment on commodity prices and industry margins.
Lee Raymond,"Exxon Mobil produced solid results in an adverse economic and commodity price environment,"
Lee Raymond,That energy legislation is zero in terms of how it affects Exxon Mobil.
Lee Raymond,"When you add it all up, that energy legislation is zero in terms of how it affects Exxon Mobil."
Lee Raymond,"When you add it all up, that energy legislation is zero on how it affects Exxon Mobil."
Lee Raymond,It's profits that make the companies run and make the economy run.
Lee Raymond,"History teaches us that punitive measures hastily crafted in response to short-term rises in prices will have unintended consequences and disincentives to investment,"
Lee Raymond,You should be down asking your representatives in Congress how did they let this happen? They had been told for two years this was going to happen.
Lee Raymond,You shouldn't be talking to me. You should be down asking your representatives in Congress how did they let this happen.
Lee Raymond,"Petroleum company earnings go up and down,"
Lee Raymond,"In order to gain the tools to fully address the broad impact of business on society, economic success is indispensable."
Lee Raymond,"Without competition, the spectacular development of technology that we have seen in the last one hundred years in this country would not have happened."
Lee Raymond,It makes no sense to talk of the social obligations of the corporation without reference to its economic obligations. The two are intertwined.
Lee Raymond,"He or she must be successful in economic terms, but always within an ethical framework. Whether his or her constituency is a corporation and its shareholders or the customers in a small and privately held business, his or her first responsibility is to serve that constituency."
Lee Raymond,"In every aspect of life, including the economic dimension, we are always challenged to do the right thing. In many cases in the market system, which allows a great deal of latitude for human choice, people can get carried away to excess."
Lee Raymond,It is important to remember that all business has an impact on the lives of real people.
Lee Raymond,"I view energy as the lifeblood of world economic activity. And as a result, the energy industry has a profile that is particularly acute."
Lee Raymond,I have a great deal of difficulty with those who live in a hugely prosperous country telling people in the developing world that they should be deprived of a critical source of energy.
Lee Raymond,The freedoms that people have that flow from all civic institutions fundamentally come from the success of a market system.
Lee Raymond,"It is the potential for economic growth that provides the basis for the development of countries, for bringing to people essential goods and services, such as water to drink and facilities for healthcare."
Lee Raymond,"There is hardly an activity that a person can think about that does not intrinsically involve energy, most of which is currently provided by fossil fuels."
Lee Raymond,"We obviously want to produce things that people want. We are going to continue to do that in an environmentally responsible way, while still being aware of the physical, scientific, and practical issues that we have to deal with."
Lee Raymond,"We have seen that in this country in the last few years, particularly on Wall Street, with the rise of the old human frailty of greed. This occurs when people begin to serve only their own needs to the detriment of everyone else."
Lee Raymond,"The market system requires that people be committed and willing to work hard. Inherent with that is what I call a merit system, which I think gives people the greatest opportunity."
Lee Raymond,I find it interesting that many of the people who want to restrict fossil fuels live in well-developed countries where abundant and affordable energy is readily available.
Lee Raymond,We should seek a system that provides outlets for those skills and talents so that everyone can find a way to work and serve in a manner that best suits the strengths of each individual.
Lee Raymond,The main professional responsibility of a person in business is business.
Lee Raymond,Ethical conduct is something that becomes inherent in an organization over a long period of time.
Lee Raymond,There is no system that is inherently moral if the participants themselves are not.
Lee Raymond,"Oil prices have remained above first-quarter levels and natural gas prices in North America have also improved, ... Early in the quarter, we have seen some recovery in most refining and marketing margins, although they remain at low levels, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region."
Usher Raymond,"I've been working so hard, I'm about to have a Mariah Carey."
Usher Raymond,Strivers achieve what dreamers believe.
Usher Raymond,Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you're going out. Have your girlfriend clip your nails or something like that.
Marlo Raynolds,We don't need to have a gold-rush mentality to these resources.
Marlo Raynolds,"As oil prices have gone up, you get this increased desire to get out onto the new frontiers of oil. We're now getting into the dirtiest sources of oil anywhere."
Marlo Raynolds,The pace of development is outstripping our ability to manage the environmental issue. Our unwritten energy policy is dig it up and sell it as fast as possible.
Ed Razek,"Some are saying that the show is not running because of the Super Bowl incident, but that's not really the case. Clearly, we could've gotten the show on air if we wanted to."
Ed Razek,"It's fashion, and we just can't always use the same way to promote the brand."
Ed Razek,"It's huge news for the web, huge news for the computer, huge news for the Information Age."
Charles Reade,"The absent are like children, helpless to defend themselves."
Charles Reade,Sow an act and you reap a habit. Sow a habit and you reap a character. Sow a character and you reap a destiny.
Charles Reade,Make 'em laugh; make 'em cry; make 'em wait.
Charles Reade,"Not a day passes over the earth, but men and women of no note do great deeds, speak great words and suffer noble sorrows."
Charles Reade,"The joys we expect are not so bright, nor the troubles so dark as we fancy they will be."
Charles Reade,Judicious absence is a weapon.
Ronald Reagan,"Today we have done what we had to do. If necessary, we shall do it again."
Ronald Reagan,It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history.... [It is] the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
Ronald Reagan,"We don't have an option of living with inflation and its attendant tragedy. We have an alternative, and that is the program for economic recovery. True, it'll take time for the favorable effects of our program to be felt. So, we must begin now. The people are watching and waiting. They don't demand miracles. They do expect us to act. Let us act together."
Ronald Reagan,Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things. It is the continuous revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding that allows to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions.
Ronald Reagan,We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough; we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.
Ronald Reagan,The size of the federal budget is not an appropriate barometer of social conscience or charitable concern.
Ronald Reagan,"We need you, we need your youth, your strength, and your idealism, to help us make right what is wrong."
Ronald Reagan,"[The truth, of course, is that Kerry, relying on the notion that voters hold a negative view of the Bush-Cheney status quo, fills the traditional role of the] gloom and doom ... better off today than they were four years ago."
Ronald Reagan,"Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! (Speech near the Berlin Wall, 1987)"
Ronald Reagan,"I made a speech by that title [A Time for Choosing] in 1964. I said, We've been told increasingly that we must choose between left or right. But we're still using those terms -- left or right. And I'll repeat what I said then in '64. There is no left or right. There's only an up or down: up to the ultimate in individual freedom, consistent with an orderly society -- or down to the totalitarianism of the ant heap. And those today who, however good their intentions, tell us that we should trade freedom for security are on that downward path."
Ronald Reagan,Draft registration destroys the very values that our society is committed to defending.
Ronald Reagan,"Governments tend not to solve problems, only rearrange them"
Ronald Reagan,An economist is someone who sees something that works in practice and wonders if it would work in theory.

Ronald Reagan,"General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"
Ronald Reagan,"The poet called Miss Liberty's torch 'the lamp beside the golden door.' Well, that was the entrance to America, and it still is. And now you really know why we're here tonight. The glistening hope of that lamp is still ours. Every promise, every opportunity, is still golden in this land. And through that golden door our children can walk into tomorrow with the knowledge that no one can be denied the promise that is America. Her heart is full; her torch is still golden, her future bright. She has arms big enough to comfort and strong enough to support, for the strength in her arms is the strength of her people. She will carry on in the '80s unafraid, unashamed, and unsurpassed. In this springtime of hope, some lights seem eternal; America's is."
Ronald Reagan,"I, in my own mind, have always thought of America as a place in the divine scheme of things that was set aside as a promised land. It was set here and the price of admission was very simple: the means of selection was very simple as to how this land should be populated. Any place in the world and any person from those places; any person with the courage, with the desire to tear up their roots, to strive for freedom, to attempt and dare to live in a strange and foreign place, to travel halfway across the world was welcome here."
Ronald Reagan,"I hope the people on Wall Street will pay attention to the people on Main Street. If they do, they will see there is a rising tide of confidence in the future of America."
Ronald Reagan,"The years ahead will be great ones for our country, for the cause of freedom and the spread of civilization. The West will not contain Communism; it will transcend Communism. We will not bother to denounce it, we'll dismiss it as a sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written."
Ronald Reagan,"The Democrats say that the United States has had its days in the sun, that our nation has passed its zenith. My fellow citizens, I utterly reject that view."
Ronald Reagan,"You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did all that could be done."
Ronald Reagan,"If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think what's at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy mankind has known in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. There can be no security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and economic stability within the United States. Those who ask us to trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state are architects of a policy of accommodation."
Ronald Reagan,No arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.
Ronald Reagan,Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom.
Ronald Reagan,"We've done our part. And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution, the men and women across America who for 8 years did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all. (Farewell Address to the Nation, January 20th, 1989)"
Ronald Reagan,in respect for his memory.

Ronald Reagan,"I am very proud to be called a pig. It stands for pride, integrity and guts."
Ronald Reagan,My years in your service will always be very special to me. The inspiration you have given me will burn brightly in my heart long after I have left the lights of the White House behind.
Ronald Reagan,"No one who lived through the Great Depression can ever look upon an unemployed person with anything but compassion. To me, there is no greater tragedy than a breadwinner willing to work, with a job skill but unable to find a market for that job skill. Back in those dark depression days I saw my father on a Christmas eve open what he thought was a Christmas greeting from his boss. Instead, it was the blue slip telling him he no longer had a job. The memory of him sitting there holding that slip of paper and then saying in a half whisper, 'That's quite a Christmas present,' it will stay with me as long as I live."
Ronald Reagan,"There are no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits to the human capacity for intelligence, imagination, and wonder."
Ronald Reagan,"No, I'm just a man committed to great ideas."
Ronald Reagan,A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.
Ronald Reagan,Let us ask ourselves; ''What kind of people do we think we are?''
Ronald Reagan,"He will be remembered not only as a pioneer in his time, but as a dominant figure in world history,"
Ronald Reagan,"Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"
Ronald Reagan,"Our friends in the other party will never forgive us for our success, and are doing everything in their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression, filled with suffering and despair. I don't know about you, but I'm getting awfully tired of the whining voices from the White House these days. They're claiming there was a decade of greed and neglect, but you and I know better than that. We were there."
Ronald Reagan,"Admittedly, there is a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson in history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face."
Ronald Reagan,"Whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears."
Ronald Reagan,"History shows that when the taxes of a nation approach about 20% of the people's income, there begins to be a lack of respect for government. . . . When it reaches 25%, there comes an increase in lawlessness."
Ronald Reagan,"We relax at the ranch, which if not heaven itself, probably has the same zip code."
Ronald Reagan,"[Unlike Bush, Reagan did his White House radio broadcasts live, a habit that got him into trouble in 1984, when he made a now-infamous joke during a sound check into an open microphone.] My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever, ... We begin bombing in five minutes."
Ronald Reagan,"The more government takes in taxes, the less incentive people have to work. What coal miner or assembly-line worker jumps at the offer of overtime when he knows Uncle Sam is going to take 60 percent or more of his extra pay?"
Ronald Reagan,The most terrifying words in the English langauge are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
Ronald Reagan,We must not look to government to solve our problems. Government is the problem.
Ronald Reagan,We seek a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer. God should never have been expelled from America's classrooms in the first place.
Ronald Reagan,Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply.Speak kindly. Leave the rest to God.
Ronald Reagan,The future doesn't belong to the faint-hearted; it belongs to the brave
Ronald Reagan,The trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.
Ronald Reagan,I oppose registration for the draft . . . because I believe the security of freedom can best be achieved by security through freedom.
Ronald Reagan,Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction
Ronald Reagan,"They have answered the stirrings of liberty with brute force, killings, mass arrests, and the setting up of concentration camps."
Ronald Reagan,"You know, if I listened to him [Michael Dukakis] long enough, I would be convinced we're in an economic downturn and people are homeless and going without food and medical attention and that we've got to do something about the unemployed."
Ronald Reagan,"It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms intended for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, We base all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government. This idea that government was beholden to the people, that it had no other source of power, is still the newest, most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. (October 27, 1964)"
Ronald Reagan,I was raised to believe that God has a plan for everyone and that seemingly random twists of fate are all a part of His plan.
Ronald Reagan,"Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making yourself aware, and then conveying that information to family and friends? Will you resist the temptation to get a government handout for your community? Realize that the doctor's fight against socialized medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without socializing the patients. Recognize that government invasion of public power is eventually an assault upon your own business. If some among you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of reprisals from customers, clients, or even government, recognize that you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last. (October 27, 1964)"

If you don't agree, if you don't think this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have."

Ronald Reagan,"We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars: It is better to be here [in Europe] ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost.

Ronald Reagan,"Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a part of American history."
Ronald Reagan,I believe with all my heart that standing up for America means standing up for the God who has so blessed our land. We need God's help to guide our nation through stormy seas. But we can't expect Him to protect America in a crisis if we just leave Him over on the shelf in our day-to-day living.

Mark Recchi,You don't want to let these guys down in the dressing room. You want to show them you're worth whatever they gave up and help this team do whatever it takes to get to that next level.
Mark Recchi,"We all care about one thing and that's trying to win. I was in the same situation in Philly and there are always enough pucks, guys are playing their roles ... and they're going to be happy with whatever they get."

Mark Recchi,"I don't think they had 10 even-strength, 5-on-5 quality chances."
Mark Recchi,"They brought in some good people that are more interested in the winning aspect of the game. Obviously, everybody wants to play, but they're going to do whatever it takes."
Mark Recchi,"Pittsburgh has been down for the past couple years, but we'd like to get back in it. Philly has been tremendous and we want to get to that level. It's exciting for the fans when you see each other more times per year. We hope to build more rivalries."
Mark Recchi,"One of the things we haven't done very well this year is learning from our mistakes. Everybody makes them, but you have to learn from them. That's what we did in our last two games, learned from what we'd been doing wrong and it paid off."
Mark Recchi,"It doesn't seem to have hurt him, has it? It's pretty amazing, what he's done. He's obviously a terrific, terrific player."
Mark Recchi,"We had an opportunity to win the hockey game in the third period and allowed two goals right in the slot. Good road teams don't let that happen. We have to get better at a lot of things right now and we will, but that's one thing we have to get stronger at."
Mark Recchi,"I thought we were turning the corner. We had a good stretch of games, and we've taken a little step backwards now. We have to find a way to get back again."
Mark Recchi,Staal is one of the premier young players in this league. It's fun working with him.
Mark Recchi,He's going to be all right. He's pretty smooth out there. It's fun to watch him. His first couple of steps are incredible.
Mark Recchi,I think it's going to be great for the game. It's really going to be a fun thing.
Mark Recchi,"It might be a fear. You don't want to get embarrassed, especially at home. It's just something where the first one went in and we seemed to get a little life."
Mark Recchi,"It's been a new experience. I can't stand the music in the dressing room any more, so I know I'm getting old."
Mark Recchi,"We have to play better. We're at home. We should have a lot more energy. There was no enthusiasm, there was no excitement to play."
Mark Recchi,"You hate to say it, but the kid really reminds you of Mario at that age. He's big, can skate, can shoot and looks like he has something of an edge."
Mark Recchi,"When you get goaltending like that, you have to take advantage of it."
Michael Redd,"You want to go out there and lead your team to victory, and that's what it's all about, whether it be assists or making plays for others or scoring, rebounding."

Michael Redd,"That's a shot that all NBA players love to have, that last second shot,"
Michael Redd,"We knew we would get our exercise in this game. Phoenix consistently pushes it and we just got outran. We could have won this game if we could have gotten down to eight or nine in the fourth, but they did a great job with (using) the three as a dagger."
Michael Redd,"We had no execution in the fourth and that really hurt us. That's a championship team, and they played like it."
Michael Redd,We're going home now and hopefully that will help. It's a different environment. This (The Palace) is a tough place to play. Hopefully we can get home and we will be able to ante-up for Game 3.
Michael Redd,"It's my heart's desire,"
Michael Redd,"I'm just playing basketball, man. I trust the referees to make the right calls. I don't need to cry about it or nothing. That's part of playoff basketball."

Helen Reddy,"In the '50s, a lot of girls never saw beyond the wedding day."
Orville Redenbacher,"We made more money feeding molasses, urea, and corn cobs to cattle than we ever did feeding dent corn."
Orville Redenbacher,"The quality sold in the amusement business did not measure up, and that is how we got into the package business with our superior product."
Orville Redenbacher,"It was necessary to have an even depth of corn on the top compared to the sides, so the air would not take the easiest route and not evenly dry the stored corn."
Orville Redenbacher,"We dried continuously day and night. We had no efficient way to do it, so we built this new popcorn plant."
Orville Redenbacher,The cobs were delivered to a big pile. We were one of the first to feed corn cobs to cattle.
Orville Redenbacher,We got to know the competition very well. In the '50s popcorn made a big growth in sales. Our main push was to produce the best quality and sell in quality retail outlets.

Robert Redford,"You have to go someplace and get in touch with it. You can't put those kinds of words on the screen without some kind of reference. It would be impossible. It wouldn't make any sense. I know that territory, by association, not necessarily personal experience, but by association."
Robert Redford,"We were at 10,000 feet in Utah and I was running out of gas. I was in boots that were leather-soled. The bear was closing in. Now, he's supposed to be playing. Once I started to run, he got really excited. Pretty soon he was chasing me. And I said if this guy gets me, his idea of play is going to be the end of me. So I threw the rifle out and got on that tree so fast. Now, once it was done, I mean, I was sweating bullets. I said, not again. Not again."
Robert Redford,"Never revisit the past, that's dangerous. You know, move on."
Robert Redford,"Weve poisoned the air, the water, and the land.In our passion to control nature,things have gone out of control.Progress from now on has to mean something different.Were running out of resources andwe are running out of time"

Robert Redford,"Filmgoers are starved for new ideas, voices and visions,"

Robert Redford,"We do not own this place, we are just passengers"
Robert Redford,Where else would I bury my family?
Robert Redford,We don't program (the festival) for commerciality. We program for diversity.
Robert Redford,I didn't think about that because I didn't have to. We were in Canada in a very remote place and we were working there as actors. She was just Jennifer.
Robert Redford,"We could create something that was criticized in the beginning as bound to fail because it wasn't commercial. And it has worked, and I'm happy with it."
Robert Redford,This was made before 'Million Dollar Baby'... but this was put on the shelf for so long.
Robert Redford,"People have been so busy relating to how I look, it's a miracle I didn't become a self-conscious blob of protoplasm."
Robert Redford,I think the environment should be put in the category of our national security. Defense of our resources is just as important as defense abroad. Otherwise what is there to defend?
Viviane Reding,Who in this room is in favor of child pornography on the new media? Who stands for the freedom to spread incitement to racial hatred on the new media?
Viviane Reding,"Europe must create a commercial environment that encourages more rapid innovation and take up of research results. The public sector has massive buying power, but it needs the right incentives to share the risks as well as the benefits of investing in new technologies and services."
Viviane Reding,"I am sure we will find a solution in interests of the internet, ... We think we could have an agreement on what's on the table."

Harry Redknapp,I had to throw a team together at Christmas.
Harry Redknapp,I think there's a bit of belief there now. We've given ourselves a real chance.
Harry Redknapp,I would give anything to be able to put it to bed. It takes your life over but I'm only looking forward to the end of the season if we can pull it off because it would be a fantastic escape.
Harry Redknapp,If we had won today we could have almost put it to bed because it would have shattered the other teams. We've got to pick ourselves up again.
Harry Redknapp,Gregory has not been in my plans and the club have come to a mutual agreement for his departure.

Sumner Redstone,"Viacom turned in an outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2002, particularly in light of the continuing challenges of a slow recovery in the overall economic environment,"
Sumner Redstone,"Viacom is off to a strong start in 2000, paced by the continued outstanding performance of MTV Network, which turned in its fifth consecutive quarter of 20 percent-plus ad sales growth, and Showtime, which registered a 25 percent gain in (cash flow) for the first three months of the year,"
Sumner Redstone,"Let me say it remains our intention to split off Blockbuster from Viacom sometime after the first of the year, ... Having said that, we will not give it away."
Sumner Redstone,"The Chinese government is more skeptical about American media companies, but I have been going to China for eight years and I don't think it will affect Viacom. In China, it is always two steps forward and one step back."
Sumner Redstone,"Consolidation was a necessary and positive trend in the evolution of these businesses,"
Sumner Redstone,Consolidation was a necessary and positive trend in the evolution of these businesses. But we have entered a new era of rapid technological change and global competition. Bulk will not ensure success.
Sumner Redstone,Sometimes divorce is better than marriage.

Randy Reed,"When you get to this level, people look to get an edge on you. When that doesn't work, they end up getting on edge."

Randy Reed,We needed a customized system that would meet our needs and integrate with our customer service management system.
Randy Reed,Our defensive intensity was spectacular around the perimeter. We're in the elite eight now and we're playing some good basketball against some good teams.
Randy Reed,"In basketball, there are always runs and streaks. A team is going to play harder in the fourth when they are down. I know I would want my team to do that. Luckily, we've been able to sustain our leads and come out with the win."
Richard Reed,"We were talking about (Steel), and it just came together at the hospital. She ended up going into labor right before the Cincinnati-Pittsburgh game so we thought the whole thing was fortuitous, so that clinched the deal."
Richard Reed,"When you leave, you are sad, ... When you get back, you have that joy that you are back on solid ground and you don't have to deal with all the craziness."

Scott Reed,"I'd watch for a rematch with these gentlemen--absolutely. If the loser goes out in a dignified manner, he'll be a shoo-in for his party's nomination in four years."
Scott Reed,"Clinton has quickly and methodically become a force to be reckoned with in the Senate. Like Lyndon Johnson before her, she is mastering the Senate to fit her agenda."

Scott Reed,"To begin with, you must realize that any idea accepted by the brain is automatically transformed into an action of some sort. It may take seconds or minutes or longer -- but ideas always produce a reaction of some sort."

Della Reese,It's very seldom you get paid for doing what you love and telling the truth at the same time. It seems they don't often coincide.

Keanu Reeves,"When the people you love are gone, you're alone."
Keanu Reeves,When I don't feel free and can't do what I want I just react. I go against it.
Keanu Reeves,"The truth is often terrifying, which I think is one of the motifs of Larry and Andrew's cinema. The cost of knowledge is an important theme. In the second and third films, they explore the consequences of Neo's choice to know the truth. It's a beautiful, beautiful story."
Keanu Reeves,The simple act of paying attention can take you a long way.
Keanu Reeves,Sometimes when you make a film you can go away for three months and then come back and live your life. But this struck a much deeper chord. I don't have the ability yet to speak about it in an objective.
Keanu Reeves,"Kissing someone is pretty intimate, actually very intimate, and your heart always kind of skips a beat before you do that."

Keanu Reeves,"I mean, if you didn't get it or if you didn't feel like you enjoyed it, sometimes that experience can change."

Keanu Reeves,"Because we're actors we can pretend and fake it, but I'd rather the intimate investment was authentic."

Brian Regan,"You see weird things driving... I've never understood log trucks, sometimes you'll be out on the highway, you see two big giant trucks loaded up with logs, and they pass eachother on the highway... I don't understand it. I mean, if they need logs over there... and they need 'em over there, you'd think a phone call would save 'em a whole lot of trouble."
Brian Regan,"I saw this sign posted once, it said, 'blasting zone ahead'. Wow... shouldn't that read: Road Closed. What do you mean there's a blasting zone, what am I supposed to do, 'Hey-- ah, you might wanna buckle up, blasting zone coming up. Yeah. Just saw the sign. Put the helmets on back there! Yeah I think we're-- (Pow!)-- Oh! We're getting close! (Pow!)-- Oh! This is gonna be a bad blasting zone! Remember that last one--we lost Billy?"

Mark Regev,"has expressed concerns about the situation to the government of Egypt, and we've been assured the current situation is temporary."
Mark Regev,The meeting was facilitated by the Turkish government and we appreciate their role.
Mark Regev,"The fear was that extremists would use porous borders to pour into Gaza to bring in explosives, weaponry cash, and that would energize the most extremist elements in the Gaza Strip instead of helping the moderates. I think this agreement that we have reached today has the right balance. It provides the maximum possible movement for Palestinians to move in and out of Gaza, as they desire and for goods to come in and out of Gaza, and at the same time for that to be balanced with the very real security concerns that everyone has."
Mark Regev,"We'd like to see the economy flourish,"

Mark Regev,"He called for the destruction of our country, of another UN member, and we don't believe the international community can let this stand. We've raised the issue with the secretary general and at the Security Council."
Mark Regev,"On one had, no one wants to see economic chaos [in the P.A.]. On the other hand no one wants to see [the aid] come back in the form of suicide bombers."
Mark Regev,We want to send a very clear and unequivocal message that after attacks like this it's not business as usual. We expect them to follow through on their promises -- that these armed gangs be disarmed. Our entire ability to move forward is based on that promise.
Mark Regev,Unfortunately this appears to be another example of the hijacking of the agenda of a professional body of the U.N..
Mark Regev,"If it acts outside international norms, if it acts outside accepted international behavior, then it can't be surprised if the international community starts to treat it like a pariah."
Mark Regev,"(Abbas) goes by the motto of 'one authority, one law, one security service'. But we don't see him putting this motto into use."
Mark Regev,"The whole agreement is to balance between security and movement. Hopefully, there will be conditions so we will not have to close it in the future. We would only do so if there is a specific security need."
Mark Regev,We had information to the effect that the whole [international monitoring] agreement was falling apart. The reason that we acted today the way we did was precisely not to allow these prisoners to be released and to scatter around the territories forcing us to do a much more comprehensive larger military operation to arrest them all.
Mark Regev,What makes these people dangerous is that their violent language is transformed into violent action.
Mark Regev,"As long as extremists have the ability to torpedo the process of reconciliation and to launch attacks, we will be at their mercy."
Otto Rehhagel,"When I arrived the players were talented, but did not obey the rules, ... Once they understood they needed to, they could then express themselves."
Otto Rehhagel,What happened here is that the Greek team wrote soccer history.

Robert Reich,"It turns out that the labor market is far more flexible than anyone assumed,"
Robert Reich,"This economy is still vigorous,"
Robert Reich,The most important community for an individual will not necessarily be a company but a looser community of people with similar skills and social connections. Continually building up those skills and connections is what a career is today.

Robert Reich,"A leader is someone who steps back from the entire system and tries to build a more collaborative, more innovative system that will work over the long term."
Steve Reich,"He was very good. He could sit at a desk and write this music and, unlike a lot of them who faked it, he could really hear it in his head."
Steve Reich,"In serial music, the series itself is seldom audible... What I'm interested in is a compositional process and a sounding music that are one in the same thing."
Steve Reich,"I discovered that the most interesting music of all was made by simply lining the loops in unison, and letting them slowly shift out of phase with other."
Andy Reid,We wanted to score a touchdown. That's what we were shooting for so we wouldn't have to worry about that other part. It didn't work out that way.

Andy Reid,"I think the players trust him,"
Andy Reid,"We have had success getting guys through here with this injury, ... I know it's magnified when it's your quarterback or a player of his magnitude. I understand how it becomes magnified, but we have a track record of being able to manage that injury, and we will see if we can't do the same. If he can't function at some point, we'll shut him down."
Andy Reid,It'll be a struggle for him to kick this week.
Andy Reid,"We'll see how it goes. Brian is our primary running back, but we will utilize (Gordon's) talents as we go. We'll give Lamar a chance to get acclimated, and we'll see how he progresses."
Andy Reid,"Once the groin becomes an issue, then the recovery is not going to take place and rest is not going to help it. It is just too much discomfort to where Donovan can't run and function."

Andy Reid,He's had two opinions and both said he needed the surgery.
Andy Reid,"You need some luck in there,"
Andy Reid,"We have veteran leaders who know what it takes to get there, and the young players listen to the veteran players. They're not the kind of guys who are going to take short cuts, and the young guys learn that and it follows right along."
Andy Reid,"We can do a better job there,"
Andy Reid,"I need to do a better job of putting my players in position to make plays on the offensive side of the ball. On the defensive side, I saw some good things."
Andy Reid,"There is a lot of room for improvement, but we also saw some good things,"
Andy Reid,I said that before the season. I think they have done a nice job in improvement.
Andy Reid,"We knew he was hurt, but it was not nearly as bad when he was playing as it was when he woke up (Tuesday) morning. It stiffened up on him. But he felt comfortable playing."

Andy Reid,"He's a great kid. He worked so hard in the off-season. He came back in phenomenal shape. We were looking forward to getting him back out there. He did some good things. For that to happen, your heart goes out to the guy."
Andy Reid,"He was not that bad after the game. [Monday] morning he was very tender. That's how this thing works. It flares up every now and again, and we just have to see how he does here. It's done that throughout his career and it's going to continue to do that. We just have to monitor it and see how he does."
Andy Reid,"He's had an MRI, a CT scan, and he did have an X-ray after the game. He has a bruised chest, and we just have to see how it works out in the next day or two."
Andy Reid,"I like his size and the way he runs the football. I thought he did a nice job of catching the football and I thought he was good in blitz pickup, recognizing people coming. Before he went to Miami, I thought he was a heck of a running back and he was in a numbers situation down there and his number was out. He is a good football player."
Andy Reid,We're not on vacation. We're down here to play a football game.
Andy Reid,In everything it's my responsibility. It's my football team. It's a reflection of me.
Andy Reid,It's unfortunate it happened. But it's no excuse.
Andy Reid,"You bank on what the doctors say, ... We're in touch with what is supposed to be the best [hamstring specialist] in the country. We're going to listen to him and see how David feels and go from there."

Andy Reid,So everybody has a lot of confidence he can kick a football and he does a nice job in practice.
Andy Reid,"The ability to run route after route after route, he can't do that."
Andy Reid,"He came in here and did a good job. He brings a lot of ability to the field, and he's an intense player."
Andy Reid,"Lamar is a big back with good speed and quickness. He also has the ability to catch the ball, which will help him in this offense. He's a talented, young running back who should be a good complement to the rest of the backs on this team. We're looking forward to getting him into Philadelphia and onto the practice field this week."
Andy Reid,"He has the ability to catch the ball, which will help him in this offense. He's a talented, young running back who should be a good complement to the rest of the backs on this team. We're look forward to getting him into Philadelphia and onto the practice field this week."

He's a talented, young running back who should be a good compliment to the rest of the backs on this team. We're look forward to getting him into Philadelphia and onto the practice field this week."
Andy Reid,"Besides his ability, another thing that impressed us was that he was the captain of the football team, which shows he was very well-respected by the coaches and players. We're excited to be bring in a person of that caliber."
Harry Reid,"The president offered comforting words tonight, but the victims of Hurricane Katrina don't need just words, they need a plan that will lead the way in recovery, rebuilding, and renewal."

Harry Reid,"We must find ways to get them the resources they need and bring them to safety,"
Harry Reid,"First, 2006 should be a significant year of transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqis taking more and more responsibility for their own security."
Harry Reid,We're almost there. We're not there. We still have some obstacles. The leader and I have spoken about them the last few hours. There's other pieces of legislation that may interfere. We have some amendments we have to vote on that are going to be hurtful to some people and not to others.
Harry Reid,oil companies need to make more money this year.
Harry Reid,"It is especially important to identify a consensus candidate to succeed Justice O'Connor, who has been a voice of reason and moderation."

Harry Reid,"We have spent two months - two months - dealing with basically five judges, all of whom have jobs."
Harry Reid,"It is no surprise that the Republican-controlled Senate intelligence committee has once again caved in to the wishes of the White House and refused even to open an investigation. We cannot effectively legislate on the NSA spying issue if we do not know the facts, and we will not know them if the Republican-controlled intelligence committee persists in refusing to do its job."
Harry Reid,"Leaking classified information to discredit White House critics, the vice president is behind that,"
Harry Reid,I'm not in the habit of patting the president on the back.
Harry Reid,"We offer a vision for a brighter American future, based on goals such as affordable health care for everyone, quality education, and environmental protection. We stand for a society that respects and celebrates diversity."

Harry Reid,"It's like running up your credit card bills today because a fortune-teller predicted you'd be rich in 10 years. When the bill comes due, you can't pay with a prediction."
Harry Reid,There are strong feelings on each side.
Harry Reid,"The failure of the White House to produce relevant documents is reason enough for any senator to oppose this nomination. The administration cannot treat the Senate with such disrespect without some consequences,"
Harry Reid,nominee with relevant non-judicial experience would bring a different and useful perspective to the court.
Harry Reid,"It is not enough to remove Mr. Brown from the disaster scene,"
Harry Reid,"I welcome that debate. One would have to search long and hard to find a bill, in my opinion, as bad as this."
Harry Reid,To try to limit debate on this most important matter that Senator Feingold is trying to put before the Senate is not appropriate.
Harry Reid,There's been adequate time for people to debate.
Harry Reid,There has been adequate time for people to debate. I hope this matter will be resolved without too much more talking.
Harry Reid,we can get to issues that are certainly more in the form of a crisis than a program that has enough money to have it in the form it's in for the next 50 years.
Harry Reid,"How much time did the president spend dealing with this emerging crisis while he was on vacation? Did the fact that he was outside of Washington, D.C., have any effect on the federal government's response?"
Harry Reid,"Social Security is not in crisis. It's a crisis the president's created, period."
Harry Reid,"Unfortunately, today's event only served to highlight the fact that the president refuses to engage in a frank conversation about the realities on the ground."
Harry Reid,"But there is nothing disrespectful about an open and fair-minded review of a nominee's approach to the Constitution and his commitment to core American values like equality, privacy and fairness,"
Harry Reid,"We're a government of laws, not men. It is not for George W. Bush to disregard the Constitution and decide that he is above the law."
Harry Reid,"As Congress finally begins to address this problem, I hope that you will stand up to the right wing of your party and stand up for what is right,"
Harry Reid,Congress has an immediate opportunity to pass legislation enabling both companies to keep pension plans for workers in place.
Harry Reid,"a champion for the underdog who was the same kind, gracious man no matter how far he rose in Congress and in life."
Harry Reid,We must protect this fragile compromise from those intent on gutting this bill.
Harry Reid,"We're demanding President Bush make a commitment to the American people that he will not pardon Scooter Libby, who was involved in this mess, nor will he pardon anyone involved in this mess,"
Harry Reid,"The president has made his choice, ... Now the Senate will do its job of deciding whether to confirm John Roberts to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court."
Harry Reid,America supports everything that we need to do with Katrina. I hope everyone understands this approximately $63 billion ... that's only a down payment. There's going to be lots more money.
Harry Reid,It is not enough to remove Mr. Brown from the disaster scene. Mr. Brown simply doesn't have the ability or the experience to oversee a coordinated federal response of this magnitude.
Mark Reid,"With two horses that weren't doing a whole lot before he got them, to win two Breeders' Cup races with them, I think it's one of the standout performances recently."
Mark Reid,"From a local government standpoint, the cost of services is the principal issue. On a statewide basis, 35-acre tracts generate more costs than revenue."
Mark Reid,"It's funny, you hear all these stories about he's doing this, he's doing that. You go in the barn, his horses look better than anybody's, they're standing on deeper bedding than anybody, they're getting better feed than anybody - he's second to none in care. He's a phenomenal natural horseman."
Mark Reid,"This is a perfect fit for our company, in order that we may better service our clients, ... Up to this point, we have concentrated on buying and selling in the private sector. With the addition of Walnut Green, we will now be able to handle the auction needs of our clients as well. We are very fortunate indeed to be involved with a company that boasts such a great tradition of honesty and integrity."
Mark Reid,"He said, 'Mark, he makes me feel like he's a college professor and I'm a kindergarten student,'  ... He said, 'He is the most intuitive horseman I've ever been around,' and that was high praise, because his father didn't give any praise. He's one of the best natural horsemen I ever met."
Marty Reid,We had a great season. I'm very proud of my kids. I wouldn't trade them for anyone.
Marty Reid,Camas is a really good team. Our kids played tremendous. They played so hard. I'm really proud of them. They're a great group to coach.
Marty Reid,"This time of year, you've gotta make those. (R.A. Long) was very solid at the free-throw line. Home-court advantage changed the issue this year for district. It is right to reward teams for finishing first or second, and I take nothing away from them. They earned it."
Marty Reid,"If you're going to win close ball games, you have to be good at the free-throw line. We stress that in practice, and the kids have responded."
Marty Reid,I might be working with someone on a research question and the cell phone would ring. They'd begin a conversation as if I wasn't standing there helping them.
Theodor Reik,"Even the wisest men make fools of themselves about women, and even the most foolish women are wise about men."
Theodor Reik,"The repressed memory is like a noisy intruder being thrown out of the concert hall. You can throw him out, but he will bang on the door and continue to disturb the concert. The analyst opens the door and says, 'If you promise to behave yourself, you can come back in."
Theodor Reik,"He [Freud] often said three things were impossible to fulfill completely; healing, education, governing. He limited his goals in analytic treatment to brining the patient to the point where he could work for a living and learn to love."
Theodor Reik,Women in general want to be loved for what they are and men for what they accomplish.
Theodor Reik,"The repressed memory is like a noisy intruder being thrown out of the concert hall. You can throw him out, but he will bang on the door and continue to disturb the concert. The analyst opens the door and says, If you promise to behave yourself, you can come back in."
Theodor Reik,Love is an attempt to change a piece of a dream world into reality.
Theodor Reik,Work and love; these are the basics. Without them there is neurosis.
Theodor Reik,"Nothing said to us, nothing we can learn from others, reaches us so deep as that which we find in ourselves."
Theodor Reik,"In our civilization, men are afraid that they will not be men enough and women are afraid that they might be considered only women."
Theodor Reik,The man who has never made a fool of himself in love will never be wise in love.
Theodor Reik,Great innovators and original thinkers and artists attract the wrath of mediocrities as lightning rods draw the flashes.
Theodor Reik,The lover is a monotheist who knows that other people worship different gods but cannot himself imagine that there could be other gods.
Kevin Reilly,NBC Universal is pleased to sponsor this event. We believe it's important to support non-traditional forums like the New York Television Festival in their efforts to cultivate the next generation of innovative storytellers.
Kevin Reilly,"Although this show was against mostly repeats in December, the strength it showed across the week and the build that it showed within each episode was indicative of a genuine appetite for the show."
Kevin Reilly,"There was some skepticism: 'Oh, this show is funny, but does it fit on NBC?' ... Earl has done what I hoped it would do, and that's rare."
Kevin Reilly,"Given the environment that I'm in right now, I can't imagine more support than I'm getting from NBC and from GE,"
Kevin Reilly,"[The continued woe of comedies.] I cannot believe that the country does not want to laugh, ... My Name is Earl."
Kevin Reilly,"We're struggling on the comedy side. Everybody is, ... I cannot believe that the country does not want to laugh at this time, with the news only going from bad to worse."
Kevin Reilly,"It's the comedy conundrum right now. You hear from the audience that they want something more than 'stupid' sitcoms. The young audience wants different form-breakers, but it's hard to get a mass-appeal show that breaks the form too much."
Kevin Reilly,"This project is a noisy, compelling combination of bold drama and laugh-out-loud comedy,"
Kevin Reilly,"It's been a struggle to find that next evolution of comedy. Earl was our highest-testing show in 15 years, which was kind of a surprise. But we definitely need cutting-edge comedies like that."
Kevin Reilly,The four-comedy block plays to the history of the night.
Kevin Reilly,The idea is to help people make life choices. The award from the Big Lottery Fund will allow us to continue and expand on these services and training packages.
Kevin Reilly,"This year will kick off with Joey finally making it in Hollywood. The same character now has lots of people looking at him, the spotlight on him. He's now not the worst client of Jennifer Coolidge. He's the best."
Kevin Reilly,"We came out of last year believing in our charismatic lead and seeing real evidence that an audience was sticking with the show. We think with some creative adjustments, stability is going to pay off in this time period."
Kevin Reilly,These three shows have A+ creative auspices and some of the most loyal audiences on television. I'm thrilled that we can count on them again next season.
Kevin Reilly,It just doesn't make sense. The feeling is that America needs to laugh now more than ever.
Kevin Reilly,"Look, we knew there was going to be a fallout because advertisers take a cautious approach to risky shows. We've been through it before. Our competitors have been through it. If the show performs, we find that people get comfortable and advertisers come back."
Kevin Reilly,"It's been tough sledding on the advertising front, and it's something that we anticipated going in and would be willing to weather if the audience in fact embraced the show."
Kevin Reilly,"It's an interesting phenomenon now, that some of these shows that stay off the air, kind of absence makes the heart grow a little fonder when they come back on. So we're committed to it by leaving the hour on there to really continue to see it build on itself."
Tom Reilly,"Todays ruling merely says this case will be ripe only after President Bush makes a final ruling on base closures. When he does, well be ready to continue if that is whats best for Otis, Barnes, the hard-working men and women who make them run and Massachusetts as a whole,"
Tom Reilly,"People ... deserve to know how we earn a living, where our money comes from and what financial interests we have."
Tom Reilly,"They changed the language from 'closure' to 'realignment,' and the bottom line here is rather than being closed, Otis will remain open,"
Tom Reilly,They've always been a top organization for golf. Now they want to make this one of their flagship facilities and they're willing to do what they can to upgrade.
Tom Reilly,"The laws in existence at the time these events occurred do not permit us to initiate criminal charges,"
Tom Reilly,"It's hard to believe the (Justice Department) would enter into an agreement like this, ... But apparently they have."
Carl Reiner,Everybody wants to laugh - you know that. They need to laugh... People need to laugh.
Carl Reiner,"I think that comedy really tells you how it is. The other thing about comedy is that - you don't even know if you're failing in drama, but you do know when you're failing in comedy. When you go to a comedy and you don't hear anybody laughing, you know that you've failed."
Carl Reiner,I'm a charming coward; I fight with words.
Carl Reiner,[The first line in his book is this:] My mother didn't try to stab my father until I was six. ... You're entitled to be a lot crazier than you are.
Carl Reiner,"In the funeral home, I never heard laughter like that in my life. The audience was laughing on the screen, and we were laughing in the home."
Carl Reiner,A lot of people like snow. I find it to be an unnecessary freezing of water.
Ad Reinhardt,Only a bad artist thinks he has a good idea. A good artist does not need anything.
Ad Reinhardt,"Now almost every artist outside of New York is connected with some school or some museum school, and even in New York the majority are. That's an interesting fact when you take the idea of making money, making a living selling paintings. Only a dozen or two painters do that."
Ad Reinhardt,"If some student came up and wanted to know where to study painting, you'd want to suggest someplace, but there's no place. I wouldn't know where to send a student to study."
Ad Reinhardt,I was drafted in '45 and I was a sailor for a year. They didn't know what to do with me so they made a sort of photographer out of me.
Ad Reinhardt,I tried to oppose the academic to the marketplace.
Ad Reinhardt,"I taught a lot of art history, especially Chinese, Japanese, and Indian. But the painting classes came back. The nudes came back. Not so much the still lifes. So now our department is the worst department, partly because it has the worst facilities."
Ad Reinhardt,Art is Art. Everything else is everything else.
Ad Reinhardt,"I got out of Columbia and then into the American Abstract Artist group, which had almost all the abstract artists in the coutry in it, about 40 or 50."
Ad Reinhardt,"The job at Brooklyn is interesting because Brooklyn reflects what happened to university art departments everywhere. It might be the worst department now, and yet at one point it was the best in the country."
Jerry Reinsdorf,"Ozzie is the Hispanic Jackie Mason. If you look at him in that light, you don't worry about anything he says."
Jerry Reinsdorf,"Like I said, Dennis has been of great value to our team."
Jerry Reinsdorf,"I think what Kenny was trying to say was that Boras has some grand ideas about what his players should be making, and it's going to drag out a long time. And we're not going to sit around and wait."
Jerry Reinsdorf,We didn't have a curse to deal with. We just had failure to deal with.
Jerry Reinsdorf,My wife design the rings. I would say I like them anyway.
Paul Reiser,"Bob, the guy who did 'Big Fat Greek Wedding,' immediately saw what everybody else chose to not see. This is not a little art film. Bob said, 'This is a big commercial hit.' He realized there's something about the movie that really works. It can play everywhere. It's odd when you see the things that are most personal can end up becoming the most universal."
Paul Reiser,"Any issues my parents went through are very prominent in the movie, even though they enjoyed a happy relationship, ... The story actually started for me when my mom told me a few years ago that because she got a job, she never made it to the World's Fair in New York, and that's a missed opportunity that always stayed with her."
Paul Reiser,"I was visiting my parents, and I walked into a room where my father was watching a Peter Falk movie on TV, ... I think it was 'The Cheap Detective.' Anyway, my father was belly-laughing, and he never really did that. I thought, 'If Peter Falk can make my dad laugh, then I'm going to come up with a movie in which Peter Falk plays my father.'"
Paul Reiser,"Over the years, there certainly have been plenty of ideas that I've had and given up on, but for this one, the only thing that was standing in its way was me doing it -- I just had to write it, ... And then if it didn't happen, it didn't happen. But I didn't want it to be for lack of effort on my part, so I had hunch that it would be a good story and that we would work well together. And it certainly worked out that way."
Paul Reiser,"It is really everybody's family,"
Paul Reiser,"I always loved comedy, but I never knew it was something you could learn to do. I always thought that some people are born comedians ... just like some people are born dentists."
Paul Reiser,"I'm feeling very vindicated that, when I see the audiences laughing and being moved, we were right. This movie was worth making,"
Paul Reiser,"We made this movie for $17, and nobody got anything. So it never dawned on me that we would get real people."
Paul Reiser,"We have such a long, familiar history with Peter Falk. The minute his mug is on that screen people smile."
Paul Reiser,"We had the boy's name picked out, but we didn't have a girl's. When he turned out to be a boy, we were so relieved. Literally, in the middle of contracting and pushing, and with my wife being drugged - out and half - lucid, we were still coming up with names."
Paul Reiser,Upstate New York in the middle of October. You can't get more beautiful than that.
Paul Reiser,"They're not the sharpest people - babies. So, you must be everything to them."
Paul Reiser,"There's something that happens in that delivery room, when a woman becomes ten times more a woman, and a guy becomes six times less a man. You feel really dopey and useless and like a spectator. I did, anyway."
Paul Reiser,The biggest thing I remember is that there was just no transition. You hit the ground diapering.
Paul Reiser,She kind of reminds one of Helen. There's something very similar about Elizabeth Perkins.
Paul Reiser,Nothing would make me happier if Peter Falk would finally win his Oscar for this. Not just as the writer but as a fan and a friend. It would be so great.
Paul Reiser,"Not only do I sing to him, I sing entire conversations. You become Jerry Lewis."
Paul Reiser,It's not like some movies where you're following a bunch of different stories you can cut around. There was nowhere to cut to. It's these guys. We're not cutting back to anybody else.
Paul Reiser,It was funny to write for Peter Falk.
Paul Reiser,In the original draft I was 27 and Peter was 55 in the script. That's not the same as a guy in his 40s and a dad in the end of his 70s. It's a different point in both our lives.
Paul Reiser,"In fact, I had the idea because of Peter Falk. I saw my dad watching a Peter Falk movie and something clicked in my head. I gotta go make a movie for Peter Falk and me."
Paul Reiser,I'd never directed before and this movie's too important to me to put in the hands of some guy who has never directed. Even if it's me.
Paul Reiser,I'd distract myself until finally it was a combination of things. The show was over and I had time on my hands. I had taken time and played and just relaxed.
Paul Reiser,He was born early. But he was born within a safe range of premature.
Paul Reiser,"Having a baby dragged me, kicking and screaming, from the world of self-absorption."
Paul Reiser,"Guys need a little help in knowing how to care for a kid. It's not that I think: Gee, parenting is beneath me. It's just that I wouldn't think of it."
Paul Reiser,"Field of Dreams is the only movie - and I saw it in the theater - on an afternoon when I was on location somewhere, and there were like 12 people in the theater. I was just so devastated; I couldn't get out of my seat. And I sat and watched it a second time."
Paul Reiser,Every time I see Peter Falk in the movie I think that would be great. We'd be fun together.
Paul Reiser,"But you get past that and realize you have to let go of what you think you want. There'll be plenty of time for that later. Right now, go and be with that baby. Just play with this beautiful little boy."
Paul Reiser,"But the two of them together, broke my heart. Olympia and Peter, those scenes... When they're kissing in their 20s and then kissing in their 70s, that's what it is. And they had never met five minutes before they shot those scenes."
Paul Reiser,"But I really felt that, something about the lights going down, and the sense of community. I saw this movie at one festival, and there were 1700 people."
Paul Reiser,"But at the same time that the experience is pulling you apart, it's also bonding you. You have this joint venture! You both made this baby. And that's the thing I still can't get over."
Paul Reiser,"And in that time, I lost my dad and had kids of my own. It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently."
Paul Reiser,"And after you've done the acting, there's a lot of places you can put your input - in the editing, in the production of it, in the rewriting of it and so on."
Paul Reiser,This is not the most right I've ever been.
Mitchell Reiss,"It's up to Kim Jong Il to make that decision, and we can't make that for him."
Mitchell Reiss,Everyone I have spoken with so far recognises the need for the IRA to respond positively and every has said sooner is better than later and I think there is some concern if it does continue to delay much longer that the situation isn't going to remain the same.
Mitchell Reiss,"Then the final thing is enforcement. What happens when we actually catch somebody who has violated international law, rules, and regulations?"
Mitchell Reiss,"They would rather the United States play the bad cop, and they could play the good cop - let the United States do all the heavy lifting here."
Mitchell Reiss,The Nuclear Suppliers Group is one area the president highlighted in his speech that's extremely important and that needs to be improved.
Mitchell Reiss,"We have a model that we're following, and it's the Libya model."
Mitchell Reiss,"You have to play the cards you are dealt and if it has made it harder, it doesn't matter, you still have to get the deal done."
Mitchell Reiss,"There is a different future that is available to North Korea, if they choose differently."
Mitchell Reiss,You are either going forward or you are not.
Mitchell Reiss,"We are hopeful that the North Koreans can show a little bit more realism, a little bit more flexibility."
Mitchell Reiss,"But with lots of good ideas, implementation is the key, and so we need to keep our eye on the ball as we go forward and make sure that people honor their pledges in terms of financial commitments, and that we actually use this money so that it makes a real difference."
Mitchell Reiss,"The format's better because it gives us a much stronger hand to play when going to the North Koreans unified, with our allies and partners in the region, all of us saying the same thing: telling them their current course is unacceptable."
Mitchell Reiss,The other countries did not share the same concern the United States had in the early '90's - that North Korea actually had an ongoing nuclear weapons program.
Mitchell Reiss,"First of all, I think the situation today is different. We're in a different place than we were in '93, '94."
Mitchell Reiss,So the president set out the policy guidance and said it had to take place in a multilateral fashion so that other countries in the region could be invested in the success of this process.
Mitchell Reiss,Any agreement that you have isn't going to be based on North Korea's intentions or trust.
Mitchell Reiss,"Or perhaps they didn't share it at all, but they were happy that the United States wanted to go ahead and deal with North Korea, that was fine."
Mitchell Reiss,It's time for the IRA to go out of business.
Mitchell Reiss,"First of all we have to recognize that despite all the problems - and in some cases failures - that this regime has been much more successful, much more resilient, than people had anticipated."
Mitchell Reiss,"Sometimes we tend to focus more on the personalities and the conflicts, and it really caricatures the issues."
Mitchell Reiss,And so there has been a lot of diplomatic movement.
Mitchell Reiss,I'm not sure you can do anything quickly or easily with the North.
Mitchell Reiss,"We need to do a lot more thinking about how the regime is going to evolve, how the bad guys are going to adapt their tactics, and what measures we're going to need in order to go forward."
Mitchell Reiss,"Again, I think we have much greater diplomatic weight by having all of us sit on the same side of the table wanting the same thing, and putting it to the North Koreans."
Mitchell Reiss,"And it has to do with having no inventory or stockpiles on the shelf, but items arrive as you need to build your product. What that means is that it's much more difficult to actually find stockpiles of already built weapons."
Mitchell Reiss,"And I think they realize that the other five countries are lined up against them, because all five are opposed to North Korea having nuclear weapons."
Mitchell Reiss,"Now North Korea certainly is located in a different place geographically, but I think it faces the same type of strategic decision. Does it want a different future for its people?"
Mitchell Reiss,"So, in a sense, the verification piece is irrelevant to the format issue."
Mitchell Reiss,"What we can do is to explain as clearly as possible what the benefits would be of him going down one path, and what the potential consequences would be if he chooses another path."
Mitchell Reiss,And it's not surprising that there should be disagreement - it'd be a little surprising if there was complete consensus on any foreign policy issue.
Rembrandt Rembrandt,Painting is the grandchild of nature. It is related to God.
Rembrandt Rembrandt,"But his faith is a faith that to him is real, and it is a faith, in my judgement, that sustained him through the hard times in his life."
Rembrandt Rembrandt,"The deepest and most lifelike emotion has been expressed, and that's the reason they have taken so long to execute."
Ernest Renan,"God, if there is a God, take my soul, if I have a soul."
Ernest Renan,"Blessed are the blind, for they know not enough to ask why."
Ernest Renan,"To conceive the good, in fact, is not sufficient; it must be made to succeed among men. To accomplish this less pure paths must be followed."
Ernest Renan,Let us remember that sorrow alone is the creator of great things.
Ernest Renan,"In morals, truth is but little prized when it is a mere sentiment, and only attains its full value when realized in the world as fact."
Ernest Renan,"As a rule, all heroism is due to a lack of reflection, and thus it is necessary to maintain a mass of imbeciles. If they once understand themselves the ruling men will be lost."
Ernest Renan,I can die when I wish to: that is my elixir of life.
Ernest Renan,Our opinions become fixed at the point where we stop thinking.
Ernest Renan,"He whom God has touched will always be a being apart: he is, whatever he may do, a stranger among men; he is marked by a sign."
Ernest Renan,"When people complain of life, it is almost always because they have asked impossible things of it."
Ernest Renan,The liberty of the individual is a necessary postulate of human progress.
Ernest Renan,Man makes holy what he believes.
Ernest Renan,All the great things of humanity have been accomplished in the name of absolute principles.
Ernest Renan,No idea can succeed except at the expense of sacrifice; no one ever escapes without enduring strain from the struggle of life.
Ernest Renan,You may take great comfort from the fact that suffering inwardly for the sake of truth proves abundantly that one loves it and marks one out as being of the elect.
Ernest Renan,As soon as sacrifice becomes a duty and necessity to mankind. I see no limit to the horizon which opens before him.
Ernest Renan,The simplest schoolboy is now familiar with truths for which Archimedes would have sacrificed his life.
Ruth Rendell,unusual thing: a European thriller writer whose work holds up as literature.
Ruth Rendell,"If I do, the whole thing falls apart. It fails. The illusion is in my head."
Ruth Rendell,"I think about what kind of a background he had, what sort of childhood he had, how he grew up, what he does for a living, the way he wants to live,"
Ruth Rendell,"I've had two proposals since I've been a widow. I am a wonderful catch, you know. I have a lot of money."
Tom Renney,"The bottom line is, you've got to do it within the rules of the game, it's that simple. As we have in the past, we'll look at the video again with him and just see where he could have maybe done something different, if anything, and allow him to play himself through it."
Tom Renney,I don't think you ever hang that responsibility on a rookie. He's one of the ways by which we can get ourselves going.
Tom Renney,"We're a work in progress and we're scrambling and scratching and clawing to kind of be what we were so proud to be earlier. And we're close. We're getting there sort of in fits and starts. But it's a matter of settling down, calming down and believing in everything that we're capable of doing within our system and we'll be fine."
Tom Renney,"It's terrific, it's great for this group of players and for the organization that rolled the dice with this philosophy. There's a sense of accomplishment that we've secured a spot."
Tom Renney,We kind of rolled the dice on this philosophy.
Tom Renney,"In the nature of the game, things have a way of balancing out. We've got some pretty good shooters, we've got guys who can score in the shootouts. That's just the way it goes. I think we have to be real careful we don't analyze ourselves to a standstill."
Tom Renney,He inspires players to go above their abilities. We play off his leadership.
Tom Renney,Jaromir really cares about this kid. He's helped him with his language; he talks to him all the time in English.
Tom Renney,"Our intention is that every time we go on the ice we have a purpose, and there is a level of performance that is acceptable and one that isn't. Sometimes we help them understand what acceptable is. Today was no problem. They worked hard."
Tom Renney,"That was the one thing that really hurt us. It's about quick puck movement, support and speed."
Tom Renney,"It hurt us from that point of view. We had our practice all ready to go as we always do, but specifically for Pittsburgh."
Tom Renney,"You know, our power play really hurt us (by going 0-for-9 Wednesday) night, but other than that, I thought we played a pretty good game. Tonight, I thought we played a more complete game."
Tom Renney,"The most important thing to us is our mental health. In that respect, we are ready to go."
Tom Renney,"I hate to use the word practice, but if we want to become a Stanley Cup contender for years to come, we need to practice this kind of pursuit of excellence. Winning division titles, winning conferences, winning Stanley Cups. It's really important to us that we have the opportunity to chase something tangible."
Tom Renney,"I thought they scored some pretty good goals . If you can't see it, you can't stop it."
Tom Renney,"I thought we would probably do Henrik well by giving him a breather before he went over to Europe, so it serves two purposes."
Tom Renney,"We're sort of playing a hunch as much as anything. He's played New Jersey well, and our last good game of hockey was here against them with Kevin in goal, so I don't think that is unreasonable at all."
Tom Renney,I think the trick was getting him in an environment that he could flourish. I still think there's a lot there. I don't think anybody should be surprised by this.
Tom Renney,"Every game to us is very valuable but this does conjure up the type of emotion that is playoff-type hockey, or certainly consequential hockey. We want to play that as much as possible, because it makes us better."
Tom Renney,"Let's be honest about this hockey club, gang: These guys have gone above and beyond the call of duty from Day One. One thing we can proudly do is defend this team's good intentions, their work habits and their desire to win."
Tom Renney,"There's no benefit-of-a-doubt stuff in the playoffs. You're in the big parade now and you have to participate. If we give ourselves a chance to play five-on-five hockey, then who knows?"
Tom Renney,Overmatched? I doubt it. I just thought we had a strong game. We took advantage of some things that were presented to us and I thought we were as good as we've been defensively all year.
Tom Renney,"It may affect our transition game. He's got really good poise with the puck, he's got good deception where he can look people off and then make the appropriate little outlet pass. Those are real critical to our transition game and how much time we spend in our own end."
Tom Renney,I thought he showed a lot of courage tonight. I thought he protected the puck as best he could and could make plays only he could make. He wasn't able to manufacture much offensively off the shot. He played to the best of his ability and it was important to have him in the lineup and in our dressing room.
Tom Renney,"We had a very professional conversation. It was not any kind of confrontation, it was just sharing thoughts."
Tom Renney,"We've got to get back to good habits of how we start our games ... how we manage the circumstances in those first six, eight, 10 minutes. We have to try to dictate the terms."
Tom Renney,That's a pretty deadly combination. You don't last long under those circumstances.
Tom Renney,"If he can elevate to the point where we have no choice, then it's possible. If he comes in and does an admirable job, then probably not."
Tom Renney,It's cheating. It's trying to make the 60-foot pass and not collaborating on anything that has to be done.
Tom Renney,"Obviously the penalty parade would suggest I'm not completely happy at all, nor should (the players) be. There's no benefit of the doubt in the playoffs. You're in the big parade now and you've got to participate. It becomes obviously clear we're incapable of dealing with the pressure of these types of situations well enough to stay out of the penalty box and give ourselves a chance."
Tom Renney,He nailed the big one. We believe we have the goaltending that can seal the deal.
Tom Renney,It's beyond belief. You sort of equate that with the drought with the Stanley Cup and I guess it adds up but it's almost unbelievable.
Tom Renney,"All the cliches fit. It's a very valuable time for us if we get through this adversity, because it's going to galvanize our group and define our organization moving forward."
Tom Renney,"It's a reference point, that's probably the biggest advantage we created for ourselves out of tonight. We did come from behind to beat a real good hockey team and we have to use that for what it's worth."
Tom Renney,"If there is an advantage to be gained by this, it's that we think we can beat this team. We feel like we can come in here and win, that's an important feeling to have as a hockey club. You've got to be really feeling strongly about yourself and your ability to beat anybody any night."
Tom Renney,"We have to stay out of the penalty box. Five-on-five, if there's a team that has the advantage it may be us. We have to be patient and avoid frustration."
Tom Renney,"The difference-maker tonight. The strength of the man, his ability to get around the defense and get it to the net and put it away is just unbelievable."
Robert Rennie,"Continued strength of commodity markets has been beneficial to the $A, but traders haven't been getting a lot of loving being long."
Robert Rennie,Liquidity has generally gone from the market. I don't think traders would be particularly aggressive and strap additional risk on.
Robert Rennie,Base metals are up suggesting there are good prospects for global growth. The risk of higher inflation from higher oil prices is pushing up gold.
Robert Rennie,Today's economic index confirmed the Japanese economy is in a solid recovery. That's yen supportive.

Janet Reno,"Consumers shouldn't have to pay sky-high prices because one airline is trying to keep out low-cost competitors,"
Janet Reno,"If the truth shows what I believe to be the case -- that we tried to set up something that would bring the people out and give them a chance to come out in a safe and orderly way -- and that it was their determination and their judgment and their actions that brought that fire upon them, then I would use the experience we have here and figure out what we can do for the future."
Janet Reno,"We are dedicated in this instance to finding the truth, and we are not going to stop until we do"
Janet Reno,"and I trust her to do it. And so, what she said is fine by me."
Janet Reno,"At that time, the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) will formally transfer parole and care to the father,"
Janet Reno,"But we can't rest now, we cannot become complacent,"
Janet Reno,"I regret deeply that Judge Parker feels that way, but I know what I've had to do based on the evidence and the law. I know what I've had to do to address the national security issues,"
Janet Reno,"Brokers may have gotten away with these crimes with little punishment before. Those days are over. If you prey on unsuspecting Americans, you're going to answer for your crimes,"
Janet Reno,"I think it is important that we adhere to principles of federalism, recognize that it is primarily a state issue, and, again, do everything we can to play an appropriate role that doesn't politicize the matter but contributes in a thoughtful way to the resolution of it,"
Janet Reno,"It is important that we identify who is responsible for them having guns, what the parents knew or should have known, and take appropriate steps, ... Meet the Press."
Janet Reno,"I didn't express any matters, opinions on any matters of substance. I think it's obvious that we disagree on a number of issues."
Janet Reno,I think it's that he is one of the smartest men I've ever met. [He] has the capacity to talk to a person as if they are the most important person around and as if he understands their hopes and fears and dreams.
Janet Reno,"We're going to pursue every last murderer until justice has been done,"
Janet Reno,should be completely independent and have no current ties to the Justice Department.
Janet Reno,"This fully supports the [Justice] Department's view that this case is about protecting consumers,"
Janet Reno,"Tensions between police and minority residents affect all aspects of the criminal justice system,"
Janet Reno,"If there is not probable cause that a citizen is knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for, or on behalf of, a foreign power which may involve a violation of federal law, then (the Justice Department) will not recommend that the application be presented to the Court,"
Janet Reno,a significant step forward in combating these criminals and ensuring the integrity of our financial institutions.
Janet Reno,"I have conducted an initial inquiry to determine whether I have received information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate,"
Janet Reno,"Based on all the information we have to date, I see no basis for reversing,"
Janet Reno,"These shootings appear to have been motivated by hate,"
Janet Reno,"Although the investigations are still under way, these shootings appear to have been motivated by hate, ... Hate crimes represent an attack not just on individual victims, but also on the victims' communities. They tear at the very fabric of a people's life."
Janet Reno,"I offered to permit additional members of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee to review these documents, in order to satisfy the committee's subpoena, ... I again offered to testify, to meet with members of the committee and to answer oversight questions."
Janet Reno,"The U.S. government alleges that for the past 45 years, the companies that manufacture and sell tobacco have waged an intentional and coordinated campaign of deceit,"
Janet Reno,"Especially in minority communities ... residents believe the police have used excessive force, that law enforcement is too aggressive, that law enforcement is too biased, disrespectful and unfair."
Janet Reno,"They will not see marshals at 2:01 today attempting to take the boy by force. If we're compelled to enforce our order, we intend to do so in a reasoned, measured way."
Janet Reno,yet another step forward in the Justice Department's investigation of campaign finance abuses associated with the 1996 election.
Janet Reno,"We want to fashion recommendations and best practices that local, state and federal agencies can follow,"
Janet Reno,"There is a little 6-year-old boy who survived one of the most traumatic events that any child could experience -- to lose his mother there in the Gulf Stream, to float for as long as he did, and live to come ashore under the circumstances that he did. We've just got to think about that little boy,"
Janet Reno,"It does not disagree with my determination, it does not say that the boy cannot be reunited with his father in this country, and in fact the court said we need not decide where or in whose custody the plaintiff should remain while this appeal is pending."
Janet Reno,"But we do want to raise consciousness ... that such attacks are growing increasingly likely,"
Janet Reno,"Congress has an oversight function, and I have the responsibility to pursue an investigation the right way, which is certainly not to disclose the details of how I'm going to conduct an investigation, ... We will be working with Chairman Burton to see how we both fulfill those functions."
Janet Reno,"They have computers, and they may have other weapons of mass destruction."

Janet Reno,"Anybody who looks at this case and doesn't know the circumstances of it is going to say 'why?', and I think that's what the president kind of naturally asked,"
Janet Reno,"When to shoot and when not to shoot is one of the most difficult decisions in some circumstances that anybody could make,"
Janet Reno,"I would refer you to the language of the law, ... It depends on the circumstances."
Janet Reno,"We know that guns do not cause violent behavior, ... but ... since we have made it harder for criminals and other prohibited persons to get guns violent crime has gone down."
Janet Reno,I don't think I had the authority to go the other way.
Janet Reno,At this moment I do not have a personal relationship with a computer.
Janet Reno,"I felt joyful at the public's criticism. People come to the country for free speech. It's what America is all about,"

Janet Reno,"I have been surrounded by some of the smartest, brightest, most caring lawyers, by agents who are willing to risk their lives for others, by support staff that are willing to work as hard as they can."
Edgar Renteria,"I have patience. I'm waiting for my pitch, and I've been lucky they've been throwing the pitch where I've been looking for it and I've hit it. When you have things going you get hits. When you're struggling you hit the ball hard right at somebody. You have to take advantage when you can."
Edgar Renteria,"The only way you get better is by working hard, and that is what I plan to do."
Edgar Renteria,"The most important thing is communication. If we have the communication, I think we could be good."
Rich Repetto,Schwab is dealing with lots of issues. They still haven't fully integrated U.S. Trust.
Rich Repetto,"This could be the first signs of the effects of increased competition in the sector. Every major online broker has increased its ad spending, with new online offerings and advertising by full-service brokers as well."
Rich Repetto,"While there are many areas where we think the company can/needs to continue to improve upon, still it is obvious from nearly every client metric, customers are responding to 'Chuck' in a compelling fashion...and we think the client is likely the most important aspect of a retail business."
Rich Repetto,Ricketts believes there is more value in the company.
Rich Repetto,They just have to hunker down and reduce expenses so they can benefit from increased trades.
Rich Repetto,"While we fully expected the stocks to rebound well before their fundamentals, we believe the scenario has now reversed to a potential overbought scenario."

Agnes Repplier,"Edged tools are dangerous things to handle, and not infrequently do much hurt"
Agnes Repplier,"In the stress of modern life, how little room is left for that most comfortable vanity that whispers in our ears that failures are not faults! Now we are taught from infancy that we must rise or fall upon our own merits; that vigilance wins success, and incapacity means ruin."
Agnes Repplier,"Like simplicity and candor, and other much-commented qualities, enthusiasm is charming until we meet it face to face, and cannot escape from its charm."
Agnes Repplier,There is always a secret irritation about a laugh in which we cannot join.
Agnes Repplier,The thinkers of the world should by rights be guardians of the world's mirth.
Agnes Repplier,Conversation between Adam and Eve must have been difficult at times because they had nobody to talk about.

Agnes Repplier,"The clear-sighted do not rule the world, but they sustain and console it."
Agnes Repplier,"It has been well said that tea is suggestive of a thousand wants, from which spring the decencies and luxuries of civilization."
Agnes Repplier,It is not what we learn in conversation that enriches us. It is the elation that comes of swift contact with tingling currents of thought.
Agnes Repplier,"Democracy forever teases us with the contrast between its ideals and its realities, between its heroic possibilities and its sorry achievements."
Agnes Repplier,It is in his pleasure that a man really lives; it is from his leisure that he constructs the true fabric of self.
Agnes Repplier,"It is as impossible to withhold education from the receptive mind, as it is impossible to force it upon the unreasoning."

Agnes Repplier,"It is impossible for a lover of cats to banish these alert, gentle, and discriminating friends, who give us just enough of their regard and complaisance to make us hunger for more."
Agnes Repplier,"A kitten is chiefly remarkable for rushing about like mad at nothing whatever, and generally stopping before it gets there."
Agnes Repplier,"Humor distorts nothing, and only false gods are laughed off their earthly pedestals."
Agnes Repplier,Humor brings insight and tolerance. Irony brings a deeper and less friendly understanding.
Rhone Resch,We're thrilled. This reverses a trend of decreases in (research and development). It shows that solar plays an important role in our energy mix.
Rhone Resch,"In 2005, we saw a tripling of venture capital money going into the solar industry compared to 2004."
Rhone Resch,"This is one of the few tax credits that consumers can utilize to reduce their energy bill. I think as we get mired deeper into the oil crisis and the electricity crisis this summer, there will be a lot of pressure on the Hill to pass legislation that is consumer focused. This will really help those who are on the fence to decide to install solar on their homes."
Rhone Resch,"With this initiative, California has taken a major step toward energy independence. This long-term, visionary policy will save ratepayers money, create high-paying jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. The CPUC should be congratulated in creating a decade-long initiative that will drive the US solar industry to invest in technological innovation and scale up manufacturing. California will be a leader in the next great high-tech growth industry - solar energy."
Rhone Resch,"California will be a leader in the next great high-tech growth industry â€“ solar energy. This long-term, visionary policy will save ratepayers money, create high-paying jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy."
Rhone Resch,I applaud DARPA for recognizing the tremendous potential of solar energy to provide reliable electricity to our troops in the field and to improve our energy security here at home.
Rhone Resch,It's frustrating that you don't have consistency across all 50 states.
Rhone Resch,"The establishment of these tax credits signifies that Congress recognizes solar as an important source of energy that belongs as a part of our national energy portfolio. And along the way, SEIA (Solar Energy Industries Association) developed new; powerful supporters of solar who will help us continue to expand solar energy markets in the years to come."
Mary Lou Retton,"I'm very determined and stubborn. There's a desire in me that makes me want to do more and more, and to do it right. Each one of us has a fire in our heart for something. It's our goal in life to find it and to keep it lit."
Mary Lou Retton,"You give up your childhood. You miss proms and games and high-school events, and people say it's awful... I say it was a good trade. You miss something but I think I gained more than I lost."
Mary Lou Retton,The endorsement game has been very good to me.
Mary Lou Retton,That's because the International Olympic Committee has a policy of never replacing medals.
Mary Lou Retton,Pay-per-view would deprive many kids of the delight of seeing the Olympics.
Mary Lou Retton,"More than 10,000 athletes came to Atlanta seeking Olympic medals. Only a few of them will be lucky and skilled enough to claim one."
Mary Lou Retton,Many medal winners dream of competing in a sport other than the one they're famous for.

Mary Lou Retton,Having a home away from the media glare is important to world-class athletes.
Mary Lou Retton,Getting to know athletes from all over the planet is a big part of the Olympic experience.
Mary Lou Retton,Fragile egos are put on the line every day.
Mary Lou Retton,Former Olympians also get paid to make appearances. Many of them won their medals in an era when Olympic success didn't go hand-in-hand with financial success.
Mary Lou Retton,"For six years, I kept my five Olympic medals wrapped in a plastic bread bag beneath my bed."
Mary Lou Retton,"For athletes, the Olympics are the ultimate test of their worth."
Mary Lou Retton,Companies that support sports developmental programs in our communities should also be applauded.

Mary Lou Retton,"As a kid, I was a pretty good little sprinter."
Paul Reubens,The public may think I'm weird. They may think I'm crazy or anything that anyone wants to think about me. That's all fine. As long as one of the things you're not thinking about me is that I'm a pedophile. Because that's not true.
Paul Reubens,"Look at me, I'm getting defensive about something that happened so many years ago, somebody said. I'll have to find out who that was and if he's still alive."
Paul Reubens,I probably have become more infamous from two misdemeanors than probably anyone i could think of.
Paul Revere,"The British are coming. One if by land, two if by sea."
Paul Revere,In every city we play in the clock never works. It reminds me of Back to the Future.
Paul Revere,"He said to me, ''We are now going towards your friends, and if you attempt to run, or we are insulted, we will blow your brains out.'' When we had got into the road they formed a circle, and ordered the prisoners in the center, and to lead me in the front."
Jose Reyes,I can't wait to meet him. I'm ready to work.
Jose Reyes,"I played with him two years in the minor leagues. He always was a good hitter. Always, man."
Jose Reyes,"It's going to be exciting, man. It's going to be exciting."
Jose Reyes,"We're just good friends. We joke around here in the clubhouse, but if we see each other outside, we're friends. We joke, try to have fun."
Jose Reyes,"If you don't have the experience, you can learn."
Jose Reyes,"I saw him kick the ball when I got to first base. When I saw that, I'm going, no doubt about that. Put myself in scoring position. I run hard out of the box every time. You never know what might happen with the ball."
Glenn Reynolds,"You can sit in your living room and shout at your television, which makes you feel helpless, you can turn off the television, which is no great solution, or you can try to do better yourself,"
Glenn Reynolds,"This whole process is part economics, part bankruptcy law, part ideology and part game theory -- but 100 percent painful."
Glenn Reynolds,"My own take: Some of the nitpicking and complaining may well be justified, even beyond the inevitable dropped balls in something like this. But there will be plenty of time for that later. Right now, people should be focusing on constructive action, not point-scoring."
Glenn Reynolds,"In the end, a few extra pledges can add to the comfort zone for the banks in a sector that is having anything but smooth sailing."
Ryan Reynolds,"That's why you and I had friction? God, I always thought it was 'cause, 'cause I fooled around with your daughter freshman year."
Ryan Reynolds,"Oh God, 'the game,' ... From what I remember, it's just a really disgusting exercise in homophobic futility ... I cannot even believe it made it into this movie. It's disgusting."
Ryan Reynolds,"We started training a month before the movie started and then by five months in, we were at our peak shape."
Ryan Reynolds,"This is a huge budget movie so it was amazing to see just how he knew what he wanted. I mean, that's all you can ever ask for from a director."
Ryan Reynolds,It's a nice visual. I had just done Blade and I put on more weight for Blade and I thought I might as well use it so I kept it and added a little more. I wanted him to be a big bear.
Ryan Reynolds,"It was comical because you're at a firing range, all these people are so seriously shooting their little guns."
Ryan Reynolds,"If you're going to commit to that, you're going to have to find some way to make it bearable and enjoyable."
Ryan Reynolds,"He has such a clear vision of exactly what he wanted out of each character, out of each set, out of each wardrobe change, out of each emotional beat, and action."
Ryan Reynolds,Are you stalking me? Because that would be super.
Trent Reznor,"Though I still have no semblance of a life outside of Nine Inch Nails at the moment, I realize my goals have gone from getting a record deal or selling another record to being a better person, more well-rounded, . . . having friends, having a relationship with somebody."
Trent Reznor,"When I look at people that I would like to feel have been a mentor or an inspiring kind of archetype of what I'd love to see my career eventually be mentioned as a footnote for in the same paragraph, it would be, like, Bowie."
Trent Reznor,"Nine Inch Nails was an experiment with me in discipline. I realized when I was 23 that I had never really tried anything. Schoolwork came easy to me. I learned to play piano effortlessly. I was coasting. I realized that I was afraid to really, really try something, 100 percent, because I had never reached true failure."
Trent Reznor,"I get involved with the set design, lighting and the use of film because I always hated seeing bands in arenas. They usually suck. You're not meant to see rock shows there. You're meant to see a basketball game. In approaching the idea of arenas, I asked, 'What can I do in arenas I can't do elsewhere?' I tried to make it unique, help frame the music, and make it more like theater, so it starts at one place and winds up at another."
Trent Reznor,the least responsive audience I can ever remember playing to.
Trent Reznor,"I was up above it. Now, I'm down in it."
Trent Reznor,This isn't meant to last. This is for right now.
Trent Reznor,"I do actually believe in love. I can't say that I'm 100 percent successful in that department, but I think it's one of the few worthwhile human experiences. It's cooler than anything I can think of right now."
Trent Reznor,And when the day arrives I'll become the sky and I'll become the sea and the sea will come to kiss me for I am going home. Nothing can stop me now.
Trent Reznor,I think there's something strangely musical about noise.
Trent Reznor,"Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me."
Trent Reznor,"Bow down before the one you serve, You're going to get what you deserve."
Trent Reznor,I feel uncomfortable because I'm insecure about who I am.
Trent Reznor,"I've become impossible, holding on to when everything seemed to matter more."
Trent Reznor,Sometimes we pee on each other before we go on stage.
Lara Rhame,"I see the trade gap stabilizing, but it's hard to see it narrowing unless you get the U.S. consumer shutting down."
Lara Rhame,The trade number at best leaves the dollar where it was and at worst sparks a substantial dollar decline.
Lara Rhame,"We are still seeing some slack in the labor market, in several different places."
Lara Rhame,This was an honest-to-goodness better-than-expected report. There were no special factors in it that made it look artificially strong. The report also indicates that consumer fatigue may not be as severe as we had previously thought.
Lara Rhame,"Everybody has to learn a little more economics than they want to learn, now that we're drawing more and more of a distinction between actual GDP and final domestic demand, which is GDP minus inventories. Inventories can surprise. It's hard to make a solid forecast about them, and the Fed said that. I think the market continues to overestimate Fed rate cuts."
Lara Rhame,"Everybody has to learn a little more economics than they want to learn, now that we're drawing more and more of a distinction between actual GDP and final domestic demand, which is GDP minus inventories, ... Inventories can surprise. It's hard to make a solid forecast about them, and the Fed said that. I think the market continues to overestimate Fed rate cuts."
Lara Rhame,"What I call a dollar crisis is when you have a big, negative feedback loop, with international investors spooked purely because of the currency, shedding U.S. assets, which would be more dollar negative, and it would just feed on itself,"
Lara Rhame,"The report is certainly better than in December, but it just doesn't reflect the level of job creation we'd expect to see at this stage of the economic recovery, or the job creation the Fed would need to see to even consider taking that first step towards tightening."
Lara Rhame,"This is undeniably good news. The crucial question going forward is going to be if the rise in confidence is reflected in more spending on the part of the consumer, or if it's simply a patriotic rally."
Shonda Rhimes,"It's incredibly encouraging that our viewers haven't gotten hung up on the race thing. It's not about the fact that she's Asian and he's black. It's about the fact that she's a slob, and he's a neat freak. That's what the whole relationship is all about."
Shonda Rhimes,It's incredibly encouraging that our viewers haven't gotten hung up on the race thing.
Shonda Rhimes,They wouldn't shut up about it. 'He's totally an alcoholic and here's why.' I hate them sometimes. Especially when they are right. Because Richard is totally an alcoholic and now I see why.
Nick Rhodes,"When we finished Ordinary World we all looked at each other and said, if this doesn't work, then we're doing something wrong. But again, I have to say, as a complete album, I really think this one makes a statement that the other ones haven't yet. I mean, I hope we do an even better album in '98 or '99, but certainly this one has said a lot that I wanted to have Duran Duran say for the '90s."
Nick Rhodes,"The last few weeks we've been focusing on team ball. If the guy's open, get it to him. Trust your teammate."
Nick Rhodes,To be able to experiment with new forms of distribution and technology comes naturally to the group and we're excited about the reaction we'll get.
Nick Rhodes,"The facilities are unreal, and it's a great opportunity for me to come in and play early."
Nick Rhodes,"Style has always been very important to us, ... We grew up in the '70s. Music was glam rock, punk rock and a very stylish movement."
Nick Rhodes,"With a lot of the new music that's around and the acts that have actually cited us as being influences... I wouldn't be so arrogant as to take somebody's record and say, I think they've taken that from what we've done, but definitely I like the sound of a lot of things out there, and they're in an area in which I enjoy making music myself."
Nick Rhodes,"Oh, I love bios! I wouldn't say traditionally it was a concept album. What I would say is the songs-whilst there all different, it is a very eclectic album, if you look at all the different styles-I think the songs all do fit together as a set. It's probably the most complete album we've made for many years."
Nick Rhodes,"We tried to relocate, but it was so hard on short notice,"
Nick Rhodes,"We tried to relocate, but it was so hard on short notice."
Nick Rhodes,"Obviously with every new album we make, we always have to believe in it and feel we've gone in the right direction."
Nick Rhodes,"Style has always been very important to us. We grew up in the '70s. Music was glam rock, punk rock and a very stylish movement."
Nick Rhodes,"You listen to a piece of music and it will remind you of something-it might make you happy, it might make you sad, but it is very emotive. And I think that Duran Duran have always understood that."
Nick Rhodes,"I got this idea about being afraid to let go of something and being afraid of sinking into a state of almost anesthesia, where you have to trust other people. Just the paranoia of it all. And it seemed to suit the frenetic track. So I just wrote it out and, you know, said it."
Nick Rhodes,We always like satisfied customers.
Nick Rhodes,to demonstrate our confidence that the great city of New Orleans will rebuild.
Nick Rhodes,You can only sleep in one bed at a time.
Ray Rhodes,"I backed off, got my rest. Get myself well and get healthy."
Ray Rhodes,"At one time, you think you're invincible. This just can't happen to you but, when it happens, the reality sets in that you either change or you die. You realize you've got only one life."
Ray Rhodes,I tried to get out of bed and I fell down.
Ray Rhodes,"With the guys being down and injured, have not played in live action yet, we need to see everybody. The way things are shaping up, we're getting guys back one at a time."
Tom Rhodes,"But with digital technology, it will really shift the power."
Tom Rhodes,"First-time filmmakers have so many mistakes, digital video will allow you to go try something and if it doesn't work, you can do it again,"
Tom Rhodes,"It's going to be a huge destabilizing force to the studios,"
David Ricardo,"The rise or fall of wages is common to all states of society, whether it be the stationary, the advancing, or the retrograde state."
David Ricardo,"The proportions, too, in which the capital that is to support labour, and the capital that is invested in tools, machinery and buildings, may be variously combined."
David Ricardo,"The facility of obtaining food is beneficial in two ways to the owners of capital, it at the same time raises profits and increases the amount of consumable commodities."
David Ricardo,"The exchangeable value of all commodities, rises as the difficulties of their production increase."
David Ricardo,"Profits might also increase, because improvements might take place in agriculture, or in the implements of husbandry, which would augment the produce with the same cost of production."
David Ricardo,"It is not by the absolute quantity of produce obtained by either class, that we can correctly judge of the rate of profit, rent, and wages, but by the quantity of labour required to obtain that produce."
David Ricardo,"In the same manner if any nation wasted part of its wealth, or lost part of its trade, it could not retain the same quantity of circulating medium which it before possessed."
David Ricardo,"In the course of these observations, I have often had occasion to insist, that rent never falls without the profits of stock rising."
David Ricardo,"In stating the principles which regulate exchangeable value and price, we should carefully distinguish between those variations which belong to the commodity itself, and those which are occasioned by a variation in the medium in which value is estimated, or price expressed."
David Ricardo,"In comparing therefore the value of the same commodity, at different periods of time, the consideration of the comparative skill and intensity of labour, required for that particular commodity, needs scarcely to be attended to, as it operates equally at both periods."
David Ricardo,"If we were left to ourselves, unfettered by legislative enactments, we should gradually withdraw our capital from the cultivation of such lands, and import the produce which is at present raised upon them."
David Ricardo,"If then the prosperity of the commercial classes, will most certainly lead to accumulation of capital, and the encouragement of productive industry; these can by no means be so surely obtained as by a fall in the price of corn."
David Ricardo,"If the quantity of labour realized in commodities, regulate their exchangeable value, every increase of the quantity of labour must augment the value of that commodity on which it is exercised, as every diminution must lower it."
David Ricardo,"If the demand for home commodities should be diminished, because of the fall of rent on the part of the landlords, it will be increased in a far greater degree by the increased opulence of the commercial classes."
David Ricardo,"If a commodity were in no way useful, - in other words, if it could in no way contribute to our gratification, - it would be destitute of exchangeable value, however scarce it might be, or whatever quantity of labour might be necessary to procure it."
David Ricardo,"Gold, on the contrary, though of little use compared with air or water, will exchange for a great quantity of other goods."
David Ricardo,"Gold and silver are no doubt subject to fluctuations, from the discovery of new and more abundant mines; but such discoveries are rare, and their effects, though powerful, are limited to periods of comparatively short duration."
David Ricardo,"During the period of capital moving from one employment to another, the profits on that to which capital is flowing will be relatively high, but will continue so no longer than till the requisite capital is obtained."
David Ricardo,"By far the greatest part of those goods which are the objects of desire, are procured by labour; and they may be multiplied, not in one country alone, but in many, almost without any assignable limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labour necessary to obtain them."
David Ricardo,"But a rise in the wages of labour would not equally affect commodities produced with machinery quickly consumed, and commodities produced with machinery slowly consumed."
David Ricardo,"As the revenue of the farmer is realized in raw produce, or in the value of raw produce, he is interested, as well as the landlord, in its high exchangeable value, but a low price of produce may be compensated to him by a great additional quantity."
David Ricardo,"Again two manufacturers may employ the same amount of fixed, and the same amount of circulating capital; but the durability of their fixed capitals may be very unequal."
David Ricardo,"After all the fertile land in the immediate neighbourhood of the first settlers were cultivated, if capital and population increased, more food would be required, and it could only be procured from land not so advantageously situated."
David Ricardo,"A rise of wages from this cause will, indeed, be invariably accompanied by a rise in the price of commodities; but in such cases, it will be found that labour and all commodities have not varied in regard to each other, and that the variation has been confined to money."
David Ricardo,"A rise in wages, from an alteration in the value of money, produces a general effect on price, and for that reason it produces no real effect whatever on profits."
David Ricardo,"Whenever, then, the usual and ordinary rate of the profits of agricultural stock, and all the outgoings belonging to the cultivation of land, are together equal to the value of the whole produce, there can be no rent."
David Ricardo,There can be no rise in the value of labour without a fall of profits.
David Ricardo,"Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the mines which produce them."
Anne Rice,I don't believe in anything and that makes me stronger than you think
Anne Rice,I had wanted to say that my song was far too painful to sing.
Anne Rice,"So until we meet again, I am thinking of you always; I love you; I wish you were here...in my arms."
Anne Rice,The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters.
Anne Rice,"I do not allow fan fiction,"
Anne Rice,Evil is just a point of view
Anne Rice,During this crisis you failed us
Anne Rice,So why must it wound him that the most despairing music is full of beauty? Why must it hurt him and make him cynical and sad and untrusting?
Anne Rice,"I want to know, for example, why beauty exists, she said, why nature continues to contrive it, and what is the link between the life of a lightning storm with the feelings these things inspire in us? If God does not exist, if these things are not unified into one metaphorical system, then why do they retain for us such symbolic power? Lestat calls it the Savage Garden, but for me that is not enough."
Anne Rice,"You reach deep down and bring up what feels absolutely authentic to you as you move along with the book, but you don't know everything about it. You can't."
Anne Rice,You can look at the New York Times Bestseller List and you can be pretty sure that the writers on that list don't know each other very well.
Anne Rice,"Writers, as they gain success, feel like outsiders because writers don't come together in real groups."
Anne Rice,"When I write something, every word of it is meant. I can't say it enough."
Anne Rice,There may be writing groups where people meet but it's occasional. You really do it all at your own computer or your own typewriter by yourself.
Anne Rice,The world doesn't need any more mediocrity or hedged bets.
Anne Rice,The most difficult novel I have had to write in terms of just getting it done was The Vampire Lestat. It took a year to write.
Anne Rice,That process by which you become a writer is a pretty lonely one. We don't have a group apprenticeship like a violinist might training for an orchestra.
Anne Rice,Stephen King in many respects is a wonderful writer. He has made a contribution. People in the future will be able to pick up Stephen King's books and learn a lot about who we were by reading those books.
Anne Rice,"Obviously, a writer can't know everything about what she writes. It's impossible."
Anne Rice,"Obsession led me to write. It's been that way with every book I've ever written. I become completely consumed by a theme, by characters, by a desire to meet a challenge."
Anne Rice,"My own funeral, I'd like to be laid out in a coffin in my own house. I would like my coffin to be put in the double parlor, and I would like all the flowers to be white."
Anne Rice,Memnoch the Devil happen to be my favorite of all The Vampire Chronicles.
Anne Rice,Invest in a feather duster - the possibilities are endless.
Anne Rice,I'm going to keep on dealing with the supernatural in a lot of ways.
Anne Rice,"I'm always looking, and I'm always asking questions."
Anne Rice,"I thought The Shining was just absolutely wonderful. Stephen King reaches all kinds of people. In the beginning he was just dismissed out of hand, which was terrible."
Anne Rice,I read The Old Curiosity Shop before I began Blackwood Farm. I was amazed at the utter madness in that book.
Anne Rice,I love New Orleans physically. I love the trees and the balmy air and the beautiful days. I have a beautiful house here.
Anne Rice,I gave up on the big screen. The Witching Hour was at Warner Bros. for 10 years and it just didn't work out.
Anne Rice,"I do not read the ancient languages, but I am beginning to study Greek."
Anne Rice,I claim Dickens as a mentor. He's my teacher. He's one of my driving forces.
Anne Rice,I can't keep up with Stephen King's output.
Anne Rice,Dickens is a very underrated writer at the moment. Everyone in his time admired him but I think right now he's not spoken of enough.
Anne Rice,"Very few beings really seek knowledge in this world. Mortal or immortal, few really ASK. On the contrary, they try to wring from the unknown the answers they have already shaped in their own minds."
Anne Rice,"The whole theme of Interview with the Vampire was Louis's quest for meaning in a godless world. He searched to find the oldest existing immortal simply to ask, What is the meaning of what we are?"
Anne Rice,"The vampires have always been metaphors for me. They've always been vehicles through which I can express things I have felt very, very deeply."
Anne Rice,First-person narrators is the way I know how to write a book with the greatest power and chance of artistic success.
Anne Rice,"The truth is, laughter always sounds more perfect than weeping. Laughter flows in a violent riff and is effortlessly melodic. Weeping is often fought, choked, half strangled, or surrendered to with humiliation."
Anne Rice,Evil is always possible. Goodness is a difficulty.
Anne Rice,"I loved words. I love to sing them and speak them and even now, I must admit, I have fallen into the joy of writing them."
Anne Rice,We're frightened of what makes us different.
Anne Rice,"To write something, you have to risk making a fool of yourself."
Anne Rice,To really ask is to open the door to the whirlwind. The answer may annihilate the question and the questioner.
Anne Rice,"The thing should have plot and character, beginning, middle and end. Arouse pity and then have a catharsis. Those were the best principles I was ever taught."
Anne Rice,"I'm usually working on my own mythology, my own realm of created characters. Stories in mythology inspire me, though I may not be conscious of it."
Anne Rice,I'm fascinated by almost any mythology that I can get my hands on.
Anne Rice,I enjoy the Web site a lot and I like being able to talk to my readers. I've always had a very close relationship with them.
Anne Rice,"I'm definitely more influenced by European writers than I am by American writers, there's no doubt about that."
Anne Rice,"I feel like an outsider, and I always will feel like one. I've always felt that I wasn't a member of any particular group."
Anne Rice,I do want to go another way - to write something completely different.
Anne Rice,The only pain in pleasure is the pleasure of the pain.
Anne Rice,"People who cease to believe in God or goodness altogether still believe in the devil. I don't know why. No, I do indeed know why. Evil is always possible. And goodness is eternally difficult."
Condoleezza Rice,We very much would like to have a deal. We are continuing to work on it.
Condoleezza Rice,overwhelmed your respect for the truth.
Condoleezza Rice,"[A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said,] DHS is not looking into a contingency plan. ... I don't know where the idea that there might be some postponement of elections comes from."
Condoleezza Rice,"We will need, I really do believe, to go back to the Security Council at some time in the not-too-distant future to get a report on what is happening with Syrian cooperation."
Condoleezza Rice,"Frankly, one of the problems that we face is that you have a bit of a relationship, or quite a relationship, between Cuba and Venezuela . . . which I think is a particular danger to the region."
Condoleezza Rice,"He will outline his vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace, and discuss Europe's and the United States's hard work and joint success in realizing the vision."
Condoleezza Rice,We understand that the Israelis have to defend themselves. It's just extremely important that the Israelis also keep in mind the long view here.
Condoleezza Rice,"We're listening to them, but as far as broad-scale U.S. involvement in talks, I don't at this point see that that would be productive."
Condoleezza Rice,"It is important that Russia make clear to the world that it is intent on strengthening the rule of law, strengthening the role of an independent judiciary, permitting a free and independent press to flourish,"
Condoleezza Rice,accelerate justice on high profile cases.
Condoleezza Rice,"In hindsight, if anything might have helped stop 9/11, it would have been better information about threats inside the United States."
Condoleezza Rice,"But the information that there were plots under way that might relate to the pre-election period came from multiple sources, and active multiple sources."
Condoleezza Rice,retrospective rewriting of the history.
Condoleezza Rice,We really want to be ready to hit the ground running with this new government when it's ready to go.
Condoleezza Rice,The sole purpose of this trip is to express support for the Lebanese people and for the Lebanese government as they try to recover fully their sovereignty and they continue their efforts to reform.
Condoleezza Rice,"The Egyptian government must fulfill the promise it made to its people - and to the entire world - by giving its citizens the freedom to choose. Egypt's elections, including the parliamentary elections, must meet objective standards that define every free election,"
Condoleezza Rice,"John Bolton is personally committed to the future success of the United Nations, and he will be a strong voice for reform at a time when the United Nations has begun to reform itself to help meet the challenging agenda before the international community."
Condoleezza Rice,inspired a whole generation of people to fight for freedom.
Condoleezza Rice,National Security Council task force.
Condoleezza Rice,"We have a long road ahead, a long road ahead. I have to say as a football fan, sometimes the last yard is the hardest, and I think we experienced that today."
Condoleezza Rice,"We have affirmed our just demands of the Syrian government and made it clear that failure with these demands will lead to serious consequences from the international community,"
Condoleezza Rice,"Iraq is typical, or the most important example, of the kind of threat that NATO will face in the future,"
Condoleezza Rice,"The vote today is an important milestone. They will have elections in December for a permanent government. Every time the Iraqi people have been given an opportunity to express themselves politically they have taken it,"
Condoleezza Rice,"You have to go out and warn. You have a duty to warn, ... Late Edition."
Condoleezza Rice,The French will have to make their own determination.
Condoleezza Rice,"If we abandon future generations in the Middle East to despair and terror, we also condemn future generations in the United States to insecurity and fear."
Condoleezza Rice,These are all the basics of democracy.
Condoleezza Rice,"The resources we commit must empower developing countries to strengthen security, to consolidate democracy, to increase trade and investment, and to improve the lives of their people."
Condoleezza Rice,"They will talk about issues concerning the continued march of democracy in Europe and also in Russia,"

Condoleezza Rice,"was characterized by freer debate, increased transparency and improved access to the media, in contrast with previous polls."
Condoleezza Rice,the terms of debate of what constitutes development.
Condoleezza Rice,"Charles Taylor is out of Liberia , he is through raping and pillaging his country and the Liberian people are trying to look forward. I really think we owe it to them to look forward and not back."
Condoleezza Rice,"The parties have now had the habit of cooperation in the Gaza withdrawal, and it is our hope that they are going to continue to build on that."
Condoleezza Rice,"on the common agenda that we have -- the agenda for cooperation that we have ahead of us on issues like [nuclear] non-proliferation, on issues like fighting disease and poverty in the poorer areas of the world, on issues like the global economy and trade."
Condoleezza Rice,"With our decision today, we show that Syria has isolated itself from the international community, ... Now, the Syrian government must make a strategic decision to fundamentally change its behavior."
Condoleezza Rice,"There's a belief that it has probably passed. We'll see, but that's the general assessment that it has probably passed."
Condoleezza Rice,"Success is not assured, but America is resolute: this is the best chance for peace we are likely to see for some years to come - and we are acting to help Israelis and Palestinians seize this chance."
Condoleezza Rice,set a revolution that made America face up to its birth defects.
Condoleezza Rice,"We will stick to the text of the Beijing [agreement], and I believe we can make progress if everybody sticks to what we agreed to,"
Grantland Rice,There's no dearth of kindness in this world of ours; Only in our blindness we gather thorns for flowers.
Grantland Rice,"For when the One Great Scorer comes To write against your name, He marks - not that you won or lost - But how you played the game."
Grantland Rice,Kindness in ourselves is the honey that blunts the sting of unkindness in another.
Grantland Rice,Few learn golf in a lifetime.
Grantland Rice,"A wise man makes his own decisions, an ignorant man follows the public opinion."
Grantland Rice,"You are meant to play the ball as it lies, a fact that may help to touch on your own objective approach to life."
Grantland Rice,"Does the road wind up-hill all the way? Yes, to the very end. Will the day's journey take the whole long day? From morn to night, my friend."
Grantland Rice,All wars are planned by old men In council rooms apart.
Grantland Rice,Eighteen holes of match play will teach you more about your foe than 18 years of dealing with him across a desk.
Grantland Rice,"Depend upon yourself. Make your judgement trustworthy by trusting it. You can develop good judgement as you do the muscles of your body - by judicious, daily exercise. To be known as a man of sound judgement will be much in your favor."
Jerry Rice,"He's in another world right now. He's in that zone. He's seeing the field so well, he's not making mistakes, he's throwing strikes. It's remarkable what he's doing."
Jerry Rice,"It's a really good thing they're having this for free, especially for guys like me who don't have health-care insurance."
Jerry Rice,"I just told him, 'Hey, you've got to let it go. He's a hard worker and I think he wants success, but he's got to keep on pushing. When the opportunity is there, that's when you've got to take advantage of it."
Jerry Rice,"To me it was never about what I accomplished on the football field, it was about the way I played the game."
Jerry Rice,I just want the same thing Joe Montana got when he was MVP. He got respect. He got commercials. He got everything.
Jerry Rice,"There are a lot of young players here right now, and these guys are going to eventually learn as they go. Next year we can't use that as an excuse that we had so many young players on the team."
Jim Rice,It was just done out of ignorance.
Jim Rice,"I am so psyched because we are on the verge of arriving at Home Plate very, very soon we may arrive by week?s end if all goes well."
Jim Rice,You guys are our future.
Jim Rice,"I flat out see no evidence for any fossils in our data. If a trilobite, for example, evolved on Mars and we came across a rock with it, we could resolve it."
Jim Rice,"The American people should never feel scared to go out to visit events that are their heritage, and that's exactly why law enforcement takes such a strong preparatory stance for these events."
Jim Rice,Fossil finding will be a very difficult job on Mars. I don't think robotic missions will do it. It will take astronauts and even then it will be a tough job.
Jim Rice,Knowledge is power. Your education is the most important thing you can do.
John Rice,"These days all broadcasters are trying to find a way to interact with their audience, It's all about the red button."
John Rice,"We hate it. When you look at our results and compare them with other large cap stocks, we think we are doing a lot of things right."
John Rice,It is a terrific project. There are so many aspects of it that are important to the community. It is a real critical look at Earth Day.
John Rice,This agreement takes us a step further in reshaping our hair care portfolio of brands in North America. It will enable us to focus on bringing innovation to market through our strong local and global brands.
Larry Rice,The parts are worth more than the whole.
Larry Rice,"It's amazing how investors penalize IBM ( IBM : Research , Estimates ) for the progress they've made over the last few years, ... And, yet they'll pay 100 times revenue for other companies. The second half of this year, it looks very good, very strong for IBM's businesses. I'd continue to buy IBM for portfolios here."
Larry Rice,"[The biggest distraction this week for investors will be] patriotism, ... It's gonna be back and forth all week. After next week, we'll be able to move forward."
Larry Rice,It's just money circulating among the same groups.
Larry Rice,This market is going to fool the greatest number of people by doing what it's not supposed to do.
Larry Rice,"My timing would be that I'd want to start lightening up as we approach the elections, because once again, after the elections, it's conceivable you have a slowing economy. But a lot of things I'm looking at underneath the surface here show me that possibly we're going to have rising inflation at a time when the economy begins to slow. So we're going to see more increases after the elections."
Larry Rice,"I don't expect this economy to show any signs of slowing down. One of the strategists a couple of years ago alluded to the battleship -- you don't stop this battleship in mid-water unless you have a bunch of torpedoes and the anti-aircraft, and the fact of the matter is, there aren't enough torpedoes out there yet,"
Larry Rice,You've got a bubble in bonds. There is a panic to buy debt just like there was a panic to buy stocks in 1999.
Larry Rice,"There's no conviction for a sustained move but there's just an ongoing rotation, ... Everyone knows now that (interest) rates aren't going to go up for awhile so it's just a recycling of the same money."
Larry Rice,There is no conviction. Is the economy slowing down or is the red-hot momentum continuing? I think people are really shell shocked by the crazy volatility.
Larry Rice,"Face it, the market really hasn't made much progress. Maybe it's telling you to err on the side of caution."
Larry Rice,"Valuations are typically higher at the beginning of a recovery, but in this case they've run too high, ... Whether you're looking at dividend yields or the P/E going forward, we're just stretched."
Larry Rice,"There's a continued choppiness coming from yesterday's meeting; it's really a trading environment instead of an investing environment, ... Action has been dominated by stories in individual stocks but, to me, it's just continuing the trend of more money chasing few names."
Adrienne Rich,"Heterosexuality has been forcibly and subliminally imposed on women.Yet everywhere women have resisted it, often at the cost of physical torture, imprisonment, psychosurgery, social ostracism, and extreme poverty."
Adrienne Rich,"I am a feminist because I feel endangered, psychically and physically, by this society and because I believe that the women's movement is saying that we have come to an edge of history when men - insofar as they are embodiments of the patriarchical i"
Adrienne Rich,We who were loved will never unlive that crippling fever.
Adrienne Rich,"We might possess every technological resource . . . but if our language is inadequate, our vision remains formless, our thinking and feeling are still running in the old cycles, our process may be revolutionary but not transformative."
Adrienne Rich,"We might hypothetically possess ourselves of every technological resource on the North American continent, but as long as our language is inadequate, our vision remains formless, our thinking and feeling are still running in the old cycles, our process may be ''revolutionary'' but not transformative."
Adrienne Rich,"As her sons have seen her: the mother in patriarchy: controlling, erotic, castrating, heart-suffering, guilt-ridden, and guilt-provoking; a marble brow, a huge breast, an avid cave; between her legs snakes, swamp-grass, or teeth; on her lap a helpless infant or a martyred son. She exists for one purpose: to bear and nourish the son."
Adrienne Rich,"Open Air Museum. Seen from a train, stopped / As by design, to bring us / Face to face with the flag of our true country: / Violet-yellow, black-violet, / Its heart sucked by slow fire / O my America / This then your desire?"
Adrienne Rich,Only to have a grief equal to all these tears!
Adrienne Rich,"My children cause me the most exquisite suffering of which I have any experience. It is the suffering of ambivalence: the murderous alternation between bitter resentment and raw-edged nerves, and blissful gratification and tenderness. Sometimes I seem to myself, in my feelings toward these tiny guiltless beings, a monster of selfishness and intolerance."
Adrienne Rich,"In order to live a fully human life we require not only control of our bodies (though control is a prerequisite); we must touch the unity and resonance of our physicality, our bond with the natural order, the corporeal grounds of our intelligence."
Adrienne Rich,A thinking woman sleeps with monsters.
Adrienne Rich,"The connections between and among women are the most feared, the most problematic, and the most potentially transforming force on the planet."
Adrienne Rich,Life on the planet is born of woman.
Adrienne Rich,"Art, whose honesty must work through artifice, cannot avoid cheating truth."
Adrienne Rich,"Every journey into the past is complicated by delusions, false memories, false namings of real events."
Adrienne Rich,"I keep coming back to you in my head, but you couldn't know that, and I have no carbons."
Adrienne Rich,Lying is done with words and also with silence.
Adrienne Rich,"Pride is a tricky, glorious, double-edged feeling."
Adrienne Rich,"The worker can unionize, go out on strike; mothers are divided from each other in homes, tied to their children by compassionate bonds; our wildcat strikes have most often taken the form of physical or mental breakdown."
Adrienne Rich,"It's exhilarating to be alive in a time of awakening consciousness; it can also be confusing, disorienting, and painful."
Adrienne Rich,The mind's passion is all for singling out. Obscurity has another tale to tell.
Adrienne Rich,The moment of change is the only poem.
Bob Richards,You are what you think. You are what you go for. You are what you do!
Bob Richards,The audience responds and you can see it start. The next step is trying to figure out another way to get (an act) into town.
Bob Richards,"I won it, at least five million times. Men who were stronger, bigger and faster than I was could have done it, but they never picked up a pole, and never made the feeble effort to pick their legs off the ground and get over the bar."
Bob Richards,"Ingenuity, plus courage, plus work, equals miracles."
Bob Richards,"One of the great lessons I've learned in athletics is that you've got to discipline your life. No matter how good you may be, you've got to be willing to cut out of your life those things that keep you from going to the top."
Jef Richards,"Commercial speech is like obscenity... we can't seem to define it, but we know it when we see it."
Jef Richards,"Is advertising a profession, like law or medicine? How many new parents clutch their baby to their breast and declare, 'I want this child to grow up to be a media planner'?"
Jef Richards,"If its not done ethically, advertising won't be trusted. If consumers don't trust it, advertising is pointless."
Jef Richards,Congress seems to believe that 'Children are our future' is a phrase coined by tobacco advertisers.
Jef Richards,I believe 'credibility' is one of the biggest issues yet to be addressed by Internet advertisers.
Jef Richards,Advertising is totally unnecessary. Unless you hope to make money.
Jef Richards,"While it may be true that the best advertising is word-of-mouth, never lose sight of the fact it also can be the worst advertising."
Jef Richards,Creative without strategy is called 'art.' Creative with strategy is called 'advertising.'
Jef Richards,"Internet advertising will not replace traditional media, it will compliment them."
Jef Richards,There is a huge difference between journalism and advertising. Journalism aspires to truth. Advertising is regulated for truth. I'll put the accuracy of the average ad in this country up against the average news story any time.
Jef Richards,"Advertising practitioners are interpreters. But unlike foreign language interpreters, adpeople must constantly learn new languages. They must understand the language of each new product, and speak the language of each new target audience."
Jef Richards,Advertising is the 'wonder' in Wonder Bread.
Jef Richards,"In the world of commercial speech, tobacco advertising bears the earmarks of an endangered species."
Jef Richards,I wish all consumers were as gullible as advertising's biggest critics. Anyone who believes advertising is that powerful will believe almost anything.
Jef Richards,Advertising is speech. It's regulated because it's often effective speech.
Jef Richards,There's so much truly putrid advertising out there it's embarrassing. But not all advertising is bad. Some of it is really quite mediocre.
Jef Richards,"Creativity is an advertising agency's most valuable asset, because it is the rarest."
Bill Richardson,"What I worry about is a new fiefdom within an already big fiefdom,"
Bill Richardson,"High gas prices are going to revolutionize the way we drive and move our society to more fuel-efficient vehicles, ... Unfortunately, it's taken a crisis of high gas prices to move us in that direction."
Bill Richardson,meets the highest standards of security.
Bill Richardson,"As soon as possible, what I want to hire is, hopefully, a four-star general with an extensive security background,"
Bill Richardson,"We may have here a security lapse that involved an individual that misplaced something and tried to engage in contradictory behavior, and, hopefully, we'll get to the bottom of this,"
Bill Richardson,"The Security Council is going to have to respond in a strong, unmistakable way,"
Bill Richardson,will not tolerate the theft of our secrets.
Bill Richardson,"That drives the science, to sort out the species and figure out what's going on with the toxins and find out where they're distributed."
Bill Richardson,"During the 2004 legislative session I proposed and the Legislature approved a bill to waive the state sales tax on efficient hybrid automobiles, ... Today, hybrid-buyers in New Mexico are saving big bucks when they purchase one of these efficient hybrids. The savings on this Escape, for instance, are about $800."
Bill Richardson,"They are close, but close is not good enough, ... I won't rest until all consumers can be assured that utilities have adequately prepared for a smooth rollover."
Bill Richardson,"I strongly believe that we made progress in our discussions in North Korea on the diplomatic front, on the nuclear front, on the humanitarian front,"
Bill Richardson,"It could be the case that one of these individuals misplaced the drives, ... What we now have is a potential cover-up, or some other factors that have to be determined."
Bill Richardson,"We're talking about a violent situation, ... We're talking about police being shot at. We're talking about a violent situation that has to be dealt with."
Bill Richardson,Senator Kerry is very relaxed. He's very much at peace. He's confident. He feels the debates have gone well. He's looking forward to the Boston Red Sox winning.
Bill Richardson,Ignorance has always been the weapon of tyrants; enlightenment the salvation of the free.
Bill Richardson,is ready to exercise all options.
Bill Richardson,"A state's income level is directly linked to the education levels of its residents. And we must support our schools - with real, tangible resources. There's no way of getting around that fact. And if you cut school spending during tough times, your state is going to suffer. Poverty rates will increase. Property crime will increase."
Bill Richardson,"We cannot have a full economic recovery, we cannot ensure the security of this country, while the states are in the midst of the worst fiscal crisis in half a century. Direct aid to cash-strapped states is perhaps the most direct way to immediately jump-start an ailing economy."
Bill Richardson,He always had the courage to ask the tough questions and demand answers. He set a high standard for TV journalists and his influence will be felt for generations to come.
Bill Richardson,Iraq is pushing this issue to the brink and there's going to be some grave consequences.
Bill Richardson,I'm also sending a message to the Congress and the American people that we will do everything we can to guard our nation's secrets.
Bill Richardson,"The rivalry is there, but at the same time we're trying to help each other. It's just healthy competition."
Bill Richardson,Every dollar governors are forced to cut out of our budgets is a dollar that's not going into the economy. . . . Every job that must be cut is another statistic in already escalating unemployment figures. . . . Every person who loses the support and services on which they rely for their livelihood and security leaves us poorer as a people and as a nation.
Bill Richardson,"I'm not going to blame the president, ... Our system is so bureaucratic that it's difficult to get things done."
Bill Richardson,"I think it's unfair to blame President Bush here, ... What I would blame is the bureaucratic red tape throughout the system that is out of control with little credibility and way too turf-conscience. Rather than point fingers in blame, the state and the federal governments need to develop a new emergency system."
Bill Richardson,"Granted, it's not going to be enough, but I believe, with the sheriff's department of the four counties that I issued the executive order, overtime pay, additional staffing of $1.7 million dollars, I think we're going to do a lot better job,"
Bill Richardson,"I don't believe that these profits that are being generated are being done without some kind of manipulation,"
Bill Richardson,"The coalition has reunited itself because of Iraqi behavior, ... We believe that there's strong unanimity and consensus on the council that Iraq's behavior has been unacceptable."
Bill Richardson,"I need full authority. I don't care what is holding it up. We just need to get it done -- this is for the national interest. I'm just stating a fact. It's not authorized,"
Bill Richardson,"We believe this is a good agreement, ... we see the British initiative as a good way to enforce the agreement."
Bill Richardson,"This is inexcusable; I'm outraged, ... It's incomprehensible what happened. I'm going to take action. I'm going to get to the bottom of this. There's going to be accountability."
Bill Richardson,"The president has directed me to initiate the order, ... There will be enforcement action if the order is not carried out."
Bill Richardson,"The stability of Asia, the future of Japan and the security of America will be determined by our ability to convince the North Koreans once and for all to dismantle their nuclear program, ... That is the goal of the six-party talks which I support and that is the message I will be carrying."
Jason Richardson,"This is the result of an extremely personal matter. I deeply regret being involved in any situation that results in the embarrassment of my family, friends and fans, the Golden State Warriors and the NBA,"
Jason Richardson,It is do or die. The season is coming to an end. We still have an opportunity. It has to be a big trip for us.
Jason Richardson,"Can't expect any less. Former team. One guy traded from here. One wanted to be here, but had a money situation. You expect them to come out and play hard."
Jason Richardson,He's not afraid to make mistakes. It's amazing how he gets offensive rebounds. The moment he steps on the court he's playing hard.
Jason Richardson,"Of course the playoffs are still on our mind. We're in a position for the last playoff spot with a few other teams, but we can't worry about them. We just have to continue to go out and win games."
Jason Richardson,"I don't think we have that killer instinct mode. When we have teams down by 10, 15 we've got them on the ropes. We let them stay in the fight instead of knocking them out. We have to act like pit bulls. We have to keep swinging. We have to go for that killer punch."
Jason Richardson,"I'm only about 65-70 percent. I'll have to do other things besides scoring, because I hate sitting, but I haven't shown up the past four games."
Jason Richardson,"Maybe we're giving up too easy. I don't know what it is. I'm mentally worn down, (and) I'm playing on one knee. I just can't move, but I'm still on the court. I had a horrible game. I haven't showed up the last four games."
Jason Richardson,"They had good defense on me. Four seconds, you've got to get a shot up. I couldn't get the ball out of my hands and I couldn't get a good shot off."
Jason Richardson,"Once you beat a team like that once or twice, especially at their place, you get confidence about them, you get confidence against them. You know that you can play with them anytime."
Jim Richardson,The best description I ever heard about street cops is that they are high school jocks who couldn't leave the locker room.
Jim Richardson,"He wasn't flashy, kind of a quiet guy, but with a deep, deep resolve. He had the heart of a champion, with all the things you think a great athlete should be. â€¦ He was just the best. If there is a prototype for the Michigan man, I can't imagine anyone being more than that than Eric Namesnik. He will be missed for a long time."
Jim Richardson,But it won't be high-end fashion like Short Pump.
Jim Richardson,Terry is like family and the entire crew has certainly missed him. Terry and I have an incredible level of communication and he's the best leader of people I've ever known. He gets the most out of every sailor on the boat.
Jim Richardson,"At first, her body was not able to adapt to the workload. It's something she wasn't used to in high school. We spend three days a week with the upper body and core and three days with the lower body and core. She's come a long way."
Jim Richardson,"This is a great demonstration of the increased awareness and availability of renewable Fuels such as E85. With automakers like General Motors producing an abundance of flexible-fuel vehicles, we can help boost our country's agriculture industry, save the environment, and reduce our dependence on petroleum."

Kevin Richardson,"The travel industry is very dynamic and changing. There are a lot of opportunities where they might need to make investments to grow, and public markets can be very short-term in nature. Prides Capital is in it for the long run."
Kevin Richardson,"I thought about going to prep school, but I wanted to come here anyway, and I was just hoping for a chance, ... They seemed interested, and I came in thinking I'd only get one chance, so I tried to make the best of it and show what I could do."
Kevin Richardson,"It was called the Backstreet Market, and it was just like a local hangout. That was where the kids would drive their cars, hang out with their convertibles and listen to music. That's how we got ''Backstreet.'' We put ''Boys'' on it, because no matter how old we get, we'll always be boys."
Kevin Richardson,A.J.'s initial treatment is going very well. His doctors suggested it would be in A.J.'s best interest to take an additional two weeks in transitional care.
Kevin Richardson,Pegasus exemplifies the kind of company we look for as a part of our investment portfolio. We have a high regard for the quality of the business and management's focus on meeting customer needs in the dynamic travel industry.
Kevin Richardson,"We're not saying that you don't need coal, but when you do mine the coal there are responsibilities to it. It may cost a little more, but it is the right thing to do."
Kevin Richardson,"We can have technology, prosperity, nice homes and cars, but at the same time we must be conscious of what we are dumping into the water, the air and our food."
Kevin Richardson,They wanted to do a movie about the Backstreet Boys.

Kevin Richardson,My mom sang in high school choir and so did my father.
Kevin Richardson,"My father worked for the Diocese of Lexington, an Episcopal church - although we weren't Episcopalians - and he ran a summer camp in Eastern Kentucky."
Kevin Richardson,"In musical theater you have to be very big and very animated, while film and television are more toned down."
Kevin Richardson,"If we can get kids talking about conservation and doing it, they can have a great influence on their parents by lecturing them and pointing the finger."
Kevin Richardson,"I've always loved music, not necessarily just the Osmonds."
Kevin Richardson,"I wasn't originally taking drama, but the drama teacher asked me to audition for Bye, Bye Birdie. I did and got the lead role. Initially I was kind of scared, but once I did it I got bitten by the bug and loved it."
Kevin Richardson,"I wanted to help raise awareness, so I created an environmental foundation called Just Within Reach."
Kevin Richardson,I started playing in the band and learned to play piano by ear.
Kevin Richardson,"I sang in church choir all my life, through elementary school, junior high and high school."
Kevin Richardson,"I remember lying on the floor of the living room with headphones on when I was four or five years old, listening to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack."
Kevin Richardson,I just moved to Florida to seek out opportunities.
Kevin Richardson,"I haven't been to the camp since my father passed away in 1991, but I go back to Kentucky all the time. I want to live there eventually."
Kevin Richardson,"I have been taking classes and I'm familiar with stage, but I'm not as familiar with acting on camera."
Kevin Richardson,"I have been reading scripts, going to auditions and looking for the right opportunities."
Kevin Richardson,"I had been singing all my life, but I started acting in high school."
Kevin Richardson,I did Chicago on Broadway the year before last. That was a great opportunity and I had a blast.
Kevin Richardson,"I did an educational video with National Geographic a year and a half ago, and it will be distributed to a few thousand schools around the country."
Kevin Richardson,"I believe as human beings we are out of balance, out of synch with the earth."
Kevin Richardson,I am not a tree-hugger and I don't think mine is an extreme point of view.
Kevin Richardson,Florida has tons of entertainment opportunities because Walt Disney World and Universal Studios are there.
Kevin Richardson,"Eventually, I'd also like to produce."
Kevin Richardson,"Coal companies have a lot of power in the media, and unfortunately a lot of information doesn't get out."
Kevin Richardson,Cancer is just a horrible disease.
Kevin Richardson,But I would lie on the floor and analyze everything. I'd listen to all the strings and the background vocals on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack and try to pick out the different instruments.
Kevin Richardson,At Christmas our house is like a Donnie and Marie Christmas Special.
Kevin Richardson,My grandfather was in a barbershop quartet and my grandmother was in a gospel quartet with her sisters.
Mary Richardson,The voyage will offer the young people an exciting opportunity to expand their skills and knowledge of the world around them through tackling something new.
Mary Richardson,"When the students are gone for the summer, you can zip through town. I have had to leave home at least 45 minutes to an hour early in order to get through Greenville Boulevard because traffic has picked up."
Mary Richardson,The family has been here a year and a half and the boy was always sitting on the porch.
Mary Richardson,"Our standards have been on the cutting edge of service for two decades. With the JCAHO Gold Seal of Approval, our clients and employees are assured of our ongoing commitment to excellence."

Nolan Richardson,I hope I never have to watch that Pop Wright shoot like that again.
Nolan Richardson,"Panama played with their heart. That's why we won, ... Today, my players understood the system I've been trying to teach them."
Nolan Richardson,"They programmed him so hard. God, they wanted him to get to that NBA."
Nolan Richardson,"Basketball is all about decisions and we took the best ones, especially from the third quarter on."
Nolan Richardson,"In my estimation, he is truly one of the finest young basketball coaches around at this point in time."
Lionel Richie,Simplicity is the key to what I do.
Lionel Richie,Hana would be happy tonight.
Lionel Richie,"People, as critical as it looks, we're OK. We are in control, whether we feel it or not."
Lionel Richie,"Exactly when people are in turmoil is the time that the entertainment business has always been at its best. Because people don't want to be reminded every day that they are under siege, or that they're not having a great time of life."
Lionel Richie,"Taking time to sit back and watch and think about what you've seen is important. Traveling did a great deal to me. I found that when I travel and just sit in the corner and watch, a million ideas come to me."
Lionel Richie,"Lionel Richie, love song, OK, thank you very much, good-bye. And all of a sudden I realized that, in my career, what has made my career has always been the surprises."
Lionel Richie,"I find the greatest songs in the world come out of pain, and I don't like it! Here's what it does: It strips away all of your facade. It makes you so honest. It's cleansing."
Lionel Richie,"So much of my career has been about saying things the way people say them, using melodies not that I can sing but that the people can sing."
Mark Richt,I've learned to appreciate every victory. I'm not going to apologize for it. We've just got to get better.
Mark Richt,A lot of this game will be trying to make adjustments as quickly as possible after we find out some of the goodies they've got ready for us.
Mark Richt,"We're just trying to get better down there, ... We just need to get more (touchdowns). We're not going to get a touchdown every time, but we need to get a higher percentage of them."
Mark Richt,I'm trying to decide whether to be happy or sad. We have to be better than this or we will struggle.
Mark Richt,"I really believe he's the best one in the league. When you get some wins, it validates the talent you have."
Mark Richt,"I would say you're running it up if you've got your first-team players in the game with five minutes to go and you're up by 40. If you're still throwing bombs, maybe that's running it up. I think it's the defense's job to slow people down anyway."
Mark Richt,"I don't know if it's a concussion, but he got dinged enough that he didn't practice,"
Mark Richt,"I was a little befuddled, ... I've seen guys making plays all the time in practice, and I'm like, 'What's the problem?' But when you'd look at the tape, it really was just one guy making a mistake."
Mark Richt,"It's just different from anybody we've seen. Thankfully, we've had time to practice and prepare for it."
Mark Richt,"You have no prayer of simulating [in practice] everything they have done in the past,"
Mark Richt,"We have an opportunity this week, if we can find some way to win it, to clinch the Eastern Division. I don't know if that's going to happen or not. We just have to take inventory of who can play right now."
Mark Richt,[Georgia made] too many mistakes ... Hopefully we'll cut down on those [Thursday].
Mark Richt,"We had a better dress rehearsal today, less mistakes (than Wednesday) ... I feel like we're prepared as good as we can be at this point."
Mark Richt,I really am sincere when I say that it's wide-open. We want to keep a completely open mind but be as fair as we can.
Mark Richt,"When you're halfway through the year, and you haven't lost yet, I'm sure it's in the back of your mind, but you have to keep it in the back of your mind,"
Mark Richt,There are a couple key offensive tackles I would love to have at this point.
Mark Richt,"The Virginia and the Georgia jobs were coming open, which one did I think ... I said, 'Well, the Virginia job's a great one, you ought to go after that.'"
Mark Richt,"When D.J. first got hurt, it was sad. We didn't know how bad, he didn't know how bad it was. We were thinking his career at Georgia could be over right then and there. That would have been awful. We would have tried to sugarcoat it as best we could, but it would have been sad for him and for us."
Mark Richt,"I know (Gant) was hurt bad,"
Mark Richt,"I wanted to make sure he knew I believe in him. I hope he knows that, but sometimes, in that moment, you need a little encouragement."
Mark Richt,"I hope I'm here ... It's a great game. They have an SEC-like stadium and fan base, so it's pretty much like we're used to."
Mark Richt,I hope I'm here
Mark Richt,We didn't really do a good job of telling everybody to keep it hush-hush. We just wanted to honor him tonight and show our support.
Mark Richt,"It wasn't as relaxing of a summer I would like. I hate it when a guy misbehaves. I hate when my own child misbehaves. The bottom line is we're dealing with kids and we're dealing with human beings, and they are going to make mistakes. That's inevitable."
Mark Richt,Kirby did a great job with our backs during the past year. We hate to lose him but at the same time recognize the opportunity he has and wish him nothing but the best.
Mark Richt,There's definitely some differences in style. That may give us grief in terms of preparation.
Mark Richt,"My goal is not to cause somebody grief or to make anyone upset, ... My goal is to love these guys and put them in a situation where they can grow up to be the best men they can be. We are an authority over them, and I have influence over them, and I take that responsibility seriously."
Mark Richt,"No coordinator can say he's got to stop our run game because we can't pass. And no one can say if we stop their pass, there's no way they can run well enough to beat us. We're good enough in both to make teams play us honestly."
Mark Richt,"No coordinator can say he's got to stop our run game because we can't pass, ... And no one can say if we stop their pass, there's no way they can run well enough to beat us. We're good enough in both to make teams play us honestly."
Mark Richt,Without him we don't win this game.
Mark Richt,We've never done that. It's not a bad idea. I've never thought to do that but maybe in the future we will.
Mark Richt,"It's a lot more fun to be in it than not, and it's a lot more fun to win it than lose it."
Mark Richt,"It's no fun to lose, ... We haven't lost in a while and now we get to remember what it feels like. Everybody wants to be undefeated and that's what we wanted. There are no excuses."
Mark Richt,It's not very often in our league that one team will become a dominant force in any given year for more than a year.
Mark Richt,We played a great football team. They executed beautifully.
Mark Richt,"I am very excited about what's going to happen with D.J. Shockley, ... He is a great football player. I'm just happy for him. You know, guys can mope about the situation, or guys can decide, 'I just don't want to be here,' and take off. He didn't do that. Not only did he stay, but he thrived at Georgia. He is in great shape academically, and he has won community service awards for us. He's just a fantastic guy, a great man. He's probably the most respected player we have on the team."
Mark Richt,"He's grown up a Bulldog. His grandfather, his father, his uncle all played for Georgia, Georgia football is in his blood. I think it does help."
Mark Richt,"We played a great football team tonight. They executed beautifully. If I wasn't coaching against them, I really would have enjoyed watching it because they did a great job."
Mark Richt,The open date is a tremendous advantage. They'll be more rested. They'll be a fresher football team. They'll probably have a better plan than they would have had with a week's notice.
Mark Richt,"The good news, ... is that some guys have been able to come in and get some experience."
Mark Richt,He comes from a top level program and has a lot of experience on the offensive side of the ball.
Mark Richt,Going for the fake punt showed a lot of guts and great execution. You've got to give them credit.
Mark Richt,"It was his first start in a hostile environment, and he did pretty darned good."
Mark Richt,"Gerald is a high-energy guy who is very strong and he's been leading us beautifully,"
Mark Richt,"He's a high-energy guy and he's been leading us beautifully. He's been keeping people off our linebackers, and he's really playing pretty well so far."
Mark Richt,We're pulling him off of that duty right now.
Mark Richt,"We have rules that must be adhered to by all members of our team. It's sometimes an unpleasant duty of a coach, but discipline is an important part of team unity and ultimately, team success. Hopefully, an important lesson is learned that will be of benefit in the future."
Mark Richt,There's no doubt Joe T is the No. 1 guy going in. He's got a lot of things going for him.
Mark Richt,"Without a doubt, he was our player of the game."
Mark Richt,"We put the onus on the defense one more time and they made the plays again, thankfully. Running game, field position, defense. It isn't pretty sometimes."
Mark Richt,dedicated to improving Jeff's employability ... elsewhere!
Mark Richt,"We might have the only kickoff team in the country that doesn't have any linebackers running down there,"
Mark Richt,"When you start talking about national implications, we really don't have much control over that at all."
Mark Richt,We control our destiny still. That's where you want to be.
Mark Richt,"I think he's still a relatively young kicker, ... It's good to have the confidence to know he can make that kind of kick."
Mark Richt,"A.J. Bryant is a player waiting to happen. If he gets a little confidence going and a couple of catches, he can really do some big things for us."
Mark Richt,I think it is very possible. Very conceivable. Game days are what separate guys. [The competition] is even enough ... I didn't feel like anybody was pulling away by a long shot in the spring.
Mark Richt,"The only competition that (Stafford) is doing right now is just trying to learn what to do. The other three guys, even four guys when you count (walk-on Nick) Dalton, have a lot better idea of what to do, even on the basics of calling the cadence. He's a talented passer. I think we all know that, and you can tell he's going full speed as far as trying to learn, but there's so much to learn in such a short amount of time."
Mark Richt,"I don't think a playoff is the answer, ... I like college football the way it is. I really do. The regular season in college football is better than any sport in America, maybe the world."
Mark Richt,"I think Florida's intentions were to use a lot of the things (West Virginia coach Rich) Rodriguez is doing, but Chris Leak's talents didn't really jibe with that."
Mark Richt,"I'm real excited about this class, mainly because of the numbers. We really covered every major position other than the kickers. If these guys unite as a team, behave like they should and work hard like they should, we should be something special three or four years down the road."
Mark Richt,It'll be more important for next year's class. You're in the first year of an eight-year contract rather than the fourth year of an eight-year contract. There is a huge difference in those two things.
Mark Richt,We just had to hang on for dear life today. It's not fun to see your boys go down. I also have to give a lot of credit to Arkansas. I tried to tell everyone how fast they were.
Mark Richt,"It's some of our guys first game on the road, and it really can jolt your body,"
Mark Richt,"He think that's his most natural position, ... He likes (the middle) the best. His body type you wouldn't draw up for a (middle linebacker), but he lays the wood probably better than any of our linebackers"
Mark Richt,"It's some of our guys' first game on the road, and it really can jolt your body."
Mark Richt,"If you believe he is a great player and very good person and a hard worker and he is only 20 points away [on the SAT] and not a qualifier on signing day ... if you don't sign him, you probably will have someone else who will. And he'll play against you."
Mark Richt,I think West Virginia was extremely excited. They brought a little more emotion in the beginning.
Mark Richt,"I liken what's happening there to what's happening to our men's basketball team and Coach [Dennis] Felton. He's building the program and getting guys who do things right to make a foundation which will last for a long, long time."
Mark Richt,"If he'd had a few more balls caught throughout the year, who knows what kind of year he could have had."
Mark Richt,"That was enough adversity for a team without a lot of character and leadership to fold up, ... and they never did."
Mark Richt,"I'm proud of our guys. You always wonder how your team is going to react to some adversity. We were losing at the half, but the guys did a great job of doing what they had to do to win. Some people may not think it's a beautiful victory, but it is to me."
Mark Richt,That's a great advantage over just showing up when two-a-days begin in the fall. He'll have a good working knowledge of the system. He'll get used to the other players. He'll get used to the college life. He'll be able to work out over the summer with the team and build a good rapport.
Mark Richt,It's been good enough to make the play-action pass legitimate. We've done some good things. Our backs have done some good things overall. Not many people can line up and run over people down after down. We're more into having good balance.
Mark Richt,"Overall, it was fairly sloppily played offensively, but there was some beauty in our ability to run the ball."
Mark Richt,"With Shockley, he becomes a weapon himself with his ability to run above and beyond the basics, ... You've got to be an accurate passer, you've got to be a good decision-maker, you've got to be able to handle the pressure of the job and you've got to be a leader. He is all those things, plus he has the bonus of being able to run. It's exciting for us."
Mark Richt,"When I'm looking for a quarterback, the first thing I look for is the ability to throw the football. That's something that most people take as a given, but it's something you've got to have. From the film I saw on Matthew, he makes every throw you can ask a guy to make."
Mark Richt,A lot of people doubted his ability to handle the academic rigors at our school. He's proven he can do that and be a fantastic All-American football player and be a fantastic citizen. He's got a heart for young people. He wants to give back. He's just a great credit to this program and our university.

Alan Rickman,I have a love/hate relationship with white silk.
Alan Rickman,"Acting is about giving something away, handing yourself over to whatever role you are asked to play. I'm not hiding or escaping or seeking anonymity.

Alan Rickman,"I was 7, and I remember being given a part in a play and thinking, This is exciting."
Alan Rickman,"I want to swim in both directions at once. Desire success, court failure."
Alan Rickman,I think worrying things are going on in England - a real apathy.
Alan Rickman,I don't think it's right that everybody knows everything about me.
Alan Rickman,Each character I play has different dimensions. I'm not interested in words that pull them together.
Alan Rickman,My parents certainly didn't have anything to do with the theater. I'm some kind of accident.
Alan Rickman,You can lull the paying customers as long as they get slapped.
Alan Rickman,Who I am gets in the way of people looking innocently at the parts I play.
Alan Rickman,When I get off the plane in England I always feel about two inches shorter.
Alan Rickman,What's interesting about the process of acting is how often you don't know what you're doing.
Alan Rickman,What is it about actors? God knows I get bored with actors talking about themselves.
Alan Rickman,There's a voice inside you that tells you what you should do.
Alan Rickman,Talent is an accident of genes - and a responsibility.
Alan Rickman,Somebody with Debbie Reynolds' features doesn't get cast as the Wicked Witch.
Alan Rickman,On film you put all your energies into a single glance.
Alan Rickman,"If you could build a house on a trampoline, that would suit me fine."
Alan Rickman,Acting touches nerves you have absolutely no control over.
Hyman Rickover,"The devil is in the details, and everything we do in the military is a detail"
Hyman Rickover,Good ideas are not adopted automatically. They must be driven into practice with courageous patience.
Hyman Rickover,"If you're going to sin, sin against God, not the bureaucracy; God will forgive you but the bureaucracy won't."
Paul Ricoeur,Wisdom finds its literary expression in wisdom literature.
Paul Ricoeur,What must be the nature of the world... if human beings are able to introduce changes into it?
Paul Ricoeur,"This is perhaps the most profound meaning of the book of Job, the best example of wisdom."
Paul Ricoeur,The text is a limited field of possible constructions.
Paul Ricoeur,"The narrative constructs the identity of the character, what can be called his or her narrative identity, in constructing that of the story told. It is the identity of the story that makes the identity of the character."
Paul Ricoeur,The moral law commands us to make the highest possible good in a world the final object of all our conduct.
Paul Ricoeur,The logic of validation allows us to move between the two limits of dogmatism and skepticism.
Paul Ricoeur,The Law is one aspect of a much more concrete and encompassing relation than the relation between commanding and obeying that characterizes the imperative.
Paul Ricoeur,Testimony should be a philosophical problem and not limited to legal or historical contexts where it refers to the account of a witness who reports what he has seen.
Paul Ricoeur,Testimony gives something to be interpreted.
Paul Ricoeur,Testimony demands to be interpreted because of the dialectic of meaning and event that traverses it.
Paul Ricoeur,"So long as the New Testament served to decipher the Old, it was taken as an absolute norm."
Paul Ricoeur,Ordinary language carries with it conditions of meaning which it is easy to recognize by classifying the contexts in which the expression is employed in a meaningful manner.
Paul Ricoeur,"On a cosmic scale, our life is insignificant, yet this brief period when we appear in the world is the time in which all meaningful questions arise."
Paul Ricoeur,"Narrative identity takes part in the story's movement, in the dialectic between order and disorder."
Paul Ricoeur,"Myth expresses in terms of the world - that is, of the other world or the second world - the understanding that man has of himself in relation to the foundation and the limit of his existence."
Paul Ricoeur,Man is this plural and collective unity in which the unity of destination and the differences of destinies are to be understood through each other.
Paul Ricoeur,"It is always possible to argue against an interpretation, to confront interpretations, to arbitrate between them and to seek for an agreement, even if this agreement remains beyond our reach."
Paul Ricoeur,"If it is true that there is always more than one way of construing a text, it is not true that all interpretations are equal."
Paul Ricoeur,"For my own part, I abandon the ethics of duty to the Hegelian critique with no regrets; it would appear to me, indeed, to have been correctly characterized by Hegel as an abstract thought, as a thought of understanding."
Paul Ricoeur,"But myth is something else than an explanation of the world, of history, and of destiny."
Jim Riddle,Neighbors would pay the price for these farming practices.
Jim Riddle,"Most of the food we grow in this area is shipped out as low priced commodities, and most of the food purchased in the area is trucked in over 1,500 miles."
Jim Riddle,"The food is not as nutritious. The more nutrients that are retained, the healthier it is and it tastes better."
Randy Riddle,"Bill Crawford is the ideal Presbyterian minister. He's very humble, and he's a servant-based man in the way he moves, thinks and acts."
Randy Riddle,They are still in a life-saving mode. You can take that for what that means.
Randy Riddle,We're all here simply because we saw a need and had the time and commitment. I think a lot of people would love to do this if they could.
Sally Ride,"If girls are interested, they have the potential to go further, ... There are still lingering stereotypes that affect girls in middle school, and they lose interest in the subjects."
Sally Ride,"There are lots of opportunities out there for women to work in these fields, ... Girls just need support, encouragement and mentoring to follow through with the sciences."
Sally Ride,"Yes, I did feel a special responsibility to be the first American woman in space."
Sally Ride,"When you're getting ready to launch into space, you're sitting on a big explosion waiting to happen."
Sally Ride,"Well, we spend an awful lot of our time working and doing experiments. It's very busy up on the shuttle."
Sally Ride,"We can see cities during the day and at night, and we can watch rivers dump sediment into the ocean, and see hurricanes form."
Sally Ride,"Then during the mission itself, I used the space shuttle's robot arm to release a satellite into orbit."
Sally Ride,The view of Earth is spectacular.
Sally Ride,"The stars don't look bigger, but they do look brighter."
Sally Ride,The space shuttle is a better and safer rocket than it was before the Challenger accident.
Sally Ride,The pressure suit helps if something goes wrong during launch or re-entry - astronauts have a way to parachute off the shuttle. The suits protect you from loss of pressure in case of emergency.
Sally Ride,"The most anxious time was during launch, just because that is so dramatic."
Sally Ride,The food isn't too bad. It's very different from the food that the astronauts ate in the very early days of the space program.
Sally Ride,The astronauts who came in with me in my astronaut class - my class had 29 men and 6 women - those men were all very used to working with women.
Sally Ride,"Some astronauts sleep in sort of beds - compartments that you can open up and crawl into and then close up, almost like a little bedroom."
Sally Ride,"So most astronauts getting ready to lift off are excited and very anxious and worried about that explosion - because if something goes wrong in the first seconds of launch, there's not very much you can do."
Sally Ride,So most astronauts are astronauts for a couple of years before they are assigned to a flight.
Sally Ride,"So I saw many planets, and they looked just a little bit brighter than they do from Earth."
Sally Ride,So I decided on science when I was in college.
Sally Ride,"Once you are assigned to a flight, the whole crew is assigned at the same time, and then that crew trains together for a whole year to prepare for that flight."
Sally Ride,"On both of my flights, everything went very well."
Sally Ride,"On a standard space shuttle crew, two of the astronauts have a test pilot background - the commander and the pilot."
Sally Ride,"No, I think most astronauts recognize that the space shuttle program is very high-risk, and are prepared for accidents."
Sally Ride,"NASA has to approve whatever we wear, so there are clothes to choose from, like space shorts - we wear those a lot - and NASA T-shirts."
Sally Ride,"My background is in physics, so I was the mission specialist, who is sort of like the flight engineer on an airplane."
Sally Ride,It's easy to sleep floating around - it's very comfortable. But you have to be careful that you don't float into somebody or something!
Sally Ride,It takes a few years to prepare for a space mission.
Sally Ride,It takes a couple of years just to get the background and knowledge that you need before you can go into detailed training for your mission.
Sally Ride,"I was always very interested in science, and I knew that for me, science was a better long-term career than tennis."
Sally Ride,"I slept just floating in the middle of the flight deck, the upper deck of the space shuttle."
Sally Ride,I liked math - that was my favorite subject - and I was very interested in astronomy and in physical science.
Sally Ride,"I felt very honored, and I knew that people would be watching very closely, and I felt it was very, very important that I do a good job."
Sally Ride,I don't have any nicknames.
Sally Ride,"I do a lot of running and hiking, and I also collect stamps - space stamps and Olympics stamps."
Sally Ride,I didn't really decide that I wanted to be an astronaut for sure until the end of college.
Sally Ride,"For quite some time, women at NASA only had scientific backgrounds."
Sally Ride,"Even though NASA tries to simulate launch, and we practice in simulators, it's not the same - it's not even close to the same."
Sally Ride,Different astronauts sleep in different ways.
Sally Ride,"But when I wasn't working, I was usually at a window looking down at Earth."
Sally Ride,"But even in elementary school and junior high, I was very interested in space and in the space program."
Sally Ride,"Because I was a tennis player, Billie Jean King was a hero of mine."
Sally Ride,"After the Challenger accident, NASA put in a lot of time to improve the safety of the space shuttle to fix the things that had gone wrong."
Sally Ride,"All adventures, especially into new territory, are scary."
Sally Ride,I had both male and female heroes.
Sally Ride,"All adventures, especially into new territory, are scary"
Tom Ridge,"Today we announce the Homeland Security Advisory system,"
Tom Ridge,"And they are constantly evaluating procedures, both in the United States and elsewhere, to find gaps in our security posture that could be exploited."
Tom Ridge,for homeland security to be effective.
Tom Ridge,I'm confident that the terrorists are aware that from the curb to the cockpit we've got additional security measures that didn't exist a couple of years ago.
Tom Ridge,an idea on paper to a reality in large part.
Tom Ridge,"Our goal is to deter any potential attack with multiple layers of security and, based on what I have seen and heard, I can tell you that the security plans and arrangements and commitment of federal, state and local officials is very, very strong,"
Tom Ridge,"Biometrics not only accurately identifies and cross-checks travelers and potential terrorists before they enter our countries, but they also provide increased travel document security and important personal identity protections."
Tom Ridge,"While there are no indications that terrorists are planning similar attacks in the United States in the near term, we have asked train and rail operators in the country to be on a heightened state of alert,"
Tom Ridge,"It was serious enough from our perspective ... a credible enough theory that at least we ought to tell folks we are mindful of it and that you ought to be mindful of it out there as well,"
Tom Ridge,"When our incident management team and our coordination center was notified (of the explosion), within in a very short period of time ... we knew what was going on at the local (and) state level, ... We engaged immediately in conversations with the Coast Guard, the EPA, the Health and Human Services."
Tom Ridge,Liberty is the most precious gift we offer our citizens.
Tom Ridge,"Yeah, we weren't certain, ... Still, in the context of everything else (intelligence chatter and a terror attack in Saudi Arabia), we could not set it aside and dismiss it as not credible."
Tom Ridge,"More often than not we were the least inclined to raise it. Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment. Sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good, you don't necessarily put the country on alert, There were times when the White House was really aggressive about raising it, and we said, 'For that?' We often lost the argument."
Tom Ridge,"to date, there is no specific intelligence that tells us or indicates to us that the convention itself would be subject to an attack."
Tom Ridge,"Anybody that's spent any time combating terrorists ... will tell you that being old doesn't necessarily mean being irrelevant, ... Good intelligence can be appropriate, no matter how old it is."
Tom Ridge,"are the result of offensive intelligence and military operations overseas, as well as strong partnerships with our allies around the world, such as Pakistan."
Tom Ridge,"compared to previous threat reporting, these intelligence reports have provided a level of detail that is very specific."
Tom Ridge,"The quality of this intelligence, based on multiple reporting streams in multiple locations, is rarely seen and is alarming in both the amount and specificity of the information,"
Tom Ridge,The intelligence that we've received over the past several weeks is ... a series of general non-specific threats against the United States.
Tom Ridge,there was specific information regarding those flights.
Tom Ridge,"The passengers and crew are an emblem of America's great glory: freedom and patriotism demonstrated at its highest regard, ... Here upon this field of honor, lives were saved and heroes were made."
Tom Ridge,"We're going to continue the convoy of food and water, particularly water and ice, over the next several days, ... We are working with the state and local communities to determine the debris removal needs and we're prepared to do everything we can to accelerate that process."
Tom Ridge,"following a terrorism-related event, fear and panic can be expected from both patients and health care providers."
Tom Ridge,"Your characterization of it as being a significantly different threat environment, based on what we historically have heard, is absolutely correct, ... So there certainly is a diminution, reduction in the amount of intelligence, and the decibel level is lower."
Tom Ridge,"It's the responsibility of our staff to plan and prepare this being almost a permanent part of our environment in the future,"
Tom Ridge,"Bush is willing to tackle the tough issues -- the ones some leaders refuse to touch, ... Issues such as real education reform, national security and defense, preserving Social Security and restoring America's values to government."
Tom Ridge,"There is a continuous stream of reporting, literally from the last two years, that indicates [terrorists'] preference or desire to use aircraft as a means of attack, ... American Morning."
Tom Ridge,"I can't imagine a better place to begin the renewal of America's purpose than the cradle of American democracy,"
Tom Ridge,do all we can to honor those who rose up with resolve to defeat evil.
Tom Ridge,"Let us to do all we can to honor all those who rose up with resolve to defeat evil, who were released into the arms of angels to see the grateful face of God,"
Tom Ridge,We'll be ready to answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.
Tom Ridge,"We realize that's a vulnerability that could be exploited with potentially catastrophic consequences,"
Tom Ridge,requesting some $36.2 billion clearly communicates this administration's commitment to investing in our Homeland Security.
Tom Ridge,"Clearly, Canada is not going to send troops to Iraq. That's just a fact and you've made that decision ... so that's off the table. But maybe we re-engage on softwood, re-engage on missile defense. It's an opportunity."
Tom Ridge,"We know they have the capability to succeed and they also hold the mistaken belief that their attacks will have an impact on America's resolve,"
Tom Ridge,"unify people, priorities and programs under a single line of authority."
Tom Ridge,"If you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 percent approval rating, you shouldn't be surprised if the election goes against you."
Tom Ridge,"[â€¢ The U.S. homeland is better protected. America has become a land scoured, probed, patrolled and fenced by a web of informers, computers, guards, spies, tape recorders, detectors, sensors, Jersey barriers, concrete planters and bomb-sniffing dogs. It may have nipped some plots in the bud and deterred others.] We look differently as a country now to the terrorists, ... We have created security measures unlike the terrorists have seen before, and we continue to upgrade them."
Tom Ridge,the best way to protect America.
Tom Ridge,"Protecting this information is critically important. Shut them down and you shut down America as we know it,"
Tom Ridge,"I think for a long time we thought we were 'fortress America' and that we were impenetrable. Maybe in our heart of hearts we knew sooner or later that it was going to happen, ... But to take a look at the president and extraordinary vice president ... I couldn't think of a better team at a tougher time to be leading America, so I'm optimistic about it."
Tom Ridge,"America understands and hopefully appreciates, ... when there is that kind of information, we share it no matter how incomplete it may be."
Tom Ridge,"If America has the opportunity to make a strategic investment that not only enhances security but makes us a better, safer, stronger, or healthier country, then we need to do that. If you secure every home town, then the homeland is secure."
Tom Ridge,"There will always be more to do, but today, America is significantly stronger and safer than ever before,"
Tom Ridge,to make North America more secure and more prosperous.
Tom Ridge,I'm honored to join the extraordinary team you've assembled to lead America. The size and scope of this challenge are immense ... an extraordinary mission. But we will carry it out.
Tom Ridge,very interested in any technology that can help create a safer and more secure America.
Tom Ridge,"This enforcement action represents an outstanding example of international cooperation in disrupting the proliferation of radiological material,"
Tom Ridge,Trust is a great force multiplier.
Leni Riefenstahl,I was fascinated by the effects that could be achieved by editing. The cutting room became a magic workshop for me.
Leni Riefenstahl,Your deeds exceed the power of human imagination. They are without equal in the history of mankind. How can we (the German people) ever thank you?
Leni Riefenstahl,"I feel as though I have lived many lives, experienced the heights and depths of each and like the waves of the ocean, never known rest. Throughout the years, I have looked always for the unusual, for the wonderful, for the mysteries at the heart of life."
Leni Riefenstahl,"I set about seeking a thread, a theme, a style, in the realm of legend. Something that might allow me to give free rein to my juvenile sense of romanticism and the beautiful image."
Leni Riefenstahl,"I want to see, that's all. This is my life. I want to see."
Leni Riefenstahl,Reality doesn't interest me.
Leni Riefenstahl,"I am fascinated by what is beautiful, strong, healthy, what is living. I seek harmony."
Leni Riefenstahl,In 1934 people were crazy and there was great enthusiasm for Hitler. We had to try and find that with our camera.
Leni Riefenstahl,"My desire to dive with an oxygen cylinder was so intensive that I decided to use a trick. Registering as Helene Jacob, I lied about my age: instead of 1902, I wrote 1922 in the application forms. My rejuvenation not withstanding, the scuba instructor eyed me skeptically; he was probably thinking: She'll never make it."
Leni Riefenstahl,Through my optimism I naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life.
Leni Riefenstahl,"The applause was so loud and insistent that I had to respond with several encores. I was numb with happiness, when it was over, I knew that this alone must be my life and my world."
Leni Riefenstahl,To my dear Fuhrer with deepest admiration.
Malcolm Rifkind,Of course there is a risk. But ... neither Gordon Brown nor Tony Blair had even been a junior minister before they took up their present responsibilities. So sometimes these risks are justified.
Malcolm Rifkind,The future is not what it used to be.
Malcolm Rifkind,"Ken Clarke has the popular appeal, he has the experience, he's an obvious person who can handle Gordon Brown who will be Prime Minister by the time of the next election."
Malcolm Rifkind,"His experience and outstanding personal qualities make him ideally qualified to lead the U.N. in tackling the many urgent tasks which it currently faces,"
Malcolm Rifkind,"It is the single biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez,"
Malcolm Rifkind,"It's not our gold, we don't own it and therefore we don't have the ability to simply by ourselves decide what should happen to it."
John Riggins,"[Riggins, you can tell, is rooting for Williams. After all, the Redskins wanted to trade Riggins when he got back -- and he ended up as a Super Bowl MVP and went to the Hall of Fame. Maybe Williams will reclaim his spot and lead the Dolphins to something glorious.] I don't know what it is that T.O. believes in, ... but I take my hat off to Ricky Williams. I want to believe Ricky. I really do."
John Riggins,"I think T.O. likes somebody to hold his hand. It might have taken nothing more than for [Eagles Coach] Andy Reid and [team president] Joe Banner to go hold his hand. The Eagles could have called everybody in, sat T.O. down and told him, 'T.O., we will never forget what you did for us last year, especially putting your career on the line like that to play in the Super Bowl coming back from such a severe injury.' And for that matter, they could have worked out a little deal the rest of us would never have known about. But the Eagles were immutable on the matter . . . totally intractable."
John Riggins,"Come on, Sandy, baby, loosen up. You're too tight."
Leonard Riggio,We're not hurting at this moment for management or for vision.
Leonard Riggio,The joy of an afternoon at the races now means being in the owner's box of a very empty racetrack.
Leonard Riggio,"Our strong commitment to continuing to create shareholder value is evidenced by the declaration of our first ever cash dividend. This dividend, supported by the company's excellent free cash flow and strong balance sheet, reflects our confidence in the future growth of Barnes & Noble,"
Leonard Riggio,"Our record third-quarter retail earnings were fueled by industry-leading comparable-store sales and illustrate our ability to execute in this market sector,"
Bobby Riggs,"If I can't play for big money, I play for a little money. And if I can't play for a little money, I stay in bed that day."
Bobby Riggs,"If I am to be a chauvinist pig, I want to be the number one pig."
Bobby Riggs,Billie and I did wonders for women's tennis. They owe me a piece of their checks.
Jacob Riis,"When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before."
Jacob Riis,"The more I live, the more I think that humor is the saving sense."
Jacob Riis,"It is through the Boys' Club that the street is hardest hit. In the fight for the lad, it is the Club which knocks out the 'gang,' using the weapon of organization."
Frank Rijkaard,"I can't fault my players. We created a lot of chances but we missed out on a victory because of the woodwork and goalkeeper Bonano, who did very well."
Frank Rijkaard,I am very happy with the team because they have shown their talent.
Frank Rijkaard,The game was more open before the sending off. We just didn't have enough patience or perhaps we have to improve our lack of luck in front of goal.
Frank Rijkaard,We did the job we had to do.
Frank Rijkaard,"I have played a lot of times against Milan as a player and coach, so it's really just another game."
Bob Riley,"Victims of domestic violence need support and effective services, ... I'm pleased to make these funds available to SABRA Sanctuary to assist their work in west Alabama."
Bob Riley,"If a child lives less than two miles, the parent has the responsibility to get that child to school. A school bus is just something people consider an easy solution."
Bob Riley,"Alabama has been providing immediate and life-saving services to our neighbors and affected Alabama citizens in the wake of this disaster, ... Getting vital health-care services to these victims continues to be a priority for our state. The best and most efficient way to accomplish that is to support the state programs and the local health-care providers already in place."
Bob Riley,Government does not create jobs. It only helps create the conditions that make jobs more or less likely.
Bob Riley,"I firmly believe God puts different people in different parts of history so great things can happen, ... I think Rosa Parks is one of those people."
Bob Riley,"The men and women who serve in our military have won for us every hour we live in freedom, sometimes at the expense of the very hours of the lifetimes they had hoped to live."
Bob Riley,"there is no reason -- no jobs, no food -- no reason for them to stay."
Bob Riley,"I think you'd change Alabama fundamentally if in six years someone said, 'If you want the best education in America, you've got to live in Alabama.' you'd change economic development, change the image of this state, you'd offer these kids an opportunity they otherwise would never have had."
Bob Riley,"When I proposed this amendment to the Legislature, it simply removed segregationist language from our constitution -- something I hope all Alabamians would support."
Bob Riley,"I had his cell phone; he had mine, ... There was just a constant communication."
Bob Riley,"Alabama is fortunate to have a world-class company like Toyota located here, ... It has a great team of dedicated workers who are helping to propel Alabama's economy forward. The state is proud to be a partner in the company's continuing success."
Bob Riley,"In a time of tight budgets, difficult choices have to be made. We must make sure our very limited resources are spent on priorities. I believe we should have no higher priority than investing in our children's classrooms and in their future."
Bob Riley,The opponents of my budget propose taking $200 million out of our classrooms and instead spending it on a larger school employee pay raise. Our focus should be on making sure our children come first.
Bob Riley,"If we are going to save this country, if we are going to reestablish that belief in God, it's up to us. If we don't do it, who will?"
Bob Riley,No skill shapes a child's future success in school or in life more than the ability to read.
Bob Riley,I have long believed that sacrifice is the pinnacle of patriotism.
Jack Riley,"[K. Jack Riley, a homeland security expert at Rand Corp., said hardened cockpit doors, air marshals and stronger public vigilance will prevent another 9/11-style hijacking.] Frankly, the preeminent security challenge at this point is keeping explosives off the airplane, ... recognize the reality that we know that air transportation security has changed post-9/11. Most of these rules don't contribute to security."
Jack Riley,[Cameras] have huge post-incident investigation value and potential prosecution value. One of the reasons the London authorities have made the progress that they've made is because of the images they had on the camera.
Jack Riley,"The notion that you can, with 100 percent certainty, prevent this kind of incident from happening in the U.S. or anywhere else is absurd,"
Jack Riley,What we're beginning to see is people traveling great distances to get pseudoephedrine.
Mike Riley,I hope Andy Darkins can come back and play from that. Right now we can't count on that. I'm hoping it's a worst-case scenario bringing up he can't play.
Mike Riley,"It helps show students that with hard work, things that they want to do are attainable."
Mike Riley,"We are extremely pleased to have attained Gold Certified status in the Microsoft Partner Program, allowing us to further promote our expertise and relationship with Microsoft to our customer base. This distinction validates the market need for NEWS, our appliance management software subsystem, that has been developed to ease the deployment and unify configuration and management of Microsoft Windows server powered appliances."
Mike Riley,"He's hard-hitting, has good mobility, brings tremendous enthusiasm to the game and is never satisfied."
Mike Riley,"What it boils down to is the student's discipline and their right to privacy. Therefore if your child is involved in an incident on the bus, the camera is going to have other children on the tape and their rights would be violated if you as a parent came to view your child and everyone else was visible."
Ned Riley,"I think what we have is a recognition by investors that there is some decent value at this price. But whether they have the intestinal fortitude to stay during further adverse times is still unanswered, ... Today, they seem to have rallied based on the expectation that there is cheapness in some of these stocks."
Ned Riley,"I think what we have is a recognition by investors that there is some decent value at this price. But whether they have the intestinal fortitude to stay during further adverse times is still unanswered. Today, they seem to have rallied based on the expectation that there is cheapness in some of these stocks."
Ned Riley,"This would be a short-term stimulus to personal computer manufacturers, semiconductors and the whole gamut of technology companies."
Ned Riley,The Federal Reserve is not here to support the stock market. This move yesterday (Wednesday) was done for economic reasons.
Ned Riley,The economic strength that we've seen in the last six weeks has been what I call deflationary.
Ned Riley,It should be evident by now that the rest of the earnings are going to come in at the same sort of magnitude over estimates. The focus is going to shift.
Ned Riley,These companies are boxed in by poor past forecasts and lack of visibility.
Ned Riley,Everybody knows the second quarter is going to be miserable but there's a sliver of optimism on the part of investors that would hope that the commentary would be geared toward a better scenario.
Ned Riley,I think there's little room for mistakes.
Ned Riley,"patience, knowledge and a lot of research."
Ned Riley,The jobs report is the cornerstone of the week. But a lot happens ahead of it.
Ned Riley,"We're back to looking at the fundamentals and, at least temporarily, avoiding gossip and rumors."
Ned Riley,The Dow seems to be lifted because people are trying to resurrect the old growth stocks and giving them another try as a safe place to hide. The perception is that some of these companies are not currency- or energy-dependent enough for earnings to get hurt.
Ned Riley,"Investors are starting to exercise one of the golden rules of investing, ... And that's buying when the news is the bleakest."
Ned Riley,"It is another piece of good news in that it leaves the Fed in an unfettered position to exercise more discretion in monetary easing. Because the economy has displayed such weakness and inflation has been non-existent with the exception of energy-related prices, the short-term inflation number may be less relevant."
Ned Riley,"If the Fed is committed to slowing the economy, then I do think demand for technology will slow."
Ned Riley,"There's no conviction over earnings, ... You're going to get this vacillation back and forth as we're in this bottoming process and it's going to take some time."
Ned Riley,There's no conviction over earnings. You're going to get this vacillation back and forth as we're in this bottoming process and it's going to take some time.
Ned Riley,It's a conviction on the part of some that a lot of the stocks have reached such a downside level that they are discounting the worst of all scenarios. The enthusiasm is clearly restrained because the selling and anxiety continues so we've got a little short covering and selective buying.
Ned Riley,"I think they're waiting for Cisco, but they're also injecting their own level of certainty about the third quarter as being the turning point for the front end of technology stocks,"
Ned Riley,"I liked yesterday's action,"
Ned Riley,I do think we're searching for a bottom on the Nasdaq and the action looks good so far. I see a lot of stocks doing well and people are going bottom fishing. Interest rates matter and clearly the Federal Reserve needs to focus on the Nasdaq.
Pat Riley,You can't worry about it. You are going to see it. They have got to deal with teams that are committed to shutting them down. You have got to get stronger against it.
Pat Riley,You've got to have all your weapons against that team.
Pat Riley,(Walsh) is not going to become a little whip in this thing. He held out and got fair value.
Pat Riley,Shaq did a great job tonight. We have to make sure he's not in foul trouble and constantly look to go to him.
Pat Riley,We had a great fourth quarter defensively. We did not get into foul trouble early and made some really big defensive plays. They shot the ball extremely well tonight. We were down going into the fourth quarter and really raised the level of our defense.
Pat Riley,"It's an ongoing battle. It's becoming more and more and more difficult to do it. There's so much talent, so much ball-handling ability. There's so many things that officials allow perimeter players to get away with that it's difficult to guard the ball."
Pat Riley,"I think they've turned the corner. They've accumulated a tremendous amount of talent. Ever since (Thomas) has come here, the talent level has gone through the roof. That's all I know."
Pat Riley,I think they've turned the corner. They've acquired a tremendous amount of talent.
Pat Riley,"We're supposed to be one of the top teams in the league. We've assembled some of the top talent in the league. This team needs to understand that when we come to another team's arena, that it is a big event. We came in here and the Hornets took it from us."
Pat Riley,"As soon as we begin to struggle offensively or get a little bit discouraged, two or three things happen to us and we stop playing defense."
Pat Riley,"We got a break tonight. Bobby Simmons is a great player - Mo Williams - those two guys would have created a lot of problems for us. The thing about a speed team, if you can see them walking up and down the court, you've done something."
Pat Riley,"The voters will put in the best players, and the coaches will take care of the rest."
Pat Riley,I'd like my reputation to stay as it is and to be remembered for a wonderful decade.
Pat Riley,I should have played him in New Jersey. I regret that. He could have helped on (Vince) Carter.
Pat Riley,It's a reality we have to understand. (O'Neal) has to be more diligent. We have to be more diligent protecting him. We need him in the game.
Pat Riley,"We feel like with this trade we traded a lot, but we got back three quality players, ... Antoine Walker is one of the very best, multi-faceted, versatile players in this game."
Pat Riley,"We traded a lot, but we got back three quality players. Antoine Walker is one of the very best multi-faceted, versatile players in this game. ... He is able to handle the ball, pass it, make plays, shoot 3's and rebound the ball. There isn't anyone in this league better at doing that."
Pat Riley,"We feel like with this trade we traded a lot, but we got back three quality players. Antoine Walker is one of the very best, multi-faceted, versatile players in this game."
Pat Riley,"I can't judge by practice, because he doesn't practice."
Pat Riley,"The upside is there could be absolute power dominance inside. But the downside is somebody could say, 'OK, you're going to go big, I'm going to go with five guards -- one shooting center and four guards.' And then who's going to beat who first?"
Pat Riley,"Shaq is very active and motivated right now. There's a lot that's been written of his philosophy for the regular season. He really wants it, and he really wants the ball too."
Pat Riley,I've seen a lot of plays like that. I coached Magic Johnson.
Pat Riley,"I also believe Odom would complement Eddie Jones and Brian Grant, our two veteran leaders. As I have said before, we are committed to winning and will do whatever it takes to give our fans talented players and a great team."
Pat Riley,I think you're going to see that kind of series.
Pat Riley,I was very conscious of (players') minutes and in the end I was very conscious of health. Today is not a good barometer to judge us.
Pat Riley,I think the overall health is OK. Everybody has something wrong with them but it is not debilitating. We just have to keep our fingers crossed everyday that we can keep everybody on the court.
Pat Riley,"I'm really tired of talking about it. I hate to do it, but there's a huge double standard here. He turns in, it's a foul on him. And they're pushing and shoving on him all the time."
Pat Riley,"This is to see whether the two years, all the drill work and all the hard work have manifested itself into something positive for him. It should be something he should be eager to do."
Pat Riley,I'm not happy with it.
Pat Riley,People got a view of absolute greatness. It's absolutely beyond description. I haven't seen players do that in a long time.
Pat Riley,"I think people got a view of absolute greatness, back and forth. The bigger the moment, both of them stepped up even bigger and bigger."
Pat Riley,"When a milestone is conquered, the subtle erosion called entitlement begins its consuming grind. The team regards its greatness as a trait and a right. Half hearted effort becomes habit and saps a champion."
Pat Riley,"We feel that he will be able to play three positions for us, giving us added versatility in our quest for a championship. We will miss Gerald Fitch, who is a good young player, but this will be a great opportunity for him out there."
Pat Riley,"We feel that he will be able to play three positions for us, giving us added versatility."
Pat Riley,"He was at the rim all night. He has tremendous athleticism, strength, force and instincts."
Pat Riley,"He's incredible. He has no fear at the end and he simply wants to be put in that position. He was a way of making plays, he's just incredible."
Pat Riley,"I have complete faith. That's how I operate, that's how I coach. I had complete faith when we were 25 and whatever (in 2002-03), and I do now. I truly believe that when all the parts are healthy, I know how good we are. I've said it over and over again and I will continue to say it, I just think this team can do something special."
Pat Riley,"I have complete faith. That's how I operate, that's how I coach. I truly believe that when all the parts are healthy, I know how good we are. I've said it over and over again and I will continue to say it, I just think this team can do something special. And that's the way I'll keep thinking."
Pat Riley,This is the time of year the enthusiasm should be coming to an all-time high.
Pat Riley,I don't think I ever had any enjoyment in the playoffs until you won.
Pat Riley,"We didn't play the game with a lot of focused energy in the first half. I thought we were a little slow, we looked tired and (Cleveland) looked sharp and they were good."
Pat Riley,"If we had come back with the same team as last year, it would have been a disaster. We didn't have the firepower to sustain what we needed in this conference. Last year was a honeymoon year. A couple players had career years. I didn't believe we had the core of players like the core we have now. We have a lot more versatility now."
Pat Riley,We didn't play with great desire and we got our heads handed to us for the second game in a row. Crossroads No. 1 is where we're at right now.
Pat Riley,There are only two options regarding commitment. You're either in or you're out. There's no such thing as life in-between.
Pat Riley,"We as an organization will do just about anything to supply comfort, compassion, money and anything else we can to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The Spurs and the Heat getting together to put on this exhibition to raise as much money as we can for the victims is an indication of what both organizations and the NBA is all about."
Pat Riley,"But it's up to Shaquille, too. I mean, it's up to him. And this is where the old coach came out of Stu. He started using some coaching terminology. He said, 'Well, you've got to get him to make a V-cut every now and then. If he makes a V-cut, then they impede his progress, they'll call it."
Pat Riley,He kept telling me he's ready. But I'm a stubborn old coach.
Pat Riley,The demise of Shaquille O'Neal has been greatly exaggerated. I can guarantee you that - and I coach him.
Pat Riley,From nobody to upstart. From upstart to contender. From contender to winner. From winner to champion. From champion to Dynasty.
Pat Riley,"When a gifted team dedicates itself to unselfish trust and combines instinct with boldness and effort, its ready to climb."
Pat Riley,"The argument is they know what they're supposed to do. At least they tell you, 'We know what we're supposed to do.' So you back off a little bit on the real big muscle work that could cause them injury."
Pat Riley,"There's no such thing as coulda, shoulda, or woulda. If you shoulda and coulda, you woulda done it."
Pat Riley,Great effort springs naturally from a great attitude.
Pat Riley,"Look for your choices, pick the best one, then go with it."
Pat Riley,"There's always the motivation of wanting to win. Everybody has that. But a champion needs, in his attitude, a motivation above and beyond winning."
Pat Riley,Being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable.
Pat Riley,People who create 20% of the results will begin believing they deserve 80% of the rewards.
Pat Riley,You can never have enough talent.
Pat Riley,You have to defeat a great players aura more than his game.
Pat Riley,Discipline is not a nasty word.
Pat Riley,Don't let other people tell you what you want.
Pat Riley,Being ready isn't enough; you have to be prepared for a promotion or any other significant change.
Pat Riley,"There can only be one state of mind as you approach any profound test; total concentration, a spirit of togetherness, and strength."
Pat Riley,Management must speak with one voice. When it doesn't management itself becomes a peripheral opponent to the team's mission.
Pat Riley,"You have no choices about how you lose, but you do have a choice about how you come back and prepare to win again."
Pat Riley,"To have long term success as a coach or in any position of leadership, you have to be obsessed in some way."
Pat Riley,"Each Warrior wants to leave the mark of his will, his signature, on important acts he touches. This is not the voice of ego but of the human spirit, rising up and declaring that it has something to contribute to the solution of the hardest problems, no matter how vexing!"
Pat Riley,Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better.
Pat Riley,Great effort springs naturally from great attitude.
Pat Riley,The Ten Commandments were not a suggestion.
Pat Riley,"If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges."
Pat Riley,Giving yourself permission to lose guarantees a loss.
Pat Riley,"When a great team loses through complacency, it will constantly search for new and more intricate explanations to explain away defeat."
Pat Riley,"A particular shot or way of moving the ball can be a player's personal signature, but efficiency of performance is what wins the game for the team."
Pat Riley,A champion needs a motivation above and beyond winning.
Pat Riley,"This is about an experienced, savvy, talented team which I believe we have taking advantage of the opportunities out there. But one thing they cannot neglect is just how hard (Chicago) is going to play and the kind of effort they're going to have to make to stay with them."
Pat Riley,"I think we're beginning to learn more about individual performances by perimeter players who have the ability to do what he does... We have to do something different at times to take the ball out of his hands, force him into areas it's not as easy for him to get done what he gets done."
Richard Riley,"These numbers reflect real and substantial progress, ... They are the product of several aggressive management decisions that were intended to get the default problem under control."
Richard Riley,Our goal now is to keep up the pace and make sure that they are learning to these high standards all the way through to high school.
Richard Riley,underscores the importance of increasing efforts to support and expand early childhood learning.
Richard Riley,"Things have moved up considerably, ... The inclination of states to get in on the action is what moves them. But people in South Carolina are ready for a real, participatory democracy."
Richard Riley,"We must look at the stark reality that there is a continuing achievement gap between the rich and the poor, and between whites and minority students, ... This gap is a gaping hole in our commitment to fulfilling the American promise, and it will only get bigger if we do not close the digital divide as well."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"There is here no measuring with time, no year matters, and ten years are nothing. Being an artist means, not reckoning and counting, but ripening like the tree which does not force it's sap and stands confident in the storms of Spring without the fear that after them may come no Summer. It does come. I learn it daily, learn it with pain to which I am grateful…"
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Physical pleasure is a sensual experience no different from pure seeing or the pure sensation with which a fine fruit fills the tongue; it is a great unending experience, which is given us, a knowing of the world, the fullness and the glory of all knowing. And not our acceptance of it is bad; the bad thing is that most people misuse and squander this experience and apply it as a stimulant at the tired spots of their lives and as distraction instead of a rallying toward exalted moments."
Rainer Maria Rilke,We see the brightness of a new page where everything yet can happen.
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Truly to sing, that is a different breath."
Rainer Maria Rilke,The only journey is the one within.
Rainer Maria Rilke,"That is the principle thing - not to remain with the dream, with the intention, with the being-in-the-mood, but always forcibly to convert it into all things"
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions"
Rainer Maria Rilke,"God...sat down for a moment when the dog was finished in order to watch it... and to know that it was good, that nothing was lacking, that it could not have been made better."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"The future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens."
Rainer Maria Rilke,I'm so glad you're here. . .it helps me realize how beautiful my world is.
Rainer Maria Rilke,I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other
Rainer Maria Rilke,"The great renewal of the world will perhaps consist in this, that man and maid, freed of all false feelings and reluctances, will seek each other not as opposites, but as brother and sister, as neighbors, and will come together as human beings."
Rainer Maria Rilke,All emotions are pure which gather you and lift you up; that emotion is impure which seizes only one side of your being and so distorts you.
Rainer Maria Rilke,All emotions are pure which gather you and lift you up; that emotion is impure which seizes only one side of your being and so distorts you
Rainer Maria Rilke,Spring has returned. The Earth is like a child that knows poems.
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Destiny itself is like a wonderful wide tapestry in which every thread is guided by an unspeakably tender hand, placed beside another thread and held and carried by a hundred others."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves ... Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point it, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps, then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love; the more they give, the more they possess."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Ideally a painter (and, generally, an artist) should not become conscious of his insights: without taking the detour through his reflective processes, and incomprehensibly to himself, all his progress should enter so swiftly into the work that he is unable to recognize them in the moment of transition. Alas, the artist who waits in ambush there, watching, detaining them, will find them transformed like the beautiful gold in the fairy tale which cannot remain gold because some small detail was not taken care of."
Rainer Maria Rilke,A person isn't who they are during the last conversation you had with them - they're who they've been throughout your whole relationship.
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Do not assume that she who seeks to comfort you now, lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. Her life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, she would never have been able to find these words."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Just as language has no longer anything in common with the thing it names, so the movements of most of the people who live in cities have lost their connection with the earth; they hang, as it were, in the air, hover in all directions, and find no place where they can settle."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"When I saw others straining toward God, I did not understand it, for though I may have had him less than they did, there was no one blocking the way between him and me, and I could reach his heart easily. It is up to him, after all, to have us, our part consists of almost solely in letting him grasp us."
Rainer Maria Rilke,There are so many things about which some old man ought to tell one while one is little; for when one is grown one would know them as a matter of course.
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Believe that with your feelings and your work you are taking part in the greatest; the more strongly you cultivate this belief, the more will reality and the world go forth from it."
Rainer Maria Rilke,More belongs to marriage than four legs in a bed.
Rainer Maria Rilke,There are no classes in life for beginners;  right away you are always asked to deal with what is most difficult
Rainer Maria Rilke,Perhaps everything terrible is in its deepest being something helpless that wants help from us.
Rainer Maria Rilke,One had to take some action against fear when once it laid hold of one.
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Everything is blooming most recklessly; if it were voices instead of colors, there would be an unbelievable shrieking into the heart of the night."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky."
Rainer Maria Rilke,"Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other."
Nick Rimando,"I got a piece of it, but I was thinking it had enough power on it to go in, ... I'm looking back there and just hoping someone gets to it pretty quickly."
Nick Rimando,The thing that's on my mind now is the (United-Galaxy) game. It grounds us a little bit.
Nick Rimando,"[The Fire's 10 goals against United are by far the most of any team, and more than one-quarter of the entire season total conceded by D.C.] They've broken us down this whole year, ... So I guess we're going to try not to have a high-scoring game for our part, but we're going to try to find the goal as much as we can. They're a very attacking team, and they have some good forwards."
Nick Rimando,"He's still young. Sometimes you see him do so well in games and turn games around â€” and the next time you see him not do as well. You know what the kid has and what he can bring, and I think sometimes the coaches might get frustrated with that. I think he gets frustrated himself."
Nick Rimando,"It's big for our confidence, it's big for our heads, ... and hopefully it will get something started for us again."
Nick Rimando,I can't believe Bobby Rhine didn't see him [Jamil Walker] on the sideline and when the ref blew the whistle I just tried to hit a good enough ball to Jamil. I thought he was going to go in but he gave a great touch and played the ball to Santino in the middle.
Arthur Rimbaud,"The first study for the man who wants to be a poet is knowledge of himself, complete: he searches for his soul, he inspects it, he puts it to the test, he learns it. As soon as he has learned it, he must cultivate it! I say that one must be a seer, make oneself a seer. The poet becomes a seer through a long, immense, and reasoned derangement of all the senses. All shapes of love suffering, madness. He searches himself, he exhausts all poisons in himself, to keep only the quintessences. Ineffable torture where he needs all his faith, all his superhuman strength, where he becomes among all men the great patient, the great criminal, the great accursed one--and the supreme Scholar! For he reaches the unknown! ....So the poet is actually a thief of Fire!"
Arthur Rimbaud,Genius is the recovery of childhood at will.
Arthur Rimbaud,"And again: No more gods! no more gods! Man is King, Man is God! - But the great Faith is Love!"
Arthur Rimbaud,One evening I sat Beauty on my knees /And I found her bitter /And I reviled her.
Arthur Rimbaud,One evening I sat Beauty on my knees --And I found her bitter --And I reviled her.
Robert Ringer,"Reality isn't the way you wish things to be, nor the way they appear to be, but the way they actually are."
Robert Ringer,"If you are prepared, then you are able to feel confident."
Robert Ringer,"People say they love truth, but in reality they want to believe that which they love is true."
Lisa Rinna,I'm giving you the best looking couple of the night award.
Lisa Rinna,"It's really a lifestyle show, and we just have a lot of fun."
Lisa Rinna,My body has gone into things and done things that I never would have imagined ever in life.
Kelly Ripa,My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
Kelly Ripa,I had a picture-perfect childhood. My parents were like June and Ward Cleaver; there was nothing dysfunctional about them.
Kelly Ripa,"[Since Oprah Winfrey said last month that she would no longer make monthly book picks, new clubs have been formed by USA Today, the] Today ... Live With Regis & Kelly."
Kelly Ripa,I'm not a prettier everywoman. I am an everywoman that they clean up awfully well for T.V.
Kelly Ripa,"In some ways, her life is so much worse that everybody else's, people feel almost cheered up and inspired. They feel like, 'If Hayley hasn't killed herself, why should I?'"
Cal Ripken,"It was an emotional night, an extraordinary moment, ... I wish Dad was there to touch and feel the stadium, but I think he might be with me now more than ever."
Cal Ripken,"This World Series isn't about crowning a champion. I think the kids will remember this as a life experience, ... Not everyone that plays baseball gets the chance to play in a big-league ballpark, but these kids get a feel for what it's like to play in Wrigley Field, what it's like to hit a ball off the Green Monster, how it feels to play at Camden Yards."
Cal Ripken,"That's the result of the black cloud on baseball, ... Until it's rid of steroids, people are naturally going to think that."
Cal Ripken,This is a great loss for baseball.
George Ripley,"We shall suffer no attachment to literature, no taste for abstract discussion, no love of purely intellectual theories, to seduce us from our devotion to the cause of the oppressed, the down trodden, the insulted and injured masses of our fellow men."
George Ripley,"This is our mercury, our lunary, but whosoever thinks of any other water besides this, is ignorant and foolish, never attaining to the desired effects."
George Ripley,"Then hast our the Red Stone perfect with less labour, expense of time and costs, for the which ever thank God."
George Ripley,The body is the substance of the stone.
George Ripley,"If any imagine from the literary tone of the preceding remarks that we are indifferent to the radical movement for the benefit of the masses which is the crowning glory of the nineteenth century, they will soon discover their egregious mistake."
George Ripley,"Also there is a similitude of a Trinity shining in the body, soul and spirit."
Tim Ritchey,"The bottom line is that since barn 14 was no longer a security barn and he would have to be moved on race day anyhow, I thought it would be a better situation in Barn 5. Since there were three stalls available there, it worked out perfectly."
Tim Ritchey,"At this point, he's only going out once a morning anyhow because the race is coming up."
Tim Ritchey,That is the race I've been pointing for.
Tim Ritchey,"Running in a Grade 1 in his second race is not ideally what you want to do, but Menacing showed me a lot off the first race,"
Tim Ritchey,I don't anticipate any more problems because it's 99.9 percent healed. He still has a lot of muscle on him. He doesn't have a big belly. That was the point of walking him two hours a day -- keeping him fit and maintaining muscle tone without putting stress on his legs.
Tim Ritchey,"We expected this kind of performance. I wasn't surprised he was that far back, but when he got rolling, it was a lot of fun."
Tim Ritchey,"Hes a very laid back and very easy going horse and he took it better than most horses would have,"
Tim Ritchey,I can't see a speed horse getting away on his own.
Tim Ritchey,"He went to the track and jogged a mile, and he was very happy to get out,"
Tim Ritchey,"I look forward to Alex's return to the races. The book isn't over ... there are still more chapters to be written to this story. As always, the health of the horse is most important."
Dennis Ritchie,"When I read commentary about suggestions for where C should go, I often think back and give thanks that it wasn't developed under the advice of a worldwide crowd."
Dennis Ritchie,"UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity."
Dennis Ritchie,"True enough that standards bodies themselves have weak teeth, but they do have influence and importance when a language begins to be widely used."
Dennis Ritchie,"A new release of Plan 9 happened in June, and at about the same time a new release of the Inferno system, which began here, was announced by Vita Nuova."
Jim Ritterbusch,"They didn't do anything, and the market viewed that as bearish and rightly so. There's currently no sign of support underneath this market."
Jim Ritterbusch,"They didn't do anything, and the market viewed that as bearish and rightly so, ... There's currently no sign of support underneath this market."
Jim Ritterbusch,A source of support to the screen appears to be indications of increased refinery maintenance that should prove capable of reversing a dramatic 23-mil bbl up-trend in gasoline stocks during the past seven weeks. Production declines should also be driven by some slippage in gasoline yields.
Jim Ritterbusch,The real strength is from institutional funds flowing into the market.
Jim Ritterbusch,"The gasoline draw is a bullish number, without doubt. The decline was much bigger than the 1.1 million barrels draw the Street was anticipating."
Jim Ritterbusch,"The gasoline draw is a bullish number, without doubt. The decline was much bigger than the 1.1 million barrels draw the Street was anticipating,"
Jim Ritterbusch,"The funds are back in the market, showing a strong commitment on long positions for crude."
Herb Ritts,"Within two hours of where I live, you have mountains and desert as location. I like the natural elements that abstract into light, texture, shape and shadow."
Herb Ritts,"When you start out, you're not really aware. I didn't have a sense of photographic history."
Herb Ritts,"What I particularly liked was that, coming from California and not being involved in the New York scene, I developed my personal way, in my own way, at my own pace."
Herb Ritts,"Well, I liked it - that was the main thing. I liked it, but I didn't think of it in terms of a career. I didn't really know; I didn't really think about it. One thing just led to another until finally I quit my job as a salesman and found myself working as a photographer."
Herb Ritts,"The education, the cultural awareness, is different in Europe, especially in France, from that in the United States. So I think the public will be much more appreciative of many images."
Herb Ritts,"That's why I felt so at home when I went to Africa. It didn't matter that I was halfway around the world in a foreign country, because all those elements are universal. And I think that's one thing about my work: It's universal."
Herb Ritts,"Regardless of whether you speak the language or are familiar with a culture, the picture should hold up."
Herb Ritts,"Once you develop your own style, you know when you're able to give your best. Feeling at home is part of it, and I don't think that's an L.A. thing. It's a matter of the environment and of what affects you."
Herb Ritts,Many people who excel are self-taught.
Herb Ritts,"It's always more comforting to know that in any given corner of any room or any location you're on, you can make a photograph that you'll appreciate."
Herb Ritts,"I'm pretty selective. I generally edit the contact sheets and then do work prints. Because I have my own lab and printers, I can afford the luxury of going through the contact sheets for black-and-white, making up work prints, seeing them big, and honing them down."
Herb Ritts,"I'd go down to the end of my street, to a garage that had a certain feeling about it, or a particular light; I'd take a picture of a friend who needed a head shot. That's how I learned, instead of having school assignments and learning camera techniques."
Herb Ritts,"I was an economics major, which I enjoyed because I had a good business sense."
Herb Ritts,"I think a lot of the time these days people are so concerned about having the right camera and the right film and the right lenses and all the special effects that go along with it, even the computer, that they're missing the key element."
Herb Ritts,I like form and shape and strength in pictures.
Herb Ritts,"I did grow up next door to Steve McQueen, who was a very famous movie star at the time, but as a kid it didn't impress me. We always had great fun with him. He would take us out on Sundays on his motorcycles, riding around in the desert; he was like a second father."
Herb Ritts,"I always enjoyed art history because, growing up in California, my exposure was limited, and it was a new experience. To learn the history of art opened up certain things to me, made me see. It intrigued me."
Herb Ritts,"I abstract it in my photographs: I like large planes and spaces, areas of texture and light, like deserts or oceans or monumental places."
Herb Ritts,"Generally, the French highly promote culture and the arts, and photography is in their blood."
Herb Ritts,"For me, the most important thing I learned was just honing my eye. I think I had a good eye."
Herb Ritts,"Each time I did assignments or editorials, I realized that I wanted to do something more. I saw that it wasn't just about the clothes."
Herb Ritts,"Coming from California and growing up where I did, I've always had a fondness for and innate sensitivity to light, texture, and warmth."
Herb Ritts,"And what excites me most is the type of public, the fact that the Parisian people have a broader cultural understanding than many Americans do."
Herb Ritts,"Actually, when I first started dabbling in photography, I was still working for my parents as a salesman."
Herb Ritts,"Even though I didn't get a business degree, I enjoyed learning about economics."
Jacqui Rivait,"Don't blame a child for being dishonest unless you have determined that they really have not been telling the truth. Have any discussion involving dishonesty privately, not in front of the whole class or the whole family, especially siblings."
Jacqui Rivait,Let's put our feet in their shoes and think about how embarrassed they must feel going to school without all of the comforts we are so lucky to have.
Jacqui Rivait,Students will use these tools long after they leave school. We are giving them a life skill.
Jacqui Rivait,"While there are certain social graces or politeness which involve not hurting another's feelings ? if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all ? it is very confusing to children. The whole issue of honesty can be very frustrating for parents to teach."
Jacqui Rivait,"Reaching out to help others is a great way for children to learn to become responsible. Younger children may not understand the concept of social responsibility, but they will understand the importance of collecting mittens for children who have nothing to keep their hands warm in the winter."
Jacqui Rivait,That right there is a wonderful opportunity for the children. How often do students from all over the community get to interact and learn about one another?
Jacqui Rivait,Food and clothing collections are great ways for children to learn responsibility. And it's even more beneficial if children can go to the facility where the goods are being donated.
Jacqui Rivait,One of the things I tell my own daughter and also the children I work with is something I learned long ago from my grandmother. Your word is your honor. If you make a commitment it is your responsibility to live up to your word. If you don't then this is a reflection on your character and ultimately on your honor as a person of integrity.
Jacqui Rivait,I don't believe that children are born with empathy. It is something they learn by seeing it modeled by others.
Jacqui Rivait,"It is so simple. It is important that we teach our children the importance of having respect for themselves and other people. If they are not being respectful or if someone is being disrespectful to them, real learning cannot take place."
Jacqui Rivait,"The major reason children lie is to escape punishment. The chances are the more a parent or a teacher is harsh, aggressive, or punitive, the more motivated children are to make up a story to protect themselves from punishment."
Jacqui Rivait,"Each result has action steps to back them up. The action steps are like a map. If you us them like a compass you will never get lost, and you will reach your destination."
Mariano Rivera,"Tomorrow? We have to go there and do it, ... Don't worry, I'll be ready for tomorrow."
Mariano Rivera,"That, ... is the way it is supposed to work."
Mariano Rivera,"I trust my pitches, ... I trust my pitches and I trust my teammates."
Mariano Rivera,I didn't want to give him anything for him to get a blooper. I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.
Mariano Rivera,"I don't mind it all. If the guy feels comfortable using that song, hey, let him be, let him be."
Mariano Rivera,"[When Rivera came in, the place roared.] I love that, because it helps us, ... I'll be ready for [tonight]. Definitely. If I have to go two [more innings], I'll go two."
Mariano Rivera,starters having the kind of years that have won it before.
Mariano Rivera,"We realize that we have to do our jobs. If we do our thing well, chances are we'll be there."
Mariano Rivera,"He's not hurt now, he's recovering. We just have to have some patience. He can be great for us."
Mariano Rivera,"After Jeter hit that home run, there was no way we could lose that game. A game like that, it motivates you. Once I saw the home run, it was my time. Thank God we have Derek. That's all I know."
Mariano Rivera,"That's not me, ... It's not that I hate talking about it, but I don't like to talk about myself. With all due respect, I don't. If you ask me, 'Yeah, I would love to win the Cy Young.'"
Mariano Rivera,"I always have confidence, ... It's big. It's good to win."
Mariano Rivera,That's the game of baseball - amazing things happen.
Mariano Rivera,DHL Presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Year Award
Mariano Rivera,"That's baseball. Anything can happen, and it happened today."
Ron Rivera,"I hit for the cycle. I got a D-lineman, I got a linebacker, I got a safety and I got a corner."
Ron Rivera,"Basically, you doubled him with a corner and safety and played your other nine against their other 10."
Ron Rivera,"We missed tackles, it's part of the game sometimes. You have to give credit to the running back, but in the same respect, I think some of the guys that missed tackles are some of our better players and we've most certainly got to improve on that."
Ron Rivera,"With the tools he has out there ? the wide receivers, the tight end and the running back ? you don't want the quarterback to get comfortable. You've got to try to get pressure one way or the other."
Ron Rivera,"Their passion, their passion for perfection. I don't think Brian gets enough credit for his work ethic. Here's a young man, when he watches film, he studies the film. He reminds me an awful lot of Mike in that respect, because Mike really was a great student of the game."
Ron Rivera,"It kind of reminds me a little bit about what happened against Cleveland and Cincinnati, was giving up the big plays."
Ron Rivera,"What I see is a guy who is matching up against a No. 1 receiver. It's a tough duty, and we know it. We believe in him, and we believe the young man can get the job done. Unfortunately, he got beat on a couple of plays. As he develops and continues to develop as a young corner, he'll get better with his technique."
Ron Rivera,"I really enjoyed the conversation with Mr. (John) Shaw and Mr. (Jay) Zygmunt. I'm just really happy for the opportunity, and if anything else comes about, it'd be great. ... I guess the only thing I can do is just wait and see what happens."
Ron Rivera,"I think as a coach the ultimate goal obviously is to be a head coach. And you do have to look at the opportunities, where you fit. Does that place in particular fit you? I'll go through the process this week and then again at the same time not lose my focus on what the ultimate goal is, and that's the playoffs."
Ron Rivera,I talked with coach (Smith) on a number of occasions. I think the neat thing about it is he does have a lot of insight into the place.
Ron Rivera,It's an aggressive style of football. The biggest difference is the age. We're probably one of the youngest groups in the NFL.
Ron Rivera,"We would like to have had more pressure, but the play action kind of froze us. We stopped the run. Unfortunately, the result was they got away with a couple of big pass plays. (Palmer) threw the ball very well."
Ron Rivera,"He had time to throw. Some of their play-action bought them good time. We were geared up to stop the run, which we did do a pretty fair job of."
Ron Rivera,"With Foster back there, their character is a little different. I think they feel really confident about their ability to run the football, and so I posed the challenge to our guys: We have to stop the run and get them in situations where we can use our front four to get pressure on the quarterback."
Ron Rivera,We have players just starting to scratch the surface of their ability. I can't wait to see the film.
Doc Rivers,It was a good fourth quarter. A good learning tool.
Doc Rivers,That one stretch really hurt us. I thought we really lost our intensity and started to watch them play.
Doc Rivers,"Wade was sensational. We said at halftime that he would try to take the game over in the second half, and he did. He's a special player."
Doc Rivers,I was happy. I was proud of our young guys. They just kept fighting. I was using it to teach execution to young guys.
Doc Rivers,I was really happy with our young guys. I was really using it (the game) to try to teach execution to the young guys.
Doc Rivers,"[Contrary to speculation, coach Doc Rivers says he didn't demand that the Celtics retain Blount.] The only thing I kept saying to Danny was, 'Assets, assets, assets,' ... When I talked with Mark, I liked what he told me. He kept talking about defense and, even though everyone told me he would not be back, he kept telling me that he wanted to be a Celtic. I told Danny and the owners, 'Here's a guy that wants to be in Boston.'"
Doc Rivers,"As a staff, you get to see how your guys handle playoff basketball, and I think it's easier to evaluate in playoff games what you need for the following year than it is in the 82-game regular season."
Joan Rivers,A woman went to a plastic surgeon and asked him to make her like Bo Derek. He gave her a labotomy.
Joan Rivers,"I had seven years of struggle, really bad years, ... I once slept in my car for a week and washed at the YWCA."
Joan Rivers,"[But she was closer to her mother.] I adored my mother. She was very formal and proper, but she was so full of fun when you got to know her. ... Because she was really like me, without the cover. You know when you take the shell off a tortoise? There's my mother. I live a lot the way she lived. I have a very formal home and my daughter was brought up strictly and all that."
Joan Rivers,"I have become my own version of an optimist. If I can't make it through one door, I'll go through another door - or I'll make a door. Something terrific will come no matter how dark the present."
Joan Rivers,Is she fat?  Her favorite food is seconds
Joan Rivers,Can we talk?
Joan Rivers,My mother could make anybody feel guilty - she used to get letters of apology from people she didn't even know.
Joan Rivers,I have no methods; all I do is accept people as they are.
Joan Rivers,"Your anger can be 49 % and your comedy 51 %, and you're okay. If the anger is 51 %, the comedy is gone."
Joan Rivers,"Anger is a symptom, a way of cloaking and expressing feelings too awful to experience directly - hurt, bitterness, grief, and, most of all, fear"
Joan Rivers,"I hate housework! You make the beds, you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again."
Joan Rivers,My routines come out of total unhappiness. My audiences are my group therapy.
Joan Rivers,My obstetrician was so dumb that when I gave birth he forgot to cut the cord. For a year that kid followed me everywhere. It was like having a dog on a leash.

Joan Rivers,Boy George is all England needs - another queen who can't dress.
Joan Rivers,"I hate housework. You make the beds, you wash the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again."
Joan Rivers,"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is God's gift, that's why we call it the present."
Joan Rivers,"Don't tell your kids you had an easy birth or they won't respect you. For years I used to wake up my daughter and say, 'Melissa you ripped me to shreds. Now go back to sleep.'."
Joan Rivers,"Thank God we're living in a country where the sky's the limit, the stores are open late and you can shop in bed thanks to television."
Joan Rivers,"I wish I had a twin, so I could know what I'd look like without plastic surgery."
Joan Rivers,The ideal beauty is a fugitive which is never found.
Joan Rivers,Before we make love my husband takes a pain killer.
Joan Rivers,I succeeded by saying what everyone else is thinking.
Joan Rivers,"A man can sleep around, no questions asked, but if a woman makes nineteen or twenty mistakes she's a tramp."
Joan Rivers,"People say that money is not the key to happiness, but I always figured if you have enough money, you can have a key made."
Joan Rivers,"I don't excercise. If God had wanted me to bend over, he would have put diamonds on the floor."
Joan Rivers,"The first time I see a jogger smiling, I'll consider it."
Joan Rivers,"I'm Jewish. I don't work out. If God had wanted us to bend over, He would have put diamonds on the floor."
Joan Rivers,"Our natures are a lot like oil, mix us with anything else, and we strive to swim on top."
Joan Rivers,"I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them."
Joan Rivers,My best birth control now is just to leave the lights on.
Joan Rivers,"No steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined."
Joan Rivers,He who limps is still walking.
Joan Rivers,If God wanted us to bend over he'd put diamonds on the floor.
Joan Rivers,"Don't follow any advice, no matter how good, until you feel as deeply in your spirit as you think in your mind that the counsel is wise."
Joan Rivers,Never floss with a stranger.

Mickey Rivers,We'll do all right if we can capitalize on our mistakes.
Mickey Rivers,The wind was blowin' about 100 degrees.
Mickey Rivers,I was eating too well and getting too much rest. I take my old lady dancing every night now. Doin' the bump keeps your legs in shape.
Mickey Rivers,He was lost out there. He was the lost Mohegan.
Mickey Rivers,I've been doing my two and a half miles every day and I've gained two pounds. My stomach is getting smaller but my butt's getting bigger.
Mickey Rivers,"My goals are to hit .300, score 100 runs, and stay injury-prone."
Mickey Rivers,The first thing you do when you get out to center field is put up your finger and check the wind chill factor.
Mickey Rivers,"He's so ugly. When you walked by him, your pants wrinkle. He made fly balls curve foul."
Mickey Rivers,What was the name of that dog on 'Rin Tin Tin'?
Mickey Rivers,He's so ugly he should have to wear an oxygen mask.
Mickey Rivers,Pitching is 80% of the game and the other half is hitting and fielding.

Mickey Rivers,"I don't get upset over things I can control, because if I can control them there's no sense in getting upset. And I don't get upset over things I can't control, because if I can't control them there's no sense in getting upset."
Mickey Rivers,"It was so cold today that I saw a dog chasing a cat, and the dog was walking."
Philip Rivers,"I'm not sitting here all fired up like I've achieved something, ... I'm pleased that I've made some progress, obviously, and shown them such, that they feel that I'm ready to be in that position."
Philip Rivers,"Drew was a heck of a teammate, a heck of a player, a guy I had a lot of fun being around and supporting. I wish him the best on the recovery of the injury, which is the one thing I hated to see happen."
Philip Rivers,"It's neat now. We're both on the same team, he's a great guy and we've had a lot of fun together."
Philip Rivers,"I watch it every year. It's something growing up as a kid you watched, never dreaming you'd actually have a chance at it.ÃŠJust to be there, to haveÃŠJason White and LarryÃŠFitzgerald sitting next to you and think, 'Wow, what great company I'm in' --ÃŠeven if IÃŠdidn't win --ÃŠthat would be a great accomplishment."
Alice Rivlin,I wouldn't expect him to do anything different than Greenspan - certainly not at the beginning.
Alice Rivlin,"The increase in inequality in income is a longtime trend, but the pressure on middle- and low-income workers is going up rapidly. Especially if they live in an area where there are high housing and gas prices, like California."
Alice Rivlin,The job of the Central Bank is to worry.

Reuven Rivlin,"We are here to ask for your forgiveness,"
Reuven Rivlin,"She is a jurist with a great deal of experience in the judicial world, who will be able hold an independent stance against all other government authorities."
Reuven Rivlin,Jewish tradition and ethics require us to treat the sensitivity of others as we would ask others to treat the dignity of the Jewish dead. It is difficult to understand how a project to glorify and strengthen tolerance is conducted with blatant intolerance.
Reuven Rivlin,"Sometimes I really don't know what are the thoughts of the prime minister, whether he will stick to our belief or whether he's going ahead with the Oslo agreements, which means to go all ahead."
Reuven Rivlin,"Sometimes I really don't know what are the thoughts of the prime minister, whether he will stick to our belief or whether he's going ahead with the Oslo agreements, which means to go all ahead,"
Freddie Roach,We are going to start training camp in the Philippines for two weeks then we will go back to the States for another six weeks.
Freddie Roach,"One of (Juan's) friends told me that he thought he made a mistake and wanted to come back. I told him all he had to do was pick up the phone and ask me, and that's all it took. I don't hold grudges at all. It's a good working relationship, which is what you need to have success."
Freddie Roach,He fights with his heart and emotion. People say you should change him and settle him down. But this is what makes him exciting and you can't take it away from him.
Freddie Roach,"When we did make it public that we were not letting anyone watch any longer, the Filipino fans stopped coming. They respected the decision and knew it was for Manny's benefit. They helped us out and we respect that."
Freddie Roach,"Manny's Filipino audience loves to watch him, but I wanted it to be more private so we could better work on going to the body and the other things we need to work on. Velazquez is somebody we definitely can't take lightly. Everybody's talking about Morales and the rematch, but there won't be a rematch without winning this fight. We've been working on a little bit of everything to make Manny more of a complete fighter."
Max Roach,"Although the crash came a year later, and although the people were poor and disenfranchised, they had a lot of pride."

Jason Robards,"All I know is, I don't do a lot of analysis. I know those words have to move me. I rely on the author. I don't want actors reasoning with me about 'motivation' and all that bull. All I want 'em to do is learn the goddamn lines and don't bump into each other."
Jason Robards,All the President's Men.
Jason Robards,"I can't believe it,"
Anthony Robbins,Nothing has any power over me other than that which I give it through my conscious thoughts.
Anthony Robbins,"Success is doing what you want to do, when you want, where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want."
Anthony Robbins,"Most people never feel secure because they are always worried that they will lose their job, lose the money they already have, lose their spouse, lose their health, and so on. The only true security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way, that you are increasing the caliber of who you are and that you are valuable to your company, your friends, and your family."
Anthony Robbins,"Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something: they're trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give, and not a place that you go to take."
Anthony Robbins,Questions provide the key to unlocking our unlimited potential.
Anthony Robbins,"Quality questions create a quality life. Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers."
Anthony Robbins,"Everything happens for a reason and a purpose, and it serves you."
Anthony Robbins,It's your unlimited power to care and to love that can make the biggest difference in the quality of your life.
Anthony Robbins,If you are truly flexible and go until... there is really very little you can't accomplish in your lifetime.
Anthony Robbins,"There is no greatness without a passion to be great, whether it's the aspiration of an athlete or an artist, a scientist, a parent, or a businessperson."
Anthony Robbins,"Why do people persist in a dissatisfying relationship, unwilling either to work toward solutions or end it and move on? It's because they know changing will lead to the unknown, and most people believe that the unknown will be much more painful than what they're already experiencing."
Anthony Robbins,The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships.
Anthony Robbins,"There are so many groups making so much money in the medical care system that any major reorganization is going to make someone unhappy or anxious at the least, ... I don't know how you do it."
Anthony Robbins,"People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals / that is, goals that do not inspire them."
Anthony Robbins,When you are grateful fear disappears and abundance appears
Anthony Robbins,"If we don't see a failure as a challenge to modify our approach, but rather as a problem with ourselves, as a personality defect, we will immediately feel overwhelmed."
Anthony Robbins,Most people fail in life because they major in minor things.
Anthony Robbins,"You're in the midst of a war: a battle between the limits of a crowd seeking the surrender of your dreams, and the power of your true vision to create and contribute. It is a fight between those who will tell you what you cannot do, and that part of you that knows -- and has always known -- that we are more than our environment; and that a dream, backed by an unrelenting will to attain it, is truly a reality with an imminent arrival."
Anthony Robbins,Determination is the wake-up call to the human will.
Anthony Robbins,"I also remember the moment my life changed, the moment I finally said, ''I've had it! I know I'm much more than I'm demonstrating mentally, emotionally, and physically in my life.'' I made a decision in that moment which was to alter my life forever. I decided to change virtually every aspect of my life. I decided I would never again settle for less than I can be."
Anthony Robbins,"More than anything else, I believe it's our decisions, not the conditions of our lives, that determine our destiny."
Anthony Robbins,"Your life changes the moment you make a new, congruent, and committed decision."
Anthony Robbins,"You must know that in any moment a decision you make can change the course of your life forever: the very next person stand behind in line or sit next to on an airplane, the very next phone call you make or receive, the very next movie you see or book you read or page you turn could be the one single thing that causes the floodgates to open, and all of the things that you've been waiting for to fall into place."
Anthony Robbins,Kids are the alltimechampions of questioning. What could you gain by imitatingthe innocence and curiosity of children who are completely determined to get ananswer?
Anthony Robbins,The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives
Anthony Robbins,There is always a way-if you're committed.
Anthony Robbins,"Many people make the mistake of thinking that all the challenges in their lives would dissipate if they just had enough money. Nothing could be further from the truth. Earning more money, in and of itself, rarely frees people. It's equally ridiculous to tell yourself that greater financial freedom and mastery of your finances would not offer your greater opportunities to expand, share, and create value for yourself and others."
Anthony Robbins,Let fear be a counselor and not a jailer
Anthony Robbins,"All personal breakthroughs being with a change in beliefs. So how do we change? The most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief. You must feel deep in your gut that not only has this belief cost you pain in the past, but it's costing you in the present and, ultimately, can only bring you pain in the future. Then you must associate tremendous pleasure to the idea of adopting a new, empowering belief."
Anthony Robbins,All personal breakthroughs begin with a change in beliefs.
Anthony Robbins,"When you temporarily run aground, remember that there are no failures in life. There are only results. Consider the adage: Success is the result of good judgment, good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is often the result of bad judgment!"
Anthony Robbins,Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.
Anthony Robbins,Passion is the genesis of genius.
Anthony Robbins,"Want to learn to eat a lot? Here it is: Eat a little. That way, you will be around long enough to eat a lot."
Anthony Robbins,Take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life.
Anthony Robbins,"Whatever happens, take responsibility."
Anthony Robbins,You always succeed in producing a result.
Anthony Robbins,When people are like each other they tend to like each other.
Anthony Robbins,There's no abiding success without commitment.
Anthony Robbins,How am I going to live today in order to create the tomorrow I'm committed to?
Anthony Robbins,Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment.
Anthony Robbins,"For changes to be of any true value, they've got to be lasting and consistent."
Anthony Robbins,"We are the only beings on the planet who lead such rich internal lives that it's not the events that matter most to us, but rather, it's how we interpret those events that will determine how we think about ourselves and how we will act in the future."
Anthony Robbins,"My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain - and because of your lifestyle, have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain."
Anthony Robbins,Using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant.
Anthony Robbins,In life you need either inspiration or desperation.
Anthony Robbins,"It is not what we get. But who we become, what we contribute... that gives meaning to our lives."
Anthony Robbins,"If you want to be successful, find someone who has achieved the results you want and copy what they do and you'll achieve the same results."
Anthony Robbins,The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives.
Anthony Robbins,The meeting of preparation with opportunity generates the offspring we call luck.
Anthony Robbins,There is no such thing as failure. There are only results.
Anthony Robbins,There's always a way - if you're committed.
Anthony Robbins,"People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals - that is, goals that do not inspire them."
Anthony Robbins,"Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more."
Anthony Robbins,"You see, it's never the environment; it's never the events of our lives, but the meaning we attach to the events - how we interpret them - that shapes who we are today and who we'll become tomorrow."
Anthony Robbins,It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.
Anthony Robbins,"Remember, a real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken new action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided."
Anthony Robbins,"Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers."
Anthony Robbins,The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment.
Anthony Robbins,Success comes from taking the initiative and following up... persisting... eloquently expressing the depth of your love. What simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life?
Anthony Robbins,"The path to success is to take massive, determined action."
Anthony Robbins,"We can change our lives. We can do, have, and be exactly what we wish."
Anthony Robbins,Live with passion!
Anthony Robbins,Surmounting difficulty is the crucible that forms character.
Anthony Robbins,"We will act consistently with our view of who we truly are, whether that view is accurate or not."
Anthony Robbins,"What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are."
Anthony Robbins,"In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our consistent actions. It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently."
Anthony Robbins,"The higher your energy level, the more efficient your body The more efficient your body, the better you feel and the more you will use your talent to produce outstanding results."
Anthony Robbins,"The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, you're in control of your life. If you don't, life controls you."
Anthony Robbins,I've come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living I now enjoy.
Anthony Robbins,"It's not the events of our lives that shape us, but our beliefs as to what those events mean."
Anthony Robbins,Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering a single area of our lives.
Anthony Robbins,"To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others."
Anthony Robbins,"The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors."
Anthony Robbins,"We aren't in an information age, we are in an entertainment age."
Anthony Robbins,"Create a vision and never let the environment, other people's beliefs, or the limits of what has been done in the past shape your decisions. Ignore conventional wisdom."
Anthony Robbins,"It's not what's happening to you now or what has happened in your past that determines who you become. Rather, it's your decisions about what to focus on, what things mean to you, and what you're going to do about them that will determine your ultimate destiny."
Anthony Robbins,You are now at a crossroads. This is your opportunity to make the most important decision you will ever make. Forget your past. Who are you now? Who have you decided you really are now? Don't think about who you have been. Who are you now? Who have you decided to become? Make this decision consciously. Make it carefully. Make it powerfully.
Anthony Robbins,"It not knowing what to do, it's doing what you know."
Anthony Robbins,"You see, in life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know. Knowing is not enough! You must take action."
Anthony Robbins,"I challenge you to make your life a masterpiece. I challenge you to join the ranks of those people who live what they teach, who walk their talk."
Anthony Robbins,"A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken a new action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided."
Anthony Robbins,"Once you have mastered time, you will understand how true it is that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year - and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade!"
Anthony Robbins,"If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten."
Anthony Robbins,Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
Anthony Robbins,"The truth of the matter is that there's nothing you can't accomplish if: (1) You clearly decide what it is that you're absolutely committed to achieving, (2) You're willing to take massive action, (3) You notice what's working or not, and (4) You continue to change your approach until you achieve what you want, using whatever life gives you along the way."
Anthony Robbins,"The most important thing you can do to achieve your goals is to make sure that as soon as you set them, you immediately begin to create momentum. The most important rules that I ever adopted to help me in achieving my goals were those I learned from a very successful man who taught me to first write down the goal, and then to never leave the site of setting a goal without firs taking some form of positive action toward its attainment."
Anthony Robbins,"Goals are a means to an end, not the ultimate purpose of our lives. They are simply a tool to concentrate our focus and move us in a direction. The only reason we really pursue goals is to cause ourselves to expand and grow. Achieving goals by themselves will never make us happy in the long term; it's who you become, as you overcome the obstacles necessary to achieve your goals, that can give you the deepest and most long-lasting sense of fulfillment."
Anthony Robbins,"One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular."
Anthony Robbins,"I believe life is constantly testing us for our level of commitment, and life's greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a never-ending commitment to act until they achieve. This level of resolve can move mountains, but it must be constant and consistent. As simplistic as this may sound, it is still the common denominator separating those who live their dreams from those who live in regret."
Anthony Robbins,"Any time you sincerely want to make a change, the first thing you must do is to raise your standards. When people ask me what really changed my life eight years ago, I tell them that absolutely the most important thin was changing what I demanded of myself. I wrote down all the things I would no longer accept in my life, all the things I would no longer tolerate, and all the things that I aspired to becoming."
Anthony Robbins,"If you don't set a baseline standard for what you'll accept in life, you'll find it's easy to slip into behaviors and attitudes or a quality of life that's far below what you deserve."
Anthony Robbins,"Put yourself in a state of mind where you say to yourself, Here is an opportunity for you to celebrate like never before, my own power, my own ability to get myself to do whatever is necessary."
Anthony Robbins,Personal power is the ability to take action.
Anthony Robbins,Commit to CANI! - Constant And Never-ending Improvement
Jerome Robbins,"I told you to sell it, not give it away."
Jerome Robbins,"There's no secret to working with kids. They either charm you and you can work with them, or they don't charm you and you feel you're stuck with them."
Jerome Robbins,We were all novices. We really were. We didn't know a goddamn thing about doing a show.
Robert Robbins,"I suggest the small investors dig in their heels with this market, not worry too much. The Fed really didn't cause a significant inflation problem. So far, this inflation pressure has been no worse than the worst it's been in the last several years. And each time it's been a great buying opportunity. Any time you can buy the S&P 500, the stock market index of the top 500 stocks, when its 7 to 11 percent off the all-time high, it's probably 2 to 1 odds. Given the history of super bull markets that we've had for 18 years in the two other of the century, that's going to be a fabulous buying opportunity. And if it's not, than you're probably half way down to the ultimate low and that's going to be an even more fabulous buying opportunity."
Robert Robbins,"I think bonds are appropriate for anybody that is close to retirement or is already retired and feels like they need that security and that defensiveness, ... appropriate diversification for a lot of people. But for people who are young and who can put money away for a long time, they really ought to be overwhelmingly in stocks."
Robert Robbins,"They talked about their responsibility to their patients and staff, and the long-term benefits of sustainability. They didn't have to be sold on it."
Robert Robbins,"The finance sector has really emerged as my favorite here, edging out technology by a bit. I recommend that people have about a quarter of their stock holdings in finance."
Robert Robbins,"Markets are down because of the start of attacks and the fear of counter attacks, which could impact further corporate earnings."
Robert Robbins,It's an appropriate example of the new corporate governance since the stock has languished for so long.
Robert Robbins,"We are looking for opportunities to partner in the community. I think it's very important for Stanford not to just look within and see patients here. If we can make these partnerships work, we will be able to serve patients we wouldn't normally serve. The more we reach out, the more we are able to solidify our referrals on more complex cases."
Tom Robbins,"When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter."
Tom Robbins,Using words to describe magic is like using a screwdriver to cut roast beef
Tom Robbins,"Ideas are mallable and unstable; they not only can be misused, they invite misuse---and the better the idea the more volatile it is. That's because only the better ideas turn into dogma, and it is by this process whereby a fresh, stimulating, humanly helpful idea is changed into robot dogma that is deadly. The problem starts at the secondary level, not with the originator or developer of the idea, but with the people who are attracted to it, until the last nail breaks, and who invariably lack the overview, flexibility, imagination, and, most importantly, sense of humor to maintain it in the spirit in which it was hatched. Ideas are made by masters, dogmas by disciples, and the Buddha is always killed on the road."
Tom Robbins,"Should one be shallow enough to view existence as a system of rewards and punishments, one soon learns that we pay as dearly for our triumphs as we do for our defeats ..."
Tom Robbins,"There's always the same amount of good luck and bad luck in the world. If one person doesn't get the bad luck, somebody else will have to get it in their place. There's always the same amount of good and evil, too. We can't eradicate evil, we can only evict it, force it to move across town. And when evil moves, some good always goes with it. But we can never alter the ratio of good to evil. All we can do is keep things stirred up so neither good nor evil solidifies. That's when things get scary. Life is like a stew, you have to stir it frequently, or all the scum rises to the top."
Tom Robbins,"The bottom line is that (a) people are never perfect, but love can be, (b) that is the one and only way that the mediocre and vile can be transformed, and (c) doing that makes it that. We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."
Tom Robbins,It is never too late to have a happy childhood

Tom Robbins,"Humanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, responsible, and cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature."
Tom Robbins,Disbelief in magic can force a poor soul into believing in government and business.
Tom Robbins,"We're our own dragons as well as our own heroes, and we have to rescue ourselves from ourselves."
Tom Robbins,To achieve the impossible; it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought.
Tom Robbins,The highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplacable being.
Tom Robbins,To be or not to be isn't the question. The question is how to prolong being.
Tom Robbins,The sky was the color of Edgar Allan Poe's pajamas.
Tom Robbins,Human folly does not impede the turning of the stars.
Tom Robbins,"True stability results when presumed order and presumed disorder are balanced. A truly stable system expects the unexpected, is prepared to be disrupted, waits to be transformed."
Tom Robbins,"Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach."
Tom Robbins,"We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."
Tom Robbins,"Equality is not in regarding different things similarly, equality is in regarding different things differently."

Alain Robert,"Fortunately, the courts discharged me every time after they understood what I had done."
Alain Robert,"In fact, it will be very easy to climb the building because of its shape and architecture."
Alain Robert,"This way I can get an adrenaline rush through the adventure, rather than through drinks and injections as some people do."
Alain Robert,"Modern people are only willing to believe in their computers, while I believe in myself."
Cavett Robert,A superficial knowledge is not enough. It must be a knowledge capable of analyzing a situation quickly and making an immediate decision.
Cavett Robert,"If we study the lives of great men and women carefully and unemotionally we find that, invariably, greatness was developed, tested and revealed through the darker periods of their lives. One of the largest tributaries of the RIVER OF GREATNESS is always the STREAM OF ADVERSITY."
Cavett Robert,Character is the ability to carry out a good resolution long after the excitement of the moment has passed.
Brian Roberts,"There would need to be some major work on that corner down there, ... The roads are not wide at all."
Brian Roberts,There is a lot of wisdom in selling off some subscribers because it just eases that regulatory question. This hastens the time when there is real competition in local phone.
Brian Roberts,"I screwed up, ... I was just trying to make something happen, and I made a mistake I shouldn't have."
Brian Roberts,"This is a major breakthrough. It's a precedent, ... We're moving to personalized television. That's the strategy Comcast has bet on."

Brian Roberts,"I look forward to working with Mike and the AT&T Broadband team to achieve the full potential of this tremendous new company,"
Brian Roberts,"I think we showed a lot, battling back after the first night. That was pretty ugly. We could've -- not folded, but we could've come out and played sluggish again. We battled and I think we should take some positive things from that."
Brian Roberts,"It's not the kind of week that you want to have very often, that's for sure. I don't think anybody really saw it coming. But the way we played, I don't know that it blows anybody's doors off."

Brian Roberts,the next engine for growth.

Chris Roberts,Cochlear is well positioned for sustainable growth.
Chris Roberts,"Cochlear is well positioned for sustainable growth,"
Chris Roberts,We've got such a young team. Everyone's learning everything new. We have to take lessons from each game and learn from them and get better. We fought all night. I didn't see anyone let up.
Cokie Roberts,Our civic society is really all we have by way of nationhood.

Gary Roberts,The potential here is significant. The NCAA is at some risk.
Jake Roberts,The snake will always bite back.
Jake Roberts,"Jake Roberts has a hard enough time being Jake Roberts. The truth is a brutal thing, I just hope that the kids take the time to learn about each of the wrestlers in the game, and if the kids can learn from our mistakes, that would make me a happy man."
Jake Roberts,"It's the sad thing about entertainment, it's not always about who is the best."
Jake Roberts,"I went to visit my father to tell him that I was going to go to college and become an architect - that was my dream. I was like, yeah I graduated from school, but it's not like you showed up for that. But all he was worried about is whether or not I wanted money from him."
Jake Roberts,"A child's hope is that your father comes riding in on that white stallion and saves them. You can't make somebody love you the way you want them to love you, it's not a Leave it to Beaver type world. This isn't television. Life's a lot more cruel than that."
Jake Roberts,Every moment is an experience.
Jeff Roberts,We have to remember what it is we're trying to accomplish sometimes.
Jeff Roberts,The next step will be to sit down with the science staff and come up with a wish list.
Jeff Roberts,Within six months of getting the green light from the board and commission we will be up and running.
Jeff Roberts,What we are planning on is to incorporate the program with the teachers we already have.
Jeff Roberts,"They got together and said they were going to do it for her. She was our inspiration, that's for sure."
Jeff Roberts,We're going to have to sit back and look at every food item in our store.
Jeff Roberts,Democracy has to have an outlet. It's not in our newspapers or televisions anymore so cable comes to the rescue.
Jeff Roberts,"Increases have been passed on to company so we have to pass them along to customers. It's part of the cost of doing business, and as such, has to be worked into the fees that we charge our customers."
Jeff Roberts,The basic freeway system was really important to this community in terms of its long-range planning and growth.
Jeff Roberts,"When it comes to summertime, we have people giving away animals because the family is going on vacation."

Jim Roberts,"We just don't know where technology is going to go. We felt we needed to get a placeholder in there for whatever. If you don't get the land now, it's going to be much more expensive to get in the future."
Jim Roberts,He's just so smooth and so fluid. He can just lull you to sleep at times.
Jim Roberts,"(He's) a workman, a self-made player. He's a kid that has to scratch and claw for everything."
Jim Roberts,"Bill understands the important role of the KGS in the research and service missions of the university and is working to build closer ties with the rest of the campus. He recognizes that all public service at KU begins with teaching and research and has provided outstanding leadership the past two years and made excellent hires during the interim. Thanks to his efforts, the KGS is in a strong position and poised to be of even greater service to Kansas."
Jim Roberts,"I thought our kids came out with a purpose, but there was no other alternative."
Jim Roberts,"He did a great job of getting to the open spots and his teammates did a great job of getting him the basketball. He was pretty relentless on the glass at times, and I thought his teammates did a good job of finding him where he could get looks. I thought our ball movement as a team was pretty good."
Jim Roberts,"I wish we had a finance director. We're working on the budget, for goodness sake. It would help us in getting together a budget and a five-year plan."
Jim Roberts,"He has the ability (to go) inside or outside so that allows him options. As a result, hopefully it makes him tough to guard."
Julian Roberts,"In many respects we have bought companies that are fundamentally strong, but have issues that we believe our management and our expertise can help resolve,"
Julian Roberts,We have done a very considerable due diligence. We have spent a lot of time with the local management and have got a good understanding of the positioning of the brand and the positioning of the business in Sweden.
Julian Roberts,"The (threshold in the) prospectus is at 90 percent. We want the whole of the company,"
Kevin Roberts,"My client loved his son, and he did a bad thing by trying to cover it up."
Kevin Roberts,The real failing that my client had was in assisting his son in trying to cover it up.
Kevin Roberts,They're not willing to accept help very readily â€” especially for mental health.
Kevin Roberts,"The threat has not gone away. Big sports events are becoming more and more global, with a huge number of viewers. Individual athletes have a higher profile. These events provide a global platform for anyone with an axe to grind."
Kevin Roberts,We had about three or four rooms that the roof was torn off of. There were cars in the front parking lot and the back parking lot that were damaged.
Norm Roberts,"We're concentrating on St. John's and what we're trying to do to build our program. We're trying to get our guys to play at the top level, and we're moving in that direction."
Norm Roberts,"Daryll is going to shut it down for the rest of the season. He tried to do everything he could to be out there for us, but this is what he needs to do right now. He will still be a big part of this team, at practices and games. We wish he could be out there but we understand."
Norm Roberts,We were patient. We took good shots. We took shots within rhythm. We did things that we normally practice every day and that is why we were successful.
Norm Roberts,We just have to stay focused on what we do and realize this is a great opportunity for us to play against a very good basketball team. Our guys are excited to play the top team in the nation. You don't always get these opportunities in a lifetime or career.
Norm Roberts,"The young man was definitely excited about the Garden and St. John's, but it wasn't a slam dunk. Anthony told me early on: 'I'm not telling my kid where to go. We may be friends, but my son is going to choose where he wants to go.'"
Norm Roberts,"I'm really, really proud of the kids. We kept telling the guys about sticking together. We went through a hard road, playing four nationally ranked teams in a row and three of them on the road. I'm proud that we stuck together and understood we could get it done if we just stayed focused and did the things we knew we could do."
Norm Roberts,We wish Cedric the best. He is a young man who put in a tremendous amount of hard work and effort in representing St. John's basketball.
Norm Roberts,I told them we've got to have a defensive mindset. We're not good in high-scoring games. I thought we did some really good things in this game but we just didn't play well in the last four minutes.
Norm Roberts,We played with a lot of energy. We played with a lot of passion.
Norm Roberts,"These games show we are capable of playing with anybody if we have the focus and energy we need to have. Now we have games coming against non-ranked teams that are still good basketball teams and we have to play with the same passion. If we do that, we will win our share of games."
Norm Roberts,"In the second half we played with energy, we played hard. We had to attack the basket and we did."
Norm Roberts,"They're a very, very, very good team. They deserve to be No. 1, no doubt about that."
Norm Roberts,"We have to do a better job of taking care of the basketball, but their pressure had a lot to do with it."
Norm Roberts,"We have a good basketball team but we are limited in certain ways. At this time of year, everybody knows what everybody can do. We have to take those things away from people. If you allow people to play to their strengths, and we let Syracuse play to their strengths, then you know you are going to struggle."
Norm Roberts,I think this is a statement that we are improving. We are a tough basketball team. We have to take that toughness on the road as well as home.
Norm Roberts,"Anthony is getting better every game. He can really shoot the basketball, and he's coming into his own as far as putting it on the floor, rebounding and playing with energy throughout the whole game."
Norm Roberts,"We're not in it for moral victories. We've got a good basketball team. We have to continue to get better. They have so many weapons, they can beat you in so many ways."
Norm Roberts,I think this is a statement that we are improving. We are a tough basketball team. It says that coming to Madison Square Garden is not an easy out.
Norm Roberts,They've got so much athletic ability. They can go outside and pressure the ball. Not too many teams can keep my guards in check because my guys are quick. But they did a good job keeping them out of the lane.
Rob Roberts,"We are moving all the services that support our entire district to the new modulars,"
Rob Roberts,"[According to the superintendent, the school district paid $2.4 million for the buildings.] That amount includes set up, plumbing, electrical hookups - everything needed, ... They need to be on a pad, just like any building. They had to have sidewalks, school bell systems and parking lots."
Rob Roberts,"Everyone did an amazing job of planning this project,"
Rob Roberts,"We had to buy furniture and computers; we had to put a teacher's desk, wall unit and file cabinet in each classroom. We ordered all those items six months ago from different manufacturers. When they were delivered, they were stored and some pieces had to be assembled. We ordered half a million dollars worth of textbooks. It took a great deal of planning by everyone in the school district - from the custodians planning on how to schedule cleaning to how we were going to supply books and teachers. It was an unbelievably complex project,"
Rob Roberts,"It was decided the best and safest place for the early childhood center would be in the modular area. We are creating it in a horseshoe shape. Each building will have handicap accessible ramps. It will be a pleasant place once the landscaping and grass are in. That area should suffice for the center for a couple of years. The center is our priority for those children and we have an immediate need,"
Robin Roberts,"I lived there for more than five years, attended a year of high school there and spent four years at the University of New Orleans. My family and I feel we need to use what we have to help in whatever way we can. That's why we are having this event at our ranch."
Robin Roberts,"I'm speechless. To work for a company like Disney that believes in community and came up with the idea and saying, 'We want to donate to the Boys and Girls Club of the Gulf Coast.' Knowing it's very important to many people here, my family included, since we helped start the one in the Pass. And a million and half dollars is gonna go a long way. It's a nice start, great start."
Robin Roberts,"We have good service, but everyone always wants better, ... Within the business community with the state and federal government centers here, Washington service is one that comes up frequently."
Robin Roberts,I never slept when I lost. I'd see the sun come up without ever having closed my eyes. I'd see those base hits over and over and they would drive me crazy.
Robin Roberts,"My feeling is that when you're managing a baseball team, you have to pick the right people to play and then pray a lot."
Robin Roberts,"Oh well, the truth hurts, doesn't it?"
Robin Roberts,"I've had mom and dad when he was here and Dorothy and the sisters, they've been on Good Morning America so our audience felt that they knew, that they know my family so when they see me upset and crying it put a face to it so it was a natural to wanna be here and do as much as I can to help out."
Robin Roberts,"There is no doubt that someone who tries to throw a curve or pitch at any early age before he's developed, before his hand is big enough to grip the ball correctly, will damage his arm."
David Robertson,"This technology has been around for six years and has never caught on, despite all that we hear about compromising data centers and stealing key consumer information. Americans, by and large, are trustful of buying online."
David Robertson,the real relationship  â€¦ to actually be in St. Louis and start to really make the music with people.
David Robertson,We are very much in listening mode and we are keen to hear what people think of these proposals.
David Robertson,He was sent off for foul and abusive language to a linesman. That is totally unacceptable.
David Robertson,"This is an idea that's been popping up around the globe. There's a lot of fee income going to the banks, and the merchants are upset."
David Robertson,Remember the 'Christmas Story' movie? You can shoot your eye out?
David Robertson,Wachovia and Bank of America compete head-to-head for deposit account customers in critically important states. It's simply untenable for Wachovia to continue to cede the credit card account relationship to Bank of America once that company takes over MBNA.
Oscar Robertson,"In sports, you're going to have players who are great but haven't won championships. That's true. You only get one winner a year, and the rest of the guys don't win."
Oscar Robertson,"You've got to learn the footwork, the positioning, how to box out, how to pass, how to shoot your free throws. All these things are necessary, not to be the No. 1 player in the world, but maybe you can play against him."
Oscar Robertson,You see what happens in college and high school games today - a three-point shot or a dunk. I think that's the reason that you see a lot of that in the pros today.
Oscar Robertson,"You need a teaching coach who understands the game of basketball, not just some guy coming on the court talking about Xs and Os."
Oscar Robertson,"You look at today, it's a different situation. You have a game that has been transformed into a game where almost every shot is either an outside shot - a three-point shot - or a dunk."
Oscar Robertson,"You have to teach now - tell a kid how to box out, tell him how to pass, teach him footwork. Players don't understand that anymore."
Oscar Robertson,"You don't cut anywhere, don't pick down anywhere, don't double screen, no weak side picking. All these things that should happen in a game of basketball don't happen anymore."
Oscar Robertson,"Who do I think was the greatest? This might shock you: Elgin Baylor. He did so many great things. Nobody could guard him, playing in the forward spot. I'd love to see some of today's greats playing against Elgin. They couldn't guard him. Nobody could."
Oscar Robertson,"When you play guard, you're not going to block a lot of shots. Inside, you're going to block shots."
Oscar Robertson,When you play against different people from all walks of life you can't do the same thing against every player defensively or offensively. You have to change up the way you go at a player.
Oscar Robertson,"When you go into a game on offense, you make a couple moves and see what the defender is going to do. Then you pretty much can figure out what he is going to do against you - whether he carries his hands low or high, whether he is bumping or pushing, those type of things."
Oscar Robertson,We're all Americans trying to compete. Magic was competing for his team and Larry for his team.
Oscar Robertson,This is where young players today want to land. They want to be NBA players because of the money.
Oscar Robertson,"They should have a rule: in order to be a sportswriter, you have to have played that sport, at some level; high school, college, junior college, somewhere. Or, you should have had to have been around the game for a long time."
Oscar Robertson,"The thing about it is almost everyone could pass that way, but we were kept from doing it by our coaches."
Oscar Robertson,"The Olympics were great, because you had to make the team, and then go to the games. Now, I don't know, these guys today don't want to do anything like that."
Oscar Robertson,"Some players are more physical than others, some play with more finesse. Some are just really great all-around players. So you have to change your game."
Oscar Robertson,"Now, I guess, people want stars. People are trying to invent stars."
Oscar Robertson,"Just fundamental things - I played guard and I played forward, so you get into a position where you are pivoting out on the court."
Oscar Robertson,"It's like all guys want to do is make a dunk, grab their shirt and yell out and scream - they could be down 30 points but that's what they do. Okay, so you made a dunk. Get back down the floor on defense!"
Oscar Robertson,It's a sad commentary when I have to say that sometimes in our country we are real sensitive to race.
Oscar Robertson,"If you're a basketball player, you've got to shoot."
Oscar Robertson,"I'd like to think that the nature of the two teams - Boston being a championship team over the years and the Lakers, same thing - was a lot bigger than Larry Bird or Magic Johnson."
Oscar Robertson,I was taught to play that way when I was in high school and even before I got to high school.
Oscar Robertson,I think that teaching coaches are the norm now.
Oscar Robertson,"I think that everyone should be able to dribble. Everyone should be able to pass. Otherwise, why are you out there?"
Oscar Robertson,I think that basketball players should get the job done no matter how it looks on the screen.
Oscar Robertson,I don't think that players learn how to play any other aspect of the game in high school or college.
Oscar Robertson,I don't blame David Stern because a player gets on the court and he doesn't put out competitively. No one can make you play if you don't want to play.
Oscar Robertson,"But if people are buying the products, naturally they're gonna use them."
Oscar Robertson,But I think the image that's thrown out on television is a bad image. Because you see players who want to imitate hip-hop stars. And the NBA is taking advantage of the situation.
Oscar Robertson,But I like to think an athlete is an athlete.
Oscar Robertson,Basketball is basketball.
Paul Robeson,"The patter of their feet as they walk through Jim Crow barriers to attend school is the thunder of the marching men of Joshua, and the world rocks beneath their tread. [on the children of Little Rock]"
Paul Robeson,I've learned that my people are not the only ones oppressed.. . . I have sung my songs all over the world and everywhere found that some common bond makes the people of all lands take to Negro songs as their own.
Paul Robeson,"In my music, my plays, my films, I want to carry always this central idea: to be African."

Maximilien Robespierre,To punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency; to forgive them is cruelty.
Maximilien Robespierre,The general will rules in society as the private will governs each separate individual.
Maximilien Robespierre,"Crime butchers innocence to secure a throne, and innocence struggles with all its might against the attempts of crime."
Maximilien Robespierre,Atheism is aristocratic; the idea of a great Being that watches over oppressed innocence and punishes triumphant crime is altogether popular.
Maximilien Robespierre,"Again, it may be said, that to love justice and equality the people need no great effort of virtue; it is sufficient that they love themselves."
Maximilien Robespierre,Pity is treason.
Maximilien Robespierre,Any law which violates the inalienable rights of man is essentially unjust and tyrannical; it is not a law at all.
Maximilien Robespierre,"Any institution which does not suppose the people good, and the magistrate corruptible, is evil."
Maximilien Robespierre,"Terror is only justice: prompt, severe and inflexible; it is then an emanation of virtue; it is less a distinct principle than a natural consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing wants of the country."
Maximilien Robespierre,The king must die so that the country can live.
Maximilien Robespierre,"The secret of freedom lies in educating people, whereas the secret of tyranny is in keeping them ignorant."
Maximilien Robespierre,"Any institution which does not suppose the people good, and the magistrate corruptible, is evil"

Ann Robinson,"We've evaluated everything from Arabic to waste management: chemistry, nuclear medicine, nutrition, child care?,"
Ann Robinson,"Everyone's very nervous. Every time a house sells, people wonder what the buyer's intention is - to tear down or remodel. In a perfect world, people would consider the needs of their neighbors and neighborhood. We try to get our clients to do that."

Brooks Robinson,many good words to me.
Brooks Robinson,"The Indians were a disciplined, energetic people, ... Their villages were quite well-constructed, considering they had tools made only of stone, bone and seashells. And they grew an abundance of corn, beans, squash, pumpkins and tobacco."
Brooks Robinson,"If your're not practicing, somebody else is, somewhere, and he'll be ready to take your job."
Brooks Robinson,I wouldn't mind seeing someone erase my record of hitting into four triple plays.

Brooks Robinson,the priority of my life.
Brooks Robinson,"I could field as long as I can remember, but hitting has been a struggle all my life."

Brooks Robinson,"Well, ... it just brought tears to my eyes."
Brooks Robinson,Fifty years from now I'll be just three inches of type in a record book.
Brooks Robinson,Was it a fact? ... Or just a great new story about a celebrity that might help sell books?
Brooks Robinson,"I'm a guy who just wanted to see his name in the lineup everyday. To me, baseball was a passion to the point of obsession."
Brooks Robinson,"It's a pretty sure thing that the player's bat is what speaks loudest when it's contract time, but there are moments when the glove has the last word."
Brooks Robinson,I'll play out the string and leave baseball without a tear. A man can't play games his whole life.
Brooks Robinson,"I really have an affection for York, ... It was the first place where my father came to see me play pro ball."
David Robinson,"It's my first time beating them in high school. It feels great to beat them here. We knew if we came out and worked hard, we could accomplish what we wanted to accomplish."

David Robinson,"If these were really 'high wage jobs,' there wouldn't be any issue at all. They were using roughly 32 union members. They wanted to take advantage of their skill and expertise, but they didn't want to pay union wages and benefits in return."
David Robinson,"I think any player will tell you that individual accomplishments help your ego, but if you don't win, it makes for a very, very long season. It counts more that the team has played well."

Eddie Robinson,Landon gets two chances and he scores two goals. That's something we've been able to count on down the stretch. He's been great for us.
Eddie Robinson,Girls singles started slow and came a long way.
Eddie Robinson,"Joe was a lovely well-mannered boy and he's going to be greatly missed by all his teachers, his friends and his fellow pupils at St Gabriel's High School."
Eddie Robinson,I'm hopeful. Boys doubles should do very well.
Eddie Robinson,"The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence."
Frank Robinson,"We need somebody, and I should have identified [the person] before we left Spring Training, to tell you the truth. It's something you have to do."
Frank Robinson,I didn't think he was going after the hitters. He was walking himself into trouble. He was one base hit away from the game blowing in our faces. I don't like pitchers throwing balls. You can't defense ball four.
Frank Robinson,"I didn't think he was going after hitters, ... He was walking himself into trouble and he was one base hit from blowing the game open."
Frank Robinson,We've had trouble all year with a runner on third and less than two outs. Baerga knows how to hit. He just didn't get it done tonight.
Frank Robinson,"That year, you can put it in a capsule, ... After the trade, everything kind of fell into place. We won the league championship. You go to the World Series against the mighty Dodgers and you sweep them in four games. It was one of those years you just didn't dream about."
Frank Robinson,"I think you have to ... take an MRI on every pitcher that you acquire in a trade or free agency - the elbows, knees and shoulders. That's the only way you're going to be able to look at the elbow and shoulder and knees, and get a pretty good idea of what's in there."
Frank Robinson,You have to give him credit for some of it. But some of the responsibility falls on our shoulders. We're not swinging the bats very well.
Frank Robinson,He has been having quality at-bats. The at-bat he had in Florida [on Friday] was an excellent at-bat. He just missed [getting a base hit].
Frank Robinson,"When a guy is maybe on the lower end of the pain threshold, we have a tendency to maybe be a little critical of him and say what he should do and what he should be able to do. All I know is an individual knows himself and he knows what he is able to handle as far as pain is concerned."
Frank Robinson,"If you want to be realistic, you say, 'What would it take? A miracle.' Well, miracles happen. Not too often, but they do happen once in a while. But, realistically, yeah, we're looking at it, and probably it's insurmountable."
Frank Robinson,"It seems like every staff has a guy that a team scores runs for, and then there's this hard-luck guy that they don't score runs for. This may be his year to get the run support."
Frank Robinson,He's done a great job.
Frank Robinson,"He had brain cramps, ... He was a spectator. It didn't hurt us tonight, but it will hurt you another time you do it. The Mets are struggling and they didn't take advantage of things."
Frank Robinson,"He had brain cramps. He was a spectator. It didn't hurt us tonight, but it will hurt you another time you do it. The Mets are struggling and they didn't take advantage of things."
Frank Robinson,"It's an honor, no question,"
Frank Robinson,"It was unbelievable the way he pitched. His record should have been better. It took some growing up on the mound, understanding the situation, the pitches and the sequences of attacking the hitter. He is kind of strong-willed. We had to kind of fight through that wall of his to see it our way."
Frank Robinson,We're not looking for a Gold Glove or anything like that. Just go out there and do the best you can. I think he'll play with a lot of enthusiasm and put the effort into getting better on a daily basis and over the course of a season. That's all a manager can ask of any player.
Frank Robinson,"September can really be like fool's gold, ... You don't want to get too excited about Septembers."
Frank Robinson,"To me, anybody who plays this game who's not injured can give you 100 percent. Now, maybe your 100 percent may be different than my 100 percent. But you can run hard, run the best you possibly can . . ."
Frank Robinson,"It's just fool around with the lineup and seeing how it operates and how it produces, certain guys hitting in certain spots."
Frank Robinson,"I don't need an explanation. I don't want to hear it, as a matter of fact. There's no excuse for that. There's no excuse for either one of them."
Frank Robinson,Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Is he going to play left field? Who knows? Those decisions will be made before we leave Florida.
Frank Robinson,I think that has to be done and will be part of the conversation if he gets here [today]. We'll see what happens. That will just be one little small part of the conversation that I will have with him.
Frank Robinson,"It was basically a warning: They have control of the game. It's up to them. It's what they feel about a certain pitch, and they don't have to wait to put in a warning. Word is, there's bad blood between the two ball clubs, and every time we play they're going to put out a warning to the umpires."
Frank Robinson,"If we're going to start complaining about the size of this ballpark, or whatever now, we just might as well pack [it] in and go home. Because if we don't, they're going to be putting us in a little white jacket and carting us out of here."
Frank Robinson,"As I told him, I wasn't going to sit here and tell him not to go, but I told him that he made a good decision under the circumstances because of the injuries he has had over the last 2 1/2 years."
Frank Robinson,As well as he could be under the circumstances. He's not down in the dumps or whatever. He's still operating in the office. But he's just like anyone else who's going through what he's going through right now. He's not as excited as he normally would be. But he sounded pretty good to me.
Frank Robinson,"He didn't have his good stuff out there tonight. He hung a lot of balls and he didn't locate on a lot of his pitches, and we took advantage of it."
Frank Robinson,You have to have a short memory as a closer.
Frank Robinson,What you have to do is just understand these kids today and not think about the past. You have to make adjustments to bridge that gap.
Frank Robinson,"The way we're going... if I called up another pitcher, he'd just hang up the phone on me."
Frank Robinson,"People come out to see the players. When do you see a manager anyway? When he's out on the field arguing with the umpires, making a fool of himself and you know you can't win, and when he brings out the line-up card."
Frank Robinson,"No. 1, these guys out here on this field. They keep my energy level up. They try hard, they don't complain about things - and I'd just like to be with them when things are good, and hopefully we can win a pennant together."
Frank Robinson,"No, I don't think my presence will cause an increase in black attendance at Cleveland."
Frank Robinson,Managers don't have as much leverage as they used to have. We can't really be the boss.
Frank Robinson,"Just focus on playing the game. Go out and do your jobs. If you do, maybe some people will come out. If not, you can't do anything about it anyway."
Frank Robinson,"If he can hit, he can hit. I don't care if he came from Class Z league."
Frank Robinson,"I know a lot of people on the field - players, coaches, managers - are glad that I'm gone."
Frank Robinson,"I just didn't have anything to say, so I said nothing."
Frank Robinson,"I haven't seen a player in this game, as long as I've been in it, that can't be pitched to... Barry is an outstanding ballplayer. I respect him an awful lot. I also have confidence in my pitchers that they can pitch to Barry Bonds and get him out."
Frank Robinson,"But I'm not going to walk Barry Bonds, like some teams do, in the first inning with nobody on."
Frank Robinson,"At least when it's in French, I won't know what the heck they're saying."
Frank Robinson,"I always tried to do the best. I knew I couldn't always be the best, but I tried to be."
Frank Robinson,"All in all, I wouldn't call it a bad outing. It was a short outing."
Frank Robinson,It's nice to come into a town and be referred to as the manager of the Cleveland Indians instead of as the first black manager.
Frank Robinson,"The fan is the one who suffers. He cheers a guy to a .350 season then watches that player sign with another team. When you destroy fan loyalties, you destroy everything."
Frank Robinson,"Pitchers did me a favor when they knocked me down. It made me more determined. I wouldn't let that pitcher get me out. They say you can't hit if you're on your back, but I didn't hit on my back. I got up."
Frank Robinson,"If the guys on the bench were as good as the guys you have out there, they'd be out there in first place."
Frank Robinson,Close don't count in baseball. Close only counts in horseshoes and grenades.
Jackie Robinson,"We have a social responsibility and we are held to a higher standard than other institutions,"
Jackie Robinson,"discover the truth of today, and perhaps find the greatness of tomorrow."
Jackie Robinson,We're in a real crisis situation where many times people are being turned away at the door.
Jackie Robinson,"I think it was one of the greatest times ever in the world to play baseball. Television was in its infancy. Breaking the color barrier,"
Jackie Robinson,"This ain't fun. But you watch me, I'll get it done."
Jackie Robinson,"It kills me to lose. If I'm a troublemaker, and I don't think that my temper makes me one, then it's because I can't stand losing. That's the way I am about winning, all I ever wanted to do was finish first."
Jackie Robinson,"Pop flies, in a sense, are just a diversion for a second baseman. Grounders are his stock trade."
Jackie Robinson,"Above anything else, I hate to lose."
Jackie Robinson,"The way I figured it, I was even with baseball and baseball with me. The game had done much for me, and I had done much for it."
Jackie Robinson,There's not an American in this country free until every one of us is free.
Jackie Robinson,"Life is not a spectator sport. If you're going to spend your whole life in the grandstand just watching what goes on, in my opinion you're wasting your life."
Jackie Robinson,A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.
Jackie Robinson,I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me... All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.
Jackie Robinson,How you played in yesterday's game is all that counts.
Jackie Robinson,The right of every American to first-class citizenship is the most important issue of our time.
Jackie Robinson,Baseball is like a poker game. Nobody wants to quit when he's losing; nobody wants you to quit when you're ahead.
James Robinson,Our premise was to showcase some of the finest coaches in Westchester and have them teach these kids the kind of basketball they teach all year back home.
James Robinson,"Our goal, simply stated, is to be the best."
James Robinson,Curiosity is idle only to those who fail to realize that it may be a very rare and indispensable thing
James Robinson,I am opposed to censorship. Censors are pretty sure fools. I have no confidence in the suppression of everyday facts.
James Robinson,They blame him now for having frozen the manuscripts. It made them crumble all the worse.
James Robinson,This could not have happened without the approval of Michael Chertoff as well as Attorney General John Ashcroft and Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson.
James Robinson,"There are pastors who won't go to people's sick beds. How can people of God turn their back on the sick, poor and hungry?"
James Robinson,"Greatness, in the last analysis, is largely bravery - courage in escaping from old ideas and old standards and respectable ways of doing things."
Janet Robinson,"We've seen what's happened in other towns like Oxford [where school construction costs keep growing beyond the budget]. We don't want to be like that,"
Janet Robinson,"We've seen what's happened in other                                                                                                                         towns like Oxford [where school construction costs keep growing beyond the budget]. We don't want to be like that,"
Janet Robinson,"While we saw growth in most ad categories at The Times, it was not sufficient to offset the expected decline in studio entertainment advertising, as the studios provided less support to Oscar-nominated films compared with last year. The [Boston] Globe also saw weakness in entertainment advertising and, in addition, travel advertising."
Janet Robinson,"The New England Sports Network would allow the Globe to better serve advertisers with combined print, television and Internet advertising sales."
Janet Robinson,"In January, traditionally a light month for advertising, revenues were on a par with those of the same period last year."
Janet Robinson,"While the advertising market remained challenging in the third quarter, our earnings were better than we expected as advertising revenue growth improved in late September. This was particularly true at The New York Times Media Group, where advertising revenues rose 2.9 percent."
Janet Robinson,"In September, our largest month in the quarter, advertising has been challenging and visibility remains limited."
Jason Robinson,I've been in more fights than I'm proud to admit in this room. ...How many relationships have I destroyed because of my anger for somebody else?
Jason Robinson,"Mark is a quality player and I have been impressed by his performances for London Wasps, not least his place kicking."
Jason Robinson,"I knew how a lot of the management operated but if you are not used to certain characters, personalities, it can rub you up the wrong way."
Jason Robinson,"We just let them know that we just have to keep playing football. We didn't do that last week. We played a good team in Lake Taylor. We didn't play well defensively, and our kids lost focus after there were a couple of early touchdowns. We were down early in this game, but they just kept fighting."
Jeff Robinson,"The overwhelming success of this year's event shows the continued momentum we are experiencing in this space. It was exciting to see the number of executives interested in improving their pricing processes. Overall, this year's event attracted a diverse group of corporations and organizations representing over 25 industries."
Jeff Robinson,The new look is refreshing. It's a great way to celebrate the people inside the factory and their passion for airplanes. This is an impressive graphic that matches our remarkable airplanes and product line.
Jeff Robinson,"In 2000, new management began full-scale renovations of each of the units,"
Jeff Robinson,"In 2000, new management began full-scale renovations of each of the units."
Jeff Robinson,"Alicia is a very energetic workaholic. She's always thinking. We're always feeding ideas off each other, which generates huge cell-phone bills, by the way."
Jill Robinson,"They accept you at face value, A person feels wanted, respected, dignified and cared for."
Jill Robinson,There are too many mediocre things in life to deal with. Love shouldnâ€™t be one of them. Anything less than extraordinary is a waste of my time.
Jill Robinson,They perform incredible services to human kind and deserve better than to be food for the table.
Jill Robinson,"In view of recent animal-abusing incidents, we feel it very much an urgency to initiate education programs to curb such activities."
Ken Robinson,They have bombed bridges. They have booby-trapped buildings. They've established sniper positions. The fear is that they will use mosques.
Ken Robinson,"I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life, another form of life."
Ken Robinson,"Since the attacks occurred there, their economy is on the verge of disaster right now. And simultaneously there is a strong building going on of minarets. You see new mosques popping up in a lot of places and you see a lot of the gaps being filled from what the country can provide to these Islamic organizations that are helping,"

You see new mosques popping up in a lot of places and you see a lot of the gaps being filled from what the country can provide to these Islamic organizations that are helping."
Ken Robinson,We're getting to a crisis point. Facilities will start falling apart.
Ken Robinson,"My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status."
Ken Robinson,"If you are not prepared to be wrong, you will never come up with anything original"
Ken Robinson,The first thing they do is they reach out and they recruit everyone who survived -- the children who no longer have parents. Young people who no longer have a job. And they create a wedge that we will have to then fight that wedge of the next generation.
Ken Robinson,"In those locations, where that type of support could be located -- and then a unilateral action would occur by Iraqis or the United States government -- that would seriously escalate our problems with the Syrian government."
Larry Robinson,I'd like to get at least two or three hours sleep.
Larry Robinson,"I would like to see some of their guys stand around, under the old rules, where they stand now in front of the net,"
Larry Robinson,The reality is that we have eight new guys in our lineup. We have to get them on the same page as everyone else.
Larry Robinson,"I've worked with Barney through the years, first as police chief and now as city manager. He's not only a skilled coach, but he cares about youth and putting them on the right path."
Larry Robinson,"It's just a matter of time before he gets hurt, if we keep giving up chances where he has to stand on his head all the time like that. Something's going to happen."
Larry Robinson,"It's funny. I think the game has changed in that in the old days guys used to hang around a lot more together because everybody pretty well had similar interests. Today there's different cultures and different personalities. Now, not everybody does the same thing. When you do get occasions such as this, it's always nice to get out with your teammates. You find out a lot about each other when you're just sitting around, whether it's lunch or having a soda or whatever."
Larry Robinson,"There seemed to be a little bit more life, a little more enthusiasm. Guys were probably a lot more focused when we got on the ice."
Larry Robinson,"We'll have to wake up and smell the coffee sooner or later,"
Larry Robinson,"This is not malicious. Maybe it's selfish on my part. I still think I can coach, I just think that at this stage of my life ... nothing is worth being sick over."
Lisa Robinson,"It's a matter of working out the logistics so that all our member casinos can buy in and support it. From what I understand, Champ Car has been meeting with downtown casinos to make that happen."
Lisa Robinson,"Honestly, it's a getaway, a stress-free night,"
Lisa Robinson,"The confirmation in knowing that he is here, it just warms your heart more than you could even imagine."
Lisa Robinson,It's a very authentic experience. This is the place where Las Vegas began. It started with a land auction at the end of Main Street.
Mark Robinson,"Helton dropped the plate holder, but even as he was on the ground, he was trying to reach for it, ... It was only after he was shot that we learned it was not a gun."
Mark Robinson,The Hubble Space Telescope can discriminate very subtle color differences on the surface.
Mark Robinson,We know he had suffered some injuries to his arms that appear to be self-inflicted.
Mark Robinson,"I drank more than a gallon of water before the race, and then at every rest stop I would stop and have a couple of drinks of water. I tried to power-walk it in."
Mark Robinson,"She had some (strikeouts), but it was mostly her putting the ball in play and the girls executing in the field really well."
Mark Robinson,"He was forced to use deadly force against Mr. Helton in order to prevent him from getting out into the area where he knew other citizens were,"
Mark Robinson,"First we're showing them different disciplines they can do. Secondly, they're coming here to have fun. Fitness is not a chore."
Mark Robinson,It was a whole different experience on Saturday. We were so much more confident in what we were doing.
Mark Robinson,We didn't want to close it during the Christmas holiday.
Mark Robinson,I can't believe I didn't get caught.
Mark Robinson,We've got Hanover this week. We'll let [the possibility of a playoff appearance] take care of itself.
Mary Robinson,"The aim of human rights, if I may borrow a term from engineering, is to move beyond the design and drawing-board phase, to move beyond thinking and talking about the foundations stones - to laying those foundation stones, inch by inch, together."
Mary Robinson,"I was elected by the women of Ireland, who instead of rocking the cradle, rocked the system."
Mary Robinson,"must not abandon its core standards and values, even in the face of the serious security threat to its own civilian population."
Mary Robinson,She is walking the talk. We need more leaders like her.
Mary Robinson,"The most important thing is to bring perpetrators to justice. That can either be done by courts in Indonesia or in East Timor. Or if it is necessary it can be done by an international tribunal,"
Mary Robinson,"Whenever force is used, the principle of proportionality has to be applied, and all necessary measures have to be taken to avoid loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian property."
Mary Robinson,"A culture is not an abstract thing. It is a living, evolving process. The aim is to push beyond standard-setting and asserting human rights to make those standards a living reality for people everywhere."
Mary Robinson,Students won't have to worry about standing in line for computers. It will be very convenient for them to get things accomplished.
Mary Robinson,"Pavement slippery, people sneezing,Lords in ermine, beggars freezing;Titled gluttons dainties carving,Genius in a garret starving."
Mary Robinson,Our motivation is our love for all babies.
Michael Robinson,"Especially early in the game, you feel that you can't get out of the trouble and you get impatient. The coaches would just tell me to calm down, they'd tell me a joke that's not that funny, and it calms me down."
Michael Robinson,"I try to have a smile on my face. But when I fumbled, I was out of it a little bit."
Michael Robinson,"And when we fall back into our safety zone, we become complacent."
Michael Robinson,We had a pretty good practice today. Everything was pretty crispy.
Michael Robinson,"Reruns is not located in a typical retail environment. People are expecting to see a lawyer's office, not a kids' shop, in that part of town."
Michael Robinson,"We wanted to come back from last week, ... We were really excited going into this game. Joe (coach Joe Paterno) had to tell us to calm down a few times."
Michael Robinson,"I didn't like it. Once I heard it was a fake, you know, me and coach kind of had it out a little bit. I guess the older I've gotten, the more he let me say some stuff."
Michael Robinson,"We wanted to go deep. Coach came in at halftime and said they couldn't handle our speed on the outside, and we just wanted to stretch them vertically. We had to hit some deep balls because they were blitzing every time."
Michael Robinson,"Our coaches have done a great job using what we have, and we have some speed on the outside, ... Coach Paterno said we were going to put the best players on the field. I've become a lot more comfortable under center, and the more games we play, the more comfortable I feel."
Michael Robinson,Handset Gateways enable businesses of all sizes to migrate quickly to IP telephony and benefit from next generation feature functionality without buying or installing expensive new phones or performing costly LAN infrastructure upgrades.
Michael Robinson,"From what I hear from the defensive players, he's a tremendous athlete. Hopefully we can keep him bottled up."
Michael Robinson,My athletic ability is both a gift and curse.
Nate Robinson,I apologized to him like 100 times already. I definitely took full responsibility of what I did. Hopefully it's minor because I would hate for me to be the one to hurt his career or anything like that.
Nate Robinson,"It's hard -- they shouldnâ€™t have even made that,"
Nate Robinson,"In college, the fans cheer the whole game, from start to finish. In the NBA it's really laid back."
Paul Robinson,"I think we face a revolution in espionage and this has truly been a wake-up call to our laboratory to look at what might have been done and what may be done using the new technologies,"
Paul Robinson,"It's very, very common practice to pick parking lots, like apartment complexes and retail facilities, to do transactions. I can't say that's exactly what happened. But it certainly is something we'd be looking at,"
Paul Robinson,"No I don't think so, everybody makes mistakes and he's our manager and we want to do well for him? Yeah, of course I would."
Paul Robinson,"Unlike the memory of humans, the video footage is pretty attractive. But that depends on the quality of the footage."
Paul Robinson,He is another great addition for Tottenham and it is just another example of the way the club wants to move forward.
Phil Robinson,"It's a miracle we're not trying a homicide case,"
Phil Robinson,"They don't support probable cause for any of the offenses that are alleged,"
Phil Robinson,"So often space is wasted, or dead, in a house which the owners consider too small. First, you need to take away the name of the room, and then the space is liberated for a variety of new uses."
Phil Robinson,"Customers are very tolerant about the Dec. 20 issues, due to the service levels they've come to expect. Everyone now knows about what was a 2.5-hour outage over a 4.5-hour time period. What happened was a rare database error, and it has been fixed. We're running as well as we've ever run."
Phil Robinson,"I do understand that density is a much more important factor than in the past, ... but Victorian terraces are built to exceedingly high densities, yet because of their high ceilings and clever design, they feel more spacious than modern homes."
Richard Robinson,Mobile are a key revenue-generating service emerging in China.
Richard Robinson,"Record-breaking sales of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince drove significantly higher results in children's book publishing and distribution and for the company overall,"
Richard Robinson,"Because the congressman is a man of deep and committed faith, he wanted to let people know personally that he has done absolutely nothing to dishonor them or his church."
Richard Robinson,It was difficult for the congressman to see people whose sole mission was to defame and defeat Mr. DeLay be successful at that.
Richard Robinson,This type of adversity tends to galvanize your support.
Steve Robinson,The vibrancy in our sports programs is still there.
Steve Robinson,My eyes have never seen such a sight.
Steve Robinson,I just had to come back to see this beautiful bird come back to this runway. Discovery was virtually perfect on this mission.
Steve Robinson,We tried from late January to mid-February. We did two surveys of all the boys in high school and let them know if they were at all interested in baseball to be sure to come and sign up. It just didn't work. It was surprising to me.
Steve Robinson,"The Cows have continued to stay popular with our audiences. They are endearing personalities that are staunch supporters of chicken, and our customers not only find them humorous, but they enjoy watching to see what they might say or do. You never know where the Cows might show up next."
Tony Robinson,There's some truth to it. We do a lot of talking but we aren't producing anything.
Tony Robinson,"The community needs to know that we, food service, will support them, ... We live in such a poor community this may be the only place they have."
Tony Robinson,"Due to the extraordinary circumstances, we've asked that everybody cancel or relocate their events."
Tony Robinson,"We estimated that it would cost between Â£700 and Â£800 each and the boys chipped in their own money. They washed cars, put up raffle and car-boot sales."
Bobby Robson,"I took a risk in putting Dyer on because I trusted our public. They didn't let me down,"
Bobby Robson,I am really looking forward to working with the new manager and his team. Stephen's record and reputation speak for themselves and I am delighted to help and advise Stephen in any way he sees fit.
Bobby Robson,He's the only man I know who could start an argument with himself
Bobby Robson,This is rotten luck and taken the edge off the result. Other teams will be laughing now.
Bobby Robson,"There's nothing we won't do to try to bring success to Irish football. We need to spread our net, we need to find out where there are any more (players). We know what we should keep; we know what we need to collect. We've got to look further than the present crop. There's an awful lot of scouting to do but we're not afraid of that."
Bobby Robson,"We gathered great experience in the Champions League last season and you cannot beat experience in whatever you do,"
Bobby Robson,We had an inner strength and the players are better for that experience. We played the big teams and were never outclassed.
Bobby Robson,The first ninety minutes of a football match are the most important.
Bobby Robson,Home advantage gives you an advantage.
Bobby Robson,Practice makes permanent.
Bobby Robson,"George had such great courage on the ball,"
Bobby Robson,"We can't replace Rooney, I don't think there's another player like him in the country... there's hardly another player like him in Europe."
Bobby Robson,The game is on a precipice but hopefully we can dismiss one of my former clubs from the competition.
Bobby Robson,But at 0-0 in the last five minutes you could go out of this competition. It would be like being a cat on a hot tin roof. The first goal will be very important.
Bobby Robson,"Whatever age they might be now, they should feel that same desire for wanting to play for their country -- passion, enthusiasm, attitude and commitment are vital to us."
Bobby Robson,"In a year's time, he's a year older."
Bryan Robson,Neil Clement and Curtis Davies are developing a good understanding as central defenders and getting to know each other's game well.
Bryan Robson,"We have to ask questions about ourselves after this performance,"
Bryan Robson,That's a good result for us. We got a few breaks today which we deserved for our second-half performance.
Bryan Robson,"It had crossed my mind for a second to take him off, ... He had a long, hard summer, he didn't get much of a break and hasn't been at his sharpest. But you also know he's always liable to do something like that."
Bryan Robson,"The team shouldn't miss one player. Kieran Richardson was a great influence on us because he had a lot of pace and was an aggressive lad, ... But I should be able to find one player in my squad who can match his qualities even if maybe they are not as good."
Bryan Robson,"Zoltan is still nowhere ready to train, he's had an injection in his groin and we hope it will settle down towards the weekend. At this moment he is very doubtful for Saturday's game."
Bryan Robson,"Geoff works hard, looks very sharp and he has scored some important goals for us,"
Bryan Robson,"Geoff deserved a new contract. He works hard, looks very sharp and has scored some very important goals. I'm delighted he has signed for another two years."
Bryan Robson,"What was in the national papers was nonsense, ... At this moment in time we have big games coming up over the next month and I'm happy with my squad."
Bryan Robson,That's why it's best for him to go out on a month's loan and play first-team football. I can gauge where his fitness is while he's playing for Forest.
Bryan Robson,A draw wouldn't be a disaster for us but no way would I ever send my team out to draw a game.
Bryan Robson,I'll make changes but that doesn't mean I'm underestimating Bradford or dismissing the competition.
Bryan Robson,Geoff deserved a new contract and this will take him up to the age of 33. The way he has gone about his job since I've been here has been very good.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The common foible of women who have been handsome is to forget that they are no longer so.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,It is great folly to wish to be wise all alone.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,It's the height of folly to want to be the only wise one.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us more than we wish.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"If we are to judge of love by its consequences, it more nearly resembles hatred than friendship."

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Pride does not wish to owe and vanity does not wish to pay.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,A refusal of praise is a desire to be praised twice.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Nothing is impossible; there are ways that lead to everything, and if we had sufficient will we should always have sufficient means. It is often merely for an excuse that we say things are impossible."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Few things are impracticable in themselves; and it is for want of application, rather than of means, that men fail to succeed."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"When a man finds no peace within himself, it is useless to seek it elsewhere."

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Passion makes idiots of the cleverest men, and makes the biggest idiots clever."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,In the human heart new passions are forever being born; the overthrow of one almost always means the rise of another.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"If we resist our passions, it is more through their weakness than from our strength."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We think very few people sensible, except those who are of our opinion."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We credit scarcely any persons with good sense except those who are of our opinion.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We would frequently be ashamed of our good deeds if people saw all of the motives that produced them.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We promise according to our hopes and perform according to our fears.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Fortune and humor govern the world.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The happiness or unhappiness of men depends as much on their humors as on fortune.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There are heroes in evil as well as in good.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Sincerity is an openness of heart; we find it in very few people; what we usually see is only an artful dissimulation to win the confidence of others.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"When our hatred is violent, it sinks us even beneath those we hate."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,When our hatred is too bitter it places us below those whom we hate.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are never so happy nor so unhappy as we imagine.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are more interested in making others believe we are happy than in trying to be happy ourselves.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,To achieve greatness one should live as if they will never die.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We seldom find people ungrateful so long as it is thought we can serve them.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,In most of mankind gratitude is merely a secret hope of further favors.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Gracefulness is to the body what understanding is to the mind.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There are few good women who do not tire of their role.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,What is called generosity is usually only the vanity of giving; we enjoy the vanity more than the thing given.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"If we judge of love by its usual effects, it resembles hatred more than friendship."

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"You can find women who have never had an affair, but it is hard to find a woman who has had just one."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Women's virtue is frequently nothing but a regard to their own quiet and a tenderness for their reputation.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Why is it that our memory is good enough to retain the least triviality that happens to us, and yet not good enough to recollect how often we have told it to the same person?"
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"When our vices leave us, we like to imagine it is we who are leaving them."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"When a man must force himself to be faithful in his love, this is hardly better than unfaithfulness."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"When a man is in love, he doubts, very often, what he most firmly believes."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Whatever good things people say of us, they tell us nothing new."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,What we call generosity is for the most part only the vanity of giving; and we exercise it because we are more fond of that vanity than of the thing we give.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,What makes the pain we feel from shame and jealousy so cutting is that vanity can give us no assistance in bearing them.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"What keeps us from abandoning ourselves entirely to one vice, often, is the fact that we have several."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We would rather speak ill of ourselves than not talk about ourselves at all.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We should often feel ashamed of our best actions if the world could see all the motives which produced them.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We often pardon those that annoy us, but we cannot pardon those we annoy."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We may sooner be brought to love them that hate us, than them that love us more than we would have them do."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We may seem great in an employment below our worth, but we very often look little in one that is too big for us."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We have no patience with other people's vanity because it is offensive to our own.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We easily forgive our friends those faults that do no affect us ourselves.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We do not praise others, ordinarily, but in order to be praised ourselves."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We come altogether fresh and raw into the several stages of life, and often find ourselves without experience, despite our years."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are very far from always knowing our own wishes.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are strong enough to bear the misfortunes of others.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are sometimes as different from ourselves as we are from others.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are so used to dissembling with others that in time we come to deceive and dissemble with ourselves.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are never so ridiculous through what we are as through what we pretend to be.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are never either so fortunate or so misfortunate as we imagine.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We are easily comforted for the misfortunes of our friends, when those misfortunes give us an occasion of expressing our affection and solicitude."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We are all strong enough to bear other men's misfortunes.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We always love those who admire us, but we do not always love those whom we admire."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"We always love those that admire us, but we do not always love those we admire."

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Virtue would go far if vanity did not keep it company.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Too great haste to repay an obligation is a kind of ingratitude.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Though nature be ever so generous, yet can she not make a hero alone. Fortune must contribute her part too; and till both concur, the work cannot be perfected."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Though men are apt to flatter and exalt themselves with their great achievements, yet these are, in truth, very often owing not so much to design as chance."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Those that have had great passions esteem themselves for the rest of their lives fortunate and unfortunate in being cured of them.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,They that apply themselves to trifling matters commonly become incapable of great ones.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There is nothing men are so generous of as advice.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There is no better proof of a man's being truly good than his desiring to be constantly under the observation of good men.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There is many a virtuous woman weary of her trade.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There are very few things impossible in themselves; and we do not want means to conquer difficulties so much as application and resolution in the use of means.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There are but very few men clever enough to know all the mischief they do.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There are bad people who would be less dangerous if they were quite devoid of goodness.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,There are a great many men valued in society who have nothing to recommend them but serviceable vices.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The word virtue is as useful to self-interest as the vices.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The surest way to be deceived is to consider oneself cleverer than others.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The reason that lovers never weary each other is because they are always talking about themselves.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The name and pretense of virtue is as serviceable to self-interest as are real vices.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The moderation of people in prosperity is the effect of a smooth and composed temper, owing to the calm of their good fortune."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The mind cannot long play the heart's role.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The man that thinks he loves his mistress for her own sake is mightily mistaken.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,The greatest part of intimate confidences proceed from a desire either to be pitied or admired.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The generality of virtuous women are like hidden treasures, they are safe only because nobody has sought after them."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The force we use on ourselves, to prevent ourselves from loving, is often more cruel than the severest treatment at the hands of one loved."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The first lover is kept a long while, when no offer is made of a second."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The desire of talking of ourselves, and showing those faults we do not mind having seen, makes up a good part of our sincerity."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The defects of the mind, like those of the face, grow worse with age."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The defects and faults of the mind are like wounds in the body; after all imaginable care has been taken to heal them up, still there will be a scar left behind, and they are in continual danger of breaking the skin and bursting out again."
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"The accent of a man's native country remains in his mind and his heart, as it does in his speech."

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,No men are oftener wrong than those that can least bear to be so.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,Jealousy springs more from love of self than from love of another.

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Jealousy is bred in doubts. When those doubts change into certainties, then the passion either ceases or turns absolute madness."

Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,We pardon to the extent that we love.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,He who lives without folly isn't so wise as he thinks.
Francois VI Duc de La Rochefoucauld,"Neither love nor fire can subsist without perpetual motion; both cease to live so soon as they cease to hope, or to fear."

Andy Roddick,He served real well and that got him out of trouble a lot. He returned well. I hit a bomb and he'd block it back and I'd be back to neutral again.

I told the chair umpire I was going to."
Andy Roddick,It's tough but I left nothing out there and Roger is a great champion.
Andy Roddick,I didn't have anything left in my body to use as fuel. I just felt dead. I had no energy after that. I puked out all my fluids and after that I was pretty dehydrated.
Andy Roddick,I really honestly wish I didn't have a birthday in this tournament.
Andy Roddick,I wish I didn't have a birthday during this tournament. This has totally blindsided me. I just felt like I would have a pretty good run here.

Andy Roddick,"I've tried to serve with a little bit more authority, ... I felt like I needed to become more aggressive. My aggression out there is my weapon."
Andy Roddick,"My aggression out there is my weapon. I think it's more letting them know that I'm not going to let them get away with something, and I'm not just going to kind of poke it back and be content to stay in rallies."

Aaron Rodgers,There wasn't a lot of passion on the field. I have no problem telling people I didn't think there was a whole lot of passion out there. I thought it seemed like some of the guys were going through the motions.

Aaron Rodgers,"If I can slow it down in my mind, ... Things will be fine."
Aaron Rodgers,"I didn't expect to play at all this season, but I thank Brett for giving us such a big lead, ... Someone asked me if I was nervous before I went in. I was like, 'We're up 45-3, what do I have to be nervous about?' It was a lot of fun out there."
Aaron Rodgers,"I get the same game plan Brett gets,"
Aaron Rodgers,"He made fun of me a lot. He made me shave my beard. He gets on me and J.T. (O'Sullivan, another quarterback) for being from the West Coast."
Aaron Rodgers,"It was a very good learning experience for me, ... You can learn from your mistakes and improve."
Aaron Rodgers,Tonight is not a setback. It's just a learning experience.
Aaron Rodgers,"That's the best defense we've played all year, but by far the cheapest, ... I got spit on. I make a good block, and the guy spits on me. I saw that too many times today. It's disgusting. I got poked in the eye. They had their hands in our facemasks all day."
Aaron Rodgers,"Brett was phenomenal today, ... The day before his 36th birthday, he looked like a 22-year-old out there. Unbelievable."
Aaron Rodgers,"He has nothing left to prove. At the same time, he still has the desire and ability. Although you might not believe me, I hope he comes back."

Bill Rodgers,Anybody can be a runner... We were meant to move. We were meant to run. It's the easiest sport.
Bill Rodgers,I believe in gradual experimentation with running shoes.
Bill Rodgers,"I believe in keeping running simple and, in regard to shoes, that would mean no gimmicks, unnecessary cushioning, etc."
Bill Rodgers,"I believe you'll develop speed via strength work which includes hill running, either repeats, or running hilly courses as the Kenyans do on a steady basis."
Bill Rodgers,Hills are terrific for running.

Mark Rodgers,"It's important work, and it's good that the U.S. government would get involved. Certainly the European Union has gotten involved in the field."
Mark Rodgers,"This is an unprecedented move in giving the governor veto power over an energy project in federal waters in the outer continental shelf. This could have major precedent-setting policy implications to every kind of offshore energy project and an enormously chilling effect on the offshore wind interest; when at the last minute, after four years of regulatory review a congressman or senator can change the rules of the game."
Mark Rodgers,"Making important energy policy that affects national security, the economy and public health is too important to be done behind the closed doors of a conference committee that avoids public hearings or the scrutiny of the full committees of each chamber. This is coming at a time when members of both parties are talking about their commitment to reform Congress to make their work more transparent and to curtail the influence of lobbyists."
Mark Rodgers,The calculator is designed to provide a basic projection of consumers' buying potential. Our built-in debt-to-income ratio calculates the high end of affordability.
Mark Rodgers,Opponents have long complained that Congress had not authorized commercial development of offshore wind energy. Now it has.
Auguste Rodin,"There are unknown forces in nature; when we give ourselves wholly to her, without reserve, she lends them to us; she shows us these forms, which our watching eyes do not see, which our intelligence does not understand or suspect."

Auguste Rodin,I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don't need.

Luis Rodriguez,"They would probably rather be home sleeping, but they took time to do this with us."
Luis Rodriguez,"It's like a chill spot, people go over there and gossip."
Luis Rodriguez,"My mom was the glue that kept the family together. She would talk, and everyone would follow."
Luis Rodriguez,"If you left the country you were considered a traitor, ... Almost none of their names were mentioned when I was at (architecture) school."
Luis Rodriguez,"Usually, the girls just get two minutes on the phone, then they're off, ... This is different. Compassion is needed."
Luis Rodriguez,"I was playing softball, and wasn't playing baseball. I was on the bench in the beginning and I had to earn my ranks. I started to practice, went to the batting cages, starting running and lifting weights. Ever since then, I have been hitting either first or second in the lineup."
Narciso Rodriguez,Piracy in fashion is rampant.
Narciso Rodriguez,"I started to design the collection by designing the fabric. ... I had some antique fabrics that I had developed into new fabrics, and then introduced reflective materials into the fabrics,"
Narciso Rodriguez,I want to celebrate the woman's beauty and I felt I had achieved that when I looked at all of it together.
Paul Rodriguez,"Hunting is not a sport. In a sport, both sides should know they're in the game."
Paul Rodriguez,"I'm a real shy guy. I don't really talk at all. My dad is the opposite, ... I see how he handles himself with fans, so I just kind of subconsciously took notes. Sometimes I see myself, and I'm like 'Whoa, this is how my dad acts.'"
Paul Rodriguez,Maybe he's my good luck charm.
Rich Rodriguez,"We are going to take him as long as he does his part academically, and we'll continue to support him as long as Greg does what he needs to do. He's got to do his part, and he knows that."
Rich Rodriguez,"It showed more than anything that when one team gains momentum, especially in a bowl, it's hard to stop it."
Rich Rodriguez,He's an explosive player. We've really been on him about making one cut and then running. He did that today and he really made it work.
Rich Rodriguez,"There's some nicks and bruises, but nothing that should keep anyone out of practice."
Rich Rodriguez,I think out guys are excited because practice is finally over.
Rich Rodriguez,"Jason's brought the power back to us,"
Rich Rodriguez,They know Maryland. They know we've been embarrassed by them several times in the past.
Rich Rodriguez,"We never had an opportunity to get another group in there, or test our conditioning. We never got gassed, because they were three and out so many times. We wanted to play more people. That's a goal of ours."
Rich Rodriguez,Pat just seized the opportunity and made the most of it.
Rich Rodriguez,"We went over to the Dome last night to the game to get a sense of the atmosphere, and I know it will be even louder Monday night. Communication is going to be a big key, but we can't prepare our guys fully until it happens."
Rich Rodriguez,You can't make missed assignments and give them cheap ones. They're good enough to beat you without you making mistakes; you can't make mistakes mentally and have a chance to do it.
Rich Rodriguez,"He still made a couple of mistakes, but not as many as a first-year player usually makes. He has the right temperament for that position. He runs hard and he has a burst."
Rich Rodriguez,"I don't mind them being proud,"
Rich Rodriguez,We're obviously excited to win the outright Big East championship. Our young men have worked very hard all season to achieve this goal.
Rich Rodriguez,"Hey, we have a lot of guys back. And we can't run guys out of here. They love going to bowl games and getting those gifts. But I am approaching it the same. I am anxious to see how much better our guys can get. Everybody that we played (in the Big East) had a young team last year. We played pretty well, but there are always areas to improve."
Rich Rodriguez,"I don't see it unlike a bunch of guys being at a ... convention sitting around trading ideas, helping each other's company."
Rich Rodriguez,"Not only were we down, but we didn't really have any signs of hope in those other 3 quarters. It was kind of improbable."
Rich Rodriguez,"Right now, he's blocking better than any wideout we've had. He's really taken to heart all the little things you're supposed to do. He's earned the right to start."
Rich Rodriguez,"We lost a lot of guys to graduation last year, so we realized there wasn't going to be a lot of talk about us winning the Big East this year. It was neat to watch them come together."
Rich Rodriguez,They're doing pretty good. I'd like to get more pressure on the quarterback at times. But those guys are giving pretty good effort. I like the way they work. I think they are all guys that are very strong and can run and can understand what we want out of their schemes.
Rich Rodriguez,"The last couple of games there's been a lot of long drives. The games are going a lot faster, which is OK as long as you win it."
Rich Rodriguez,Playing in a BCS game helps with getting the team name out there. Players are going to go where they think they can excel.
Rich Rodriguez,"I think you're going to have to make some plays in the passing game, whether or not the opportunities are there I don't know. But nobody has been able to run the ball on them,"
Rich Rodriguez,"[Wofford runs a wishbone attack similar to Navy and Air Force.] Their offensive linemen aren't as big, but they get on you and cut block a lot, ... They get low and get on your knees."
Rich Rodriguez,Our tailbacks are going to score a lot when we're running the football and I thought [Steve] made some nice runs.
Rich Rodriguez,As I mentioned to some folks last night. There's a lot of good football teams in the Big East and we had some very competitive battles with them and we'll continue to have those the next several years.
Rich Rodriguez,Those guys were not intimidated or overly excited about the environment at all. Nothing overwhelmed them. Really this was the case for them all year.
Rich Rodriguez,"I don't want to dampen anyone's enthusiasm, ... but we should be the underdog."
Rich Rodriguez,"Our guys believed the whole season that we could defend our Big East title, and we've played with that dedication and focus on the field. I'm very happy for our seniors and our whole football family."
Rich Rodriguez,"I think we took to heart some of the criticism of our league and the fact that no one was predicting us to win. Basically, we were playing in their home environment, their home state."
Rich Rodriguez,"[The Mountaineers didn't substitute on defense against Syracuse because the Orange failed to control the ball longer than six plays on any drive. Syracuse's longest drive covered 26 yards.] We never had an opportunity to get another group in there, or test our conditioning, ... We never got gassed, because they were three and out so many times. We wanted to play more people. That's a goal of ours."
Rich Rodriguez,"Not only were we down, it wasn't even a ball game. They were in control. I told our guys all we need is a spark or two."
Rich Rodriguez,"It's really big to be able to play with confidence, and they are. Of course, hopefully our guys are [confident], too."
Rich Rodriguez,"They're playing with a lot of confidence. They're playing fast, too. If your guys play hard and play fast, that gives you a chance, and that's what they're doing."
Rich Rodriguez,His options are really limited. I know he'd have to go to a junior college and graduate before getting a chance at another Division I school.
Rich Rodriguez,"In 20-some years of college coaching, I have never had two quarterbacks hurt in one game. I don't want to jinx us."
Rich Rodriguez,"They'll either be in bed or they'll be back on the plane to Pittsburgh. Nobody wants to be sent home from a bowl game because, one, you want to enjoy a big game and, two, your name is going to be on the bottom of that ESPN ticker thing that goes non-stop across the bottom of the TV screen."
Rich Rodriguez,"It's like a basketball coach saying he's been to the Final Four. It's nice to have that recognition, but our goal is to be there more than once, and win it."
Rich Rodriguez,He'll get his most action.
Rich Rodriguez,"We'll have to roll guys in there, ... I think we felt his absence a little bit. He'd really played well at nose guard and held the point down for us. That's a key, key position on the defensive front."
Rich Rodriguez,"They have some other players. With D.J. Shockley's ability to throw the ball down the field, I think they'll still take some deep shots."
Robert Rodriguez,"I've always felt like I've been wagging the tail of the big technology dog, to see what I could get it to do. Since I started using AMD64 technology, the technology is now wagging me, to see what I can do with it. AMD LIVE! Fulfils the final dream, by delivering the goods as originally imagined by the artist."
Robert Rodriguez,"You're out there in your race suit and your jeans and nobody knows who you are, ... The Kiplinger Report."
Robert Rodriguez,"Once it happened, I had a better practice in the afternoon. I'm growing more and more comfortable as the weeks have progressed. It was probably my most comfortable practice. I knew exactly what I was doing (on) special teams, so I went after it. It felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders."
Robert Rodriguez,"IÃ†ve been drawing since I was a young kid, ... I just had the passion to draw, so I kept at it. I want people to enjoy my art."
Robert Rodriguez,"They have the necessary abundance of food and the non-disturbance they need to breed, to procreate and to thrive in this area,"
Robert Rodriguez,I hope to have more control over that in the future.
Robert Rodriguez,"(Bernstein's) music continues to be loved by all kinds of audiences, ... So get your tickets early. Our concert is going to be packed."
Robert Rodriguez,"Even though I can make my own budgets, I always ask for less money than we need so that you have to be more creative, you have to strip it down."
Robert Rodriguez,What I love about new technology is that it really pushes the art. It really pushes it in a way that you can't imagine until you come up with the idea. It's idea-based. You can do anything.
Robert Rodriguez,"The challenge is what was making it exciting. You don't want to do anything that's too easy or that you know that you can pull off, otherwise it's really not worth doing."
Robert Rodriguez,Don't be told something is impossible. There's always a way.
Robert Rodriguez,"Frank is such a great visual storyteller, that if you study his artwork you see that his Sin City books are already the best movies never seen on the big screen."
Robert Rodriguez,"Don't give me any money, don't give me any people, but give freedom, and I'll give you a movie that looks gigantic."
Glenn Roeder,Nothing could be further from the truth.
Glenn Roeder,"Nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, Michael has been to see his specialist for an X-ray and a scan and as a result, he missed a couple of days' training."
Glenn Roeder,When Titus Bramble went off Jean Alain seemed to take on all the responsibility and it was almost as if he said to himself 'I am the man now'.
Glenn Roeder,"We are pleased with that performance and result. Bolton are a hard team to play against, you can see that by their results, and I am delighted, as we played some terrific football."
Glenn Roeder,"Some of our players did well, some didn't. We conceded two goals before we'd even caught our breath. In the end I was stood there thinking, 'My God, I wish we'd got Rooney.' He's not even near his full potential right now but in three or four years there's every chance he could be the world's No1 player."
Glenn Roeder,"We are still waiting for confirmation but all the signs are that Scott has got glandular fever. Doctors don't like to say anything until test results come back, but that is what we are expecting."
Glenn Roeder,"The only huge achievement next week will be taking three points off the Bolton Wanderers. If you look beyond that, you trip up very quickly."
Jeremy Roenick,"It would be a travesty if I'm not. I know they want a youth movement, and they need to have one, but it'd be disrespectful of the guys who have gotten Team USA to this point internationally."
Jeremy Roenick,"I'm mulling over a lot of things right now and I'm not ruling out retirement,"
Jeremy Roenick,"To not have the opportunity to go back one more time and try and win the gold is obviously, in my opinion, very disrespectful. They can beat me down and say I'm over the hill or say that I don't have it anymore, but to me, I know that I do."
Jeremy Roenick,It was a fluky goal they (the Wings) scored on the game-winner. But they're a good team.
Jeremy Roenick,"It was a fluky goal they (the Wings) scored on the game-winner, ... But they're a good team."
Jeremy Roenick,"[â€¢ Dan Daly of the Washington Times, on the] future considerations ... In hockey that usually means a roll of tape, a couple of cracked sticks and the backup goalie in Moose Jaw."
Jeremy Roenick,It's (bad) that we lost. We worked hard. We deserved a better fate. I think we showed them that we're going to be a hard team to play against in this building.
Jeremy Roenick,"We're a strong union, but we are frustrated with the lack of communication, the lack dialogue and negotiation by the NHL,"
Jeremy Roenick,We have no confidence in our ability and no confidence that we are doing it right. We just made too many mistakes. We are afraid of failure and doing something wrong.
Theodore Roethke,"All finite things reveal infinitude: The mountain with its singular bright shade Like the blue shine on freshly frozen snow, The after-light upon ice-burdened pines; Odor of basswood upon a mountain slope, A scene beloved of bees; Silence of wate"
Theodore Roethke,What is madness but nobility of soul. At odds with circumstance?
Theodore Roethke,I learn by going where I have to go
Theodore Roethke,"I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. I feel my fate in what I cannot fear. I learn by going where I cannot go."
Theodore Roethke,"The soul has many motions, body one."
Theodore Roethke,Time marks us while we are marking time.
Theodore Roethke,Love begets love. This torment is my joy.
Theodore Roethke,"I came to love, I came into my own."
Theodore Roethke,A lively understandable spirit Once entertained you. It will come again. Be still. Wait.
Theodore Roethke,"Over every mountain there is a path, although it may not be seen from the valley."
Theodore Roethke,"Deep in their roots, all flowers keep the light."
Ben Roethlisberger,"We haven't run a lot of plays that fit me getting out of the pocket, ... Once we start game-planning, that's to our strength and our advantage."
Ben Roethlisberger,It's an opportunity to see these guys again and just relax a little bit.
Ben Roethlisberger,"Our defense is all over the place, and it's so much fun watching them play. Offensively, we haven't played mistake-free football, but we've been playing well and we're going to have to keep doing that if we want to go to where we want to go."
Ben Roethlisberger,"It feels like an eternity since I've been out there. I can't wait to get out there and get on the field so the guys know I'm back, and hopefully I'm back to stay for a while."
Ben Roethlisberger,"The doctors are telling me it looks good. As long as I keep telling myself it feels good, I'll be OK."
Ben Roethlisberger,"You don't expect that from a guy like that. Obviously, he was a little frustrated. But I don't remember complaining. It's just unfortunate coming from a guy like that."
Ben Roethlisberger,"I told Tom that if I was a coach, that?s who I?d want on the field, ... I had all the confidence in the world in our defense and I?d still take our defense next time."
Ben Roethlisberger,"We'll probably still think we're underdogs. We know we're going into it believing in each other, and if no one else believes in us, that's fine with us. Because we know the mentality that we need to take into the game, and that's the mentality we'll take into the game."
Ben Roethlisberger,Y'all want to come in now? All the non-believers. You want to come in now?
Ben Roethlisberger,I promised him that I would get him four game balls. I'm glad that I could fulfill the promises that I made to him.
Joe Rogan,"When someone comes along and expresses him or herself as freely as they think, people flock to it. They enjoy it."
Joe Rogan,"To me, comedy is a great occupation because I don't really worry that much about what other people think of me."
Joe Rogan,The only time I commit to conspiracy theories is when something way retarded happens. Like Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone.
Joe Rogan,The misconception is that standup comics are always on. I don't know any really funny comics that are annoying and constantly trying to be funny all the time.
Joe Rogan,"The Comedy Store in LA, it's a really loose room and it's really dark and creepy and a great place to explore your own thoughts onstage."
Joe Rogan,The audience changes every night. You're the same person. You have to speak your mind and do the stuff that you think is funny and makes you laugh.
Joe Rogan,People want their 15 minutes and are willing to do anything to get it.
Joe Rogan,People for the most part can smell lies.
Joe Rogan,"Never stay in a bad marriage, and don't hang around with psycho coke fiends."
Joe Rogan,It's painful for me to watch someone who isn't funny. It's horrifying to sit in the back and watch some guy who just totally sucks.
Joe Rogan,"It never hurt Lenny Bruce's career to get arrested for swearing. It did back in the time, but he broke those doors down by doing the stuff that he believed in."
Joe Rogan,"If you are the greatest, why would you go around talking about it?"
Joe Rogan,"If someone plays a brooding actor in a film, people think they're brooding all the time."
Joe Rogan,"I'm a huge Groucho fan. There were some great comic minds that would transfer into any generation, and Groucho is certainly one of them."
Joe Rogan,I wouldn't totally rule out doing Letterman or the Tonight Show if I had a set that I just happened to write that I thought was funny but was still appropriate for network censors. But I'm not going to go out of my way.
Joe Rogan,I really never had any ambitions to be a standup comic. I was talked into it by guys that I used to work out with.
Joe Rogan,"I had a great time on News Radio, I got to make tons of money in relative obscurity and learn a lot about the TV biz and work on my standup act constantly. It was a dream gig."
Joe Rogan,"Have you ever talked to someone, and you're not even really talking to them? Actors are the worst for that."
Joe Rogan,"Comedy is really not like any other art form in that it's very specialized and varied in it's content, but generic in it's title."
Joe Rogan,"Being a celebrity or anything else where you're really ambitious, it's really a game to see how successful you can get."
Joe Rogan,"Because I have a girlfriend, I try and take the straight and narrow path, which is good because it prevents VD."
Joe Rogan,Apartment living is tough action. Just the whole idea that you share a washer and dryer always freaked me out.
Joe Rogan,"After this whole acting thing is over and done, you eventually have to be human. Some people are never human. It's very weird."
Joe Rogan,"Richard Pryor is, in my mind, the most honest comedian. He bared his soul to people. I think that's why everybody loved him so much."
Joe Rogan,My act is so completely and totally uncensored that the only way I could really pull it off is if I treat the audience like they're my best friends.
Joe Rogan,"I had seen movies before that that had made me laugh, but I had never seen anything even remotely close to as funny as Richard Pryor was, just standing there talking."
Joe Rogan,"That's my only goal. Surround myself with funny people, and make sure everyone has a good time and works hard."
Joe Rogan,"If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure."
Adrian Rogers,"The city has come together for strength and to rally -- that is a good thing,"

Bill Rogers,"Matt got the job done OK, but he wasn't real sharp. He had to throw a lot of pitches."
Bill Rogers,The secret to not getting scammed and successfully getting a timeshare is all in the educational process prior to purchasing. It eliminates about 90 percent of the problems with timesharing.

Bill Rogers,"My price went up 17 cents last night, and that's just the beginning, I'm afraid, ... It's not good news for anybody."
Bill Rogers,"It's quite an accomplishment. We're trying awful hard to have good (test) scores. To me, it's extremely prestigious because it's a difficult task to do."
Carl Rogers,"It would not take very long to recoup our money, ... It would be a very short payback."
Carl Rogers,The only person who cannot be helped is that person who blames others.

Fred Rogers,I think of discipline as the continual everyday process of helping a child learn self-discipline.
Fred Rogers,"I like to compare the holiday season with the way a child listens to a favorite story. The pleasure is in the familiar way the story begins, the anticipation of familiar turns it takes, the familiar moments of suspense, and the familiar climax and ending."

Jim Rogers,Today's stock price does not reflect the company's value.
Jim Rogers,"Research has shown that it's extremely unusual to find more than one infected animal in a herd, especially in a country where the disease has as low a prevalence as it does in the U.S.. Plus there are food safety measures taken at the time of slaughter that are designed to prevent potentially contaminated material from entering the food chain."
Jim Rogers,My basic advise is don't lose money
Jim Rogers,Then we told them the asking price. One man said he could be in a hotel by Saturday.
Jim Rogers,That's outrageous. There is something terribly wrong in their methodology for educating kids.
Jim Rogers,"Having an entity out there assessing and evaluating and having the information being made public, that's not all bad, ... It's just one additional way of providing some kind of picture of higher education in this country."
Jim Rogers,"I think I'm going to make a lot more money in coffee, orange juice or cotton, but I own silver as well."
Jim Rogers,You can no longer buy commodities at Merrill Lynch. My guess is many analysts and even executives are too young to know how profitable a hot commodities market can be. They will soon.
Jim Rogers,Throughout history the public has always piled into the latest bull market right at the top so few have caught on to the bull market in commodities.
Jim Rogers,"The price of a commodity will never go to zero. When you invest in commodities futures, you're not buying a piece of paper that says you own an intangible piece of company that can go bankrupt."

Jim Rogers,"I think this is also a great time to invest in private equity, helping companies grow from the ground up."
Jim Rogers,"Historically, there has been a bull market in commodities every 20 or 30 years."
Jim Rogers,"During the late 1970s and early 1980s, high prices led companies to overproduce, leading to substantial excess supply and stockpiling."
Jim Rogers,Do not buy the hype from Wall St. and the press that stocks always go up. There are long periods when stocks do nothing and other investments are better.
Jim Rogers,Commodities tend to zig when the equity markets zag.
Jim Rogers,Commodities are a great investment during an inflationary period because increases in the price of raw materials reflect the rising costs of goods.
Jim Rogers,Bottoms in the investment world don't end with four-year lows; they end with 10- or 15-year lows.
Jim Rogers,"Tough times helped many commodities producers become lean and mean through consolidation, mergers and cost-cutting. All that excess supply has been sopped up."
Jim Rogers,"If the current birth rate, which is the lowest in the major developed countries, continues, there will be no Japanese. Who will pay the enormous debt?"
Jim Rogers,Index investing outperforms active management year after year.
Jim Rogers,"Most of my thoughts, you couldn't print."
Jim Rogers,"Get inside information from the president and you will probably lose half your money. If you get it from the chairman of the board, you will lose all of your money."

John Rogers,"You're what I would call a commodity, a trained law enforcement officer."
John Rogers,"Most all our friends have been here, so well-known, yes indeed."
John Rogers,It really takes the flexibility away from the employer and the employee to make sure they have enough people on hand to do the work they want to do. If I want to work through my break or work through my lunch and leave early to attend a child-care matter the bill doesn't allow it.
Kenny Rogers,"You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run"
Kenny Rogers,"The skew of the audience has probably dropped 10 years, ... Older people don't have the spontaneity and the energy. You mix in 15-percent young kids and the older people enjoy the show more."

Kenny Rogers,Don't be afraid to give up the good for the great.
Kenny Rogers,"Know when to hold 'um, know when to fold 'um and know when to walk away from cameramen."

Kenny Rogers,There is a trade off - as you grow older you gain wisdom but you lose spontaneity.
Randy Rogers,Code Enforcement will be provided noise meters. Off-highway vehicle riders cannot disturb the peace.
Randy Rogers,"They came back against some kids that don't get a lot of minutes. We had a bunch of turnovers on some inbound plays and didn't take very good care of the ball the last five minutes. I thought we took good care of the ball in general, just not at the end of the game."
Randy Rogers,I truly believe she's one of the better -- if not one of the top five -- point guards in the country in junior college basketball.
Richard Rogers,There is no way I am going back there. I was looking for an excuse to get out and that was it.

Roy Rogers,What's a butterfly garden without butterflies?
Steve Rogers,We're eager to retail the cars because we're uncertain from week to week what they're worth.
Steve Rogers,"I have heard there are some problems with avalanches, the snow is really heavy and wet so it could happen at anytime."
Steve Rogers,By conserving power and avoiding power outages we are all protecting Lake Tahoe by reducing the risk of sewer spills.
Steve Rogers,"November's unemployment rates were a bit of a mixed bag. We had some gains in retail jobs that were offset by some layoffs in manufacturing, but (the layoffs) were not dramatically reflected in the numbers."
Steve Rogers,"I hate to make a prediction, but I would not be surprised if we reached 99% or 100% occupancy as this unfortunately unfolds."
Steve Rogers,"I hate to make a prediction, but I would not be surprised if we reached 99% or 100% occupancy as this unfortunately unfolds,"

Tom Rogers,Primarily our responsibility is to keep the lines clear so that utilities can provide reliable service to their customers.
Tom Rogers,"We still have a lot of work to do, but I do think we are making some real progress. We're still very much in a testing and learning stage."
Tom Rogers,"Beginning today, we're giving Yahoo users - whether they're at the office or away from home - the ability to easily schedule recordings for later viewing."
Will Rogers,"If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging."

You can take 'em or leave 'em - you can say they're funny or they're terrible or they're good, or whatever, but you can just pass 'em by. But with Congress, every time they make a joke, it's a law! And every time they make a law, it's a joke!"

Will Rogers,"If they wasn't in congress, why, they would be doing something else against us that might be even worse."

Jacques Rogge,"We are pleased by the pace of progress now,"
Jacques Rogge,"Even if there is a negative test, that is only part of the equation. We have evidence of Italian police which we should receive shortly. If you want to prove the guilt of athletes, there are various methods of proof."

Jacques Rogge,"We know of course that ... co-operation will have to be renewed with the federal government because of your elections. As soon as a new government is in place, the links will be made and improved, but definitely I think everything is okay."
Jacques Rogge,"Sponsorship is really a record in Vancouver and the economy being very hot, that means construction prices are soaring. That means also that profits of the companies are soaring and one might compensate the other."
Jacques Rogge,It is clear that the fight against doping is not served by the way in which the debate is currently held.
Jacques Rogge,"I think the net is the tightest we can have. We are testing in and out of competition. We are testing in the [athletes'] village, outside the village and in other countries where there are training camps. This is a control that is worldwide, not just in Piedmont or Italy."

Jim Rohn,Giving is better than receiving because giving starts the receiving process.

Scott Rolen,"I don't know if there's a magic number of at-bats for me to take in spring training. I'm not going to worry about it if I don't get to a certain number down here. I feel like I'm making progress, and that's what I thought this was all about."
Scott Rolen,"This is my job, and this is what I do,"
Scott Rolen,"A lot of people liked the old place. It had some history. A lot of great players played there. The way the game's going, the trend of the game, is to have new ballparks."

Scott Rolen,"Right now I'm turned loose and I'm hitting off the tee and playing golf, running, lifting, strength training, lifting as much as I want to lift. I'm not restricted right now. In my range of motion, I'm right at the very end of everything -- five degrees is what they're telling me."
Scott Rolen,"He's an eight-time Gold Glove outfielder; I'm certainly not worried about Jim Edmonds. I'm certainly not worried about him at the plate, I'm certainly not worried about him in the field. He's a huge part of this team, and right in the middle of everything."
Scott Rolen,"I have every expectation to be ready for spring training,"
Scott Rolen,"This is a longer process, no doubt. This is a more serious rehab. There it was kind of a healing time, and once I was done healing, then I could just strengthen and come right back. I had no loss of range of motion or anything like that. My range of motion was almost zero after this surgery, so I had to come all the way back."
Scott Rolen,There was a debate in the third where the bathroom was. We had a search party out for the bathroom; it was actually right in front of us. The door was closed.

Henry Rollins,"â€œThe whitest white dipped in clinging dirt. Another summer has thrown its corpse on my floor. The streets have given birth to even more strangers. Rivers of urine stripe the sidewalks. It rained the other day and the only thing that occurred to me was it would wash the smell away for a few days. Tonight is the first hot night. Outside my window, the human noise factor is intense. Itâ€™s past midnight. They talk too much. They scream liquor-fueled idiot chatter. I pull away and close the door. I think about how itâ€™s all going to play out. How much time people spend trying to get across to each other, trying to clear their names. Trying to overturn the charges brought against them. I have decided to tell them that itâ€™s all true and not seek a fair trial. Itâ€™s the only way to be free. Stop trying to matter. I could get my body tattooed with air-colored ink and walk invisibly amongst them. I have heard people say that they felt closer to their parents after they have died. Maybe if I treat people as if they were dead, I could get along with them better. I want to be able to like living people somehow. As it is now, theyâ€™re I best coming through speakers or trapped between book covers. Here I go into the heat. Four months as a human anvil.â€"
Henry Rollins,It'll destroy you if you try to make it mean anything to anyone but yourself.
Henry Rollins,"I must tell you that I was always afraid of the fury with which I loved you. It overwhelmed me. I thought it beyond comprehension, therefore my silence."
Henry Rollins,"When was the last time you wanted to say it all to the right person? To have it all come out right, to surprise yourself at how together you could be. When was the last time you ever met someone who made you want to give it all to them? I mean give yourself to them. Where you couldn't express yourself enough - like you wanted to cut off one of your arms to be understood. That's it - you would cut your head off to have someone understand you. You know how pointless that one is. You know how many times you've smashed yourself to bits on the rocks."
Henry Rollins,The average is the borderline that keeps mere men in their place. Those who step over the line are heroes by the very act. Go.
Henry Rollins,"The streets lie, the sidewalks lie, everything lies You can try and read it but you're gonna get it wrong...all wrong The summer evenings burn and melt and the nights glitter but you're gonna get it wrong And it's gonna sink its teeth into your flesh and pull you to the bottom."
Henry Rollins,I don't want to know. I don't need it. I don't want the information that millions of people have. I don't want to be fed these boring facts and figures. Then you'll become one of the masses. I'd rather starve my mind a bit and have to search out nutrition in stranger places.
Henry Rollins,"Nothing Brings People together more, then mutual hatred"
Henry Rollins,"If you hate your parents, the man or the establishment, don't show them up by getting wasted and wrapping your car around a tree. If you really want to rebel against your parents: outearn them, outlive them, and know more than they do."
Henry Rollins,It is no surprise to me that hardly anyone tells the truth about how they feel. The smart ones keep themselves to themselves for good reason. Why would you want to tell anyone anything that's dear to you? Even when you like them and want nothing more than to be closer than close to them? It's so painful to be next to someone you feel strongly about and know you can't say the things you want to.
Henry Rollins,"My feelings for you shame me into silence. The truth of this and your name will never be revealed. It is you who has made me realize the failure of my life. The thought of you fills me with longing and at the same time, a burning humiliation that produces scar tissue and dead brain cells. Your existence mocks me and I am unable to confront this. You have no idea of any of this. None of this is your fault. It is completely with me. It is you who makes me see what I really am. I am weak and out of touch with myself."
Henry Rollins,When you start to doubt yourself the real world will eat you alive.
Henry Rollins,Life will not break your heart. It'll crush it.
Henry Rollins,Why do you think the old stories tell of men who set out on great journeys to impress the gods? Because trying to impress people just isn't worth the time and effort.
Henry Rollins,"Keep your blood clean, your body lean, and your mind sharp."
Henry Rollins,Sometimes the truth hurts. And sometimes it feels real good.
Henry Rollins,"Scar tissue is stronger than regular tissue. Realize the strength, move on."
Henry Rollins,There's no such thing as an ex-junkie.
Henry Rollins,"I don't believe in fate or destiny. I believe in various degrees of hatred, paranoia, and abandonment. However much of that gets heaped upon you doesn't matter - it's only a matter of how much you can take and what it does to you."
Henry Rollins,I forged myself out of a vacuum. I crawl along the highway on hacked off stumps year after year. Some wonder how and why. I never do.
Henry Rollins,Hope is the last thing a person does before they are defeated.
Henry Rollins,It's sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.
Henry Rollins,"To hate is to show you still care, who needs that, focus on what's really important."
Henry Rollins,The blues is losing someone you love and not having enough money to immerse yourself in drink.
Henry Rollins,I believe that one defines oneself by reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself. To cut yourself out of stone.
Henry Rollins,Loneliness adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better.
Henry Rollins,I think about the meaning of pain. Pain is personal. It really belongs to the one feeling it. Probably the only thing that is your own. I like mine.
Jimmy Rollins,I said I'd trade a hit for a win. Unfortunately it didn't happen.
Jimmy Rollins,We know we have the talent to win. We know we can beat a lot of the teams we're going to face.
Jimmy Rollins,I said hello to him. He always smiles at me and I smile back. I always liked Larry.
Jimmy Rollins,"He put a couple of things into perspective, allowing me to free my swing up a little more, ... I think it's always good to hear from the opposite end of the spectrum."
Jimmy Rollins,Records are meant to be broken and it's good to have an opportunity to chase them. But I'm more focused on how we do as a team.
Jimmy Rollins,"I've been waiting five or six months, so I didn't mind waiting. It was good to get the first game out of the way."
Jimmy Rollins,The man still has it. Tom Gordon still has it.
Jimmy Rollins,"I was happy I got a triple -- not that I wouldn't have been satisfied with anything,"
Jimmy Rollins,"Being involved means giving it your all and helping the team win, much like you're doing during the season with your respective team. The games will be competitive and intense, almost playoff-like. You'll have to be at the top of your game mentally and physically to compete."
Jimmy Rollins,It's nice to be doing it in the fashion I'm doing it in. The W's matter.
Jimmy Rollins,I'd rather do it in a winning fashion.
Jimmy Rollins,"It's a great event with a lot of eyes on the event. I'm going to give it everything I've got. I don't know if Chase and I will both play, but we'll see. It's a great reward to be part of the team."
Jimmy Rollins,He was in front of the plate. I didn't have a choice.
Jimmy Rollins,It's just a belief we have. We've been playing together a number of years now and we don't want to be satisfied with second place. We want a ring now. And that's different from prior years.
Jimmy Rollins,It's time to play winning baseball. We know where we want to go.
George Romero,"Obviously, we don't have the bucks for big stars, so I'll be saved from having to worry about that. There are a couple of people I'd love to get, Asia Argento being first and foremost. If I could get a couple people like that, I'd be thrilled."
George Romero,"If you can keep it together, you can find a way. I've had a tremendous amount of luck, despite all the frustration... I've been able to stay at home, raise a family and live fairly comfortably, not wealthy by any means."
George Romero,"I don't like all the deferential humor, I think it detracts. Laugh with it, not at it."
George Romero,There's this Hollywood mentality that we have to compete or have effects or have a star... it's hard to get past that stuff.
George Romero,"You can fall on your face easily if you go off in a certain direction. The Birds is a good example, some people are really phobic about birds flying over their heads, and some don't care. So, it's a personal thing."
George Romero,"The big tickets come from a much younger audience and a different audience base. The midnight moviegoers were, like, movie fans: people who were either into films or into particular films, and into them in either a sophisticated or a kind of quirky way."
George Romero,"I think today's audiences, the audiences that make the big money for a studio, are out for whatever the latest event picture is, or the must-see stuff. I think it's a different crowd."
George Romero,"Young audiences today have seen a lot of those movies but only on video, there haven't been any new stuff."
George Romero,"If one horror film hits, everyone says, 'Let's go make a horror film.' It's the genre that never dies."
George Romero,"I thought Godzilla was a mess, the monster had no character and the humans didn't either. They forgot to make the movie that went along with all these wonderful effects."
George Romero,I think you're only free if you're working on very low or huge money.
George Romero,"The guy that made me wanna make movies... and this is off the wall-is a guy named Michael Pal, the British director."
George Romero,"There are so many factors when you think of your own films. You think of the people you worked on it with, and somehow forget the movie. You can't forgive the movie for a long time. It takes a few years to look at it with any objectivity and forgive its flaws."
George Romero,"As great as Ed is, the wisdom out here is that he can't carry a movie. They'll pay him $3 million to be the second banana in Julia Roberts things. But they won't put up $3 million for an Ed Harris movie."
George Romero,I also have always liked the monster within idea. I like the zombies being us. Zombies are the blue-collar monsters.
George Romero,"As a filmmaker you get typecast just as much as an actor does, so I'm trapped in a genre that I love, but I'm trapped in it!"
George Romero,"I really believe that you could do horror very inexpensively. I don't think it has anything to do with the effects, the effects are not the most important parts."
George Romero,The most realistic blood I've seen is when Marlon Brando gets beat up in On The Waterfront.
George Romero,I like guys who are understandable and good guys who are flawed.
George Romero,I'd like to just stick to the game and try to make a really good action film.
John Romero,There are too many games being developed by people that have no business creating games.
John Romero,The game-playing market today is pretty sizable.
John Romero,It is very important to lead the field and innovate in game design.
John Romero,I'm a hardcore gamer and would never let you down by designing a crappy title.
John Romero,"I live way out in the country, in truck-country."
John Romero,I'm creating the kind of games that I like right now. I'm not being held back by technology.
John Romero,We are at the point where game designers have become celebrities due to the size of the market they serve.
John Romero,"I started creating games in 1979 and got my first real programming job at Origin Systems in 1987. I am completely self-taught, no school."
John Romero,"I think DOOM had just the right mix of elements that keep people coming back to it: great monsters, excellent weapons with great balance, a spooky environment and extreme speed."
John Romero,"I completely love playing and designing games and always will. I am so into games that I listen to game music all day. That may sound strange, but you can guarantee I'm a hardcore gamer and would never let you down by designing a crappy title."
John Romero,"In marketing I've seen only one strategy that can't miss - and that is to market to your best customers first, your best prospects second and the rest of the world last."
Ronaldinho Ronaldinho,"I'm pleased firstly because of the win and secondly for helping the team with my goals. It's a good result for the team and we have to keep working,"
Ronaldinho Ronaldinho,The team played very well and I was delighted to help out with three goals.
Ronaldinho Ronaldinho,I am very happy in this side and this type of contentment doesn't have a price. I want for nothing here and look forward to staying for many years.

Ronaldo Ronaldo,"It wasn't Brazil's greatest game ever, but the victory was very important,"
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"It was a piece of stupidity on my part,"
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"Usually, it's the quality of the players which decides the match, not having the coach telling you whether it's the right moment to take on the defender or not."
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"It's happening slowly, but businesses are investing, ... We don't have the language advantages that India has, but we have the people."
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"I love to score goals after passing all the defenders as well as the keeper. This is not my speciality, but my habit."
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"I have been poor and money doesn't make any importance to me. I won't let all the money and glory go to my head. Fame came so quickly and early. It is a pressure to maintain it. Well, I've get used to it. I enjoy the applauding and appreciation of my"
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"Off the field I like to go out, but not too much. I love to dress well, love Italian fashion. And I like to eat well. But in general I'm a simple guy. Cars are not my great passion, but I think it's important to have the best. To me, music is a must;"
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"If I was asked about my wildest dreams, I would never have considered this."
Ronaldo Ronaldo,Let's display our determination that was lacking in Buenos Aires.
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"In Latin America, the pace is slower, it is more technical. In Europe, it is faster, but I haven't had any problems adapting to it."
Ronaldo Ronaldo,"I don't see any advantage in this,"
Rajon Rondo,"I was trying to get up and pressure the ball, but the picks were very effective. It was very frustrating. It's a play that we run a lot, but they executed it very well."
Rajon Rondo,He stepped up. Our other guys were in foul trouble a little bit.
Rajon Rondo,"We've played against each other in high school, so we've been big rivals. I believe he's one of the best shooters in the country."
Rajon Rondo,"Some people say I should test the waters, but I'm very confident that I'll prove my game to the scouts â€¦ ."
Rajon Rondo,"Everybody expressed themselves. Everybody just didn't really hold anything back last night, just talked. We were more encouraging, we were kind of negative because we were losing and we needed to straighten up, and we did."
Rajon Rondo,(Tennessee) played up on me and my big men kept setting screens and getting me open.
Rajon Rondo,"Coach Smith has given me tough love, which I believe has made me a stronger ballplayer and a better person."
Rajon Rondo,"We've got Tennessee at home; it's a big game and we know they beat Florida, so we've got to come ready to play."
Rajon Rondo,"Bad. We're not communicating on defense. In the film against Indiana, they shot the ball well. But that was partly our fault too because we didn't get a lot of contests on their shots and we didn't keep it out of the post."
Rajon Rondo,Everybody gets down on Patrick's defense. He showed it tonight. It was all determination and desire.
Rajon Rondo,"He went and got the cleats, but coach Smith said we had to go. I don't know if I could have covered him, but he would have had to cover me, too. But he was pretty cool. We kept joking a lot."
Rajon Rondo,We just want to keep taking care of business. We can't worry about what our record was. We just have to keep playing hard.
Rajon Rondo,Coach showed he believed in me. So I had to believe in myself.

Andy Rooney,Don't rule out working with your hands. It does not preclude using your head.
Andy Rooney,Obscenities... I think a lot of dumb people do it because they can't think of what they want to say and they're frustrated. A lot of smart people do it to pretend they aren't very smart - want to be just one of the boys.
Andy Rooney,Most of us end up with no more than five or six people who remember us. Teachers have thousands of people who remember them for the rest of their lives.

Andy Rooney,Making duplicate copies and computer printouts of things no one wanted even one of in the first place is giving America a new sense of purpose.
Andy Rooney,Happiness depends more on how life strikes you than on what happens.
Andy Rooney,I don't like food that's too carefully arranged; it makes me think that the chef is spending too much time arranging and not enough time cooking. If I wanted a picture I'd buy a painting.
Andy Rooney,Computers may save time but they sure waste a lot of paper. About 98 percent of everything printed out by a computer is garbage that no one ever reads.
Andy Rooney,"Computers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they make it easier to do don't need to be done."
Dan Rooney,"I think they're meeting and there is some progress. But it's not enough, unfortunately."

Dan Rooney,It was a compromise by all parties and I think that makes it great.
Dan Rooney,"It's a tough, expensive agreement. But I think we'll be fine. We'll have to watch our expenses and things like that, and be fiscally responsible. But it's a great thing. This gives us labor peace for a while, which is what separated the National Football League from other sports. It's good for the players, and I think it will be good for the league."
Dan Rooney,I guess what all this does is determine some specific measurement that may equate to athletic ability. But it's hard to get excited if a guy doesn't play well on film.

John Rooney,The so-called pathological liar has learned from an early age that they get punished more often for telling the truth than they do for lying. They get so accustomed to devious behavior that they lie without much thought or emotion.
Paul Roos,There's a lot of work still to go on the ground and you want to make sure that they've got a chance to prepare it for Saturday night.
Paul Roos,I think in the past three years we've had a number of young guys who have got in early in the pre-season and played all throughout the season. Probably the main focus for tomorrow is to see how they go.

Eleanor Roosevelt,What you don't do can be a destructive force
Eleanor Roosevelt,"All human beings have failings, all human beings have needs and temptations and stresses. Men and women who live together through long years get to know one another's failings; but they also come to know what is worthy of respect and admiration in those they live with and in themselves. If at the end one can say, This man used to the limit the powers that God granted him; he was worthy of love and respect and of the sacrifices of many people, made in order that he might achieve what he deemed to be his task, then that life has been lived well and there are no regrets."

The first is freedom of speech and expression--everywhere in the world. The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way--everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want--which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants--everywhere in the world.

Al Rosen,I tip my hat to them. They were relentless. But I'm proud of my girls for how they kept coming back against El Paso. I'm excited (about district play). We've won two tournaments and finished second in another. Hopefully this (predistrict competition) will push us to a good district finish.
Al Rosen,"We had some serving problems today, and that (serving) has been what's helped win many of our games. This just wasn't our day."
Al Rosen,This a completely unregulated environment.
Al Rosen,George is a dynamic individual who wants and demands perfection. He has an insatiable desire to win and he's been very successful. That being said ... he can be rough on the people who work for him.
Al Rosen,"As long as we have loose accounting and auditing in Canada, this is going to continue to be a problem,"
Al Rosen,"I'm 90 per cent plus sure, but once again, in our business we have to be 100 per cent sure. And that is why the investigation is needed; to look at the volumes, the prices, at a whole cross-section of the trusts and the dividend paying stocks. And there's a third category of other stocks that will benefit from the trading."
David Rosenberg,The glue that kept the consumer market together the last few years was the wealth effect from the housing boom.
David Rosenberg,"Equity markets [are] getting clobbered everywhere, especially in emerging markets ... bonds in the process of catching a safety bid."
David Rosenberg,That's a significant statement. We are hedging our bets and don't see a great risk in doing it.
David Rosenberg,"Katrina's effects are being felt nationally-on the nation's transportation arteries, supply chains, chemical plants, airlines, leisure/hotels, gasoline prices everywhere and retailing. The commercial impact is widespread."
David Rosenberg,There's nothing in the tea leaves telling us we'll be seeing much labor-market buoyancy for several months.
David Rosenberg,"It's a very strange mix, ... It may signal some kind of slowing, but I think I'd have to see a lot more evidence of that. It doesn't appear that consumer consumption is slowing in any meaningful way."
David Rosenberg,"We estimate the near-term loss in terms of output, employment and income in the affected area coupled with the surge in energy costs that impacts everyone will offset any future rebuilding by a factor of two to one."
David Rosenberg,"If CEOs are just frozen in fear, ... who's going to go on a spending spree."
David Rosenberg,A sharp double-digit drop in natural gas prices and a decline in fuel oil and electricity prices drive our call.
David Rosenberg,As the economy continues to slow and inflation remains benign we expect the Fed will be in easing mode by the second half.
David Rosenberg,"As for the employment report, I think there's a danger of overreacting over the message from it because this was the third warmest January in the past 112 years."
David Rosenberg,It is basically a subtle way to flash to the market that the negative economic consequences are resonating and that the Fed may not just look at this as a temporary soft patch this time.
David Rosenberg,There is no question that these are trends that are going to add to people's anxiety and the process has already started.
David Rosenberg,"You need more than just the ability to spend, you need the incentive to spend. You're only going to start spending if you can prove to your board that your investment is going to pay off."
Isaac Rosenberg,I don't think I knew what real poetry was till I read Keats a couple of years ago.
Isaac Rosenberg,"Nobody ever told me what to read, or ever put poetry in my way."
Isaac Rosenberg,"I can't look at things in the simple, large way that great poets do."
Isaac Rosenberg,"Being by the nature of my upbringing, all my energies having been directed to one channel of activity, crippled from other activities and made helpless even to live."
Isaac Rosenberg,I despair of ever writing excellent poetry.
Isaac Rosenberg,"I will not leave a corner of my consciousness covered up, but saturate myself with the strange and extraordinary new conditions of this life, and it will all refine itself into poetry later on."
Isaac Rosenberg,"You mustn't forget the circumstances I have been brought up in, the little education I have had."
Isaac Rosenberg,I never joined the army for patriotic reasons.
Isaac Rosenberg,Poetical appreciation is only newly bursting on me.
Joel Rosenberg,She was that way herself. She practiced very hard and very introspective. She always tape-recorded herself and played it back.
Joel Rosenberg,Miscellaneous is always the largest category.
Joel Rosenberg,"I'm a simple man. All I want is enough sleep for two normal men, enough whiskey for three, and enough women for four."
Ryan Rosenberg,"FileMaker Mobile 8 is widely used to run workgroup solutions, including everything from managing service calls to tracking teachers in a classroom. FileMaker Pro makes it possible for anyone to create and deploy a workgroup solution that spans desktops and handhelds. FileMaker Mobile 8 is a major advancement in the ease of management of larger workgroup solutions and the new starter solutions make it even easier for individuals to get started fast."
Ryan Rosenberg,"FileMaker Mobile 8 is widely used to run workgroup solutions, including everything from managing service calls to tracking teachers in a classroom."
Ryan Rosenberg,"We've enhanced that so you can highlight relationships, annotate and color-code things."
Stanley Rosenblatt,Is there any greater risk factor than smoking?
Stanley Rosenblatt,It would be a great pleasure ... a great pleasure to bring them down where they belong.
Stanley Rosenblatt,I don't think that two years of hard work ... is gonna go down the drain on some technicality.
Stanley Rosenblatt,Secondhand smoke causes cancer and other diseases. But the tobacco industries' overall global strategy and tactic was to plant doubt in the minds of the American people ... Does it really?
Stanley Rosenblatt,"We are, quite frankly, suspicious that a plan is in the works to prevent our national class action, on behalf of some 60,000 flight attendants, from going to trial on Monday,"
Drew Rosenhaus,"He'd like to practice [today]. We're going to take every step possible to do that, I assure you. But all those people who have knocked him and have speculated about his future, let me assure you he will be playing in the future. He will be. He wants to be an Eagle. But I assure you, do not write him off."
Drew Rosenhaus,"Terrell has received a lot of criticism, in my opinion unfairly,"
Drew Rosenhaus,"Mike had been looking for a new contract and really had endured a lot of unfair criticism for holding out in Green Bay and a lot of people questioned his decision. He got the last laugh. In effect, he got traded and he got the new contact that he wanted. For those people that were knocking and ridiculing him for holding out and questioning his logic, he landed with the team that he was real excited about playing for and he landed a contract that he felt comfortable with and pays him like the elite corners in the league."
Drew Rosenhaus,"The Cowboys were the best fit, the most logical choice. It's going to be a match made in heaven."
Tom Rosenstiel,"He looked like the king of muscle beach and he was a surfer. But he had vision. He believed that for a city to be great, it had to have a great newspaper."
Tom Rosenstiel,We know from various studies that women do not consume news in the same numbers as men. These numbers suggest that one reason may be that women don't see themselves in the news as much as men. The numbers suggest that the news does not fully reflect the breadth that women now play in American culture.
Tom Rosenstiel,"each one synthesizing and adding to what others are learning. If only one or two news organizations do it, it won't have the same effect."
Tom Rosenstiel,It's the illusion of more information.
Tom Rosenstiel,"It's the illusion of more information, but it's actually a lot of repetition."
Tom Rosenstiel,Maybe part of their brilliance is they're not as guilt-ridden about it.
Tom Rosenstiel,It's not unheard of to wait for a news peg. It's not unusual to discover the existence of something and not know the context of it until later.
Tom Rosenstiel,"When a president is popular, there's a tendency to describe events describing his popularity. When the numbers are falling, you use that as a lens to explain why his popularity is diminishing."
Tom Rosenstiel,What he's saying may be good press criticism but I'm not sure it's good law.
Matt Rosoff,I think they thought of putting in a more sales-oriented person (Johnson) who talks to customers all the time and really knows what they're asking for.
Matt Rosoff,"There's room for improvement,"
Matt Rosoff,"There's room for improvement in areas such as clear product roadmaps and delivering timely updates,"
Matt Rosoff,"This is definitely being driven by Microsoft's desire to position Windows as a home entertainment hub, and to do that they have to make some concessions, ... They're walking a line, trying to please both sides (content companies and consumers) at the same time."
Matt Rosoff,I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft could double (its online advertising revenue) in three to five years.
Matt Rosoff,"Content owners may not take advantage of what Microsoft is doing? They could bypass the PC altogether, or come up with some other type of system."
Barney Ross,"When we were in Pearl, in order to get out of the sun, we always had awnings over the back end of the ship, the stern of the ship."
Barney Ross,"When we came back into Pearl it was pitch dark, and we could see the fires from the Arizona and the other ships still burning in the harbor."
Barney Ross,We were very fortunate that the carriers weren't in the harbor.
Barney Ross,"We managed to get underway, and I don't know to this day why we didn't get struck or take a torpedo, but we didn't. We got outside of the exit of the harbor and we started dropping depth charges."
Barney Ross,Two-thirds of the crew was allowed to go to the shore because they had weekend passes. The only ones aboard were those who had the duty.
Barney Ross,They neglected to get our oil supplies and our submarines. The battleships they did get were beginning to become obsolete anyway.
Barney Ross,"They got word that the Japanese planes were coming back, so we sunk her ourselves so the Japanese wouldn't get it. We didn't want the Japanese to get it intact."
Barney Ross,"There were Japanese submarines out there, and we got credit for two of them and credited for knocking down four planes on our way out."
Barney Ross,"The planes alone would have taken care of us, so I was grateful that we never found them. We were out there searching for 36 hours."
Barney Ross,The gunner's mate came up and started breaking the locks on the ammunition. Everything was locked up for fear that someone might go in there with a cigarette or something.
Barney Ross,"Our duty was to try and find the Japanese fleet. We never did find the Japanese fleet and I am awfully glad, because they had attacked us there with six carriers, three battleships, 10 or 15 cruisers, and about 20 destroyers."
Barney Ross,It was lucky for me. It wasn't lucky for the nine people that got killed and the 20 that were injured.
Barney Ross,"I'd get a shell, they weighed about 80 pounds I think, but when I was 19 or 20 that was nothing. I'd take a shell and a bag of powder, I'd put it in the hoist and then I would send it up to the gun."
Barney Ross,"I was standing on the deck of the USS Blue, a destroyer. We were all alone out there at this buoy, tied up."
Barney Ross,I had been out there long enough. I had not seen my family for four years.
Barney Ross,"I did not really know what to do. The searchlight was my battle station, but there was no need to be on a searchlight at 7:55 in the morning."
Barney Ross,"Everything was black in the harbor, but there were still some fires burning on the ships."
Barney Ross,Destroyers did not have chaplains because they were too small.
Barney Ross,"All destroyers at that time had about 200 men. A destroyer was rough riding, and with the rough weather, the sea can be an enemy too."
Barney Ross,All we had aboard the ship that morning was one Annapolis graduate and three reserves.
Diana Ross,"I really, deeply believe that dreams do come true. Often, they might not come when you want them. They come in their own time."
Diana Ross,You can't just sit there and wait for people to give you that golden dream. You've got to get out there and make it happen for yourself.
Diana Ross,With the Supremes I made so much money so fast all I wanted to do was buy clothes and pretty things. Now I'm comfortable with money and it's comfortable with me.
Jim Ross,Be assured that Triple H is more than ready to return to Monday Night RAW and he and the incomparable 'Nature Boy' will make quite the impact if my instincts are correct.
Jim Ross,"He was the kind of writer who took a person's life and made it interesting. If you wanted to get the humanity of a story, you assigned it to Tim."
Jim Ross,"The fact of the matter is that the Williams family has guarded that property, kept trespassers off of that property, had contracts to maintain Coronet property, and when they joined the lawsuit, these types of retaliatory actions began."
John Ross,"I'm extremely excited and I'm extremely pleased with the progress in all arenas,"
John Ross,"We really haven't had any problems. We've worked out some parking with a couple of the businesses around, they're letting us use their parking if we need it, but we really haven't been doing thousands and thousands of people like they expected."
John Ross,It's a lifestyle I chose to pursue and I'm thankful to have the opportunity to do it.
John Ross,"They're a good team and we had too many mistakes. We have to clean up our penalties. Fruth made three big plays, but he's so big you almost have to dedicate two people to him. And they run the ball well, too. That's a good combination."
John Ross,"As the offender is entitled to a speedy trial, the victim and the victim's family should be entitled to see a speedy administration of justice. Waiting 10 years to see justice is further offensive to the family."
Kevin Ross,"We hope to do very well, ... If the [corners] can hold up, then we can do a lot more with the people inside. The more 'man' you can play, the better off you are. You can do a lot of things. You can turn people loose up front. You don't have to worry about the guys on the outside. So if they hold up like we think they can, then we'll be a better defense."
Kevin Ross,"Two games will be fine for him, ... You're just concerned about his timing. Coming out in hitting shape."
Kevin Ross,"The man molded me, scolded me, preached to me and taught me just about everything I learned about football."
Kevin Ross,"It's been a tough year, no doubt about it. I'm not afraid to say that. The offense hasn't fired on all cylinders. If you don't have 11 guys working in unison, you can't sustain a drive. That's the greatest part of the game."
Rick Ross,This kind of just takes it to a different place and is something new.
Rick Ross,"Many of these proposed Peace Palaces never come to fruition. Much of Maharishi's vast fortune is in real estate investments,"
Rick Ross,"There's no doubt that these are big players. This could be a significant first step in closing them down. These groups are led by dominant, charismatic personalities and when you pull the plug on them, it has a collapsing effect on all segments."
Rick Ross,We're hoping to make it the single place where customers can go when they're looking for Java products. It hasn't really been done by anybody else.
Rick Ross,I think it's through the same provider. We (Peninsula College) pay an annual premium for insurance. The moment students sign up to be on a sports team they are automatically covered.
Rick Ross,"There may be some difficulties during a period of adjustment. Specifically, picking up their life again and making their own truly independent decisions."
Rick Ross,"When families observe a later, deeper stage of cult involvement they may find it necessary to consider the involvement of a professional such as myself in an intervention effort."
Rick Ross,In a cult intervention information is presented about the group that the member is most often not aware of.
Rick Ross,"This consists of a series of meetings that may last several days through which information is provided that may include reviewing documentaries, news programs, court records and certain reports about the group in question."
Rick Ross,The best method for preventing destructive cult involvement is preventative education. If students and the public at large are more aware of destructive groups beforehand they may better understand and resist their recruitment efforts.
Rick Ross,"Also, schools share some responsibility and should offer helpful orientations that include general information about such recruitment efforts on their campuses."
Rick Ross,It simply isn't open. I think it's time for action. I think it's time for a change.
Ruth Ross,All prosperity begins in the mind and is dependent only on the full use of our creative imagination.
Ruth Ross,A ''should'' is a ''have to'' with no teeth; it is dead energy.
Ruth Ross,"In this game, by trying to win; you automatically lose."
Ruth Ross,We won't even attempt to achieve what we do not believe at a deep level we can have or deserve.
Ruth Ross,"There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important."
Tim Ross,"It's big. We went into Person and stole one there and came in and got another victory here. If you win on the road it's big time, but you still got to hold your own court. This is a great win, but we're only halfway through. It should be an exciting second half of the season."
Tim Ross,"We were in foul trouble with both Hunter [Collins] and Marshall [Williams]. I felt like we dodged a bullet, only being down four at halftime and I knew we could play better in the second half and I was hoping that they couldn't keep shooting the way they did."
Tim Ross,He was hardly ever in trouble. The walk was in the first inning.
Tim Ross,One of our goals was to win the regular-season title. We still have to go to East Chapel Hill and handle our business to win the championship outright.
Gavin Rossdale,"Wherever you look there are inspirations, books, literature, paintings, landscapes, everything. Just living is an inspiration."
Gavin Rossdale,THE SCIENCE OF THINGS
Gavin Rossdale,"I've been going through some pretty crazy stuff. And I've had to deal with a few people that I thought were pretty close to me turning around and just trying to destroy me, I think."
Gavin Rossdale,"The point about it is that if you're pointed toward some kind of goodness, some kind of light, something positive, you find your way through these trials and tribulations, ... I've basically dedicated my whole lyrical life to people's ability to cope with the struggle because I do believe there is a struggle. And I don't mean it in a negative sense. I just mean it in a realistic sense. Nothing is greater than staying right on the positive, but sometimes life can have a way of just pulling you back and dragging you a bit."
Gavin Rossdale,"There's nothing worse than someone coming up to me and going ''Oh God, I really love your hair.''"
Gavin Rossdale,"he says. ''But I like to create challenges for myself. There are loads of producers less edgy than Page, but he's been great in many ways, doing guitar parts and arrangements and also knowing when to leave me alone."
Gavin Rossdale,"I'm not a workaholic, but I was a bit manic, I have to confess."
Gavin Rossdale,I think people are too hard on the Pistols. The Pistols started the whole punk thing and never saw much money.
Gavin Rossdale,The only people who benefit from lawsuits are lawyers. I think we made a couple of them rich.
Christina Rossetti,Better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad.
Christina Rossetti,"Be the green grass above me, with showers and dewdrops wet; and if thou wilt, remember, and if thou wilt, forget."
Christina Rossetti,"What can I give him,Poor as I am?If I were a shepherd,I would bring a lamb;If I were a wise man,I would do my part;Yet what I can I give himGive my heart."
Christina Rossetti,"I might show facts as plain as day: but, since your eyes are blind, you'd say, Where? What? and turn away."
Christina Rossetti,Hope is like a hairball trembling from its birth...
Valentino Rossi,"I never saw him race but they tell me he was one of the best, maybe the best ever. I am now on the podium of all-time winners and this is a big pleasure for me."
Valentino Rossi,"It was a fantastic race and my best race of the year by far. It was a battle between great riders and it was fantastic to win like this. I would like to say thank you to my team because the bike was very, very fast."
Valentino Rossi,"It was a tough race with quite a few strong riders battling it out at the finish. It was not easy to overtake, but a few of them managed to do it."
Valentino Rossi,"He ran a great race, but he made a little mistake and made it easy for me, ... It was a great weekend for us."
Valentino Rossi,"For me, it was the best race of the year,"
Valentino Rossi,"It's going to be a really difficult race because it's such a demanding circuit,"
Valentino Rossi,"I am very happy. I know I gave more than 100% in the race, and we had a lot of problems this weekend,"
Valentino Rossi,"I'm lucky because I don't feel too much pressure - it's only in the last hour before the race, and even then it's good, positive pressure."
Valentino Rossi,I am disappointed because I wanted to win the first race of the season but there is nothing we can do now. I'm looking forward to the next race in Qatar.
Valentino Rossi,"I am not sure what will happen in the race, and I am a little worried."
Valentino Rossi,"I always race to win, but last year it was like a motocross track and there was so much sand out there. I've got really bad memories of last year and you could say I have a score to settle with the circuit,"
Valentino Rossi,"We still have quite a few problems with the vibration and this means that we can't use the bike to its full potential and make fast lap times. We've tried lots of changes to the set-up today - balance, suspension, but the problem remains. In some of the fast corners my speed is down by as much as 15 or 20kms. The good thing is that we're much better than yesterday and we've done some really good work within the team to make these improvements, but it's still not enough and some other riders are looking very strong."
Valentino Rossi,The numbers are always important and to have won like (as many as) Mick (Doohan) is a great pleasure. But this victory is very much more important.
Valentino Rossi,It's a fantastic track and if the bike is okay it's a great pleasure to ride.
Valentino Rossi,"Racing with Yamaha gives me a great taste and a great motivation to win; these last two championships have been two of the best,"
Valentino Rossi,"It's a magic track for me,"
Valentino Rossi,"For sure, this is a magic circuit for me, ... I have had some great, great battles here in the past."
Valentino Rossi,"So, 11 victories is fantastic and always race in this track is different, is magic, ... I win a lot of times here, a lot of important races for my career and I love this track."
Valentino Rossi,"This track is magic, it was a great race. I wasn't able to escape. Nicky had a great race and stayed right with me."
Valentino Rossi,"Unfortunately, Sete had a problem, which was bad luck for him because he should have been on the podium. Anyway, this is a good win for me and now I just need one more for the title. But it is not over yet."
Valentino Rossi,"Records are not the most important thing but I am very happy to have the same number of victories as 'Mike the Bike',"
Valentino Rossi,"The advantage we have in the championship means that I can ride at each of the remaining six rounds without pressure to try to win every race,"
Gioacchino Rossini,Give me a laundry-list and I'll set it to music.
Gioacchino Rossini,"Every kind of music is good, except the boring kind."
Gioacchino Rossini,"Answer them [critics] with silence and indifference. It works better, I assure you, than anger and argument."
Charles Rossotti,"I hope you get your problem solved today,"
Charles Rossotti,I don't think it's a small move in this direction; I think it's a huge move.
Charles Rossotti,IPv6 is vital to the future competitiveness of industry and government.
Charles Rossotti,We think it provides a very powerful incentive for business investment.
Charles Rossotti,The bottom line: Taxpayers will pay about the same.
Guido van Rossum,There was a project at Lawrence Livermore National Labs where many years ago they went down this path for scripting and controlling very large numerical calculations.
Guido van Rossum,"If you decide to design your own language, there are thousands of sort of amateur language designer pitfalls."
Guido van Rossum,I have this hope that there is a better way. Higher-level tools that actually let you see the structure of the software more clearly will be of tremendous value.
Guido van Rossum,"Yes, I definitely believe that it has some good cross-platform properties. Object orientation was one of the techniques I used to make Python platform independent."
Guido van Rossum,"My own perception of that is somewhat colored by where people ask my advice, which is still, of course, about changes to Python internals or at least standard libraries."
Guido van Rossum,"In my daily work, I work on very large, complex, distributed systems built out of many Python modules and packages. The focus is very similar to what you find, for example, in Java and, in general, in systems programming languages."
Guido van Rossum,The second stream of material that is going to come out of this project is a programming environment and a set of programming tools where we really want to focus again on the needs of the newbie. This environment is going to have to be extremely user-friendly.
Guido van Rossum,"Now, it's my belief that Python is a lot easier than to teach to students programming and teach them C or C++ or Java at the same time because all the details of the languages are so much harder. Other scripting languages really don't work very well there either."
Guido van Rossum,"Mark Hammond is working in this area, with Windows Scripting Host. It is definitely an area where Python fits almost perfectly. That's quite independent from Java, actually."
Guido van Rossum,"Invariably, you'll find that if the language is any good, your users are going to take it to places where you never thought it would be taken."
Guido van Rossum,"If you're talking about Java in particular, Python is about the best fit you can get amongst all the other languages. Yet the funny thing is, from a language point of view, JavaScript has a lot in common with Python, but it is sort of a restricted subset."
Guido van Rossum,I would guess that the decision to create a small special purpose language or use an existing general purpose language is one of the toughest decisions that anyone facing the need for a new language must make.
Guido van Rossum,I think the real key to Python's platform independence is that it was conceived right from the start as only very loosely tied to Unix.
Marc Rotenberg,"We need to be on guard here a bit, ensuring that when technology is used, it's effective and respects constitutional principles."
Marc Rotenberg,"Key escrow would not have prevented what took place, ... And the rush to establish Draconian security controls may do very little to provide greater safety for Americans. They would, however, provide a great cost in terms of freedom."
Marc Rotenberg,"Key escrow would not have prevented what took place. And the rush to establish Draconian security controls may do very little to provide greater safety for Americans. They would, however, provide a great cost in terms of freedom."
Marc Rotenberg,"One of the seemingly unsolvable problems is what do you do when someone is wrongly put on this watch list. If there are that many people on the list, a lot of them probably shouldn't be there. But how are they ever going to get off?"
Marc Rotenberg,"Normally, your license plate number only becomes relevant when you're involved in an accident, pulled over by police or when your car is stolen. This technology changes that. ... It's a new form of surveillance."
Marc Rotenberg,The changing structure and nature of the workplace has led to more invasive and often covert monitoring practices that call into question employees' most basic rights to privacy and dignity.
Marc Rotenberg,Jason is one of the leaders in the privacy communities. He's tremendously effective. He gets things done.
Marc Rotenberg,"We are looking to the FTC to see whether companies that break their promises and collect personal information in an unfair and deceptive manner will be held accountable,"
Marc Rotenberg,"We think it's very useful that people can go to the Internet and get a lot of information, but we think it's appropriate to draw the line where personal information is given at a Web site."
Marc Rotenberg,"Because Amazon announced that it could no longer guarantee that it would not disclose customer information to third parties, and in the absence of legal or technical means to assure privacy for Amazon customers, we have decided that we can no longer continue our relationship with Amazon."
Marc Rotenberg,"In terms of how information is collected and used on the Internet, ... to allow detailed secret profiles to be created is disastrous."
Marc Rotenberg,We are looking to the FTC to see whether companies that break their promises and collect personal information in an unfair and deceptive manner will be held accountable.
Marc Rotenberg,"It's sweeping, in terms of its impact, and we hope this is the start of better practices on Microsoft's part."
Marc Rotenberg,It was big stuff. We were fighting to save the soul of the internet.
Marc Rotenberg,This has a big implication for the national debate.
Marc Rotenberg,[Legislators] need to support privacy to establish consumer confidence.
Marc Rotenberg,A company shouldn't take value from people's private messages.
Marc Rotenberg,There is no scenario where it makes sense for a company to take record of who we've called each month and make that data available for sale.
Marc Rotenberg,"Once you enable third-party access to Internet-based communication, you create a vulnerability that didn't previously exist. It will put at risk the stability and security of the Internet."
Marc Rotenberg,The FCC simply does not have the statutory authority to extend the 1994 law for the telephone system to the 21st century Internet.

John Roth,"It's just doing what you do in practice, ... (Left guard) Geoff Townsend made a nice block and I was able to get outside."
John Roth,"The common perception is that you file for an extension to bide your time to get the money together, ... But then you end up paying interest, a late payment penalty and a late filing penalty."
John Roth,We continue to expect that our percentage growth in revenue and earnings per share from operations in 2000 over 1999 will be in the low 40s.
John Roth,We only expect a meaningful rebound in capital spending following a period of industry rationalization and an improved economic environment. Given the uncertainty as to the extent and timing of these events we are not providing specific financial guidance for the next quarter of full year 2001.
John Roth,Our customers are inhibited by the high cost of energy and steel. They are concerned that the prices they are forced to charge make them less competitive.
John Roth,"The company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive break even [results] at a quarterly revenue level well below $4 billion, ... The structure is expected to be in place in the first quarter 2002."
Kenneth Roth,Armed conflicts often involve discrepancies of power between adversaries. Allowing those discrepancies to justify attacking civilians would create an immense loophole in the protections of international humanitarian law.
Kenneth Roth,"Things have changed in Venezuela, but not for the better. There's been a continued consolidation of power on the part of Chavez."
Kenneth Roth,The hypocrisy factor has encouraged copycat techniques around the world by people who do like the U.S. does and has also weakened the United States as one of the traditional important supporters of human rights.
Kenneth Roth,The hypocrisy factor has encouraged copycat techniques around the world by people who do like the United States does and has also weakened the United States as one of the traditional important supporters of human rights.
Kenneth Roth,"We spoke openly with the Libyan government about our concerns. We disagree on many substantive issues, but they are willing to listen and discuss."
Kenneth Roth,This is an important symbolic visit. The real test is to see if the government is ready to implement the recommendations and show it's serious about eradicating torture.
Kenneth Roth,We welcome Libya's first steps toward reform. But the government has a long road to travel before it meets the international standards of human rights.
Kenneth Roth,"There is an enormous problem that when a government as influential as the United States flouts basic human rights standards, it undermines the standards and gives green light to other governments to do the same."
Kenneth Roth,"The EU largely ignored human rights abuses by its friends in Africa. It was very good about speaking out against the pariah Zimbabwe. But when it came to Angola, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda, there was little if anything said."
Kenneth Roth,"You plunge yourself further and further into debt, rental prices drop, you can't make your mortgage payments and you're forced to sell for less than you owe."
Kenneth Roth,Moral squeamishness shouldn't stand in the way of finding solutions to this terrible crisis.
Kenneth Roth,The moral authority of the United States depends on its working effectively with other countries to advance human rights protection ? not blocking a consensus proposal that makes so much progress for human rights. The current resolution can be made to work if the United States joins with other democracies to establish the new council and make it function effectively.
Kenneth Roth,The U.S. government's use and defense of torture and inhumane treatment played the largest role in undermining Washington's ability to promote human rights.
Stuart Rothenberg,You don't have to be Albert Einstein to know there is some risk.
Stuart Rothenberg,"If Gore were up 10 points, this wouldn't happen. There would be a lot of golf to be played otherwise."
Stuart Rothenberg,"The problem with the big issues, Social Security reform, campaign finance reform, fundamental tax reform, is that they are so politically dangerous that I think both sides want to avoid them."
Stuart Rothenberg,"He does not have a reservoir of good will, either in Congress or in the country. People in Congress are looking for ways to disagree with him. Democrats don't seem intimidated by him. And the public doesn't see him as honest, forthright or as much as a leader as they did a year ago. He's considerably weaker."
Stuart Rothenberg,"We will be drawing down some troops. If the president wants to try to turn that into the beginning of a success, he actually, I think, has some opportunity."
Stuart Rothenberg,California is going to be quite good for the Democrats. But the rest of the country is a draw.
Stuart Rothenberg,I think it's less risky for the Kerry campaign to embrace former President Clinton than it is to reject him.
Larry Rothschild,"I don't want him to go out there without having completely built up the arm strength to where he should be. I want him in an environment where we can build him up without any kind of risk. We've gotten a lot further along with that in a short period of time. I think he's on schedule to do everything we need him to do and not have any problems. That's the way I'm assuming it's going to go, and we'll keep progressing."
Larry Rothschild,We're just now building up his strength and stamina. I don't use timetables. It's impossible.
Larry Rothschild,"He's throwing fine. It's just building up strength and stamina and his pitches and tiring him out without going overboard with it, and we'll keep progressing from what we did today."
Larry Rothschild,"Arm-wise, he's making real good progress. We need to see what he can do and how quickly he can bounce back from the knee and then we'll figure the rest out."
Larry Rothschild,"I took the job four years ago with winning in mind, and we haven't accomplished that."
Larry Rothschild,"When I took the job four years ago, it was with winning in mind, and we haven't accomplished that. So I felt an obligation to ... the organization. I like Chicago. I'm from there, and our kids love being there, and there's no place like Wrigley Field."
Larry Rothschild,"I went back and forth in my mind a lot,"
Larry Rothschild,In my mind I figured we weren't going to start the season. I thought that all winter. Shoulders are a little different and you'd better be careful with it. Because setbacks can be long term and cost you long chunks of times. That's what we are trying to avoid.
Larry Rothschild,"It's been impressive to where they are up to now. They're throwing the ball with pretty good force behind it. It's not so much what they can do today, but can they feel like they can do it again tomorrow? That's the basis we pretty much use to go forward."
Larry Rothschild,"The two months that I'm in Spring Training is tough. The family obligation weighed heavily. We spent a lot of time talking about that. The truth of the matter is during spring, I'm at the ballpark the majority of days for 12, 15 hours. I wouldn't get a whole lot of time with them."
Larry Rothschild,"It's an outpatient procedure. You've got to believe it's not all that drastic. Hopefully, it's quick and not much and he bounces back quickly."
Larry Rothschild,He stood up and threw without putting a lot of pressure on the knee. Just basically tossing 90 balls to keep the motion and looseness through the shoulder.
Larry Rothschild,"He shows us the ability to throw strikes any time in the count. He has a high level of concentration on every pitch, and that's something we like. Because of his experience, he has an excellent chance to be in the rotation. The ball is really in his court."

Johnny Rotten,If you were to look back at me as a school kid you'd see a very quiet little church mouse kind of character.
Johnny Rotten,"It's no good being nice and young and naive. There's no good in that at all. You've got to do it all yourself, and you've gotta learn quick. And you can't look for sympathy either."
Johnny Rotten,There's nothing glorious in dying. Anyone can do it.
Johnny Rotten,"Anyone who's parading under a $100,00-plus video is not free from corporate. That's just the MTV advertising agency. I find them all to be just a bit of a sham."
Nouriel Roubini,"This is a very delicate moment. The economy is already very imbalanced. On top of that, we've had a massive oil shock and now we have a natural disaster that might be something of a tipping point."
Nouriel Roubini,"While central banks care less than private investors about the return on their investments, they're not completely clueless,"
Nouriel Roubini,Our ability to finance ourselves depends upon the willingness of foreign central banks to hold dollars. That willingness is going to be shrinking (this) year.
Nouriel Roubini,"The ability to send a 'sell' order that roils markets may not give China a veto over U.S. foreign policy, but it surely does increase the cost of any U.S. policy that China opposes."
Mike Rounds,"By then, we hope that problems with the new (Medicare benefit) will be resolved."

Mike Rounds,There are more people living in freedom today than at any other time in the history of the human race.
James Rouse,"If he trimmed trees, it would be straight across the top. It would be perfect. You could know his work from anybody else's."
James Rouse,"An inspired, concerned and loving society will dignify man; will find the ways to develop his talent; will put the fruits of his labor and intellect to effective use; will achieve brotherhood; eliminate bigotry and intolerance; will care for the indigent, the delinquent, the sick, the aged; seek the truth and communicate it; respect differences among man."
James Rouse,"The desire for the creation to exist - not for a return on investment, not for what it may say about you, but for the love of the thing, the creation, itself. One creates music because we love it enough to make it happen. The reason you would create anything is because you love it enough to see it exist."
James Rouse,Each one of those pools of blood is where someone's child died or was seriously wounded.
James Rouse,"We created ways for people to care more deeply about one another, to stimulate, encourage, release creativity, minimize intolerance and bigotry."

Jack Roush,The (WWE) has its ways of determining who is going to win and maybe NASCAR behind the scenes is trying to do the same thing. I take it personally. I do take it personally.
Jack Roush,It's going to be a test of NASCAR's will and the drivers' patience. What they decide in the (scoring) tower could have a lot of bearing on the outcome of the race.
Jack Roush,It's funny how things work out sometimes.
Jack Roush,"Fielding a third truck in Atlanta will enable David to run in front of his hometown crowd, friends and family. It will also gain him some additional seat time in preparation for his stint driving the No. 6. We're looking forward to getting David a jump start on his 2006 schedule."
Jack Roush,"Fact is, Carl is a young man of great potential and enthusiasm. He's on a learning curve that's straight up and it'd be more likely he'd have a great result this year than it was him having a great result last year. He doesn't need to focus on not losing, he doesn't need to focus on hanging on, he just needs to go out and do what's natural, which is what got him where he is."
Jack Roush,"We've probably had more conversation in the last 10 days than we've had in the last 10 years, and I don't know if that's good or bad for the rest of the competition and for what Brian and/or NASCAR would otherwise be trying to accomplish, ... But we certainly share an interest and a stake in the result of the question that's in front of us."

Jean-Jacques Rousseau,"The English people believes itself to be free; it is gravely mistaken; it is free only during election of members of parliament; as soon as the members are elected, the people is enslaved; it is nothing. In the brief moment of its freedom, the English people makes such a use of that freedom that it deserves to lose it."

Jean-Jacques Rousseau,"O love, if I regret the age when one savors you, it is not for the hour of pleasure, but for the one that follows it."

Jeff Rowland,"We're looking Final Four, national championship. Our goals are a lot higher this year."

Arundhati Roy,"People are so isolated, and so alone, and so suspicious, and so competitive with each other, and so sure that they are about to be conned by their neighbor, or by their mother, or by their sister, or their grandmother.

Arundhati Roy,"Electricity produced in the name of the poor is consumed by the rich with endless appetites,"
Arundhati Roy,"I think many people were surprised by the victory of the Congress, because it was really hard to see beyond the sort of haze of hatred that the Hindu nationalists had been spreading."

Brandon Roy,"He's the key to their team. If he can't get going, it'll be a tough night for everybody."
Brandon Roy,"This is the first night that me, Bobby and Jamaal all got on the same page. It's important that we step up and be seen. If we get on the same page night in, night out, we can be a really good team."
Brandon Roy,"This is the first night me, Bobby and Jamal got on the same page. We need to lead this team. I think tonight we did a good job."
Brandon Roy,They're so experienced and so talented. We're definitely going to need them to make some mistakes to win.
Brandon Roy,"I don't think it crossed my mind we were going to lose that game. I'm still kicking myself. For the first time in basketball, I feel sorry for myself."
Brandon Roy,"I was actually frustrated throughout (non-league). I was like, man, I can wait until I can start putting my print on the team."
Brandon Roy,"(Intensity) is something I've been learning and striving for since I got here. Coach is always on me about my intensity level. He told me I was talented but I had to pick up my intensity level. In the past, I would often defer. This season I wasn't allowed to do that. He had to stay on me to make sure I bring it every night. Now I'm seeing that all the hard work paid off. Playing hard all the time can be rewarded."
Brandon Roy,"We can't give up hope. I've started off 0-5, so it doesn't get any worse than that. Five-and-four is not bad at all. We just have to keep scrapping and keep fighting and know that if we win this game we've got two games at home and chance to go to 7-4. The future is still bright for us."
Brandon Roy,When I was a kid I dreamed about this. It's an incredible honor to be recognized nationally like this.
Brandon Roy,There's a lot of good teams on that 32-game home win streak. Another one came in here and took it from us. It's the only way it should end.
Brandon Roy,"We're still kind of kicking ourselves for those two losses at home. But we got two really big wins on the road and now we've got to go back and defend our home court, like we usually do."
Brandon Roy,"There have been a lot of good teams on that 32-game home winning streak, and another one came in here and took it from us. It is the only way it should end, it shouldn't end with us losing by 15 or us losing to a bad team."
Brandon Roy,I'm a big fan of Dee Brown. He's the heart and soul of that team and he's the first guy we've got to stop.
Brandon Roy,"In my heart, I would have liked to have seen him come to Washington because I feel like the things I've been through here have made me not only a better person but a better basketball player. You come to college and nobody looks at you as a star anymore. You're just another guy on the team, and that would have been great for him."
Brandon Roy,"Lately a lot of people have been giving me respect. You know when they don't give it to me, I just use it as motivation. Now that they're saying I'm the most complete player, I have to look for other motivation."
Brandon Roy,"They were physical, they were banging me. Coming off screens, they were grabbing me. It was one of those games."
Brandon Roy,"It's fun playing Oregon. It's an up-tempo game. Hopefully, we'll make some shots."
Brandon Roy,"That was the smoothest, easiest 25 I've had this year. I wasn't fighting against any of my teammates to get points. I was just kind of rolling in the offense. And Jamaal got his."
Brandon Roy,"We've got a lot of experience. When I was a sophomore, we were just excited to be there. Last year, being a one-seed, we just wanted to live up to expectations. This season is fun because no one is really saying much about us. We have the chance to go in there and surprise some people. We almost get to play the underdog role."
Brandon Roy,"I said, if we didn't prove to ourselves today that we can play with the best teams in the country, then you're just not a believer. I think we just showed the world we're a good team and we're here to stay."
Brandon Roy,We control our own destiny now.
Brandon Roy,"The consistency of fans now is so much better. I think it has a lot to do with our play, and we're doing it together. The better we get, the better they get."
Brandon Roy,Last year we had huge confidence because teams didn't know how quick we were or how fast we were going to play.
Brandon Roy,"Coach knows that when the game gets tight, a light switch goes off in my head."
Brandon Roy,Coach said just push it up the court. Push it and pull it. That's what I did.
Brandon Roy,"It makes it a lot smoother. At the beginning of the game, it's more my time. Then when Jamaal comes in, I can kind of concentrate on other areas and it's more his time."
Brandon Roy,I think we just want to keep playing good basketball. We don't want to go the Pac-10 tournament and have a terrible game and have that be the last thought on our minds heading into the NCAA tournament.
Brandon Roy,"He's made me a better player over four seasons. All summer, we played pick-up basketball and we'd match up against one another. When I penetrate to the basket, there are times when he stops me. His ability to guard big men and small guys definitely helps."
Brandon Roy,"I'm still kicking myself because I think for the first time in basketball, I felt sorry for myself. Like, 'Man, I did everything I could to win and then that happened.' It took me a minute to get my engine going. I think Bobby [Jones] felt the same way. I think Jamaal [Williams] felt the same way."
Brandon Roy,"It's awesome that top players from the state of Washington with a year difference in age are considered top players in the country. That says a lot for the state and how we've come along as basketball players. When I was a kid, I dreamed about this."
Brandon Roy,"That was the first real adversity this team had to face and even I was interested to see how we'd react. We had bad chemistry [during the losing streak]. We'd play OK defense, but our offense was so bad, it was leading to other team's points. Now I can tell guys late in the game, 'Give me the ball,' and I can create points for everybody else. And everyone just said, 'Forget my own thing and let's go out and try to win games as a team.' Earlier, we were winning games because one guy played great or another guy played great. But now we are winning as a team."
Darrell Royal,"You've got to think lucky. If you fall into a mudhole, check your back pocket - you might have caught a fish."
Darrell Royal,You never lose a game if the opponent doesn't score.
Darrell Royal,"You know, a football coach is nothing more than a teacher. You teach them the same subject, and you have a group of new guys every year."
Darrell Royal,"When I was a freshman at Oklahoma in 1946, the game was sold out - and it's been sold out ever since."
Darrell Royal,Three things can happen when you pass and two of 'em are bad.
Darrell Royal,"The only thing that would change would be the year, the names. It just got to be a repetitious life."
Darrell Royal,Sometimes you have to suck it up and call a number.
Darrell Royal,"If worms carried pistols, birds wouldn't eat 'em."
Darrell Royal,"If I were going to stay in coaching, I would have stayed right there because I was totally happy."
Darrell Royal,"If everything had already been done, there would be nothing left for young people to accomplish. There are always going to be people who run faster, jump higher, dive deeper, and come up drier."
Darrell Royal,I've enjoyed my retirement.
Darrell Royal,I'm not bored; I'm not a guy who has nothing to do.
Darrell Royal,"I was still enjoying coaching, but there was a repetitious manner about it."
Darrell Royal,I was in a profession that received a lot of media.
Darrell Royal,I used to care more about the score than I do now.
Darrell Royal,I try not to play two days in succession. I usually try to space it so I have a day in between.
Darrell Royal,I try not to make the same mistakes today that I made yesterday.
Darrell Royal,I really don't have a favorite course. I usually ask where there are the least players.
Darrell Royal,I never have planned a whole lot of future. It's one day at a time.
Darrell Royal,I move around and play different golf courses. I just enjoy it.
Darrell Royal,I learned this about coaching: You don't have to explain victory and you can't explain defeat.
Darrell Royal,I know that the odds are against a marriage lasting 60 years.
Darrell Royal,I knew that when I resigned from the University of Texas that I would never coach again.
Darrell Royal,I have found that the players who have played in that game really do have respect for their adversaries.
Darrell Royal,I had hoped God would be neutral.
Darrell Royal,"I don't count on the boy who waits till October, when it's cool and fun, then decides he wants to play."
Darrell Royal,I do not let a bad score ruin my enjoyment for golf.
Darrell Royal,I didn't want to stay until I had used up all the enjoyment because that's too long to stay anywhere.
Darrell Royal,"He's not very fast, but maybe Elizabeth Taylor can't sing."
Darrell Royal,Football doesn't build character. It eliminates the weak ones.
Darrell Royal,Don't matter what they throw at us. Only angry people win football games.
Darrell Royal,"But I do have time to pencil in golf, and we've got four excellent courses."
Darrell Royal,Breaks balance out. The sun don't shine on the same ol' dog's rear end every day.
Darrell Royal,All the white meat is gone. There's nothin' but necks on the platter.
Darrell Royal,"For me, it is just the total experience - from the time I first started as an assistant coach until I wound up at the University of Texas for 20 years."
Darrell Royal,"I feel like this hurts us and works to the advantage of Notre Dame, ... I think our problem for our fans, is to keep their feet on the ground. Like the old saying, 'A little perfume doesn't hurt you if you don't drink it.'"
Darrell Royal,I'm still healthy as can be.
David Rubenstein,Right now we're operating as if the music's not going to stop playing and the music is going to stop. I am more concerned about this than any other issue.
David Rubenstein,"There is too much money at stake. At some point, somebody will blink and work out a compromise. If not, there will be plenty of competitors to Blackberry to fill the lacuna."
David Rubenstein,This has been a golden age for our industry but nothing continues to be golden forever.
David Rubin,"enlightening. I really started looking at birds in a different way, [for example, considering] the issue of space from the perspective of a bird -- projectile, trajectory."
David Rubin,Why not make it (the law) specific so the rules are clear and victims have some comfort level going in?
David Rubin,"Because the risk for developing colorectal cancer increases beginning about eight to ten years after the onset of IBD, even if the disease is in remission, it is imperative people seek screenings more frequently, approximately every one to two years. Regular examinations allow for early detection and vital treatment for colorectal cancer -- a curable disease if caught early."
David Rubin,The beauty of this building is that the structure is already here. The condition of this is superb compared to when we started Lake Mirror Towers.
David Rubin,"To shield a client with 'On the advice of counsel,' we object in the strongest terms,"
Elaine Rubin,"My experience is when moving online, they don't understand the detail and knowledge and discipline you must have across the entire spectrum of e-commerce. It is not a pretty sight the first couple of years. It's really a commitment. You have to have the patience and the dollars to wait it out."
Elaine Rubin,Its a matter of money. Their site is very robust. It's a fascinating announcement. Making it prior to the Christmas season leads me to believe they're probably bleeding pretty badly.
Elaine Rubin,"Right now, UPS is sort of the default choice. If someone comes up with the better mousetrap, then suddenly they won't be so satisfied with UPS. If USPS starts acting like an innovative business, then a lot of people would like to work with them. The Airborne thing also makes a lot of sense."
Elaine Rubin,"It is representative of the industry at large. About 12-to-18 months ago, there was this common belief amongst retailers that in order to have longevity and a long-standing business, we all need to be considering multi-channel operations. This is what consumers are going to demand of us."
Elaine Rubin,"Our merging with the NRF is indicative of the times too. We actually were negotiating this agreement with NRF 12 to 18 months ago. We realized that the world was converging, and in order for Shop.org to remain powerful and lucrative, we were looking for a more traditional partner as well."
Jerry Rubin,The backseat produced the sexual revolution
Jerry Rubin,"The jobs are there, but, particularly for working adults, traditional education just isn't going to cut it. New ways for training that meet the real-life requirements for adults are critically important."
Jerry Rubin,I would be copping out if I stayed in the myth of the '60s.
Jerry Rubin,The individual who signs the check has the ultimate power.
Jerry Rubin,The backseat produced the sexual revolution.
Jerry Rubin,Some of the greatest social reformers of our time were wealthy.
Jerry Rubin,I'm famous. That's my job.

Jerry Rubin,The power to define the situation is the ultimate power.
Jerry Rubin,Don't trust anyone over thirty.
Jerry Rubin,Every person on the streets of New York is a type. The city is one big theater where everyone is on display.
Rick Rubin,"He's never been part of any style, and he's crossed different boundaries of pop and rock and different kinds of music at different times."
Rick Rubin,"In Neil's mind, what separated him from all of his Brill Building songwriter counterparts was he wrote songs on the guitar and everyone else wrote on the piano. Guitar is equated with rock in a way piano has never been, so Neil has an unusual mix of guitar-based (rock) songwriting mixed with Brill Building melodic (piano) approach."
Rick Rubin,"In Neil's mind, what separated him from all of his Brill Building songwriter counterparts was he wrote songs on the guitar and everyone else wrote on the piano, ... Guitar is equated with rock in a way piano has never been, so Neil has an unusual mix of guitar-based (rock) songwriting mixed with Brill Building melodic (piano) approach."
Rick Rubin,"It's really starting to stick. If nothing else, it's a major distraction for management."
Rick Rubin,"It was an interesting, eye-opening experience,"
Rick Rubin,The inflationary environment we're seeing is still having a disproportionate effect on their consumers for now.
Rick Rubin,"He brought the chops right from the beginning, ... What I pushed for was for him to go beyond, in terms of continuing way beyond where he normally would."
Rick Rubin,I don't know what makes someone hip. The goal is artist achievement and the best work we can do with no limitation.
Robert Rubin,"It is critically important, not just for Japan, but for the rest of the region and the rest of the world, that that take place."
Robert Rubin,"The key is that these are now longstanding problems, and it is going to take a concerted and very substantial effort over a sustained period of time for Japan to get back on track,"
Robert Rubin,"As you look around the globe, it seems to me that a lot of the countries hurt by the Asian financial crises have made tremendous progress. On the other hand, in all of those countries there's a lot to do."
Robert Rubin,"This may be the most dramatic, most complicated and most significant economic transformation in modern history."
Robert Rubin,"The Prime Minister said earlier in the year that his objectives were domestic demand-led growth and I think he's taken very important and very constructive steps in that direction and we very much welcome them,"
Robert Rubin,"Here at home, ... while the most likely scenario remains solid growth and low inflation -- subject to the usual ups and downs -- certain sectors have been impacted by the crisis, some because of increased imports and others because of decreased exports. Moreover, problems in the global economy do constitute a risk to all our overall economic well-being."
Robert Rubin,"It focuses predominately on middle income tax cuts for education, and for child care and for savings, ... This Week."
Robert Rubin,"Thus far, the effects on our economy, though real, are relatively moderate and the most likely scenario for the next year is continued solid growth and low inflation,"
Robert Rubin,"Economically, things are going well,"
Robert Rubin,"Had these kinds of requirements been in place before the current crisis began in 1997, the flows of capital might well have slowed at a much earlier stage, substantially reducing the severity of the crisis,"
Robert Rubin,"I think it could have real changing effects on the financial markets of our country, it could cause investors to think more about real rates of return and that in turn could spawn new kinds of products,"
Robert Rubin,"Fiscal policy is the other ladle in the macroeconomic punch bowl, and consistency in use of the two ladles is powerful, and inconsistency can be injurious,"
Robert Rubin,"I'm saying that we have significant concerns about significant portions ? of this, ... We need to work with Congress to work our way through that."
Robert Rubin,The overarching point of the president's economic strategy going forward in the 1999 budget is clear: under no circumstances should we take any steps that will undo the fiscal discipline that we have worked so hard to achieve and has been so central to our strong economy of the last five years.
Robert Rubin,I've got 11 fly rods and a lot of unread books.
Robert Rubin,"We all shared a belief in market-based economics  though we had somewhat different views as to the appropriate role of government in our society  and felt that what happened abroad could greatly affect our own economic well being,"
Robert Rubin,"the financial architecture of the 21 st century, an architecture that is as modern as the markets."
Ricky Rudd,"The guys did a great job in the pits, ... We just sort of tried to stay out of trouble. We've wrecked out of this race like the last three times. It's usually been a good race track for us and we were lucky we got a good qualifying spot and just tried to keep our nose clean all night."
Ricky Rudd,"They're as good as they've ever been. They're still competitive. Their retirement plans are based on their sons coming up. They want to spend time helping their careers, and I have a lot of respect for them."
Ricky Rudd,"We've wrecked out of this race the last three times,"
Ricky Rudd,"I'm really sort of surprised at this run because we spent 98 percent of our time yesterday working on race setup and I got really comfortable with what I had there, ... Within the rules structure they allow you to do a few things for qualifying and the guys took advantage of that."
Ricky Rudd,"I have fun when I go road racing. I like them. I wouldn't want to run a road course every weekend, but I wouldn't mind seeing one or two more on the schedule. I like them because it sort of breaks up the regular routine, and we've had good luck on them over the years."
Ricky Rudd,"Nowadays, as they've been working on the cars and the quality control is getting a lot better, there's not a really a big difference. The cars are built specifically for different types of race tracks, whether it's a high-travel track or low-travel track, and that's what they go by. They go by data. It's past me, way beyond me now. But as far as me saying I've got a favorite car, they're getting stuff more consistent. I don't really see that anymore. They all seem to run about the same - unless they're purposely trying to make one differently, which they can do very easily."
Ricky Rudd,"I still have the desire and ability to win races, but a little burnout is beginning to set in. I may drive a few races next year if someone needs a substitute driver, but it's time to freshen up and do some things with my family that I have put off for a lot of years."
Philip Ruddock,"My understanding of the evidence is that some of the product had been actually purchased, others had been ordered, ... The intelligence assessment is that this was an enterprise designed to manufacture a very large quantity of explosives."
Philip Ruddock,"It is unacceptable that people who are able to pay a people-smuggler and make their way through several countries where they may avail themselves of protection, are getting a more favorable outcome than people languishing in the most appalling circumstances in refugee camps around the world,"
Philip Ruddock,"we can do our job, and that is to keep them out."
Philip Ruddock,"This morning ... some 70 to 80 detainees set fire to two recreational buildings, the dining room and an ablution block,"
Philip Ruddock,"All of the measures that we are seeking to put in place are balanced and appropriate for the circumstances that we face, ... We're not targeting specific members of the community."
Philip Ruddock,"They take no action in relation to lawful protest activity but the assessment has been made in accordance with the provisions of the ASIO Act,"
Rick Rudesill,It's not a surprise to us. We're used to seeing (him hit those shots) in practice.
Rick Rudesill,It's two winning teams playing in the region finals. Anything that's happened in the past doesn't mean a thing.
Rick Rudesill,"We have to limit our own mistakes and capitalize on their mistakes. When two good teams are playing each other, you've got to be sharp mentally. Every trip counts."
Rick Rudesill,It's a fine line. It's almost an arrogance some players play with. And they've got to have some of it. You want to have confidence without too much arrogance with it.
Rita Rudner,Men forget everything; women remember everything. That's why men need instant replays in sports. They've already forgotten what happened.
Rita Rudner,My mother is such a lousy cook that Thanksgiving at her house is a time of sorrow.
Rita Rudner,"To attract men, I wear a perfume called 'New Car Interior"
Rita Rudner,The entertainment complements what we do here. There is no better shopping than here and there are no better restaurants. There are a million ways to enjoy yourselves in Las Vegas.
Rita Rudner,I know I want to have children while my parents are still young enough to take care of them
Rita Rudner,"Whenever I date a guy, I think, 'Is this the man I want my children to spend their weekends with?'"
Rita Rudner,When I eventually met Mr. Right I had no idea that his first name was Always.
Rita Rudner,"To attract men, I wear a perfume called New Car Interior."
Rita Rudner,My mother buried three husbands - and two of them were only napping.
Rita Rudner,"Most turkeys taste better the day after, my mother's tasted better the day before."
Rita Rudner,It's so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.
Rita Rudner,"It wasn't that no one asked me to the prom, it was that no one would tell me where it was."
Rita Rudner,I know I want to have children while my parents are still young enough to take care of them.
Rita Rudner,I don't plan to grow old gracefully. I plan to have face-lifts until my ears meet.
Rita Rudner,I was a vegetarian until I started leaning toward the sunlight.
Rita Rudner,I think men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage. They've experienced pain and bought jewelry.
Rita Rudner,"The word 'aerobics' came about when the gym instructors got together and said: If we're going to charge $10 an hour, we can't call it Jumping up and down."
Rita Rudner,"They usually have two tellers in my local bank, except when it's very busy, when they have one."
Rita Rudner,Men reach their sexual peak at eighteen. Women reach theirs at thirty-five. Do you get the feeling that God is playing a practical joke?
Rita Rudner,My grandmother was a very tough woman. She buried three husbands and two of them were just napping.
Rita Rudner,Someday I want to be rich. Some people get so rich they lose all respect for humanity. That's how rich I want to be.
Rita Rudner,"Marriages don't last. When I meet a guy, the first question I ask myself is: is this the man I want my children to spend their weekends with?"
Rita Rudner,"I love to shop after a bad relationship. I don't know. I buy a new outfit and it makes me feel better. It just does. Sometimes I see a really great outfit, I'll break up with someone on purpose."
Rita Rudner,"My husband gave me a necklace. It's fake. I requested fake. Maybe I'm paranoid, but in this day and age, I don't want something around my neck that's worth more than my head."
Rita Rudner,"Neurotics build castles in the air, psychotics live in them. My mother cleans them."
Rita Rudner,The time you spend grieving over a man should never exceed the amount of time you actually spent with him.
Rita Rudner,Some women hold up dresses that are so ugly and they always say the same thing: 'This looks much better on.' On what? On fire?
Rita Rudner,Men who consistently leave the toilet seat up secretly want women to get up to go the bathroom in the middle of the night and fall in.
Rita Rudner,I got kicked out of ballet class because I pulled a groin muscle. It wasn't mine.
Rita Rudner,"We've begun to long for the pitter-patter of little feet - so we bought a dog. Well, it's cheaper, and you get more feet."
Rita Rudner,"I want to have children, but my friends scare me. One of my friends told me she was in labor for 36 hours. I don't even want to do anything that feels good for 36 hours."
Rita Rudner,I was going to have cosmetic surgery until I noticed that the doctor's office was full of portraits by Picasso.
Rita Rudner,My husband and I are either going to buy a dog or have a child. We can't decide whether to ruin our carpet or ruin our lives.
Rita Rudner,Men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage - they've experienced pain and bought jewelry.
Rita Rudner,I love being married. It's so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.

Rita Rudner,My boyfriend and I broke up. He wanted to get married and I didn't want him to.
Lindy Ruff,The key to deserving the victory was the amount of battle we had in the penalty-kill situations.
Lindy Ruff,Our game was back where we needed it. We really skated well. They had trouble with our speed.
Lindy Ruff,"It was a cheap shot, it was a knee on knee hit. He knocked our guy out of the lineup for several weeks."
Lindy Ruff,"With the new rules he's going to score. Still, I'll take some of the grind and some of the front-of-the-net play that we have in our guys, and I think it's just made us a deeper, stronger team in that sense."
Lindy Ruff,"You believe you can make it every year. You don't think it's going to end. But the reality is that most teams, you end up in, you end up out."
Lindy Ruff,"He's going to be a tremendous asset. He's well-respected. He's passionate about the game. From his practice habits to his workout habits to his preparation for the game, both on the ice and off the ice, no player can question his opinion."
Lindy Ruff,"I'll take 100 points, but the guys got me a gift and my parents said, 'When you get a gift you should wear it."
Lindy Ruff,We only had two odd-man rushes the whole night.
Lindy Ruff,"He's anxious to play. He's cleared for physical stuff in practice, which we're giving him a pretty good dose of today. . . . I wouldn't rule him out for later in the week."
Lindy Ruff,"There's no quit in our team. Check our record, the number of games we've won when we've been down by a goal. You've got to give the guys credit. The number of guys we've had go out of the lineup at key times and the number of guys who have stepped up ... you've got to give every guy in that room credit for battling through adversity and doing it every night."
Lindy Ruff,I liked the way he played the game. He really had a sound game. I'm getting happy with where the team's at right now.
Lindy Ruff,"I'm very appreciative from ownership all the way down â€” the faith they've shown, ... I really like what the team has done and I appreciate the message they've sent and what they've tried to do. ... But it's knowing that we have a job to do every day and this business is all about winning."
Lindy Ruff,"I'm very appreciative from ownership all the way down, the faith they've shown,"
Lindy Ruff,We are definitely disappointed. Our execution wasn't very good.
Lindy Ruff,We played them pretty even for most of the game. But our execution was not very good.
Lindy Ruff,"The first seven minutes was as poorly as I've seen us play in a while. Our execution, our passing . . . we weren't crisp. We weren't alert. We deserved what we got."
Lindy Ruff,"Our execution and passing wasn't very good. We had a couple of guys on a couple of shifts who couldn't handle the puck, and it disrupted the whole power play."
Lindy Ruff,"It makes for an interesting three days. You can have a lot of emotion spill over. Really, it's going to feel like the start of a playoff series, and not that often do you get that situation in our league."
Lindy Ruff,"As a team, there's nights when you need his enthusiasm, you need that desire to go through anybody. His fearless attitude on the ice is something that keeps other teams on their toes. There's nights you just can't have another player do that. He's full bore, straight ahead, and the first guy there when there's trouble for any of his teammates."
Lindy Ruff,"We've got a lot of decisions to make,"
Lindy Ruff,"A lot of mannerisms remind me of his dad, kind of the way he skates and the fact he's a real smart player. He really thinks the game well."
Lindy Ruff,"He wasn't out, but he wasn't there. I had a conversation with him and it was more like a conversation with myself."
Lindy Ruff,He was solid. He saw everything and was totally under control. He gave us momentum.
Lindy Ruff,They just never quit. They battle through adversity. The message is when you're dealt tough cards you give it your all and you go until the last whistle.
Lindy Ruff,"They just never quit. They battle through adversity and don't quit. ... Again, we demonstrated a lot of resilience and made enough plays."
Lindy Ruff,"We took advantage of every break we got. We took advantage of our odd-numbered situations that we haven't previously taken advantage of in Game 3 and Game 4. The good chances they gave us, we made sure we finished. We made sure that we got them down when we had the opportunity."
Lindy Ruff,I think it's a heck of an accomplishment. It's a mark nobody would have expected at the start of the year. ... It's something they should be proud of.
Mark Ruffalo,"It was a bunch of young girls,"
Mark Ruffalo,"It was a bunch of young girls, ... They were standing in close proximity. I said, 'Hi. How are you?' One of them asked (he puts on a high girly voice), 'Are you Matt from 13 Going on 30 ?' They were nice and everything. But I usually like to be low-key and private."
Mark Ruffalo,"I can't just 'Jim Carrey' something like that, ... I don't have that kind of genius. So I went and hired a clown and we did isolating exercises, where one part of your body does one thing and another part does something else. And then, at 2 in the morning, after working on it for hours, I was lying down, and I thought, 'Oh my God, I've got it now!'"
Mark Ruffalo,"Well, it's actually funny and romantic, unlike many romantic comedies these days,"
Mark Ruffalo,I've been able to hide behind the character in Eternal Sunshine . People don't recognize me from Collateral . But this feels more exposed.
Mark Ruffalo,"I like doing the action and the romantic comedy stuff,"
Ja Rule,"I got started in 1995, working in a group called The Cash Money Click."
Ja Rule,"These companies are in it for their dollars, and whatever is hot that is what they follow."
Ja Rule,I've signed a few sneakers in my day.
Jalal Rumi,"Oh soul, you worry too much. You have seen your own strength. You have seen your own beauty. You have seen your golden wings. Of anything less, why do you worry? You are in truth the soul, of the soul, of the soul."

Jalal Rumi,"It may be that the satisfaction I need depends on my going away, so that when I've gone and come back, I'll find it at home."
Jalal Rumi,"You are quaffing drink from a hundred fountains: whenever any of these hundred yields less, your pleasure is diminished. But when the sublime fountain gushes from within you, no longer need you steal from the other fountains."
Jalal Rumi,He is like a man using a candle to look for the sun
Jalal Rumi,Look at Love...how it tangleswith the one fallen in love .
Jalal Rumi,"This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet."
Jalal Rumi,The hurt you embrace becomes joy.
Jalal Rumi,The way you make love is the wayGod will be with you.
Jalal Rumi,Reason is like an officer when the king appears. The officer then loses his power and hides himself. Reason is the shadow cast by God; God is the sun.
Jalal Rumi,Fear is the cheapest room in the house.
Jalal Rumi,"The Eternal looked upon me for a moment with His eye of power, and annihilated me in His being, and become manifest to me in His essence. I saw I existed through Him."
Jalal Rumi,"Everyone has been made for some particular work, and the desire for that work has been put in every heart."
Jalal Rumi,"I died a mineral, and became a plant. I died a plant and rose an animal. I died an animal and I was man. Why should I fear? When was I less by dying?"
Jalal Rumi,"Every tree and plant in the meadow seemed to be dancing, those which average eyes would see as fixed and still"
Jalal Rumi,Only from the heart Can you touch the sky.
Jalal Rumi,"Let the lover be disgraceful, crazy, absent-minded. Someone sober will worry about events going badly. Let the lover be."
Jalal Rumi,"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it."
Jalal Rumi,Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment.
Jalal Rumi,You were born with wings. Why prefer to crawl through life?
Jalal Rumi,Let the beauty of what you love be what you do.
Jalal Rumi,"In your light I learn how to love.In your beauty, how to make poems.You dance inside my chest,where no one sees you."
Jalal Rumi,"Oh soul,you worry too much.You have seen your own strength.You have seen your own beauty.You have seen your golden wings.Of anything less,why do you worry?You are in truththe soul, of the soul, of the soul."
Jalal Rumi,To praise the sun is to praise your own eyes.
Jalal Rumi,The lion is most handsome when looking for food
Jalal Rumi,Why do you stay in prisonwhen the door is so wide open?Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking.Live in silence.
Jalal Rumi,"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I will meet you there."
Donald Rumsfeld,"You haven't heard words like that from me,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Sixty years ago, an American ambassador to Japan, echoing the conventional wisdom of the times, confidently told President Harry Truman that 'democracy in Japan will never work,' ... Today, Japan is one of the world's model democracies, with one of the largest economies in the world."
Donald Rumsfeld,Do I think [the voting] will go forward? Yes I do.
Donald Rumsfeld,"There are other photos -- many other photos -- that depict incidents of physical violence towards prisoners, acts that can only be described as blatantly sadistic, cruel and inhuman, ... And I am advised there also are videos of these actions."
Donald Rumsfeld,The immediate effect is likely to be what it's always been -- a spike in violence. The last thing in the world the enemies want is success. The last thing they want is democracy in Iraq.
Donald Rumsfeld,level of violence and the insurgency to continue.
Donald Rumsfeld,"But those deadly acts, and they were deadly, proved not to be harbingers of victory."
Donald Rumsfeld,Don't accept the post or stay unless you have an understanding with the President that you're free to tell him what you think with the bark off and you have the courage to do it.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Those advances in China's strategic strike capability raise questions, particularly when there's an imperfect understanding of such developments on the part of others,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"By not wearing uniforms, by not carrying your weapon openly, by not carrying insignia of that, you're trying to suggest that you want the advantages that accrue to an innocent, a civilian, a noncombatant,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"He's either dead, or he's incapacitated, or he's healthy and cowering in some tunnel someplace trying to avoid being caught. What else can one say?"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Additional capabilities for airborne reconnaissance, heavy-lift ground equipment and medical support are being identified and dispatched from within the Central Command region,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"I knew that they had not cleared Afghan air space or returned,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Every society, ... has to be vigilant against another type of Great Wall that can be a burden on man's talents and is born from a fear of them - a wall that limits speech, information and choices."
Donald Rumsfeld,Thank you for your great service to our nation.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Don't think of yourself as indispensable or infallible. As Charles De Gaulle said, the cemeteries of the world are full of indispensable men."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Make decisions about the President's personal security. He can overrule you, but don't ask him to be the one to counsel caution."
Donald Rumsfeld,"I don't know that he necessarily reflects the U.N., the center of gravity of the Security Council on any particular issue at any particular time,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"They have in every way possible guaranteed their security,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We are not going to find them in my view -- just as I never believed the inspectors would -- by running around seeing if they can open a door and surprise somebody and find something,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"not inevitable, although as the president has said, 'Time is running out.'"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We haven't found Saddam Hussein, and I don't know anyone who's running around saying he didn't exist,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"If you develop rules, never have more than ten."
Donald Rumsfeld,at still greater risk.
Donald Rumsfeld,to put your lives at risk on behalf of your fellow soldiers is admirable.
Donald Rumsfeld,"There is always a risk in gradualism. It pacifies the hesitant and the tentative,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"It's only a matter of time before the rest are dealt with,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Move decisions out to the Cabinet and agencies. Strengthen them by moving responsibility, authority, and accountability their direction."
Donald Rumsfeld,need to speed up the process by which Iraqis assume greater responsibility for their own security.
Donald Rumsfeld,"As the capabilities of the Republic of Korea grow, obviously they will assume more and more responsibility, as they have been doing in recent years. As that happens in an orderly way, over time, there will be adjustments in the command relationship and those are the kinds of things allies discuss."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Like all alliances, this relationship must and is, in fact, evolving to remain strong and relevant, ... It's our joint responsibility to manage the alliance's evolution, and we are getting that job done."
Donald Rumsfeld,take on more responsibility.

Donald Rumsfeld,"It's going well, we are making progress, but it's far from finished,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We discussed the impressive economic progress China has made in recent years and the emergence of China on the world scene. We also talked about the upcoming 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and the success of China's second manned space flight for which I offer my congratulations,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Progress has been made and we encourage it,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Progress (on reform) has been made and we encourage it and are available to be of assistance in various ways,"
Donald Rumsfeld,We must work together if we're to be able to address the problems of inadequate funding -- which has been the case -- unreliable funding ... and resistance to change.
Donald Rumsfeld,"This is an unusual situation. This regime has been in power for decades. These two individuals are particularly vicious individuals. They are now dead. We know that, ... They have been carefully identified. The Iraqi people have been waiting for confirmation of that. And they, in my view, deserved having confirmation of that."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Those who sabotage the efforts to restore power and water and other services are not attacking the coalition, they are attacking you, the Iraqi people. With your cooperation we're dealing with them."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Why this huge contract has not been and is not now being adequately audited is beyond me. The potential for waste and profiteering under such a contract is substantial,"
Donald Rumsfeld,Think ahead. Don't let day-to-day operations drive out planning.
Donald Rumsfeld,"We're planning to bring the 152,000 down to about 135,000 or 137,000 or 140,000 over the coming weeks, now that the election is behind us,"
Donald Rumsfeld,The planning is going to go forward outside of NATO if necessary.
Donald Rumsfeld,Be able to resign. It will improve your value to the President and do wonders for your performance.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Many millions of people will believe them, despite the fact that they are so patently false."
Donald Rumsfeld,"It was a large convoy, and there were a lot of people killed and a lot of vehicles damaged, or destroyed, I should say."
Donald Rumsfeld,"There are an awful lot of people chasing the wrong rabbit here, it seems to me,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We are sending very clear messages to people around [Saddam] that they would be well-advised not to use those weapons, ... In the event, they do, they would wish they hadn't."
Donald Rumsfeld,"In some instances, people have been killed and in still other instances they've been wounded. And still others, we have reason to believe they might have escaped to another country. In other cases, we don't know where they are,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"These people are committed terrorists, ... We are keeping them off the street and out of the airlines and out of nuclear power plants and out of ports ... , and it seems to me a perfectly reasonable thing to do."
Donald Rumsfeld,"You put your lives at risk .. so that the citizens of a grateful nation can live in peace,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The rapid and, from our perspective at least, non-transparent nature of this buildup contributes to their uncertainty,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"It is a series of things that will be taking place, looking into defensive and offensive capabilities and the nature of our world and our circumstance in it, and what kind of threats and challenges and opportunities face us,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"There is no question but that $74.7 billion is a great deal of money, but the cost of not investing would be far greater, ... We need the funds. We need the flexibility as to how they are spent, so we can adapt to the unknowable circumstances that are unfolding in the weeks and months ahead."
Donald Rumsfeld,"I mean, we've got Chavez in Venezuela with a lot of oil money. He's a person who was elected legally -- just as Adolf Hitler was elected legally..."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things, ... They're also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here."
Donald Rumsfeld,"If they do, it would be a mistake,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The president knows, as I know, there are no indispensable men ... He knows that I serve at his pleasure, and that's that."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Here was a man who was photographed hundreds of times shooting off rifles and showing how tough he was, and in fact, he wasn't very tough, he was cowering in a hole in the ground, and had a pistol and didn't use it and certainly did not put up any fight at all,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"You can't have two countries living next to each other for very long, with a million people staring at each other with weapons, and not recognize that there are certain things that would be desirable,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"I am in a listening mode and a looking mode,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Let me assure all Iraqis listening today that life without Saddam Hussein is not a distant dream,"
Donald Rumsfeld,Don't necessarily avoid sharp edges. Occasionally they are necessary to leadership.
Donald Rumsfeld,"As enemy leaders become fewer and fewer that does not necessarily mean that the task will become easier, ... People can hide in caves for long periods, and this will take time."
Donald Rumsfeld,Where are Iraq's leaders?
Donald Rumsfeld,Our department doesn't do that kind of thing. It's against the law. He's a private citizen. Private citizens say all kinds of things all the time.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Certainly it's against the law. Our department doesn't do that type of thing,"
Donald Rumsfeld,Reduce the number of lawyers. They are like beavers - they get in the middle of the stream and dam it up.
Donald Rumsfeld,"To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two."
Donald Rumsfeld,"to my knowledge, and I think I would have knowledge."
Donald Rumsfeld,"have been involved in training and to my knowledge, that's what we're still doing."
Donald Rumsfeld,Our department doesn't do that kind of thing. It's against the law. Not to my knowledge and I would think I would have knowledge.
Donald Rumsfeld,"To my knowledge, the Saudis have not said that,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We've got to find a way to have the military justice system operate at a pace that reflects the world of the 21st century with 24-hour news and a desire to report things that are dramatic and negative, and to repeat them over and over again until for some reason they are disproved or they're concluded, and the longer that period is the more harmful it is for our country,"
Donald Rumsfeld,had been made generally aware that the Justice Department had an investigation going on.
Donald Rumsfeld,"I would not say that Justice is not interested in prosecuting him,"
Donald Rumsfeld,Listening to both sides does not necessarily bring about a correct judgment.
Donald Rumsfeld,"We have no intention of doing either one to be perfectly honest. We have every intention of working out an arrangement with the Russians and I think we will,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"And why the intelligence proved wrong, I'm not in a position to say. I simply don't know. But the world is a lot better off with Saddam Hussein in jail than they were with him in power."
Donald Rumsfeld,"I do not personally have ... enough intelligence from reliable sources ... that would enable me to walk up and say that I have conviction that he's dead. I also lack conviction that he's alive,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"There's no question you've got to have an intelligence capability, ... and the question is, how do you do it and who do you use and [with] what vetting process. So they're thinking those things through right now."
Donald Rumsfeld,"There's one capability that is essential to dealing with all of these threats and, needless to say, that's intelligence,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Until you're down on the ground, you can't know precisely, ... The intelligence we have is clearly sufficient for the president to say that he believes the world has to recognize the Iraqis have repeatedly violated these U.N. resolutions."
Donald Rumsfeld,"In terms of having first-hand information, I just can't imagine that he does, ... The allegation is ridiculous."
Donald Rumsfeld,"I think this constant quest for new information and smoking guns is misguided,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Almost every arrest leads to additional pieces of information. It may be scraps of information in their pockets, it may be things they say, it may be other connections that occur,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"See that the President, the Cabinet and staff are informed. If cut out of the information flow, their decisions may be poor, not made, or not confidently or persuasively implemented."
Donald Rumsfeld,"We do not have information that validates any of that. Indeed some of the numbers are ridiculous,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"You have contributed to significant improvement in the lives of the citizens of those two countries,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We must be careful not to give terrorists the false hope that if they can simply hold on long enough, they can outlast us,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Obviously the hope and goal of all of the nations that have troops in the Balkans, is that over a period of time the parties on the ground will sort through their differences in a peaceful and constructive way and find the kind of civil structures that will enable them to have the stability that would be necessary for them on a more durable basis,"
Donald Rumsfeld,My hope is that they will either be killed or taken prisoner.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Whether the forces would come home or whether they'd move farther south on the peninsula or whether they'd move to some neighboring area are the kinds of things that are being sorted out,"
Donald Rumsfeld,probably unmatched in history.
Donald Rumsfeld,"This is an important moment in Iraqi history,"
Donald Rumsfeld,be useful to take a moment to retrace the actual history.
Donald Rumsfeld,"while it has to be a heart-wrenching thing for each of the families involved, our task is to try to help them and the country understand the importance of the work that's being done."
Donald Rumsfeld,Watch the growth of middle level management. Don't automatically fill vacant jobs. Leave some positions unfilled for 6-8 months to see what happens. You will find you won't need to fill some of them.
Donald Rumsfeld,"I congratulate the people of Mongolia, the government and the armed forces of Mongolia for selecting that (peacekeeping) as a principle aspect of their military focus, and certainly the United States is anxious and willing and ready to be of assistance,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"[The new government] would be an Iraq that would be for the Iraqi people. It wouldn't be a regime determined from the outside of Iraq, ... nonsense."
Donald Rumsfeld,Enemies of the legitimate Iraqi government' -- how's that?
Donald Rumsfeld,"And the only thing that will have changed is that you've now got the interim government and the coalition forces with the same goal, ... but it will require interaction between the two of them because there will be a government for the first time in place of the Taliban."
Donald Rumsfeld,"We consider such trafficking as hostile acts and will hold the Syrian government accountable for such shipments,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The Iraqi people are going to sort out what the Iraqi government ought to look like,"
Donald Rumsfeld,It's not clear to me that that will even be decided until after the government that follows the interim government is in place.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Many people around the President have sizeable egos before entering government, some with good reason. Their new positions will do little to moderate their egos."
Donald Rumsfeld,"If I said, 'My goodness, that's a big help,' it suggests that we plan to go use them. And that is a decision the president has not made,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Oh my goodness gracious, what you can buy off the Internet in terms of overhead photography. A trained ape can know an awful lot of what is going on in this world, just by punching on his mouse, for a relatively modest cost."
Donald Rumsfeld,"People have said, 'My goodness, why does it take so long for someone to come back with and have the actual facts?' ... Well, it takes a long time to be truthful."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Our objective is not to create dependency but to encourage Iraqi independence, by giving Iraqis increasing responsibility, over time, for the security and governance of their country, ... Because long-term stability comes not from the presence of foreign forces but from the development of functioning local institutions. The sooner Iraqis can take responsibility for their own affairs the sooner U.S. forces can come home."
Donald Rumsfeld,"You folks have helped to liberate 25 million human beings, ... You've also performed any number of acts of kindness, generosity and compassion to the Iraqi people that you've worked with."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Preparing for the future will require us to think differently and develop the kinds of forces and capabilities that can adapt quickly to new challenges and to unexpected circumstances,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Our department doesn't do that kind of thing. It's against the law. However, it is fun to play the 'what if' game."
Donald Rumsfeld,"This much is certain. Those that oppose the Iraqi people's transition to freedom and self-rule will not be permitted to derail it. U.S. forces are on the offense,"
Donald Rumsfeld,to force people to think about it in the broadest possible terms.
Donald Rumsfeld,"I can't tell you if the use of force in Iraq today will last five days, five weeks or five months, but it won't last any longer than that."
Donald Rumsfeld,"If anybody thinks that I'm [in Iraq] to throw water on a fire, they're wrong,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We are capable of fighting two major regional conflicts,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The Iraqi soldiers and officers must ask themselves whether they want to die fighting for a doomed regime or do they want to survive, help the Iraqi people in the liberation of their country and play a role in a new free Iraq."
Donald Rumsfeld,"[In Washington, thousands of people marched in remembrance of the attacks and in tribute to troops fighting overseas.] I wish we could say ... that we were gathering today to commemorate a danger that had long since past, ... But we cannot. The enemy, though seriously weakened and continuously under pressure, continues to plot attacks, and the danger they pose to the free world is real and present."
Donald Rumsfeld,"[While cautioning that Operation Iraqi Freedom was still far from over and] there's a lot more fighting that's going to be done, ... a very good day."
Donald Rumsfeld,"There's a lot more fighting that's going to be done. More people are going to be killed, let there be no doubt. This is not over, despite all the celebrations on the street."
Donald Rumsfeld,In unanimity there may well be either cowardice or uncritical thinking.
Donald Rumsfeld,"If there's a failure, it's me. It's my failure for not understanding and knowing that there were hundreds -- or however many there are of these things -- that could eventually end up in the public and do the damage they've done,"
Donald Rumsfeld,it is our expectation the secretary will seek a higher figure and we will of course take a look at it.
Donald Rumsfeld,"In the execution of Presidential decisions work to be true to his views, in fact and tone."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Many countries, for example, have questions about the pace and scope of China's military expansion,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"They are checking out their environment and determining what their opportunities and their options are, ... Our view is, we are not going to give them any."
Donald Rumsfeld,"We all go through strong emotions when something like this occurs, ... We see it and we're shocked and we're stunned and we're disgusted, and we know in our hearts that we are better than that, and, yet, that is what is being seen in the world as presenting our country."
Donald Rumsfeld,"In terms of Iraq, the insurgency is going to diminish, I think, after these elections."
Donald Rumsfeld,"I have no comment on the German elections outcome, but I would have to say that the way it was conducted was notably unhelpful."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Let's say you tried to have an election and you could have it in three-quarters or four-fifths of the country, but some places you couldn't because the violence was too great. Well, that's -- so be it. Nothing's perfect in life. So you have an election that's not quite perfect."
Donald Rumsfeld,"We will be focusing on those quality of life issues: health, and education, and housing and pay,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"I guess the one word that comes to mind is really 'duty.' You've done yours, ... The people of New York have done theirs, and the men and women in uniform are still doing theirs."
Donald Rumsfeld,"If in doubt, move decisions up to the President."
Donald Rumsfeld,"What they need is blankets and tents and medicines. They have a lot of doctors, people on the ground."
Donald Rumsfeld,"As the president said, it is a natural disaster of historic proportion, ... No one can come up with anything that approximates this in the history of our country."
Donald Rumsfeld,"The deputy director of central intelligence briefed on that subject. I have no desire to go beyond saying the answer is yes,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Our dependence on operations in space, however, makes us somewhat vulnerable to new challenges. It's only logical to conclude that we must be attentive to these vulnerabilities and pay careful attention to protecting and promoting our interests in space,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The process has been delayed a bit, but democracy has never been described as speedy, efficient or perfect,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"I think a delay is not helpful, ... How a few days' delay in this process would affect the insurgency, I think that it wouldn't. Who knows? Time will tell, we'll all know soon enough."
Donald Rumsfeld,"[Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he was confident the military campaign would be successful in removing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power.] Things are going very well, ... the pressure is continuing on the Iraqi regime, and [the regime] will not be there in the period ahead."
Donald Rumsfeld,"To the extent that defense expenditures are judged to be considerably higher than what is published, neighbors understandably wonder what the reason might be for the disparity between what they believe to be reality and public statements,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The minute that Saddam Hussein and his small ruling clique sense that they're out of danger, I suspect that they'll have no further incentive to cooperation, and any U.N. inspection and disarmament efforts could then fail,"
Donald Rumsfeld,Reduce the layers of management. They put distance between the top of an organization and the customers.
Donald Rumsfeld,"If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much."
Donald Rumsfeld,"It is their country; they ultimately are going to have to provide security for that country,"
Donald Rumsfeld,They know that they're the ones that are going to have to grab that country. And it's time.
Donald Rumsfeld,"They know that they're the ones who are going to have to grab that country, and it's time,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"seems unusual -- after all, our country stands for freedom and the protection of rights."
Donald Rumsfeld,"I ... would recommend that some provision be made so that the senior leadership in that country and their families could be provided haven in some other country,"
Donald Rumsfeld,The adjustments being announced are the recognition of the Iraqi people's progress in assuming added responsibility for their country.
Donald Rumsfeld,"We know we're finding Iranian weapons inside of the country,"
Donald Rumsfeld,his gratitude for their service to their country.
Donald Rumsfeld,"I think that you can have a legitimate insurgency in a country that has popular support and has a cohesiveness and has a legitimate gripe. These people don't have a legitimate gripe,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The stronger the interim government gets, the more effective the security situation in the country gets, the less likely that there will be substantial operations like this. But that's some distance off,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"We are seeing history unfold, events that will shape the course of a country, the fate of a people and potentially the future of the region."
Donald Rumsfeld,"In fact, in a number of parts of the country, people already have more food, water and electricity than they had under the old regime, ... But some do not have these necessities, and the coalition is working day and night to help provide them."
Donald Rumsfeld,"And it's been a good cooperation, and we've shared some information, and we think that over time it ought to be beneficial."
Donald Rumsfeld,The Secretary of Defense is not a super General or Admiral. His task is to exercise civilian control over the Department for the Commander-in-Chief and the country.
Donald Rumsfeld,if he acts with the express purpose of inflicting harm or suffering on a patient within his control.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Once Iraq is safely in the hands of the Iraqi people, and a government they elected under a new constitution, our troops will be able to come home with the honor they have earned,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"I wish the constitution were complete rather than delayed by seven days, or up to seven days."
Donald Rumsfeld,you could have a constitution not only passed -- which I have believed all along it would pass -- but passed with the support of a much broader element within the Sunni community.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Obviously I've always believed the sooner the constitution was completed, and sooner it was voted on, the greater the likelihood the Iraqi people would feel they have a stake in the country, and that they have an acceptable set of compromises that would protect them from each other,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Twenty-five million people in Iraq are free, ... They've been liberated. The schools are functioning. There's a new interim constitution that protects the rights of women and will protect minorities and ethnic elements in that country. It's an advance for freedom."
Donald Rumsfeld,"regrettably, completing the constitution is not likely to end all the violence in Iraq or solve all of the country's problems."
Donald Rumsfeld,It is easier to get into something than to get out of it.
Donald Rumsfeld,"I want to emphasize how important it is that Congress pass the final legislation prior to the upcoming Senate recess,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Don't divide the world into them and us. Avoid infatuation with or resentment of the press, the Congress, rivals, or opponents. Accept them as facts. They have their jobs and you have yours."
Donald Rumsfeld,"They haven't stopped it and they're not going to win, ... The thought of their prevailing in this conflict is a terrible thought."
Donald Rumsfeld,"What will follow will not be a repeat of any other conflict, ... It will be of a force and scope and scale that has been beyond what has been seen before."
Donald Rumsfeld,entering a very dangerous aspect of this conflict.
Donald Rumsfeld,What will follow will not be a repeat of any other conflict.
Donald Rumsfeld,"I have absolutely full confidence in the way the detainees are being handled and treated, ... I've spent a lot of time talking to the people there about it."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Include others. As Senator Pat Moynihan said, Stubborn opposition to proposals often has no other basis than the complaining question, 'Why wasn't I consulted?'"
Donald Rumsfeld,"But that may be a distinction without a difference for someone from the Arab community,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"He will either deal with the problem of disarming or he will tell the world community that he is unwilling to -- and the next choice, as the president has suggested, is with the United Nations and the members of the Security Council,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"I don't know what the circumstances of the leadership of the country is, ... I don't think people in the country know. We haven't seen any evidence in recent days."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Those of us in the United States and in other countries around the world, free countries, hope that the choices they make are choices toward a more open society, a more transparent society."
Donald Rumsfeld,"If the world decides to impose choices on us, then we'll make choices with respect to the things we're doing and deal with those problems,"
Donald Rumsfeld,will make the right choices -- choices that will serve the world's real interests in regional peace and security.
Donald Rumsfeld,"We now have people from ... two or three handfuls of countries ... and my first choice would be for many of those to end up back in their countries to be processed through their systems, ... We undoubtedly will end up processing them through the criminal justice system ... I suspect there will be some military commissions."
Donald Rumsfeld,is everyone's last choice.
Donald Rumsfeld,The Sunnis have got to make a choice: Do they want to live in a society that's free?
Donald Rumsfeld,We believe we have made progress in eliminating defense sites around the country... [but] we cannot state with certainty that we destroyed the dozens of command and control and leadership facilities we selected.
Donald Rumsfeld,"We'd like to see them improve and I believe that (China) would, too, ... The question is if we can find ways to do it that are comfortable from both nations' standpoint."
Donald Rumsfeld,"My personal belief is that today we have reached some progress. ... The meetings will continue later this week in Washington,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"A growth in China's power projection understandably leads other nations to question China's intentions, and to adjust their behavior in some fashion."
Donald Rumsfeld,"The fact of the matter is that the military experts on the ground from the beginning have said what they thought the number ought to be,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"It is a question that is moving around in the department and in the Coalition Provisional Authority, and I believe possibly with the [Iraqi] Governing Council, and it's complicated,"
Donald Rumsfeld,Find ways to decentralize. Move decision making authority down and out. Encourage a more entrepreneurial approach.
Donald Rumsfeld,"The total size of the Afghan army is a subject that is under discussion, and very likely will continue to be under discussion for several reasons,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"And their massacres of innocents have outraged most Iraqis, rather than attracting broad support. Indeed, polls indicate that the anger against the terrorists and the insurgents is growing."
Donald Rumsfeld,to represent the best of what America stands for to a foreign audience.
Donald Rumsfeld,But it's important for each of you to know that that is not the values of America and it's not your values. And I know that and you know that and your families know that. And we're proud of you -- each of you. We're proud of your service.
Donald Rumsfeld,"The people who committed these acts are clearly determined to try to force the United States of America and our values from the world, or to respond by curtailing our freedoms. If we do that, the terrorists will have won, and we have no intention of doing so,"
Donald Rumsfeld,"My latest information is they have not come to an agreement, ... It's an investigation. It is done together. We'll just have to wait and see."
Donald Rumsfeld,making an assessment and providing some advice and working with the Philippine troops.
Donald Rumsfeld,"Inspectors do not have the duty or the ability to uncover terrible weapons hidden in a vast country. The responsibility of inspectors is simply to confirm evidence of voluntary and total disarmament. Saddam Hussein has the responsibility to provide that evidence, as directed, and in full"
Donald Rumsfeld,"The confusion of Iraqi officials is growing, ... Their ability to see what is happening on the battlefield, to communicate with their forces and to control their country is slipping away."
Donald Rumsfeld,"Effective missile defense -- not only homeland defense but also the ability to defend U.S. allies abroad and our friends -- must be achieved in the most cost-effective manner that modern technology offers,"

Salman Rushdie,"Literature is where I go to explore the highest and lowest places in human society and in the human spirit, where I hope to find not absolute truth but the truth of the tale, of the imagination and of the heart."
Salman Rushdie,"The liveliness of literature lies in its exceptionality, in being the individual, idiosyncratic vision of one human being, in which, to our delight and great surprise, we may find our own vision reflected."
Salman Rushdie,"If you want to tell the untold stories, if you want to give voice to the voiceless, you've got to find a language. Which goes for film as well as prose, for documentary as well as autobiography. Use the wrong language, and you're dumb and blind."
Salman Rushdie,What one writer can make in the solitude of one room is something no power can easily destroy.
Salman Rushdie,The novel does not seek to establish a privileged language but it insists upon the freedom to portray and analyze the struggle between the different contestants for such privileges.

Salman Rushdie,"I have a deep feeling for Kashmir, and I just had to write this book, ... [But] it's very hard to write about real events. It becomes unbearable. The challenge in writing this book was: how do you write about these things bearably without sweetening the pill?"
Salman Rushdie,"It was because it was easier to blame me, ... You know, 'Why is he rocking the boat?' In those days there was a lot of that stuff. He was asking for it. He did it on purpose. He was begging for it. It was just conventional blaming-the-victim stuff. I don't like the term 'victim' when applied to myself. Certainly I felt the guilt burden had shifted from the people doing the violence to the person on the receiving end of the violence."
Salman Rushdie,"Always do something impossible right at the beginning of the show?. Swallow a sword, tie yourself in a knot, defy gravity. Do what the audience knows it could never do no matter how hard it tries. After that you'll have them eating out of your hand."
Salman Rushdie,Most of what matters in your life takes place in your absence.
Salman Rushdie,"A poet's work is to name the unnameable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world, and stop it going to sleep."

John Ruskin,"How false is the conception, how frantic the pursuit, of that treacherous phantom which men call Liberty: most treacherous, indeed, of all phantoms; for the feeblest ray of reason might surely show us, that not only its attainment, but its being, was impossible. There is no such thing in the universe. There can never be.

Steve Russell,We want to continue to keep our youth busy so they have more activities than just hanging around the streets and getting in trouble.

Tim Russert,"And you are convinced the Kurds, the Sunnis, the Shiites will come together in a democracy?"

Babe Ruth,As soon as I got out there I felt a strange relationship with the pitcher's mound. It was as if I'd been born out there. Pitching just felt like the most natural thing in the world. Striking out batters was easy.

While learning the point on the fly last season, he averaged 12.7 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.1 assists and a conference-high 2.0 steals and directed one of the country's most efficient offenses.] There are so many good guards in the conference that if you don't have one like Devin, you'll get buried, ... He's finding out that he's a natural for the point position."
Bo Ryan,"I like to protect my players, but I don't like to make excuses. (But) I think anybody that's seen our guys knows that was way too quick (of) a turnaround. And, in all fairness to them, I just wish they could have had some more time. But, they didn't."
Bo Ryan,I don't know where we'd be without him. That's not conversation. That's a fact. He has that kind of impact on the people around him.
Bo Ryan,"That's what college does for people when given the opportunity, ... We've watched him grow into manhood right in front of our eyes. He has enveloped the knowledge, the experience and is a better person who can give more back than anybody I've ever coached. He has grown in so many ways beyond how he plays the game."
Bo Ryan,"All three played in pretty good (high school) programs, and that always helps coming into a college situation. But being the first practice, it's still too early to get a read on the freshmen. They're attentive, they're hungry, they have good instincts, they've had good coaching and hopefully they'll continue to stay hungry and continue to get good coaching."
Bo Ryan,"Highs, lows, it's all part of being a teacher and a coach, ... I look forward to every season with the same mental approach that I'm responsible for developing young men into being players and making them better."
Jim Ryan,"[He's] very flattered, ... liked my work enough to invite me over."
Jim Ryan,"We are opening these shelters for residents who are apprehensive of their homes flooding or concerned about power outages and are medically dependent on electrical equipment, ... With the sensitivity to the recent flooding in the Gulf coast states, we are taking a very pro-active, cautious approach with this storm."
Jim Ryan,"In some cases, I have heard that the parents replace the computer from a bedroom to an open area like a family room. The children might be less susceptible if they knew that the parents were nearby and could walk by at any time."

Nolan Ryan,"Safety is a big part of preparing my ranch for the busy times ahead, and preventing injuries is a good way to have a truly successful season."
Nolan Ryan,I can't think of anything more humiliating than losing a ballgame to a guy who steals home on you. It happened to me one time against Kansas City. I had a 2-2 count on the hitter - and Amos Otis broke from third. The pitch was a ball and slid in safe. I felt like a nickel.
Nolan Ryan,"The demographics of the state allows for another team. Given the projected growth of the state and the demographics, I think (San Antonio) would support (a team)."

Rex Ryan,"That's what's funny, ... My brother and I had to go back, take a step back into college football because nobody would've taken us. We were just Buddy Ryan's sons. They can't coach; just look at Arizona that last year."
Rex Ryan,"As a coach, I could lie and tell you the standard thing about, 'Oh, we'll let that fly under the rug,' but that's not how we operate. This is a team game. It's about all 11 and not just one."

Shawn Rychcik,We didn't think we were down or in trouble. I liked to see that we got the 3-2 [lead] and still got the next two [runs] after that. That's something we have lacked at times. It's hard enough to get three runs across but to get five is huge.
Shawn Rychcik,We are more spread out in talent this year. I'm not naÃ¯ve to the fact that we're going to have growing pains. We've got to let the talent fly.

Shawn Rychcik,We did a pretty good job. It's just hard to lose no matter what the circumstances.

The problem with Rhode Island is that, you know, it's an hour and 45 minutes [away]. So at least with Harvard we can decide last minute, probably in the morning, whether or not to play, and then probably make it up if we can't."
Shawn Rychcik,It gives you an advantage. The second game we got a little better swings at her and the third game the same. It just helps -- you have an idea of what they are throwing.
